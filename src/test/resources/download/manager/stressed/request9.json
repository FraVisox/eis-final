Kyah Simon had the chance to win the game for Melbourne, with a penalty taken in the 89th minute, but her left-footed shot was saved by Sarah Willacy in the bottom right corner. That’s disappointing for Simon, who fired that wonderful long-range goal for the Matildas last weekend against China. The round ends with the Glory on top (although they have played an extra on their opponents), tied on 12 points with Brisbane. Canberra and Newcastle are tired in third and fourth, on nine points, ahead of Melbourne City (seven points), Sydney FC (six points) and Adelaide, Western Sydney and Melbourne Victory (all tied on four points). That’s all from me today – thankyou to those who followed along, particularly our ever-patient W-League fans who have been waiting for some live blog love. We hope you enjoyed this version of W-League driven Sportwatch. The Mariners are into the top four, and win back-to-back matches for the first time this season. Powell, returning from surgery on both legs, found the breakthrough goal, while De Silva – the man who set him up – takes three votes for best on ground. Speaking to TV after, he says the game was very tough, played in very hot conditions, and he’s simply happy to have played his role for the team. Doesn’t disagree that he’s in career-best form – paying tribute to being able to play alongside quality teammates, with favourable formations and style of play. Thinks things are coming to fruition on the Central Coast, but the hard work doesn’t stop here. A-League 92:40 Central Coast Mariners 1-0 Perth Glory Standing ovation for Danny De Silva as he leaves the field, subbed off for Buhagiar. As I’ve been blogging the W-League, I haven’t seen the whole of this game, but he’s apparently been seriously impressive. Doesn’t surprise me from what I’ve seen in just the few minutes I’ve caught – he and Powell set up a goal I’d be happy to watch many times over. Won’t Perth take this one particularly harshly if their former player costs them the game. A-League 86:00 Central Coast Mariners 1-0 Perth Glory Powell really impressing in the last few minutes, and he sets up Hoole very nicely in the box, who holds onto possession too long and takes a shot leaning backwards on the ball – it’s well over the bar. Should really have been more selfless with possession. Here comes Yagoub Mustafa for the Glory in his A-League debut. A-League 83:30 Central Coast Mariners 1-0 Perth Glory Yes I know, Ellie, I was about to check in on the other W-League game, also. That should finish at the same time as this A-League clash, so I’ll be able to bring you the results at once. Just saw another replay of the goal - Powell perfected the pass to De Silva, and did brilliantly to follow it up. Smart thinking from De Silva, too, who is having some season. Wilson comes off for Brimmer as Perth try and fire up for the last ten minutes or so. 79:00 Finally, a breakthrough in the A-League, with a brilliant pass from Blake Powell setting up De Silva on the wing, who tapped one back in to Powell, who fired the finish into the underside of the cross-bar, the bounce kind. This is set up for a photo finish. Well done Brisbane Three wins for the Roar as a club this weekend. Well done to the Roar on an excellent victory, that takes them up to level at the top of the table with Perth Glory. They were the dominant side and deserved the win, owning possession with a fluency United rarely showed. My best on was Hayley Raso – while she may have faded in the last 15 minutes or so, her work by then was done. She was simply brilliant for her side, setting up chance after chance with selfless assists and stunning speed. Tameka Butt likewise impressed, with a skillful first touch off the wonderful pass from Gorry helping her find the breakthrough, and, ultimately, the decider. They were my 1,2,3 for the Roar. For Canberra, I couldn’t have been more impressed with Ellie Carpenter’s game. She did what she could with minimal opportunity, and her footwork is to be seen to be believed. She combined really nicely with international Elise Thorsnes, who looks a great find for United. I have no doubt they’ll be right up there in contention at the end of the season, particular once Michelle Heyman finds some more consistent form. W-League 95:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Probably another couple of minutes to go here after Butt’s treatment time is taken into account, but unfortunately for Canberra it’s all Brisbane, with Gorry effectively taking another 30 seconds or so off the clock. She’s impressed, running and presenting all day. Gielnik tries to own possession, but it’s over the sideline. One last chance for Canberra. W-League 92:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Just the four minutes of extra time - my sense is not enough for United. Gorry takes the corner kick for Roar, it’s flat and low, bouncing with surprise value. Not sure that was how she meant to strike it. Canberra try desperately to gain ground on the turnover, but there’s bodies tumbling everywhere. Here they come again - but we’ll stop play as Butt looks to have sustained a calf injury. Let’s hope not for her sake, and for the Matildas! Let’s hope it’s cramp. W-League 89:30 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Not a bad effort by Bassett, who found Arnold unawares. She looked to palm the shot, but it’s ruled a goal-kick. On replay, it looks as if Arnold did indeed allow the wide shot to fly past. Doesn’t take much for Canberra to pose a threat, but it’s not quite happening for them today. Lovely sliding tackle by Pressley to stop Raso in her tracks, who was out in plenty of space with speed. W-League 88:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Ouch, Raso is writhing around on the ground after she looked to take a foot in the stomach or ribs. Players falling over everywhere as exhaustion kicks in. Canberra pressing hard and late to try and find the equaliser, and Heyman and Carpenter are the two who look most likely. Cheung is subbed off after not her best performance, with Toby making her way on for just the few remaining minutes plus extra time. W-League 84:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Another corner won for Brisbane, who continue to pile on the pressure. It’s a high ball in, but Cheung can’t turn the header into anything threatening. Down the other end Heyman finds Carpenter with the perfect cross, and Carpenter flies to meet the volley, but it’s mis-timed after she sprinted to make the ball in the first place. Heyman owed Carpenter one, and she delivered. W-League 81:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Butt with plenty of space yet again, she finds Gorry out wide to a trio of orange, but no joy for the second. Torpey looks to have cramped - she’s been relatively impressive today - but can’t be subbed off with no substitutions remaining for the Roar. Canberra, meanwhile, take an impromptu time-out, with head coach Garriock no doubt telling her troops they’re still in the game. W-League 78:00 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Gorry connects with Hunt after trying to chip over her and looks sore, flying into the turf. She looks set to come off. Wai Ki Cheung lacks accuracy with a shot on goal, the ball floating well wide. Hasn’t been her best, and she’s yet to score in the A-League. Should really have scored the early shot in front of an open net – while Heyman should also have one to her name. Butt likes the look of her 50th from long range, but there’s not enough power in the shot to trouble the keeper. W-League 75:27 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar I forgot to add earlier that Clare Hunt has repalced Ash Sykes, who looked very sore. Whittall is also about to maker her entrance, this time for Flannery who looks exhausted. She’s been full of running in both attack and defence. W-League 73:50 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Canberra unable to find any rhythm forward in a dominant display from the Roar. Sykes injured really hasn’t helped. But, as if on cue, Ellie Carpenter almost does it all herself, winning the ball in the midfield, coming in deep after the pass from Thorsnes, beating O’Brien with the first touch and then setting up Heyman on a platter. Heyman can’t find touch, and Carpenter is dismayed, hands thrown on her head. She’s something special, Carpenter. W-League 71:10 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Gorry takes the corner, and it’s a one-two with Butt. Gorry winds up but can’t clear the defender, but finds herself in all sorts of space to set up Gielnik on the opposite wing. Canberra clear and find the quick repel, but it’s a turnover and Brisbane come again. Roar on top, and pushing. W-League 65:36 Canberra United 0-1 Brisbane Roar Finally! The Roar find the breakthrough through Tameka Butt, a deserved goal for Brisbane who have been well on top all day. It was a wonderful lofted pass by Gorry, from so far out, Butt with the lovely first touch and then the finish to the right of Kopmeyer. That’s Butt’s 49th goal in the W-League. W-League 65:36 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Don’t forget there’s only 14 rounds of W-League, so we’re actually almost at the half-way mark. Hard to believe, it feels like it just started. If you’re just coming to it make sure you check out Ann Odong’s preview of this season’s action. Perth Glory are sitting pretty on top at the moment, although they have played the extra fixture, comparative to these two sides. W-League 63:20 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Sykes is back on the field but it looks as if she’s had a moon boot strapped to her foot. Not sure how she can play with such heavy taping, but she’s tough. Nice field position from Canberra after a stirring run from Thorsnes. Bassett lines up for the corner as the locals look to take the lead. It’s a beauty, but fisted away by Arnold. W-League 61:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Cheung finds Butt, and Gorry finds Gielnik for the cross in. Expect plenty of dangerous crosses from Gielnik, who has already forced a corner for her side. Cheung finds Raso outside the box, but her strike is wide, floating past the right post. W-League 59:30 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Raso beaten, for one of the only times today, this time to Thorsnes. It sets up Sykes for a possible cross, but she’s trodden on by Torpey. Carnage all round, as we’ll surely get a breather and a sub. Sykes takes to the sideline for some treatment, while it’s Abbey Lloyd who makes way for Gielnik. It’s a dangerous ball-in from the free-kick, but Pressley is too late to get to the back post. W-League 56:15 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Canberra weren’t far off from scoring there, with a Michelle Heyman header finding Ash Sykes who fired one off and missed narrowly to the left. That would have been something of an injustice after how much the Roar have dominated play. Here’s another change coming, this time for the Roar, with Gielnik warming up. Might be Wai Ki Cheung to make way. W-League 53:15 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Wai Ki finds you know who in Raso who spots Lloyd on the opposite wing, she then finds Butt who runs the ball into the box and fires it back to Boureille. It’s a drawn out build up, and ends with a Torpey cross and a nice header which is cleared for a corner. Gorry to take it. It’s a low, powerful one, but Wai Ki Cheung can’t fire it into the net. W-League 50:30 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Brilliant ball to Raso who then finds Butt on the corner of the box. She sets up a long-range shot for Boureille, who fires off a stunning one-touch bomb. It’s a wonderful save from Kopmeyer, who dives hard and fast to her right, to palm the dipping ball. W-League 48:50 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Nice ball back to the keeper by Gorry, who doesn’t reward her faith with a dodgy clearance. Still, Canberra aren’t able to make the most of the turnover. Carpenter, with the defensive intercept, is the other who has really impressed me today, and is also seemingly a crowd favourite. W-League 46:45 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Just the one sub with Grace Maher off and Amy Sayer on, Sykes into the midfield. Sayer just 16 so one of the emerging stars of the W-League. Think Maher is unlucky to be subbed off, but Canberra needed to mix something up. Speaking of Raso, she’s right back into the action, setting one up at the feet of Polkinghorne, but she can’t quite make the most of it. Wai Ki then finds Raso again, who can’t get one past the defence. Not sure how else to describe Raso’s game other than total dominance – and she’s into the action again with a pass to Wai Ki who is unfortunately off-side. Women’s rugby league For those women’s sport fans who may be following along (yes I know, I’m making assumptions about the audience)... did you catch Larissa O’Connor’s great piece on the momentum behind a national women’s rugby league competition earlier this week? It was written in the lead-up to the Jillaroos’ triumph over the Kiwi Ferns on the weekend. Enjoy! W-League coverage For those mentioning it, I’m also disappointed by the lack of W-League coverage this week. Nothing on SBS (free-to-air) and only live-streaming of this game on Fox online. A-League on Fox League on TV. That means there’s absolutely no coverage of the City v Adelaide United W-League clash, which is currently 1-0 in Melbourne’s favour after a header to Ashley Hatch. Glad to hear you’re enjoying the W-League-led blog today – unfortunately we are also dictated by what’s televised, when the game is played, when I need to have my dinner, etc. Haha. But trust me I’m doing my best to do it as often as possible :) It’s officially over in the first A-League clash of the day, with Victory downing the Phoenix 3-2. Victory fought back from a two-goal deficit in an entertaining, if sometimes shambolic, A-League clash in Wellington. Eighth on the ladder going into Sunday’s match, the Victory trailed 0-2 at half-time after two Andrija Kaludjerovic headers but battled back in a gritty second-half performance to seal their second win of the season. Besart Berisha’s 54th-minute tap-in and an own goal three minutes later off Goran Paracki set up a tense final half-hour which was broken by James Troisi’s 86th minute winner. The win shunts Melbourne up the table to sit equal with fifth-placed Perth on 10 points. Berisha looked to have scored the opening goal after a Kosta Barbarouses through-ball, but the video assistant referee ruled offside to disallow the goal. With thanks to AAP W-League half-time Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Just the one minute of added time, which sees Gorry intercept a loose Pressley pass. This time it’s “how hard is it?” from the vocal Canberra crowd. Here comes the speedy Carpenter, who in turn finds Heyman. Not sure that she saw Flannery flying down the left wing – she certainly took too long to release if so. No score in the first-half, after a largely dominant display by the Roar. W-League 44:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Oops, Pressley tries some fancy footwork in the defensive third and is forced to clear her own mistake to allow the Roar another run at it. Polkinghorne’s through ball finds Torpey, and Raso’s threatening ball in is poorly cleared. Gorry comes again with a cross that almost finds Wai Ki, but it’s not to be. Frenetic pace to end the first half. W-League 42:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Polkinghorne taking the attacking free-kick, as she usually does (same goes for corners). Gorry and Pickett stand by, and Gorry fools us all by taking the kick. The rebound is dangerous with Ash Sykes beating Raso for pace, and Raso mis-timing the slide tackle to earn herself a yellow. Reckon Roar would have been in trouble if she hadn’t have stopped Sykes in her tracks. The long free-kick from Pressley is repelled with little threat. The crowd are at it again, this time demanding Canberra ‘keep possession’! Easier said than done though, really, isn’t it. Meanwhile Carpenter is off on another impressive run after intercepting Gorry. Loved her game, too. Small flashes of brilliance. W-League 38:50 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Gorry wide to Raso, whose cross just clears Butt and Wai Ki. Have to agree with the commentary team who argue that Thorsnes marking Raso hasn’t necessary been a successful move. Raso running rings around her, currently (that said, I’m not sure who could contain her in the form she is in today). W-League 37:30 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Lovely one, two for Gorry with Butt, but the shot is too long and high. The Roar came in seventh last season, which is hard to believe given their form to date, and today (not to mention that they boast the five Matildas). Wai Ki is offside again, and looks frustrated with her performance today. W-League 35:40 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Butt won’t be deterred, and finds a clear strike in little to no space. Her fired shot is mopped up by Kopmeyer, but it was an impressive feat to get one off in the first place. This time Raso just overcooks the pass to Torpey, but she’s impressed mightily so far, back in the W-League after her time with Portland Thorns. Meanwhile Carpenter beats three, maybe four defenders in a seriously skilled run, but is finally repelled. W-League 32:20 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar “Get the ball Canberra, God!” comes the cry from the crowd. Then “pick her up!” I identify with such frustration, fans. Not with this particular game, per se, but I’m sure I’ve repeated those lines a few times myself. Few sloppy turnovers from both sides here, with Bassett taking down Butt in a clumsy challenge. She claims this is the second time she’s been felled unfairly. That’s another solid challenge from Canberra. Bassett gets a lengthy telling off from the referee. W-League 29:50 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Looks like Thorsnes is marking Raso, she’s not as fast but a tactical reader of play. Good move, I think, as Raso is by far the most threatening player on the field so far. This time she wins herself a corner from nothing, Kopmeyer forced to come out and block her third bite of the ball. The cross is a dangerous one, but it’s cleared well by Thorsnes. W-League 28:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Nice build-up by Brisbane, with Torpey ending up with the cross/shot. Some conversation about whether Raso should be shifted to the left, given how dangerous she’s already proved. This time she’s hip-and-shouldered by Thorsnes for a Brisbane free-kick (deliberate use of Australian Rules terminology there as it didn’t seem a football challenge). Gorry’s lofted kick is too high, and over her teammates’ heads. W-League 25:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Wow, this time it’s Raso who misses the open goal, she ran perfectly behind the defence, and Kopmeyer was off her line, but she could only find the left side of the net. Polkinghorne and Flannery collide going for the header, and the result is a Carpeneter free for United. ‘Canberra United’ chant goes up around the ground, but it’s too long and cut off easily by Arnold. W-League 23:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Canberra need answers for the speed of Raso – who is continually poking holes through the defence, with some excellent assist play. Reckon she’s almost been too unselfish, but Wai Ki had no reason not to score with the last ball. Tameka Butt looks sore, let’s hope nothing’s amiss as she’s been on fire for the Matildas. Here comes Heyman, who is clearly the crowd favourite, she finds Carpenter with a lovely cross, and Carpenter is upended as the crowd cries foul. No luck on the call. W-League 19:45 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Raso making it happen again, with the perfect assist to Hong Kong international to Cheung Wai Ki who for some inexplicable reason fires it straight to Kopmeyer – as on the commentary, it would’ve been harder for her to hit the keeper than not, then. Wonderful lead-up play from Raso. W-League 18:12 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar All of Raso, Gorry and Lloyd fire strikes at Kopmeyer, but they can’t evade the wall. Meanwhile, Polkinghorne finds Tameka Butt with a beautiful lofted through pass, but she can’t score. Very nice lead-up play by Brisbane. W-League 16:00 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Forgive me if I mistake the goalkeepers today, both Kopmeyer (Canberra) and Arnold (Brisbane) have played for the opposing side! Both sides trading turnovers at the moment, but Raso and Thorsnes respectively are making the running in the middle. Fine turn from Heyman opens up the Roar defence, but Carpenter can’t do the same, and the ball is turned over. W-League 13:20 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Canberra’s forwards are pushing up well, and putting plenty of pressure on the Roar clearances. Heyman lurking particularly dangerously. This time it’s the Roar who intercept a sloppy United clearance, and Raso’s excellent run is set up for Tameka Butt, who lofts one over the cross-bar. She’s been easily my pick of play so far, Raso. W-League 11:37 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar O’Brien with a very, very loose pass which is intercepted by Grace Maher, who is positioned high and picks up the easy intercept. She finds Bassett, who loops it to Thorsnes, but there’s nothing doing with some desperate and effective Roar defense. Another United cross hits Thorsnes on the chest, she strikes neatly, but it’s into the gloves of a fumbly Arnold. W-League 09:30 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Bolting run from Thorsnes who finds Flannery, but the Roar defence are solid, and the clearance is a long one. Liking the look of Thorsnes, who is plying her trade in Australia. Few cheap turnovers to date, but the Roar look dangerous in attack – although they’re pulled up for off-side on this particular run. Lots of discussion re: Sam Kerr’s Asian player of the year award, which she followed up with a goal for Perth Glory fresh off the plane on Friday night. Not much that woman can’t do. W-League 06:05 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Speaking of Raso she finds a neat ball through, before she hits the deck after colliding with the United defence, but can’t convince the referee that she deserves a free-kick. She’s off like a pocket rocket today, Raso. Heyman, meanwhile beats Pickett for a nice cross in, which sadly for the locals, comes to nothing. W-League 04:20 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Very suburban feel to this whole coverage, with a single camera on duty, it seems. Great vibe from the crowd though, with some very loud supporters cheering on Michelle Heyman’s first run forward. She’s looking ominous, as is Raso for the Roar. W-League 02:40 Canberra United 0-0 Brisbane Roar Would you believe it, an ‘unexpected error’ has occurred with the Canberra United v Brisbane Roar footage. I could have predicted this. Give me a moment. Oh no we’re back on! Carpenter and Gorriy going head-to-head in the midfield, with Gorry taking the honours in their first mini-duel. Matildas Roar The formidable Hayley Raso is just one of five returning Matildas suiting up for the Roar today, she impressed me against China! W-League kick-off Is not far off, very strange experience waiting on the live stream to begin, presumably right on the cusp of play! In the meantime, here are some nice warm-up visuals. (No further score in the A-League, bound to be a win to the Victory, it seems. Impressive after they went 2-0 down with a demoralising VAR overrule!) A-League 85:40 Wellington Phoenix 2-3 Melbourne Victory Would you believe it? Troisi scores after an excellent through ball from Berisha, just outside the box. Italiano comes up to meet him but he can’t stop it – that’s surely the winner. A-League 85:00 Wellington Phoenix 2-2 Melbourne Victory Fascinating contest here to date, with Melbourne Victory seemingly taking the early lead with a Besart Berisha goal being overturned by the VAR. On the television replay it looked a tight and perhaps even incorrect call, but we won’t question the VAR, will we? Phoenix than capitalised on a purple patch, scoring twice in two minutes through the same man in Kaluderovic. Both were brilliant headers – the first a powerful one landing just under the cross bar, the other a tactical looper over Thomas’ head. It all looked over for Victory at a demoralising 2-0, but they hit back through Berisha in the 54th minute after Italiano palmed Barbarouses’ shot into his path, for a rebound into the empty net. Victory then forced an own goal after a Berisha header just minutes later to incredibly level the game. I’ve got this one on the TV as I wait for the live stream to fire up, and Victory had a gilt-edged chance to take the victory through the man of the hour, Berisha, who missed everything with an open net in front of him (the ball put on a platter by Troisi). That would certainly, surely have been the game. Minutes later Phoenix have their own chance through Vidsoic after the cut back from Doyle, but the strike flies over the bar. This is set up for a thrilling finish! Lisa De Vanna Been following the W-League action this weekend? If so I hope you caught Lisa De Vanna’s brilliant goal for Sydney FC against Melbourne Victory at Cromer Park yesterday...! The Sky Blues went on win 2-0, after Princess Ibini scored the first with a strike from the centre of the box into the bottom right corner. She was assisted by another Matilda in Chloe Logarzo. Starting XIs Here are your teams for today: Welcome Hello everyone and welcome to this experimental version of Sportwatch. By experimental I mean – my feature game is the Canberra United v Brisbane Roar W-League clash, which is not televised but rather live streamed through Fox Sports, so pray with me that it works. (Worst case scenario we will do some creative re-jigging, OK). So, provided all is well... this match pits second (Canberra United) against third (Brisbane Roar). Both teams are level on points, having lost one match and won three each, but Roar are behind on goal difference, while Canberra will be looking for their fourth-straight victory this W-League season. The Roar come into this round fresh after a week off (a bye weekend for the Matildas clash against China, which we also blogged). Heather Garriock (United head coach) will be buoyed by the return of her two star Matildas in Michelle Heyman (looking to force her way back into the national side after an injury lay-off) and Ellie Carpenter. Heyman will join fellow strikers Ashleigh Skyes and Elise Thorsnes (of Norway) who debuted last week in a formidable attacking outfit. This should be a great one. I will also keep you updated on A-League action, which is happening simultaneously, including the early game between Wellington and Melbourne Victory. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of how the FFA governance crisis may affect Australia’s bid to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/05/gene-sherman-fashion-misunderstood-shopping","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T00:36:11Z","webTitle":"Gene Sherman: 'Fashion is misunderstood, a lot of people still think of it as shopping'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/05/gene-sherman-fashion-misunderstood-shopping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/05/gene-sherman-fashion-misunderstood-shopping","fields":{"headline":"Gene Sherman: 'Fashion is misunderstood, a lot of people still think of it as shopping'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gene Sherman doesn’t shop for clothes in the way most people shop for clothes. Sure, she’ll pick up a T-shirt every now and then, but when she wants something substantial, it has to meet certain criteria. It should be black, avant garde and created by a particular Japanese designer. And it must be interesting enough to replace one of the 35 outfits already in her wardrobe because for every new piece she acquires, one is “retired”. For Sherman, fashion is not about glamour – it’s about ideas, and it’s an art form she takes very seriously. “I think fashion is a bit misunderstood, a lot of people still think of fashion as shopping and I never thought of it as shopping.” When we meet, she is dressed in her customary black, a sculptural jacket paired with a long sweeping skirt decked with a Yohji Yamamoto belt covered in silver hardware. She wears an oversized silver ring and her tiny penny-shaped eyeglasses are perched on her nose. Her wardrobe – or, as she describes it, her collection – is dominated by designs by Issey Miyake, Comme des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto, with a few acquisitions from Australian designers Alistair Trung and Akira Isogawa. It’s the intellectual side of Japanese fashion design that has always appealed to her. “I loved the way [Japanese fashion design] was conceptualised, it was explained, it had thinking behind it,” she says. “It had an intelligence that the sewing on of beads, much as I think that’s brilliant [and] it’s not that I don’t appreciate the craftsmanship – but it’s not enough for me.” Over the years, her fashion collection has become significant enough that, in 2009, she donated 60 garments to the Powerhouse museum for exhibition. No Vinnies drop off for this fashion collector. Art and ideas have been central to all aspects of Sherman’s life. An academic with a doctorate in French literature, she was the driving force behind the commercial Sherman Galleries in Sydney throughout its 21-year lifespan, and then the not-for-profit Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation (Scaf). Both were highly respected galleries with exhibitions by contemporary artists including Ai Weiwei, Shaun Gladwell, Fiona Tan and Brook Andrew, but Sherman admits they cost a small fortune to run, particularly Scaf. “It was expensive even when I did the first budget but over time costs went up. Also I grew more ambitious, everything I do seems to grow.” So after 10 years, she was content to close Scaf earlier this year. But she was not interested in putting her feet up. Although she recently turned 70, she needed a new challenge. “I’m still very energetic, but I had a number of goals – to spend less money, have more time, not have so many deadlines [and] do something that no one else has done.” This month she launched the Sherman Centre for Culture and Ideas (Scci –pronounced sky). A crowd of arts journalists gathered in Scaf’s former home in the Sydney suburb of Paddington for the launch. In her opening speech, Sherman described Scci as a place for “the exchange of ideas”. Over the next five years, the centre will host two ideas festivals – or “hubs” as Sherman calls them – each year: one in April focused on fashion; the other in October focused on architecture. The two-week festivals will have a densely packed program of talks, workshops and demonstrations tackling the ideas behind these artforms, although there will be no exhibitions. “The link between all these categories is an expanded notion of art – art as culture, not art as pictures on the wall”, Sherman says. With only four permanent staff, Scci will be a small cultural player but its ambitions are large. It will partner with the Museum of Arts and Applied Science, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the University of Technology Sydney on some programs. “With these big institutions, we want to exchange ideas, share connections. We want to build bigger, richer denser programs, separately we can do it, but together we can do it better,” Sherman says. The fashion festival will be headlined by international speakers including the Paris Grand Palais exhibition director Emmanuel Coquery, Japanese designer Akira Minagawa and Vogue India editor-at-large Bandana Tewari. There will be discussion on fashion writing, ethical fashion, the art of fashion, the business of fashion and the future of fashion. Journalist Clare Press will lead the discussion on the ethics of fashion and says she is excited to see Scci tackling the ideas behind the fashion industry: “Ideas can so often be lost or sidelined when commerce takes over, and of course the modern fashion world is powered by commerce. As the velvet rope has been lifted and fashion has become more popular, we’ve seen an explosion of festivals, pop-ups and exhibitions in the fashion space, but how many of them are, at their core, about ideas? I can’t think of any.” Fashion is close to Sherman’s heart but she is just as interested in architecture. Scaf ran a series of exhibitions called Fugitive Structures focused on emerging architects, and Sherman was surprised by their popularity. “I realised that I had a whole untapped audience there of architecture students, design students, industrial design students, that no one was catering for.” Details of the lineup for the architectural program are still to be announced. She uses the example of highly regarded embroiderer, Mary Brown in Sydney who has expressed her admiration for the work of designer Paul Vasileff in Adelaide She hopes Scci will become a place where artists connect. She uses the example of highly regarded embroiderer Mary Brown in Sydney who has expressed her admiration for the work of designer Paul Vasileff in Adelaide, but the two have never met. “They need to meet, these two people,” she exclaims. “They know of each other but who is going to bring them together?” The answer is probably Gene Sherman. The inaugural fashion festival at the Sherman Centre for Culture and Ideas will take place in April and the architecture festival in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/02/chittagong-shipbreaking-yards-legal-fight","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T21:00:22Z","webTitle":"‘This is the world’s cheapest place to scrap ships’ – but in Chittagong, it’s people who pay the price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/02/chittagong-shipbreaking-yards-legal-fight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/02/chittagong-shipbreaking-yards-legal-fight","fields":{"headline":"‘This is the world’s cheapest place to scrap ships’ – but in Chittagong, it’s people who pay the price","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mohamed Edris’s life as he knew it in the Bangladeshi ship recycling yards ended at 11.30am on Saturday 11 April 2015. The 38-year-old metal cutter had been working with 100 others on the 19,600-tonne container ship Eurus London at the Ferdous Steel Corporation shipyard in Chittagong when catastrophe struck. His task had been to cut away the huge 40-tonne propeller with a blow torch. Alarm bells rang, he said, when he saw that a large metal platform had been placed below the propeller to stop it falling into the mud on the beach. “I told the supervisor and two others that it was dangerous because it could bounce back when the propeller fell. I told them I could not do it, but they insisted that I did,” he said. He obeyed and nearly died. The propeller broke free, hit the metal plate and sprung back as he predicted. It sliced off his left leg below the knee, blinded him in one eye and nearly broke his back. The yard paid for his hospital treatment, gave him 125,000 Bangladeshi taka (£1,142) compensation and 460 Bdt (£4.32) a week for nine months. Now he, and the seven family members he supported, rely on handouts from friends. But in a legal test case Zodiac Maritime, the London-based shipping company that managed the Eurus London until it was sold for scrap, could be held responsible. In a case that could see British, American and European shipowners and managers being made liable for the many deaths and accidents that take place every year in Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani shipbreaking yards, UK law firm Leigh Day is suing Zodiac for negligence on behalf of Edris. It claims that Zodiac, which manages about 150 large ships and is owned by Eyal Ofer, son of the late Israeli shipping magnate Sammy Ofer, should have known how dangerous the Chittagong breaking yards were when the vessel was sold for scrap to GMS, a US-based “cash buyer” or middle man. “Zodiac knew, or ought to have known, that there was a foreseeable risk of physical harm to workers when they allowed their vessel to be sold to a Chittagong yard through a cash buyer,” says Martyn Day, a director of Leigh Day. New legal action is needed, say environmentalists and unions, because of the steady number of deaths and injuries to workers. On one level, shipbreaking is one of the world’s “greenest” industries, with every nut, bolt and sheet of metal on a ship being recycled. It also employs hundreds of thousands of people in some of the world’s poorest countries. But, say critics, owners knowingly cause suffering to workers by sending their ships to be recycled on Asian beaches. British-based companies have sent 28 ships to be beached in the past two years, including six to Chittagong. Two vessels waiting to be dismantled in that yard last week were managed by Zodiac. “Shipowners shield themselves from responsibility through the use of cash buyers. These scrap dealers sell off the ships for the highest price offered,” says Ingvild Jenssen, director of Shipbreaking Platform, a Brussels-based coalition of environmental, human rights and labour groups. “All ships that end up on the beaches of Bangladesh, Pakistan or India pass through cash buyers, and all sales to cash buyers are clearly scrap deals where the higher price paid indicates that the vessel will be beached.” More than 800 large ships are broken up each year, the vast majority on Asian beaches. Owners can earn an extra $1m to $4m (£740,000 to £2.96m) per ship when selling to Asian yards via cash buyers, instead of opting for recycling yards with higher standards, says Jenssen. “No one forces the industry to send ships to be dismantled there. They choose to send them,” she says. Edris, who came to Chittagong aged 14 and who, until his accident, worked six 14-hour shifts a week, earning £3.20 a day, is one of thousands of workers who have been injured in the yards since they appeared in the 1960s. There are no official statistics but labour groups say that in the past 10 years there have been more than 125 deaths. Chittagong is now the world’s largest shipbreaking centre, last year recycling 230 ships and generating 10m tonnes of steel – up to 60% of all the steel used in Bangladesh. Most of the workers migrate from rural areas. Hired out in gangs, they live in overcrowded shacks close to the yards. The Ferdous yard is like many others. Hidden behind high metal gates, it slopes down to the Bay of Bengal. It can take months for young men, wielding only sledgehammers and metal cutters, to dismantle a large vessel. “Chittagong is the cheapest place to scrap ships but the price is suffering. Nine men have died here this year. Nobody feels responsible for these men’s lives,” says Muhammed Ali Shahin, Bangladesh coordinator of Shipbreaking Platform. The law offers little protection, he says. “EU laws stop EU-flagged ships being broken up on Asian beaches, but because owners can easily ‘reflag’ ships it has little strength.” Pressed by labour groups, the UN’s International Maritime Organisation passed the Hong Kong Convention (HKC) in 2009. This demands that ship owners and states do not pose a risk to human health, safety and the environment. But, says Shipbreaking Platform, it does not stop the beaching of vessels, which is blamed for most accidents, and it is unlikely to come into force for years because it requires 15 states, and 40% of world merchant shipping, to have signed up. “The industry is moving to adopt Hong Kong standards,” says Nikos Mikelis, a non-executive director of GMS. “There is a good likelihood of the convention entering into force within the next five to seven years. Ratifying and reaching the HKC targets will not be too difficult.” He argues that groups such as Shipbreaking Platform are naive and, by demanding the end of beaching, are endangering the livelihoods of workers in some of the world’s poorest countries. He does see progress. “Japan and India are investing $100m in upgrades. Forty-one yards out of 120 in Alang, India, now meet HKC standards and 15 others are moving towards safer and cleaner work. But in Bangladesh only one yard [PHP Shipbreaking] meets international standards.” Mikelis says the major shipping companies such as Maersk now have arrangements with individual yards. “The industry wants improvement but it needs to invest to improve,” he says. In the case of Zodiac, Martyn Day argues that the company knew the methods involved in dismantling vessels in Chittagong, yet it sold the Eurus London on in the full knowledge that it would be broken up in unsafe conditions. “They had a duty not to sell vessels to Bangladesh shipyards via their contractors or cash buyers,” he says. “Zodiac sold it to a cash buyer in the knowledge it would be dismantled in unsafe conditions.” In a statement to the Observer, Zodiac said the accident occurred four months after the ship had been sold to a third-party buyer. As a result, it said: “We deny any liability for the injuries suffered by Mr Edris and we dispute the claim.” It added: “The yard where Mr Edris was employed was not Zodiac’s contractor and Zodiac did not select the yard used to dismantle the vessel. Zodiac has no control over the working practices at shipbreaking yards. The claim seeks to extend the law of negligence beyond any recognised boundaries. It is the law of Bangladesh which applies to this case.” The impact of an injury on workers’ families is immense. “Edris provided for seven people,” said one man who knows him. “He has no savings. He is angry. He is now wholly reliant on the generosity of friends and family. His children have become scared of him because he cries a lot and screams in pain.” Edris said: “I feel like a dead man. I have no hope. I will never be able to go back to work. I have steel plates in my body and I can only walk on sticks, I am in constant pain. I want to open a shop, but that needs 500,000 Bdt. “I have seen many men killed and injured. It is very dangerous work. I tell people not to work there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/nomad-stores-the-ambulance-chasers-of-gentrification","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nomad stores: the latest sign of gentrification","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/nomad-stores-the-ambulance-chasers-of-gentrification","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/nomad-stores-the-ambulance-chasers-of-gentrification","fields":{"headline":"Nomad stores: the latest sign of gentrification","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Eleven years ago, east London restaurant Bistrotheque – an early frontrunner of the bare bulb/subway-tile aesthetic – opened The Reindeer in a large car park in an east London brewery. Billed as the city’s first pop-up restaurant, such was the hype that it fed more than 20,000 people in three weeks. The financial crisis of 2008 consolidated the pop-up method as the easiest route to starting a new business during the following decade. For landlords, it was the best way to let unused space – and for retailers to take a punt without the costs of a long-term lease. But what seemed like a hip new way to shift, say, juice, was actually proof of the volatility of the high street. With that in mind, what should we make of the latest retail neologism – the nomad store – shops that open up in any given location when the time suits? Coined by hip London boutique Browns, its first nomad “project” opened in east London this autumn. Inside it looks cool and warehouse-y. There are concertina doors, lots of mirrors, artwork by Polly Morgan and fresh brownies. Browns describes it as “semi-permanent” yet “roaming” (a pop-up will eventually end) and a “21st-century response to the pop-up model”, which means no one knows when it will open, when it will close and what it will be. There is no formula. The shop can be dismantled in a few hours with no prior warning (although there is no plan to do so because it’s doing quite well). The other point of the nomad store is that it is designed to reflect its location – here, the focus is on being “gender-fused”, a clunky phrase that essentially means you can have Balenciaga on a rail next to Raf Simons. It’s a sort of ambulance-chaser of gentrification. When east London falls short, the “nomad project” will move on to the next place. Eddie Blake, senior architect at Sam Jacob Studio (who lives nearby), thinks the term is a misnomer. He says it’s “the force of capital that makes this stuff nomadic – not a romantic attachment to roaming”. Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford, is more sympathetic, saying they “feed into the wider trend for variety and variability ... [creating] a sense of urgency that, when coupled with a consumer’s desire to be different, works”. What’s more, the unpredictability of nomad shops suggests we are “increasingly comfortable with a gig economy and the lack of permanence”, so their success is our fault. Nomad shops like this feel more interesting than pop-ups. And with an estimated 8,000 stores closing this year, shops need to change. Becoming a nomad is simply one way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/01/boy-found-dead-in-birmingham-is-named-as-hakeem-hussain","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T18:40:51Z","webTitle":"Boy found dead in Birmingham is named as Hakeem Hussain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/boy-found-dead-in-birmingham-is-named-as-hakeem-hussain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/boy-found-dead-in-birmingham-is-named-as-hakeem-hussain","fields":{"headline":"Boy found dead in Birmingham is named as Hakeem Hussain","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A seven-year old boy found dead at a house in Birmingham has been named, as investigations into the cause of his death continue. Hakeem Hussain was discovered by paramedics at the property in Nechells on Sunday 26 November at about 7.30am, police said. A man, 56, and a woman, 35, were arrested on suspicion of wilfully ill-treating a child and have been released under investigation. Reports that Hussain had suffered hypothermia and frozen to death could not be confirmed. Temperatures in Birmingham hit a low of 2C on Sunday morning. Birmingham city council said Hakeem was known to the authority and that the multi-agency Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board was deciding whether to launch a review of his case. A postmortem on Friday into the cause of death proved inconclusive and further tests are to be carried out on the boy, also known as Hakeem Mahmud. DI Jim Munro, from the Public Protection Unit, said: “This is a tragic case and has understandably had a huge impact on the community. “We are keen to hear from anyone who knew Hakeem as we continue to build up a picture of the circumstances surrounding his death.” West Midlands ambulance service had responded to reports of a cardiac arrest. “Two ambulances and a paramedic officer attended the scene and arrived to find a boy in cardiac arrest. Sadly, nothing could be done to save the child and he was confirmed dead on scene,” said a spokesperson. The headteacher of Hakeem’s school, Nechells E-Act academy, paid tribute to the year 3 pupil on behalf of children and staff. “Hakeem was a most beautiful little boy, a great friend to many staff and children with a wicked sense of humour and an infectious giggle,” said Julie Wright, who is organising a whole academy assembly to celebrate his gifts and talents. “He was a warm and generous-hearted soul who was talented across many areas of the curriculum, but especially so in music and the arts. Hakeem will be sorely missed by us all.” A spokesperson for E-Act, which runs a chain of academy schools throughout the country, said: “We were deeply saddened by the death of one of our pupils, which happened out of school. “We are providing support for our pupils through grief and bereavement counsellors who specialise in working with young children. “As the incident is now being investigated by the police, we are not able to provide any detail at this point.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/03/rose-wylie-quack-quack-review-serpentine-sackler-gallery","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"Rose Wylie: Quack Quack review – crude, joyous spontaneity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/03/rose-wylie-quack-quack-review-serpentine-sackler-gallery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/03/rose-wylie-quack-quack-review-serpentine-sackler-gallery","fields":{"headline":"Rose Wylie: Quack Quack review – crude, joyous spontaneity","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Grand, ungainly and defiantly young – this is the art of Rose Wylie. It is a strange and anomalous combination, especially since she is now 83. Looking at her enormous canvases, which might show a park bench, a film star surrounded by flying ears or a biscuit on its way into someone’s open mouth, you reel at the sheer directness of the painting, presented with all the primitive force of a child’s drawing. Her works are crude and joyous, and as awkward as she wants them to be. They are also catnip for collectors, critics and students alike. Wylie found fame late, winning the Paul Hamlyn, Charles Wollaston and John Moores prizes for painting in her 70s and 80s. Born in Kent, where she still lives, her career was interrupted by motherhood for many years, and she only completed her MA at the age of 47. The earliest work in this retrospective dates only as far back as 1997 – a yellow bird peering out of some clumsily painted branches, but at just the right angle to show its fledgling wariness – and her style has scarcely changed ever since. Ray’s Yellow Plane shows a sun-bright aircraft soaring down an unprimed canvas, yellow and orange paint pressed hard into the fabric and so thick you could practically lift the plane off the surface. Pink Skater presents a woman in sugar-pink costume, orange stars bursting all around her, held in a leap so expansive it straddles two canvases. Her frozen smile echoes the thought bubble Will I Win, running like a newsflash below. It is a jubilant and preposterous scenario. Here and there, Wylie has added a bit more canvas or watercolour paper at the last minute, hastily improvising as she goes. The pictures carry drips and globs, as if worked on the floor and then upended. You can see where the heavily laden brush eventually runs out, or where a whole paint tube has been squeezed on to the surface and worked like wet plaster across the surface. The subject matter might seem modest – a pineapple, two flowers – but the monumental materiality of the paint slows it all down. They are like rapid observations writ large. Or perhaps they are recollections. For the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, Wylie has painted memories of Kensington Gardens during the blitz, featuring this very building. Dogs scramble merrily about in the gloaming beneath whirring German planes. Two yellow ducks, straight out of a bath, stand in for the local fowl. This a seven-year-old’s vision of the park, curious and without any fear. The painting is gleefully coarse. Like the huge man with his knees carelessly splayed, dwarfing the park bench on which he sits; or the wine-dark sky, a banana moon hanging above another wonky bench in bright green. Pick your own colour, runs the wording below, as if everything could be readily changed. Spontaneity is crucial to her look. And the look trips you up every time. It carries the image with outright candour (and the influences too: Wylie’s admiration for Philip Guston and the neo-expressionists is openly declared), and then it asks you to consider why on earth she would choose to paint like this. These pictures are not quite cartoons, although they deploy the language of caricature – explosion marks, tiny legs and big heads, and so on – and nor are they knowing pastiches of children’s art. There is huge relish in the jaunty outlines, the exhilaration of colour and the material characteristics of paint. They allow Wylie, at best, a kind of laconically humorous timing. A two-picture sequence shows an acorn on one side and a jay on the other, trying desperately to force his beak into the next frame, as if it actually contained food. The tightrope balanced by an acrobat with a tiny pursed mouth really is tight, barely a couple of inches wide. There is the queer intimation of a clock in the dragonfly’s head, as if measuring his one precious day of life. Comparatively small, and in watercolour, these paintings are epigrammatic where the biggest friezes are not. The comedy of her art has at least something to do with the balance between scale and content. The curators of this show are putting considerable emphasis on Wylie’s film paintings, based on scenes from particular movies, and on the cinematic aspects of her art, which aren’t obvious to me. Certainly there are focus pulls; two pictures show a pink-draped table in a desert, in closeup and then at distance, in a kind of comic jump. But it feels quite irrelevant that the film is Syriana, or that it stars George Clooney, as inscribed in wobbly block capitals below. Nor is it quite clear – visually or intellectually – what drew Wylie to paint a frame from Kill Bill, or a vast frieze of caryatids in red dresses, except that a note scribbled on the canvas refers to the Cannes premiere of The Paperboy, notoriously booed, at which Nicole Kidman wore red. What engaged Wylie doesn’t emerge in these works. The subject matter hasn’t become entirely her own. Look instead at the abrupt and outlandish painting of Elizabeth I, based on Marcus Gheeraerts’ famous “Ditchley portrait”. Wylie gives Gloriana a head like a ginger lightbulb, briskly apt, and surrounds her with some humble pansies, yellow and purple, enlarged until they become almost overpoweringly heraldic. The juxtaposition is so sudden it becomes comic; like many kinds of humour, however, it doesn’t bear too much analysis. • Rose Wylie: Quack Quack is at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, London until 11 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-dylan-jones-gq-magazine-fashion-shoot-real-diva","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T18:39:41Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn should have given GQ the full Mariah Carey | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-dylan-jones-gq-magazine-fashion-shoot-real-diva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-dylan-jones-gq-magazine-fashion-shoot-real-diva","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn should have given GQ the full Mariah Carey","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am very surprised to find that the GQ editor, Dylan Jones, has become a committed recruiting sergeant for Jeremy Corbyn: after all, Jones did once pay David Cameron 20 grand to be allowed to write a book about him. But it is impossible to draw any other conclusion from Jones’s faux-pained Today programme interview about Corbyn, who is the magazine’s cover star this month. I must admit, I didn’t hear this live – like anyone normal on 1 December, I was listening to Mariah Carey’s Christmas album. But having caught up with it, I can see it’s absolutely the most important thing this editor’s done since the GQ power list that ranked David Beckham above Rupert Murdoch. By way of context, I don’t really read men’s magazines – I am quite uncomfortable with the way they demean men. Just kidding! I love them, with all their hilarious articles about Bear Grylls’ work ethic, what to do in 48 hours in Zurich, and the overwhelming implication that not knowing the difference between a standard luxury watch and a chronograph is a moral crime basically akin to racism. Anyway, Jones began by sniffing to Today that Corbyn didn’t realise “he couldn’t just turn up in his anorak”. The entire riff seemed predicated on the notion that British people would rather be led by someone whose team spend literally months being dicks about what their client will and won’t do. “He’ll wear Tom Ford, Dior, Armani (mainline, no Emporio) – nothing by John Galliano for obvious reasons – and Ken Pavés does his hair or it’s off.” Instead, Jones winced, the Labour leader’s office “didn’t really understand the process” – as though “the process” of how a magazine cover happens should interest anyone outside the trade to the extent that they’d lavish more than 12 seconds on trying to “understand” it. For what minuscule amount it is worth, I thought Corbyn had never come across better than he did in the Today interview, despite the fact he wasn’t in the room. But wherever you stand on Corbyn – even if it’s his windpipe, to adapt a Steve Coogan joke about someone else – it was difficult to escape the feeling that Jones is a Momentum sleeper. “It was almost like he was being pushed around like a grandpa for the family Christmas photograph,” Jones said of the photoshoot – a critique that taps into the fact that everyone hates their grandpas, especially at Christmas. If this wasn’t deliberate … well, let’s look forward to hearing Jones publicly shitbag Robert Downey Jr or some multi-Grammy winner the next time they act a million times worse. Mainly, Jones seemed shocked that Corbyn behaved in the way magazines let people behave all the time. But the Labour leader’s sole diva-ism seems to have been declining to be interviewed by Alastair Campbell, which is perfectly reasonable. Furthermore, unless you’re a movie or rock star, these showbiz moments in life don’t come along very often. Looked at seasonally, Corbyn’s entire rise is a Christmas movie in the Home Alone/Trading Places tradition, where someone unsuited and vulnerable has to step up and deal with a situation. We don’t begrudge these characters the odd moment of owning their success, do we? If anything, Corbyn didn’t go far enough. I’d have had the full Mariah Carey-style dressing room rider – 286 white votive candles spelling out FOR THE MANY NOT THE FEW, a basket of kittens to pet, and a vegetable medley with all the green ones picked out. Also: I don’t do stairs. Anyway, the magazine containing the full interview isn’t out till next week, but I am one of the lucky! few! who has been shown it in advance. I can report … not a lot. The interviewer starts by saying Corbyn “shakes my hand like someone who has just been handed a particularly ripe piece of fruit”, and ends with an anecdote about Corbyn seeing an otter in the sea, which I think might be meant to be read allegorically. I’ve put a call into Bletchley Park, but haven’t heard back yet. Certainly, some of Corbyn’s replies have the excruciating ring of celebrity cliche. He doesn’t use the large, formal opposition leader’s office because he “felt like a prisoner in a gilded cage”. Almost the exact words Mariah used for her marriage to Tommy Mottola. She ended up leaving him and emancipating her Mimi; Corbyn dealt with it by taking a much smaller office than his strategy director, Seumas Milne. Both have an amazing Christmas album in them though. (Jeremy and Mariah, I mean. I can’t really see Seumas doing one.) Moving on, the interviewer and Jones are very exercised that Corbyn couldn’t name a favourite movie. (I once asked Nigel Farage to do the same, funnily enough, and he initially couldn’t think of a single one, floundering for what felt like hours before saying Love Actually.) Mainly, though, the questions to Corbyn seem designed to showcase what GQ likes to think about itself, as opposed to anything else. For instance: “What’s the last American novel you’ve read?” When Corbyn cites a 1937 novel about Ford factory workers, he is immediately hit with: “Anything more contemporary?” When Corbyn says he read De Profundis during one of his leadership campaigns, GQ follows up with “which, of course, is Wilde’s letter written while incarcerated in Reading gaol”. I adore that “of course” – for the benefit of readers only here for the abs tips and Overfinch Range Rover porn. As mentioned, the Corbyn interview is thin editorial gruel. I’ve just finished The Vanity Fair Diaries, Tina’s Brown’s absolute scream of a book about her meteoric editorship of the magazine in New York in the 80s. It contains several episodes in which she’s not happy with a cover, and knows the only way to save sales is to use some sleight of hand, either with a cleverly provocative cover headline that jumps off the newsstand, or by creating noise around it in some other way. Jones is engaged in the latter, perhaps because his mag is too self-regardingly grand to have given the public what it wants. Namely, to put Corbyn in a big Santa costume for the Christmas issue. (And don’t tell me he wouldn’t have worn it, because he dressed up like a hip-hop mogul for The Last Leg.) Having failed to do so, and been left with a bit of a turkey, Jones knows his trade, and is frantically hustling his way around the problem. Nothing wrong with that. We’re all in trade, dear – I myself am grateful for the column material. Our only wish can be that nothing like this is taken remotely seriously, by anyone, on any side of any political divide, ever. All I want for Christmas is that. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/03/why-jeremy-corbyn-rocked-an-ms-suit-on-the-cover-of-gq","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T14:00:43Z","webTitle":"Why Jeremy Corbyn rocked an M&S suit on the cover of GQ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/03/why-jeremy-corbyn-rocked-an-ms-suit-on-the-cover-of-gq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/03/why-jeremy-corbyn-rocked-an-ms-suit-on-the-cover-of-gq","fields":{"headline":"Why Jeremy Corbyn rocked an M&S suit on the cover of GQ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has been a cover star in the making for years.

An approachable-meets-authoritative navy wool-blend suit – and a Marks &amp; Spencer one at that. By wearing M&amp;S, Corbyn shows his support for the British high street and – in particular – an institution struggling with its clothing lines (place your bets on Corbyn having a Kate effect). Additionally, at less than £200, it’s what fashion folk praise as “affordable” and “accessible”, as well as toeing his political party line. It also keeps Corbyn recognisable. As much as the fashion world would have rejoiced to see him decked out in Vetements – the luxe contemporary brand breaking with casualwear convention – this is Corbyn looking and feeling his most comfortable (he wore a near identical M&amp;S style to the Pride of Britain Awards in 2016). In the inside shoot, with his jacket off, sleeves rolled up and red tie (of course) discarded, he masters the art of another key fashion term: executive realness. And all this from the man who was told last year by then-prime minister David Cameron to “put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem”. Corbyn admitted to being strong-armed by his advisors in the first place into upping his look. But if the past year has proved anything, it’s that when ready, Corbyn does things his way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/damian-green-vendetta-police","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T17:14:26Z","webTitle":"I believe my friend Damian Green.

The vendetta against him must be stopped","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I have known Damian Green for over 20 years, since we were elected together in 1997. He stands out among us with the highest standards of public service, probity and integrity. The prime minister has known him even longer, and her judgment was to make him her deputy, and the second most important figure in her government. It was, in my view, her best appointment. Yet in the past month Damian Green has been subject to a slew of what amounts to organised gossip about legal activity coming from former police officers arising out of a nine year-old investigation which was exceptionally maladroit, slipshod in execution and properly subject to very heavy criticism. The officer in charge was Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick. In 2008, Damian Green, then shadow immigration minister, had his parliamentary office raided without a warrant, by the Metropolitan police, after he was implicated in leaking Home Office documents that were politically embarrassing to the then Labour government. I had known Quick from before this incident, as deputy then chief constable of Surrey police. Surrey police has been blessed by two successive outstanding leaders, Ian Blair and Denis O’Connor, and Quick’s promotion from deputy to chief gave me cause for concern that he was being promoted beyond his comfort zone. When he was further promoted to assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, dealing with some of the most controversial issues of the day, his rather solid qualities were insufficient to cope with the political and operational maelstrom he had to manage. In 2008, Quick ordered Damian Green’s arrest to much consternation. Green was swiftly released without charge, and subsequently all evidence and documents relating to the botched operation were destroyed. Or so it was thought. Until today, when former police officer Neil Lewis, apparently the person who analysed the computers removed from Green’s office, offered up his 10-year-old notebook as evidence that he was looking at pornography while in his parliamentary office. There are serious problems with this. First, and perhaps of most concern, it breaks the fundamental duty of confidentiality for serving and former police officers by putting the details, false or otherwise, of private police investigations into the public domain. The public interest defence is impossible to sustain when the details they allege relate to non-illegal activity, as in this case. Second, Lewis never mentioned the pornography in his 2008 report for the Metropolitan police. Lewis has admitted to speaking to Quick before breaching his duty of confidentiality, and that it appears the sole notebook he has preserved from his time in the force is one relating to Damian Green. Finally, Lewis changes his position in the course of his BBC interview. He starts off admitting that he can’t say that it was Green who accessed the pornography, before later telling the reporter he was in “no doubt whatsoever”. However, his conclusion drawn from his recollection of the pattern of access to the computer is wholly inconsistent with the normal pattern of an MP’s parliamentary life, particularly if you hold ministerial or shadow ministerial responsibility. We simply do not have time as we move from one meeting to the next to have hours to peruse leisure websites of whatever type. There are days when I do not have time to switch my desktop computer on, and computer access is by mobile devices on the run between competing engagements. This entire episode throws up several troubling questions about the behaviour of former police officers towards a liked and well-respected cabinet minister. It appears that these officers, profoundly hurt by the criticism they received during their bungled investigation, have now breached their duty of confidentiality to attempt to bring down the deputy prime minister, with no proof to advance what looks like an organised smear, in order to take advantage of the current climate and other unrelated issues. Damian Green is a man of integrity, and when he says he was not responsible for any pornography allegedly found on his computers, I believe him. There is a Cabinet Office investigation going on into Damian Green, and this investigation must have included the Metropolitan police. If, as I expect, this report finds Green innocent of any impropriety, I will be delighted to see a good man have his good name sustained. I am now deeply concerned by the way in which the people we need to protect us and help safeguard our democracy felt free to smear the reputation of a fine public servant. This appears to be part of a personal vendetta arising from the unhappy end to another career in the service of the public. The public interest would not be served by the grief and resentment of that personal tragedy being allowed to impugn the reputation of the first secretary of state, particularly when his qualities are sorely needed in our country’s government. • Crispin Blunt is Conservative MP for Reigate and chairman of the foreign affairs select committee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2017/dec/06/occupational-therapist-job-interview-tips-questions-answers","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T10:42:53Z","webTitle":"Occupational therapist job interview tips: eight questions and answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/dec/06/occupational-therapist-job-interview-tips-questions-answers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2017/dec/06/occupational-therapist-job-interview-tips-questions-answers","fields":{"headline":"Occupational therapist job interview tips: eight questions and answers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For newly trained occupational therapists to get their careers off the ground, they need to have enthusiasm, adaptability, a real willingness to learn – and a focus on the patient above all else. But how can they best show these skills when applying for jobs? We asked those responsible for hiring occupational therapists to tell us how they select the right candidates – and what interviewees can say and do to impress them. Can I come and visit? I’m impressed if someone contacts me beforehand. We’re not a traditional occupational therapy service, so if someone hasn’t done their homework they won’t be able to answer our questions as fully. You can then demonstrate in an interview why your interest and skills are suited to this particular post and trust. Becky Lodge, head of occupational therapy &amp; rehab, forensic services, west London mental health NHS trust Why do you want this job? Sometimes people really trip up on those opening questions that set the scene and show who you really are and how you’re committed to the profession. I don’t expect everybody to have the perfect skill set, but I want to see their potential, their values, their enthusiasm, their keenness to learn, and their willingness to adapt. We have adopted the six Cs of nursing (care, compassion, commitment, communication, competence and courage) as our trust’s values – and throughout the interview we’d be looking for people to show us where those values shine through in their day-to-day practice. Gary Flockhart, associate director of nursing and therapies, Cheshire and Wirral partnership NHS foundation trust Why are you the right person for this role? We want someone who doesn’t think they are the whole package. We are looking for people who are reflective, willing to accept supervision and who understand that they need it. Katherine Godfrey, trustwide head of profession for occupational therapy, Avon and Wiltshire mental health partnership NHS trust I would always ask someone about their experience, what skills they bring, and what interests they have. Have they had experience of standardised assessments in terms of occupational therapy? Have they used them – and do they understand them and the model of human occupation, which is the main model we use in the trust. If an interviewee says that they do, I know that they understand what they are coming to – and that they have read up about the trust and the service. Becky Lodge What makes a good occupational therapist? What I particularly value in a clinician is the ability to see themselves as enabling somebody to recover or change. You’re not an expert dictating what their recovery path is: you listen to what they want and where they want to be and give advice on how they might get there. I’d look for somebody who can show they can be reflective about their practice. Keir Harding, occupational therapist within the NHS and clinical lead for Beam Consultancy Interviewees should talk about how they manage challenging situations and their own stress levels, as well as supervisions and reflective practice. These are all clinical skills that you need to be able to demonstrate at interview. We also need to see that you know how to seek support when you need it. Becky Lodge During the degree, you do several practice placements, so sometimes people want to go doggedly through this – their six weeks in a hand therapy unit, for example. They need to draw out the skills that they got from that placement that are particularly relevant to the post they are applying for. If they learned how to prioritise their workload or work in a multidisciplinary team – that’s what we want to hear about, rather than that they learned a specific skill which will only be relevant to a particular specialism. Giving examples which show you work well with service users is vital. We’re interested in people who can show that they can understand another person’s point of view and communicate well. Katherine Godfrey How would your friends describe you? I hate asking about strengths and weaknesses, but asking this question enables people to be a bit more honest and less modest. What are the personal skills they think they demonstrate that friends would notice, and how do they view themselves? We’re looking for self-awareness more than anything, because you need all different sorts of people in a team. Katherine Godfrey Can you tell me about a time when you’ve witnessed care that you thought wasn’t good? What did you think about it? What did you do about it? What would you do differently? With the right people, you can see them going back to that time, being really passionate about the fact that they didn’t like what they saw and committed to doing something about it. I wouldn’t want someone who’s aspiring to be a professional occupational therapist to say, “I just reported it to the manager”. Gary Flockhart What can occupational therapy contribute to a multidisciplinary team? All occupational therapists work in teams and we’re looking for people who have an understanding of the roles of other health professionals they might work with. I’m looking for someone who knows what occupational therapy is and can explain it, because they will need to advocate for that within their team and with patients. Maria Yuen, lead occupational therapist, Cheshire and Wirral partnership NHS foundation trust Any questions for us? This is a really good time to sum up why you think you should get the job and why you’re the right person for it, bringing it back to how you might fit into the organisation. Can you show your adaptability, flexibility and entrepreneurship? NHS services are going to change and we have to be innovative and look at new ways of doing things. If you can articulate your professional role in meeting those challenges, it puts you in a good place. Gary Flockhart We welcome people asking questions and sometimes people haven’t prepared anything for this, so get flummoxed. Perhaps don’t ask about the local nightlife, but something about the post that they couldn’t find out without meeting us face-to-face. Good questions are things like: What are you most proud of in your service? What recent developments are happening?

The black community which I come from in Harlem, we don’t have the resources to determine that course.” The tailor found himself at the centre of the cultural appropriation debate this year when a near-copy of a Dapper Dan design appeared on the Gucci catwalk. Gucci shortcircuited the ensuing criticism by announcing a new collaboration with the tailor, whose atelier will reopen next year, this time stocked with official Gucci fabrics instead of bootlegged ones. “In my community, we have a different language to discuss cultural appropriation. We have bootlegs and we have knockoffs. It is about creating something new,” said Dapper Dan. “My take on the partnership with Gucci is that I am happy to have a global audience. I feel that if I can be accepted by a brand on this level, that sends a message to people of colour all over the planet that we can finally do this. Because when you look back at brands that have been created by people of colour, none of them have survived. They all crashed.” The tailor, whose iconic client list of rappers included LL Cool J, Eric B and Rakim and Salt-N-Pepa, was speaking at the Voices summit curated by Business of Fashion. The designer Dries van Noten, who recently faced a backlash over the use in his knitwear of a traditional Peruvian llama motif, also addressed the issue of appropriation, questioning the framework in which cultural references have become problematic. “There was a huge reaction against that sweater. I was told I was a thief. It does not make sense to me as a citizen of the world that the only culture I am allowed to think about is Belgian folklore. Of course, we must be careful and sensitive. But why is it so different from a Belgian chef using olive oil?” Halima Aden, the hijab-wearing catwalk model who made headlines when she appeared at the Maxmara show this year, spoke of her own positive experiences of cultural exchange in the fashion industry. “I have learned so much from being around other models from different backgrounds. One of the best examples is Gigi Hadid. I have loved spending time with her and seeing that there is no one way to be a Muslim woman, that we can coexist in that space and support each other. Women should have the freedom to wear revealing clothes if that’s what makes them feel beautiful, but women who want to dress modestly should feel like they have a place in fashion, too.” Aden faced “a lot of pushback” from her Somalian-American family when she became the first hijab-wearing entrant to the Miss Minnesota contest in 2016. “My mom was like, ‘Stay in your lane’. But I wanted to participate because I never saw myself as different from my fellow Minnesotans, and the only time I saw a woman dressed like me was on CNN – and they were never doing anything I approved of.” In 2017, the year following Aden’s appearance in the contest, seven hijab-wearing women entered. Carine Roitfeld, the iconic French stylist who Aden describes as her mentor, acknowledged that her native France has a particularly difficult relationship with the hijab. “People are very fearful. But I don’t care, because I think I am doing the right thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/02/the-resistance-now-senate-republicans-feel-force-of-protest-but-pass-tax-bill-anyway","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T15:00:15Z","webTitle":"Senate Republicans feel force of protest … but pass tax bill anyway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/02/the-resistance-now-senate-republicans-feel-force-of-protest-but-pass-tax-bill-anyway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/02/the-resistance-now-senate-republicans-feel-force-of-protest-but-pass-tax-bill-anyway","fields":{"headline":"Senate Republicans feel force of protest … but pass tax bill anyway","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tax bill passes Senate … but only after activists make their voices heard Senate Republicans finally managed to pass some legislation on Friday night, in the form of their much-criticized tax bill … but only after a remarkable effort from activists to thwart the bill. In Arizona activists had protested through Thursday night outside John McCain’s office, while people did the same outside Susan Collins’ office in Bangor, Maine. Both had been seen as potential no votes before committing to the bill this week. Even on Friday morning, progressive group Indivisible had been urging activists to spend the day making calls to senators, providing phone numbers and suggested scripts to urge elected officials to vote against the legislation. It wasn’t just activists who launched desperate efforts. The DNC urged supporters to make calls, while the editorial board of the New York Times took over the @nytopinion Twitter feed on Wednesday “to urge the Senate to reject a tax bill that hurts the middle class &amp; the nation’s fiscal health”. On Monday thousands of activists across the country had launched sit-ins at senators’ offices. In the end all the effort wasn’t enough. But there will be more battles to come. Verizon focus of last ditch net neutrality protest Hundreds of protests are planned outside Verizon stores on Thursday 7 December, to demonstrate against the upcoming Federal Communications Commission vote on net neutrality. Activists say they have chosen to target Verizon as the FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former lawyer for Verizon. The company has lobbied for current regulations – designed to protect an open internet – to be overturned. The FCC is due to vote on defanging those regulations on 14 December – potentially allowing internet service providers like Verizon to charge for different levels of web access. A group of coalitions including Fight for the Future and Team Internet are organizing the demonstrations. “We’ll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon’s puppet FCC from killing net neutrality,” said a message on the groups’ Verizon Protests website, which has a tool for people to find their nearest protests. Broken musical instruments for children Grammy award-winning composer David Lang is launching his Symphony for a Broken Orchestra in Philadelphia this weekend – a novel attempt to draw attention to the more than $1.2m that has been slashed from the city’s musical instrument repair fund. Lang – who won a Grammy in 2010 for his composition The Little Match Girl Passion and the Pulitzer prize for music in 2008 – sourced 1,500 broken musical instruments the School District of Philadelphia for the performance. “If there are 1,500 broken musical instruments, that’s 1,500 children who should be playing these instruments and whose lives could be changed,” said Lang. “There is something heartbreaking about it.” Lang hopes people will donate to repair instruments through the Symphony for a Broken Orchestra website – those instruments will then be put “back into the hands of a child”.

It flourished under William Gaddis, Thomas Pynchon and John Barth; it became even more prominent when David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest appeared the year before Don DeLillo’s Underworld, and recent examples might include Joshua Cohen, Adam Levin and especially Mark Z Danielewski’s proposed 27-volume The Familiar. To be added to this door-stopping tendency is Matthew McIntosh’s theMystery.doc, subtitled “a novel”, although it frets over that description. What is surprising is that McIntosh would join this vaguely macho club. His debut novel, Well, published in 2005, was a shade under 300 pages: classic creative writing in the key of Raymond Carver, and no bad thing for that. theMystery.doc is a whopping 1,600 pages. It includes photographs, text messages, plagiarisms, discussions about itself and a whole “drawerful of jpegs, tifs, pdfs, mp3s,midis, wavs, aiffs, mpgs, movs, and all other accounts we keep of our / de::: / cline:::” It also features reams of pages made up mostly of asterisks. These may be a wink to Edith Wharton’s story “The Muse’s Tragedy”. They occasionally represent snowfall, but they are also the snow or static on a television, it seems; appropriately for a book much concerned with technology and its discontents. A number of pages are just repetitions of &gt; &gt; &gt;, as if the author – again, this is clearly deliberate – had fallen asleep at the computer. There are five pages of what looks like – I may be wrong – a modern doc file pasted into an earlier version of the software: “AWW91IHdlcmUgcminaHQiEhIK2x…” and so on. There are black pages and empty pages, as in Tristram Shandy, and there are redactions that may or may not be significant. “The universe is a big puzzle and needs to be put back together again,” says one of the narrative voices. That may be so, but is there a story? Yes, to an extent. There are conveniently titled chapters that tell the reader of an author who wakes up with amnesia, cannot recognise the woman in the room with him, and finds on his laptop his work in progress, a completely blank file called theMystery.doc. A cat is dead in the yard. His neighbour has dementia. He has some kind of relationship with a woman much younger than he is. She parties with various lowlifes and a creepy couple called MOM and Pop. There is a parallel narrative about a young man moving from Federal Way, Seattle – the setting of Well – to work in London, where he falls in love with a passive-aggressive woman, does a load of dope and drinks cheap cider. There are sections in which people – or maybe just one person – try to find out if WebsiteGreeters.com is a form of Turing test. Is the individual at the other end of the datastream an actual human or not? And there are inset short stories about, among other things, care homes, premature births, dying parents – and if you can’t get a story out of them, you are on a hiding to nothing – which are very touching and tender (in both senses of that word). There are transcripts of 911 emergency calls. There are overheard conversations and a strange kind of agent, unloading his secrets. Quite early in the book, I realised what the game was: we live in a world of information overload and fragmented identities. Even the extent of the book is a kind of awful realism: as if McIntosh is saying “too much, too much, too much” again and again and again. He himself appears as a character, and that makes it even more problematic that the book tries to diagnose itself. “M” is asked: “Does it have fictional characters? That’s a difficult question to answer. Because, reality is an issue in the book, so … It’s a very, very different sort of ….. book”. The sad thing is that it is not that very different from many other infatuated avant-garde attempts. Where it does make advances is in its serious analysis of religion. Time and again it circles back to how religion has formed and informed the central characters. If one is looking at birth, love and death, then these are all spaces in which religious thoughts and sentiments break through. The mini-essay parts of this engorged and sprawling book are actually the most concise and precise. If I were to use one word to describe theMystery.doc it would be “valiant”. It tries hard to be cutting-edge and it is brave in how it looks at the emotional repercussions of its long gestation. But it might not be a coincidence that Don Quixote, that great book about failure, is referred to frequently. theMystery.doc is like a giant scrapbook of ideas for books. Many are clever, many are moving, many are sincere, many are intriguing: but not all of them should be between two covers. • Stuart Kelly’s The Minister and the Murderer will be published next year by Granta. theMystery.doc is published by Grove Press.

The mayor also wants to experiment with getting businesses to make their tap water available to the public, building on a scheme launched two years ago in Bristol. A million plastic bottles are bought worldwide every minute, and annual consumption is expected to surpass half a trillion bottles by 2021. A large proportion wind up buried in landfill sites or littering the ocean, with figures revealing that more than half of the plastic bottles bought in 2016 were not collected for recycling. “The mayor wants to see a reduction in the amount of single-use plastic bottles and cups across the capital and has asked City Hall officers to examine the feasibility of a pilot community water refill scheme, or other interventions,” said a spokesperson for Khan, adding that the mayor has also written to the government to discuss trialling a deposit return scheme in London and would like London’s businesses to make tap water available to the public. “Sadiq supports boroughs in identifying suitable locations for water fountains and bottle-refill stations during the planning process in new or redeveloped public spaces, such as town centres, shopping malls, parks and squares,” the spokesperson added, pointing to Khan’s blueprint for London, which is open for consultation until March 2018. “Free drinking-water fountains that can refill water bottles, as well as be drunk from, should be provided in appropriate locations in new or redeveloped public realm,” the report notes, adding that such locations include busy pedestrian areas, parks and squares. The mayor appears to be joining an incipient movement to challenge the inexorable spread of plastic. Retailers such as Pret a Manger, JD Wetherspoon and even London Zoo have indicated that they want to curb their plastic usage, and last month Jamie Oliver also called for more drinking stations to be installed to provide “a free and greener alternative to sugary drinks”. In addition, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has revealed that greater access to drinking fountains across the country is being considered as part of the government’s bid to cut plastic waste. Enthusiastically rolled out by Victorian philanthropists for public health and temperance reasons, water fountains were once far more abundant than they are today: the current provision around London and England’s metropolitan boroughs shows vast disparities. Exclusive data gathered by the Guardian reveals that while the borough of Lambeth has 25 drinking fountains around its parks and open spaces, many others, including Sutton, Enfield and Haringey, have none – and no plans to install any. A similar dearth was found across England’s urban hubs: not one of the councils across Manchester, Merseyside or South Yorkshire – encompassing Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham – reported having any drinking fountains in parks or town centres, with those that had been installed were decommissioned. And it remains to be seen whether Gove and Khan’s ambitions will be realised. Khan’s predecessor, Boris Johnson, also announced “a new era of public fountains” in 2008, but did not follow through. “Under the previous mayoralty, several proposals for providing water fountains and water bottle refill stations were explored but there were concerns over high installation costs,” a spokesperson for Khan told the Guardian. But the Guardian has established that costs are negligible. Documents regarding the installation of a drinking fountain in Shrewsbury Park, Greenwich, suggests it would cost about £6,000. A spokesperson for Tower Hamlets, which has 11 drinking fountains and is considering installing a further two, said that the decision to install fountains tended to be made when refurbs of parks and playgrounds were being undertaken, and after consultation with the public. A survey by YouGov and Keep Britain Tidy earlier this year revealed that 70% of individuals questioned agreed that tap water should be more freely available, while 59% said they would be more likely to reuse a water bottle if they could easily fill it in shops, parks and other locations. Paul O’Connell, a trustee of the Drinking Fountain Association that was set up in 1859, said that while budget cuts appeared to be behind the decommissioning of existing fountains by councils, commercial considerations might also play a role in decisions over whether to install fountains. He said that, for example, seven years ago, Network Rail admitted that it did not want new drinking points on its stations, in part because it would undermine retailers. In a letter to O’Connell, seen by the Guardian and dated February 2010, a transport ministry official noted that Network Rail believed that “installing water fountains would take away the revenue that retailers receive from the sale of bottled water (and other drinks) and rents that Network Rail receives from retailers is a significant source of revenue”. When contacted by the Guardian, a Network Rail spokesperson said that water fountains were not, and would not, be installed in stations, but refused to give a rationale. “Water fountains are not a facility we currently have in stations and there are currently no plans to do so,” the spokesperson said. While O’Connell said he welcomed the plans from the London mayor, he warned that promises to boost the number of water fountains had been made before, to little effect. “Obviously, we have been here before,” he said. But, he added, the approach could bring many benefits if installed in the right locations, from aiding public health, to saving money and helping the environment. “There is a lot of waste caused by single-use plastic and it’s a basic human need to have drinking water,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/04/we-have-a-new-mortgage-and-would-like-to-travel-for-a-year-can-we-do-it","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"We have a new mortgage and would like to travel for a year.

Can we do it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Q I would be very grateful for any advice you can offer regarding having a mortgage but wanting to go travelling for a year. My partner and I got a mortgage to buy our flat last year. We are currently both in full-time jobs but are thinking it would be nice to take a year out and go travelling. We (naively) thought that we could just rent out our flat (I know easier said than done) and set off on our travels. But now I have been reading that we may have to change our mortgage to a buy-to-let mortgage, which could significantly increase our interest rate and may result in charges due to changes in a three-year fixed-term contract. So my question is, do we have to change our mortgage, or is there a way we can keep it the same, given that it is short term and we won’t actually be making a profit on the income of the rent (just helping to pay off the mortgage whilst we are away). KG A You are right that you can’t just rent out your flat and set off on your travels but you may not need to worry about converting your mortgage to a buy-to-let loan. If you don’t plan to let your flat for more than 12 months and you intend to return to living in it, most lenders will consider what’s called a ”consent to let” arrangement for which there may be a administration fee of £100 to £300. As well as charging a fee to give you permission to let your property, some lenders will also increase the mortgage interest rate although they may not do this if you are on a fixed-rate deal. Before giving its consent to let, a lender will need to be satisfied that your plan to let your flat has come about through a genuine change in your personal circumstances – for example, you have to move for work reasons and possibly, you’ve decided to go off travelling. You are unlikely to get consent to let if it looks as though you were always planning to let your property but applied for a residential mortgage to get a better deal. But before approaching your lender to see if it will give you permission to let your property or if it will insist you swap to a buy-to-let mortgage (which it may), you need to find out if letting your flat is a realistic proposition. You need to know first whether the flat is in a fit state to be let and if it is how much rent you could get for it. If it isn’t in a fit state to let, you need to know what you should do to make it suitable, which could include fitting smoke alarms and extractor fans and making sure that any upholstered furniture is fire proof. You’ll also need to have gas appliances tested by a Gas Safe engineer and provide your tenants with an energy performance certificate. If you plan to use a lettings agent to manage the letting of your flat – and deal with tenants while you are away - you should factor in their charge for this service which is generally 10% to 15% of the rental income. On top of that, you’ll need to pay for landlord insurance to protect the property while it has tenants in it, which your current buildings and contents insurance won’t. You should also factor in the cost of storing items that you don’t want left in the flat while you are out of the country. With any luck, the net rental income after deducting all the extra costs of being an absentee landlord will cover the mortgage. If it doesn’t, your travel plans will have to wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/03/press-freedom-president-tweets-arent-helping","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"All the president’s tweets aren’t helping press freedom much","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/03/press-freedom-president-tweets-arent-helping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/03/press-freedom-president-tweets-arent-helping","fields":{"headline":"All the president’s tweets aren’t helping press freedom much","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The first doleful report for 2017 (from Index on Censorship) reports 259 journalists jailed this year around the world, and 79 killed.

Therein lies the basic reason why UK politics is in such an unholy mess: the idea that if you’re not with us you’re against us, the whole adversarial principle that keeps the parliamentary process stuck at the level of a public school debate. When Margaret Thatcher struck down the GLC and thus emptied County Hall, a golden opportunity for reform was lost. The council chamber, with its rows of benches in a horseshoe, could have been adapted to produce a debating chamber like those of more grownup nations, each seat equipped with a screen and voting terminal, enabling individual MPs to do what, by Soubry’s account, they are too scared to do: vote according to their beliefs and those of their constituents. It might even, in the long term, have undermined the whole idea of government v opposition and enabled ad hoc alliances to be formed when a realistic alternative to government policy can be developed – such as now. Our judicial system is similarly blighted: as Keir Starmer once observed, the idea that the truth can emerge from a process in which two barristers present opposing arguments and expect 12 civilians to make the decision doesn’t make a lot of sense when you think about it. But neither institution is likely to change while the lawyers remain in charge. Jim Trimmer Kingston I am writing to condemn the death threats made against my constituency opponent Anna Soubry. Broxtowe’s MP has the right to express her views without fielding such disgusting responses. I also share deep concern over the impasse regarding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. But I disagree with her identification of the politicians “history will condemn” in relation to this issue. The person responsible for this debacle is David Cameron, in whose cabinet Ms Soubry served and with whom she agreed the timetable for the 2016 referendum that has left the country deeply divided and facing an uncertain future. Regardless of your Brexit view, Cameron’s chaotic cabinet’s failings were compounded by their decision to then allow him to lead the Remain efforts and overshadow more established and credible campaigners. Greg Marshall Labour prospective parliamentary candidate for Broxtowe Anna Soubry describes feeling emotionally wobbly after being labelled a “mutineer” and receiving death threats for revealing that she is opposed to the EU withdrawal bill. The government, apparently, has not expressed condemnation of this behaviour. There is also silence from the many MPs who know that leaving the EU will be disastrous for the UK and who seem to be voting against their consciences. Theresa May is said to be in thrall to hard Brexiters. My guess is that she is in fear of losing votes and thus her role as prime minister. But consider whose votes she would be losing: those who use social media to silence opposition by threatening rape and murder, and those who remain silent about such abuse. I believe that large numbers of the population now see that restoring fairness and equality in this country is the business of the government and will not be achieved by leaving the EU. Your editorial of 12 November said “Enough of this shambles”; let’s have the courage to halt the process and manage the fallout.

A hot water bottle waits in the crowd to greet the couple. The crowds had started to arrive a couple of hours early and were three or four deep by the time the royal Range Rover pulled up at the top of the street for the couple’s 200-yard walk to the arts centre Nottingham Contemporary for a Terrence Higgins Trust fund-raising fair. Prince Harry and Meghan greet the public.. and the press. Some had billed the event as Meghan’s “‘work experience induction day” but the actress proved far too much of a pro at working an audience to show any signs of nerves. She did all that was required of her and more. She smiled, she got touchy-feely with Harry, she smiled, she chatted to people, she smiled, she accepted a bouquet of roses, she smiled. The perfect princess. She even wandered off to smile and chat to people on the opposite side of the road to Harry. Which went down a storm with one section of the crowd, but left those who just got the prince feeling somewhat shortchanged. Shades of Charles and Diana. This man brought his barn owl to the meet the couple. The first walkabout had only been scheduled to last a few minutes but ended up taking the best part of half an hour. Which was great for the crowds but put rather a strain on those covering the event for the news channels. A young spiderman made an appearance in the crowd. Having exhausted their knowledge of Meghan’s clothes – coat from Canada, the rest from Britain; to their credit, no one had a clue where the bag came from – the commentators found themselves with rather a lot of dead airtime to fill. Phones are poised at the barriers and in the crowd. How would Meghan be feeling? Nervous but quietly confident, as she has had a lot of practice appearing in public in a TV show that most people in Britain haven’t seen. Would the Queen have given her any advice? Harry and fiancee, Meghan Markle, tour the Terrence Higgins Trust World Aids Day charity fair. Probably not, but all was well as Harry was a great mentor. The veteran royal hack Dickie Arbiter observed that we shouldn’t be too worried about Meghan feeling the cold because, although she had been born in California, she had spent a lot of time in Toronto. Prince Harry and Meghan wave from the comfort of their car. Just when it looked like Harry and Meghan had finally made it to the front door of Nottingham Contemporary, they dashed back into the street for an encore. To the manner born. And cut. Prince Harry and Meghan later visited the Nottingham Academy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/02/slobodan-praljak-suicide-reopens-old-wounds-bosnia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Slobodan Praljak's suicide reopens old wounds in Bosnia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/02/slobodan-praljak-suicide-reopens-old-wounds-bosnia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/02/slobodan-praljak-suicide-reopens-old-wounds-bosnia","fields":{"headline":"Slobodan Praljak's suicide reopens old wounds in Bosnia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the main square of the quiet town of Čapljina, hundreds of candles on the paving stones outside the pastel-shaded municipal building spell out one name: Praljak. The dramatic suicide of the Croat general Slobodan Praljak, swigging poison on live television moments after his sentence for war crimes was upheld on Wednesday, shocked the world. On Friday, Dutch prosecutors said Praljak died after taking potassium cyanide, citing the results of a preliminary postmortem. “This has resulted in a failure of the heart, which is indicated as the suspected cause of death,” they said. But reactions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Čapljina, his hometown, and Mostar, the city his forces besieged, are particularly fraught. “It’s like life has stopped completely here,” says Miro Jovanovič, a middle-aged municipal official as he crosses the square, overlooked by a twin-spired Catholic church. “We want to honour him as he lived proudly, but couldn’t live with this injustice. He was one of us.” In Čapljina, which lies beside the broad Neretva river between Mostar and the Adriatic coast, Praljak’s 20-year sentence is seen as a shocking miscarriage of justice. It lies in a region considered a heartland of Croat nationalism: a derogatory joke goes that in the rocky hills of western Herzegovina, nothing grows but snakes, stones and Ustasha – the second world war Croat fascist movement. Croatian flags hang at regular intervals, graffiti declares local loyalty to Zagreb’s leading football club, and several cafes have posters of Praljak with the backdrop of the Croatian flag and the slogan “our hero”. “We were together in the war when I fought. He wasn’t guilty,” says Ivan Buntić, 59, as he opened up his clothes shop on the edge of Čapljina’s old town. “He was a special man, like a Greek hero. Perhaps he knew that war crimes were happening, but he couldn’t do much – he was the one who was trying to restore order. Everyone had armies, everyone had [concentration] camps.” Praljak was found guilty of war crimes in the 1992-95 Bosnian war, one of six ethnic Croats convicted by the Hague tribunal who, prosecutors said, were “key participants in a joint criminal enterprise to ethnically cleanse Bosnian Muslims”. He was involved in the siege of Mostar, during which the city’s 16th-century Old Bridge was destroyed by Croat shelling. Croats make up around 16% of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina and many feel both that the framework established at the end of the war disadvantages them at the expense of Bosnian Muslims and Serbs and that war crimes against Croats have gone unpunished. Arranging flowers outside her shop on Čapljina’s main street, Marijana Vego, 29, says Praljak was “righteous”. “As a Christian Catholic, this is the first time in my life that I’ve thought a suicide was heroic. I took my kids to light candles for him. I’m not saying there were no crimes, but there were crimes on all sides.” The implications of Praljak’s conviction and suicide echo well beyond the starkly beautiful Neretva valley. The judges on Wednesday upheld the verdict that the late Croatian president Franjo Tuđjman shared the ultimate purpose of the “criminal enterprise” and his successors in Zagreb, now the capital of an EU member state, have been accused of sending mixed messages since Praljak’s suicide. The president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, said Croats needed to admit “some of our fellow compatriots in Bosnia committed crimes” but acknowledged Praljak’s death had “deeply struck the hearts of the Croatian people”. The prime minister, Andrej Plenković, said simply that the UN court’s verdict was a “deep moral injustice”. Plenković leads the political party founded by Tuđjman, the HDZ, while Grabar-Kitarović was a member until her election as president. In the Mostar head office of the HDZ’s Bosnian sister party, Vladimir Šoljić, who served as “defence minister” of the wartime Croatian statelet Herceg-Bosna, remembers Praljak as a charismatic and brave individual from their first meeting at secondary school. “He always had a crowd of people around him at school, and later as a solider was always the first to lead. He spent every day in the war seeing Muslims, helping them with loans, support, calling their families – then they turned around and called him a war criminal. What he did was so him – some people act brave, but that really was him.” Šoljić insists that Herceg-Bosna was not a land-grab driven by ethnic cleansing, part of a plan to divide Bosnia between Croats and Serbs, but a defensive move to protect Croats – particularly following massacres by Serbs – and that there were no orders from above for war crimes. “It’s no secret that all Croats want to be part of Croatia, but we have to be realistic. There was never a plan to change borders. I attended many, many meetings with the defence minister of Croatia – if anyone can find a single order or instruction of any kind to commit war crimes, I’ll do the same as General Praljak.” Others have less rosy memories of Praljak’s “defence” of the region. Nedim Ćišić, a 38-year-old Bosnian Muslim musician and artist, was sheltered with his parents and sister by Croatian friends in Čapljina after being released from a nearby Croat-run prison camp. “One night we heard – Boom! Boom! Boom! Which was strange, as the fighting wasn’t close at the time. Then we heard it was the Muslim businesses being blown up. That’s when we knew it was time to leave.” Armanj, a 37-year-old waiter, was wounded in the leg by a sniper as a teenager while out on an errand. “Fourteen members of my family died, all because of that monster, Praljak. His suicide was cowardice. They destroyed our bridge just because we had different names.” Mostar today remains a divided city, with Bosnian Muslims mostly living in the east of the city, and Croats in the west. In the hours after Praljak’s death, police filled the streets around the “frontline” between the two. Not all Croats share in the glorification of Praljak, but his death has re-opened old wounds. “Praljak’s suicide was his last grenade,” says Marko Tomaš, a poet. Son of a Serb and a Bosnian Muslim and born in Slovenia, Tomaš’s friends see him as epitomising the multi-ethnic mix of old Mostar, destroyed as neighbours turned on one another in the war. Like many Bosnians of all ethnicities, he is frustrated at political and economic stasis, presided over by politicians who trade on ethnic nationalism. “There’s a psychosis here still – what we have isn’t peace, because war never ended, and our politicians are those who led us into this situation in the first place. The whole region has psychosis, and one spark could set it off again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/01/meghan-markle-could-shake-up-monarchy-says-noam-chomsky","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T16:06:06Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle could shake up monarchy, says Noam Chomsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/meghan-markle-could-shake-up-monarchy-says-noam-chomsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/meghan-markle-could-shake-up-monarchy-says-noam-chomsky","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle could shake up monarchy, says Noam Chomsky","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Meghan Markle could “shake up” the British monarchy, according to Noam Chomsky, the eminent linguistics professor and leftwing political activist, who is one of the actor’s favourite writers. Markle displayed her radical credentials last summer when she told her 2 million Instagram followers that Chomsky’s book Who Rules the World was a “great read”, adding: “highly recommend”. She met Prince Harry, who she will marry in May, around the same time as she was reading Chomsky, a one-time anarchist, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist. According to the New York Review of Books, that particular book is a “plea to end American hypocrisy and to introduce a more consistently principled dimension to American relations with the world”. Chomsky, 88, told the Guardian on Friday: “I’ve heard about the marriage, but didn’t know about Markle’s interests. Naturally pleased to hear it. Sounds as though she may, for many reasons, shake up the royal family.” Chomsky’s attitude to royalty is somewhat barbed. Asked by Prospect Magazine in 2011 if the monarchy was good for Britain, he quoted his philosopher friend Peter Slezak. “Royalty serves a useful purpose, he said: the pomp and ceremony helps undermine respect for state authority.” Markle is planning to take British citizenship, but for now her head of state is Donald Trump. As a supporter of Hillary Clinton, she is likely to find any involvement in a state visit by the US president challenging. “The way to understand Trump, I think, is pretty simple,” Chomsky said. “Apart from the pathological megalomania, he is an astute enough politician to understand that his only hope for power is to keep his adoring base in line, and they relish the fact that he is lashing out at those they see as their enemies and persecutors: Muslims, elites, foreigners … Not unknown in history, and not with welcome outcomes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/26/khaled-ali-egypts-unlikeliest-challenger-to-strongman-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"Khaled Ali: Egypt's unlikeliest challenger to strongman president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/khaled-ali-egypts-unlikeliest-challenger-to-strongman-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/26/khaled-ali-egypts-unlikeliest-challenger-to-strongman-president","fields":{"headline":"Khaled Ali: Egypt's unlikeliest challenger to strongman president","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Khaled Ali is an unassuming sort of revolutionary. Dressed in a tweed jacket, his formidable eyebrows arching over thick-rimmed glasses, he could be mistaken for a substitute teacher rather than a firebrand lawyer and hopeful presidential candidate in Egypt’s forthcoming election. “I’m seen as a traitor funded from abroad,” he said, shrugging off the criticisms levelled at him by Egyptian media and pro-government figures. Ali’s platform, a mix of welfare proposals including expanded health insurance and a minimum wage, is reminiscent of socialists who’ve broken into mainstream politics elsewhere, such as Bernie Sanders or even Jeremy Corbyn. Does he see himself in the same tradition? Ali gives his only interview response in English: “I am Khaled Ali.” Then he laughs. Yet Ali might be the closest thing that Egypt has to David confronting Goliath. He is currently one of four potential candidates to declare their intention to run against Egypt’s strongman president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in the country’s presidential election due in spring 2018, but perhaps the only one with a chance of competing. Col Ahmed Konsowa was detained shortly after he declared his intention to run, accused of violating military rules by expressing political views in uniform. Last week he was sentenced to six years in prison. Egypt’s former prime minister, Ahmed Shafik, was deported from the UAE and held incommunicado for 24 hours on his return to Egypt after declaring his intention to run.Shafik is a formidable symbol of the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak, an autocrat with ties to its powerful military and security services, while Ali is the latest figurehead of the leftist opposition that toppled Mubarak from power in 2011. Sisi, formerly head of the country’s armed forces, who swept to power in a popularly-backed military coup in 2013 and won with 97% of the vote in the 2014 election. His first term witnessed increasing economic turbulence and security concerns, accompanied by an unprecedented crackdown on opposition, free speech and civil society. Though he is yet to declare, he is widely expected to run for a second term, and win. Ali’s platform is less a criticism of Sisi’s style of government and more a challenge to the entire system that he represents. As a result, for many he is not just opposition but public enemy number one. His campaign has faced intimidation from the start. Police raided a printing house producing his campaign brochures, then denied the raid ever took place. “I was asked to attend a dinner in downtown Cairo, and the next day every cafe in that street was closed, as everyone had been hassled by the police,” he added. “A lawyer in one district wanted to hold a meeting to discuss supporting me, and then got a call from the police demanding that he cancel it.” Ali has also become a punching bag for Egypt’s overwhelmingly pro-state media. Since announcing his intention to run, he is yet to be invited to speak on any of Egypt’s influential nightly talkshows or give interviews to the local press. The hyper-nationalist Al Gomhuria newspaper has run coverage denouncing Ali, at one point publishing a provocative full-page op-ed by the editor in chief entitled “Khaled Ali and midget’s play”. The piece described Ali as a show-off secretly funded by the EU, obsessed with authority and “cartoonish struggles”. Their obsession with minimising Ali’s candidacy figure is reminiscent of the reaction to his last bid for president in 2012, where he garnered less than 1% of the overall vote. Since then, however, Ali has risen to infamy, which he hopes will generate votes for him in 2018. Ali was at the forefront of a divisive battle over Sisi’s highly controversial decision to transfer two islands to Saudi Arabia. The jovial lawyer spearheaded a successful legal case overruling the government’s decision in January, arguing that the two islands were originally Egyptian, not Saudi. Yet his victory was later doubly crushed. Egypt’s parliament circumvented the court’s decision, meaning that the transfer will go ahead. Pro-government lawyer Samir Sabry later took Ali to court, accusing him of “making an obscene gesture” during the celebrations of his victory. Ali appealed the decision, but won’t find out until 3 January if his appeal has been accepted. If denied, he will be unable to run in 2018. If barred from running, Ali’s campaign has no contingency plan, and Egypt’s left will lose its figurehead. “There is no [other] person,” he said. . Much of Ali’s support base is comprised of large sections of Egyptian youth, who have tended to boycott state politics since Sisi came to power. If is is able to run, Ali believes he can tempt younger voters back to the ballot box. He presents a flyer showing a declaration of support for his candidacy from the banned April 6 Youth Movement, established in 2008. “This is one of the groups that said they wouldn’t even support an election – and here they are, coming back!” he said, visibly buoyed by the support. For others, backing from groups like April 6 marks Ali as a permanent outsider. “I will not vote for President Sisi,” said Hisham Kassem, former editor of the nationalist tabloid Al-Masry Al-Youm. “But I’m hoping for a more formidable candidate than Khaled Ali.” Kassem believes that a civilian president “needs to be able to deal with the security agencies” capable of undermining Egypt’s leaders, notably Morsi. “People need to feel confident and see an image of a powerful man,” he said. Ali says his aim is simply to undermine some of Sisi’s alleged popularity at the ballot box. But even this comes with extreme risks. Asked if he has anything to add at the end of our interview he jokes: “Don’t forget to bring me food when I go to prison.” Additional reporting by Adham Youssef"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/04/researchers-share-22m-breakthrough-prize-as-science-gets-rock-star-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T04:23:20Z","webTitle":"Researchers share $22m Breakthrough prize as science gets rock star treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/04/researchers-share-22m-breakthrough-prize-as-science-gets-rock-star-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/04/researchers-share-22m-breakthrough-prize-as-science-gets-rock-star-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Researchers share $22m Breakthrough prize as science gets rock star treatment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The most glitzy event on the scientific calendar took place on Sunday night when the Breakthrough Foundation gave away $22m (£16.3m) in prizes to dozens of physicists, biologists and mathematicians at a ceremony in Silicon Valley. The winners this year include five researchers who won $3m (£2.2m) each for their work on cell biology, plant science and neurodegenerative diseases, two mathematicians, and a team of 27 physicists who mapped the primordial light that warmed the universe moments after the big bang 13.8 billion years ago. Now in their sixth year, the Breakthrough prizes are backed by Yuri Milner, a Silicon Valley tech investor, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife Priscilla Chan, Anne Wojcicki from the DNA testing company 23andMe, and Google’s Sergey Brin. Launched by Milner in 2012, the awards aim to make rock stars of scientists and raise their profile in the public consciousness. The annual ceremony at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in California provides a rare opportunity for some of the world’s leading minds to rub shoulders with celebrities, who this year included Morgan Freeman as host, fellow actors Kerry Washington and Mila Kunis, and Miss USA 2017 Kára McCullough. When Joe Polchinski at the University of California in Santa Barbara shared the physics prize last year, he conceded his nieces and nephews would know more about the A-list attendees than he would. Oxford University geneticist Kim Nasmyth won for his work on chromosomes but said he had not worked out what to do with the windfall. “It’s a wonderful bonus, but not something you expect,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of money, I haven’t had time to think it through.” On being recognised for what amounts to his life’s work, he added: “You have to do science because you want to know, not because you want to get recognition. If you do what it takes to please other people, you’ll lose your moral compass.” Nasmyth has won lucrative awards before and channelled some of his winnings into Gregor Mendel’s former monastery in Brno. Another life sciences prizewinner, Joanne Chory at the Salk Institute in San Diego, was honoured for three decades of painstaking research into the genetic programs that flip into action when plants find themselves plunged into shade. Her work revealed that plants can sense when a nearby competitor is about to steal their light, sparking a growth spurt in response. The plants detect threatening neighbours by sensing a surge in the particular wavelengths of red light that are given off by vegetation. Chory now has ambitious plans to breed plants that can suck vast quantities of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in a bid to combat climate change. She believes that crops could be selected to absorb 20 times more of the greenhouse gas than they do today, and convert it into suberin, a waxy material found in roots and bark that breaks down incredibly slowly in soil. “If we can do this on 5% of the landmass people are growing crops on, we can take out 50% of global human emissions,” she said. Three other life sciences prizes went to Kazutoshi Mori at Kyoto University and Peter Walter for their work on “quality control” mechanisms that keep cells healthy, and to Don Cleveland at the University of California, San Diego, for his research on motor neurone disease. The $3m Breakthrough prize in mathematics was shared by two British-born mathematicians, Christopher Hacon at the University of Utah and James McKernan at the University of California in San Diego. The pair made major contributions to a field of mathematics known as birational algebraic geometry, which sets the rules for projecting abstract objects with more than 1,000 dimensions onto lower-dimensional surfaces. “It gets very technical, very quickly,” said McKernan. Speaking before the ceremony, Hacon was feeling a little unnerved. “It’s really not a mathematician kind of thing, but I’ll probably survive,” he said. “I’ve got a tux ready, but I’m not keen on wearing it.” Asked what he might do with his share of the winnings, Hacon was nothing if not realistic. “I’ll start by paying taxes,” he said. “And I have six kids, so the rest will evaporate.” Chuck Bennett, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, led a Nasa mission known as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) to map the faint afterglow of the big bang’s radiation that now permeates the universe. The achievement, now more than a decade old, won the 27-strong science team the $3m Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics. “When we made our first maps of the sky, I thought these are beautiful,” Bennett told the Guardian. “It is still absolutely amazing to me. We can look directly back in time.” Bennett believes that the prizes may help raise the profile of science at a time when it is sorely needed. “The point is not to make rock stars of us, but of the science itself,” he said. “I don’t think people realise how big a role science plays in their lives. In everything you do, from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, there’s something about what you’re doing that involves scientific advances. I don’t think people think about that at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/06/goblin-ever-dundas-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T07:29:10Z","webTitle":"Goblin by Ever Dundas review – a brilliant picaresque","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/06/goblin-ever-dundas-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/06/goblin-ever-dundas-review","fields":{"headline":"Goblin by Ever Dundas review – a brilliant picaresque","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dead things can’t die; weirdos always find each other. These two statements, from Scottish author Ever Dundas’s terrific debut novel, contain between them much of the meaning of the book, and much that makes it moving. It is a celebration of freakery, of creating one’s own family; a meditation on trauma and loss and abandonment (in both senses of that word) which, somehow, is never bleak.Goblin brims throughout with a kind of reckless joy. The story switches regularly and rapidly between past and almost-present, mostly in London: between the firelit city of the blitz and the firelit city of the 2011 riots. Goblin, when we first encounter her, is an 81-year-old reader-in-residence at Edinburgh’s Central Library, where she is kept company by Ben, a homeless man eating his way through Ulysses, page by page, chowing down as if it were a gorgonzola sandwich. Goblin is the name her mother used for her; a term of hatred that she has reclaimed. One day, she reads in the newspaper about the discovery in Kensal Green Cemetery of a macabre buried cache – doll parts, bones, a camera. The film, when developed, is of interest to the police. This provokes in Goblin intrusive thoughts of her childhood in London. Things that were buried are coming to the surface. Little moments bring on memories: a dizzy spell, a sip of whisky, the cooing of pigeons; suddenly, we are back in 1941 and she is a semi-feral girl, an androgynous urchin with a head full of HG Wells and Bride of Frankenstein, and a bedroom full of strays. About those strays. Neglected and emotionally abused by her mother, Goblin shows love and mercy to animals made homeless by Luftwaffe bombs or otherwise threatened by life on the home front. A crucial plot point has to do with the so-called “pet massacre” of 1939 when, in the first four days of the war, an estimated 400,000 animals were put down by Londoners worried that they would not be able to feed or care for them. One of Dundas’s aims with this book, she has explained, is to challenge the romantic consensus around the second world war and, as Ballard said of Crash, to “rub the human face in its own vomit and force it to look in the mirror”. In her descriptions of the pet massacre, she gives us the vomit – literally – and a horrific, unforgettable image: a Golgotha of cats and dogs, corpses piled in a stinking hill, a foreshadowing of what would be found upon the liberation of the death camps. As well as animals, Goblin’s other comfort is language. She is a storyteller, potty- and poetry-mouthed, cursing and versing, “weaving tales, spinning words into nets”, as one character puts it, until “no one knew what was true any more”. She creates a personal mythology based around her reading of science fiction and the Bible, anxiety about German invasion and the delusional ramblings of a local eccentric, the Crazy Pigeon Woman of Amen Court. Any experience, no matter how personally traumatic, is understood in the context of this myth: real life is held at a distance, where it cannot hurt as much. Goblin is a picaresque; in what are arguably the best passages, the heroine sets out to walk from Cornwall to London, a revacuee heading back to the blitz, to rubble and trouble, with her pet hog, Corporal Pig, trotting at her heels. There is so much energy and delight in that chapter, but Dundas can do stillness too. She is an accomplished creator of tableaux. The plot scoots along, breathless, deathwards, so fast it blurs, when all of a sudden – snap! – it seems to freeze on artfully composed scenes: girls in gas masks playing skipping games; a teenage boy lying in his bedroom, Dietrich on the wall, Liszt on the gramophone, smoke in the air; a child floating, drowned, on a bombsite, her dirty blond hair “like a messed up halo”. What Dundas reveals, again and again, is the mildewed wall behind the Keep Calm and Carry On poster. Her wartime London is rendered with such eldritch vivacity that the story loses considerable energy, though not fatally so, when it moves on and Goblin grows up. The novel itself is a kind of foundling. It was published originally in May by Freight and there were concerns that it might be lost as a result of that publisher’s financial difficulties. Happily, it has been rescued by Saraband and has another chance at life. Its recent naming as Scottish first book of the year at the Saltire literary awards signals a remarkable and deserved resurrection. Dead things can’t die? Quite so. Dead good things shouldn’t either. • Peter Ross’s The Passion of Harry Bingo: Further Dispatches from Unreported Scotland is published by Sandstone. Goblin is published by Saraband.

Figueroa had moved to London from Gran Canaria, Spain, with his three-year-old daughter and found himself living in damp, cold and mouldy conditions. Eventually, he was evicted and pushed into temporary accommodation for a short stint. These experiences led to years of mental health problems. Wanting to do something active about the housing crisis, Figueroa got involved with different campaign groups across London, but thought they were too locally focused. He wanted to be part of something bigger. He didn’t feel his voice was being heard, and suspected others felt the same. “I was wondering how I could help others,” says Figueroa. “Those who are harder to reach, who have their own problems, who are being left out of the discussion.” A trained musician, Figueroa came up with an answer in 2013: a housing choir. His choir, named Section 21, campaigns about renting conditions in London, but Figueroa says it is a space for everyone, whatever their housing situation. “I myself have experienced homelessness. Poor renting, rogue landlords, homelessness – these things are linked,” he explains. “There is no limitation to who can join our choir. The first goal is to create a sense of community and to start a healing process.” For Figueroa, singing provides a literal release of being able to vent frustrations out loud, even if no one in the housing office is listening. “If you voice your concerns through a choir, everybody gets heard,” he says. “When people use music to campaign, we are in harmony.” Section 21 is not the only housing choir in the country. The choir with no name is a choir for homeless people. Set up in 2008 in London, it has been so successful that there are now two additional branches, in south London and Birmingham. Like Figueroa’s choir, it’s not singing ability that counts, but getting together for a good cause. As well as providing therapeutic relief and a sense of community for participants, Figueroa says singing has proved to be a vital campaigning tool. “Singing makes people more empathetic, and empathy leads to interaction,” he explains. “When we started the pop-up choir in 2013, people would walk past, ask questions and get involved. We created a network of support – and that helps us to build our campaign.” His ultimate aim is to bring relief to people who have been in similar situations to his when he first came to England. “For me this is very personal,” he says. “I was living as a single parent in a place that wasn’t suitable for living in. It was cold, it was mouldy, there was no double glazing, and the landlord decided to evict me suddenly. It was an uncomfortable time.” Figueroa says that anyone thinking about joining his choir is welcome. “I felt I couldn’t change the past, but I could change how I dealt with it,” he says. Now he and the members of his choir want to offer an outlet – and a voice – to other people facing up to bad housing. Want to join the choir?

The way the cards fell at the tournament in Hawaii, Wright knew victory over local wildcard Brisa Hennessy in the last-eight heat would bring her a second world crown. Defeat would have left the door open to challengers Stephanie Gilmore and Carissa Moore. But an early 8.50 score in effect put paid to the hopes of her rivals and the 23-year-old, wearing heavy strapping on her right knee, went on to a seemingly comfortable victory at odds with the pressure she was facing. Wright tore the MCL in her knee just before October’s Champions Tour event in Portugal, but made light of the injury to not only return to competition quickly, but ultimately go on to mirror the success of last year. Afterwards, Wright paid tribute to her coach, Glenn Hall, and the rest of her support crew. “We’ve just had a sick team,” she said. “All through the year, we’ve had little ups and downs. I’ve had the most amazing conversations over the last couple of months with the entire team, from knee injuries to me getting mentally and physically prepared for this. That’s what the last couple of weeks have been about. “Working with Glenn over the last two years has been incredible. We had this long plan and I plan to stick to it. Going back-to-back is true testament to his dedication and the work he puts in non-stop. It takes a team to do this.” Heading into the final event of the season, five women were still in with a shout of overall victory – Wright and her fellow Australians Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons, and Americans Moore and Courtney Conlogue. Fitzgibbons’ dream of a first world title was crushed yet again in a surprise second-round defeat to Hennessy on Thursday, before Conlogue was edged out by Nikki Van Dijk in Friday’s fourth round at Honolua Bay. That left Wright, Gilmore and Moore in the running, but with Wright sitting above the other two women in the World Surf League rankings, all she needed was to see off Hennessy. Wright, who moves into a semi-final against Gilmore, is pursuing just her second tour win this season, to add to victory at the Oi Rio Pro. Ominously for her rivals, she said she did not intend to stop at two world titles, having drawn level with Lynne Boyer of Hawaii and closer to Moore, who has three under her belt. Layne Beachley with seven still remains the benchmark, while Gilmore has six to her name. “I decided in 2015 that I was going to win one every year and I want to hold true to that,” Wright said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/02/wales-south-africa-autumn-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T16:29:28Z","webTitle":"Wales scrape win as Leigh Halfpenny penalty halts South Africa fightback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/02/wales-south-africa-autumn-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/02/wales-south-africa-autumn-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wales scrape win as Leigh Halfpenny penalty halts South Africa fightback","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The last word in the autumn internationals went to Leigh Halfpenny, his penalty settling a reasonably entertaining game between two weakened sides just when South Africa had overturned what was at one stage an 18-point deficit. Halfpenny’s kick would only have been a leveller had Handré Pollard not hit a post after scoring his side’s second try, but Wales could take more out of the game than the Springboks, who often played as if they had been lobotomised. One of the game’s superpowers have become mind-numbingly ordinary, having to battle back from two early sucker punches. For all the virtue of persisting with players based at home to try to contain an exodus to Europe and Japan, their game is already so denuded that what used to be one of the game’s surest foundations now resembles a sandcastle. Their best players are elsewhere, although here the hooker Malcolm Marx was a man-of-the-match contender, forcing turnovers and carrying with purpose. After two years drifting towards the bottom, South Africa have a decision to make before 2019 because the back division they fielded against Wales had no more wit than that paraded by Georgia two weeks before. Wales, who were without 16 players through injury and unavailability, scored two tries in the opening seven minutes that were stunning in their simplicity, born on the training ground by coaches who had noticed how South Africa had defended on this tour with the organisation skills and basic understanding of a struggling second division side. They expected Wales to run after watching their first three matches and were nonplussed when they found their opponents had not kicked an old habit. The first try came from a scrum on halfway. It was a reset after Wales had been pushed off the ball and when the prop Scott Andrews buckled under pressure, Taulupe Faletau got the ball away quickly. When it reached the fly-half Dan Biggar, he chipped across the field for Hallam Amos on the right wing whose opposite number Warrick Gelant had drifted infield. Scott Williams scored the try after Amos drew what there was of the cover defence and three minutes later his midfield Hadleigh Parkes marked his debut with a try after Biggar, following a lineout, had foiled the blitz defence by prodding the ball into space behind with the full-back Andries Coetzee, whose afternoon started awfully and got worse, absent without leave. Coetzee, who under the high ball was as reliable as an umbrella in a hurricane, wasted turnover possession by dithering over whether to run, pass or kick. By the time he made up his mind, Biggar had anticipated the latter and charged the ball down for Faletau to pick up and smartly pass to Parkes for the centre’s second try on the half-hour. Faletau was offside when Biggar made contact with the ball, but the try was not reviewed. The television match official had been called into action 16 minutes before when Marx finished off a driving maul. The ball was on the line when he was pulled to his feet by team-mates, but none of the three TV angles provided for review allowed the official to give a positive answer to the question posed to him by the referee, Jérôme Garcès: try, yes or no? South Africa pulled back to 21-10 at the interval. Pollard’s penalty in between Parkes’s tries was followed by Gelant scoring on his first full appearance. The wing knocked the ball on and Biggar’s kick led to another try after Dillyn Leyds ran out of defence for Jesse Kriel to kick to the line and Gelant to outpace Aled Davies. South Africa had more purpose after the break when the coaches pointed out where they had gone wrong, needing all 15 minutes, and were ahead in 14 minutes. They attacked the gainline and when Pollard scored following a lineout, Kriel gave them the lead after Marx’s flat, at best, cut-out pass gave him space on the left wing. With Biggar off the field with concussion, South Africa should have sealed victory comfortably. Superior up front and on the floor, they just needed an element of control but their replacement backs added nothing and they finished as they had started after Halfpenny’s penalty had restored Wales’s lead, desperately needing direction. Their head coach, Allister Coetzee, mounted a passionate defence of his position, saying that while last year had been a “fiasco”, there had been a marked improvement in 2017 having started over again with players based in the country. Yet nothing depicts South Africa’s decline more than their captain, Eben Etzebeth, who was once counted among the world’s best second rows but has been sapped by the mediocrity of the game in his country. His match ended when, with seconds remaining in the opening half, he was injured throwing an improbable off-load in his 22 – the mighty fallen.

A ninth defeat in 12 Premier League matches, on a day when Stoke City appeared to be there for the taking, leaves Swansea City bottom of the table and prompted their manager to deliver a scathing assessment. It is a wretched run of results at any level and raises serious questions about how much longer Swansea’s owners are willing to tolerate the sight of the club sliding inexorably towards the Championship. Clement expressed his hope that he would be given more time, yet he also gave the impression that he is as fed up as anyone. Stoke were obliging opponents in many ways although Swansea never had enough about them to score again after conceding twice in the space of four chaotic first-half minutes. Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Diouf scored those goals, punishing some abject defending after Wilfried Bony had netted against his former club. “I believe we’ve gone bottom of the table and I can’t say that we’re unlucky,” Clement said. “We’ve lost 10 games now. It’s not been through misfortune. We deserve to be bottom because we’re not consistent enough through a 90-minute period.” Leroy Fer was at fault for Stoke’s first goal, with the midfielder carelessly losing possession 30 yards out, and Clement made the point that the defending was not much better prior to the home team’s second, when Swansea dropped far too deep as Peter Crouch flicked on for Diouf to hammer home. “Then, very characteristic of us at this point, mentally we’re not in a good state, you go down having led and we didn’t play well from that point,” he said. Swansea enjoyed plenty of possession in the second half, but as has been the case throughout the season, it was hard to see them scoring. Bony’s goal – a brilliantly taken first-time volley from Martin Olsson’s cross – was their first since October. It says it all that the closest the visitors came to equalising in the second period was when Jack Butland tipped over a header from Ryan Shawcross, the Stoke defender. “It’s the same thing,” Clement said. “We’re a toothless team. Offensively we’re nowhere near good enough, we don’t create enough, we don’t score enough. That’s our biggest issue.” When it was pointed out to Clement that he had been scathing of his own team, he said: “When I am scathing about my team I am scathing of myself. It is not me pointing the finger and saying: ‘It is his fault’. It is a collective effort. I cannot win without the players. So I am being more self-critical because I have to be better and get more out of this team.” The key question is whether Clement, who had described this game as a Cup final beforehand, will get the opportunity. “Those kind of things are very much out of the hands of the manager or a coach,” he said. “That will always be down to the chairman and the ownership to make those decisions if the situation is going in a really bad direction and you can’t see any chance of changing it. “I believe I can [change it]. I showed last year I am capable of working at this level with 29 points over 19 games. It was a big effort. It is nowhere near as good this season.” For Stoke, who were relieved to pick up their second victory in eight matches, the league table makes for much better reading now that they are up to 13th position. Shaqiri took his goal well following a lovely through ball from midfielder Joe Allen and the dangerous Diouf was close to adding a third when he headed the ball wide in the second half. “It would have been very easy to feel sorry for ourselves [after Bony’s goal],” Mark Hughes, Stoke’s manager, said. “But I didn’t see any evidence of that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/02/chelsea-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T14:37:44Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s Eden Hazard puts paid to Newcastle hopes of a shock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/02/chelsea-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/02/chelsea-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s Eden Hazard puts paid to Newcastle hopes of a shock","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The only problem for Antonio Conte after seeing the irrepressible Eden Hazard provide the latest demonstration of his outstanding ability to win a game with almost no help at all was the knowledge that the Belgian’s brilliance still might not be enough for the champions to retain their title. Not with Manchester City setting new standards at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea played with controlled aggression to stamp out Newcastle United’s attempts at insurrection here, but Conte struck a slightly defeatist tone, lamenting how the team peering down at the rest of the league is doing “extraordinary things” and wondering when that will cease to be the case. Unless that happens, Chelsea can forget about the Premier League trophy staying in west London. They did cut City’s lead to eight points, fighting back from a goal down to ruin Rafael Benítez’s return to one of his old clubs, but there seems little prospect of Pep Guardiola’s freewheeling side slipping up when they host West Ham United on Sunday , and such levels of excellence can be draining for those in pursuit of them. In that context, however, it was still a pleasing afternoon for Conte. “A good performance overall,” he said. “I am very happy for this. It is not simple to go 1-0 down and have the right will and desire.” For Conte, who is likely to be punished by the Football Association for being sent from the touchline in last Wednesday’s tight 1-0 win over Swansea City, it was a chance to stand back and appreciate Hazard’s special talent and, despite falling behind to Dwight Gayle’s early goal, Chelsea were never in any meaningful danger of losing. Hazard scored twice, either side of Álvaro Morata’s 10th goal of the season in all competitions, and the home fans could revel in mocking Benítez long before the final whistle. There was a bit of snarl in the air. Benítez has plenty of history with Chelsea, from those infamous Champions League semi-finals against his Liverpool team to that interim spell here four years ago, and the diehards in the Matthew Harding Stand greeted him with a loud chorus of boos. However, the bigger concern for the Spaniard was his team extending their winless run to six matches. “Every game is so difficult,” he said, disappointed at Newcastle’s failure to build on Gayle’s opener in the 12th minute. The visitors made an ambitious start and the indecision in the Chelsea defence that led to Gayle stroking the ball into an unguarded net could be attributed to Newcastle’s initial exuberance. The striker started the move by flicking on a long punt and Conte must have been alarmed by his side’s failure to react, with N’Golo Kanté too meek in his attempt to mop up and Marcos Alonso making everything worse with an ill-advised backpass. Thibaut Courtois charged out to deny Jacob Murphy but the goalkeeper’s intervention presented Gayle with an easy chance. Gayle had put Newcastle in a similarly commanding position at Old Trafford two weeks ago, only for Manchester United to respond with four unanswered goals, and the hosts made sure that his enterprise went to waste again. “We can change our system,” Conte said. “We can play Hazard as a second striker. We can play him as a No10 when we play 3-4-3. Today, Eden and Álvaro showed a good link.” Conte opted for the 3-5-1-1 system that is designed to coax the best out of Hazard, granting him the freedom to roam from a central position, and it was an arduous task for a Newcastle side that strained to track the forward’s slippery movement. Newcastle’s defending had become worryingly ragged by the time Hazard equalised in the 21st minute. Andreas Christensen sent a looping header against the left post and the team in black and white stripes had not fallen back into shape when César Azpilicueta whipped in another menacing cross. Florian Lejeune stretched to divert the ball away from Morata and Hazard followed up, driving a bouncing shot past Karl Darlow. Chelsea went in front 12 minutes later. Victor Moses, making his first start since suffering a hamstring injury two months ago, laced a cross into the six-yard box from the right and Morata headed home from close range. It was a fine way for Chelsea to respond to adversity and Moses was instrumental in their third goal, earning a penalty thanks to Matt Ritchie’s desperate late tackle. Hazard dinked it down the middle to give his team a precious cushion. Now Chelsea could do with an unlikely favour from West Ham."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/02/david-de-gea-manchester-united-arsenal-onslaught","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T09:59:33Z","webTitle":"David de Gea brings greatness to bear for Manchester United amid Arsenal onslaught | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/02/david-de-gea-manchester-united-arsenal-onslaught","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/02/david-de-gea-manchester-united-arsenal-onslaught","fields":{"headline":"David de Gea brings greatness to bear for United to repel Arsenal onslaught","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"How did Arsenal not win this match?

For an hour at the Emirates, as Arsenal surged back from the indignity of conceding a 2-0 deficit, De Gea was a one-man spider’s web, leaping and tumbling and spreading his limbs with startling grace and agility to keep Arsenal at bay. Most notably there was a mind-boggling double-save 11 minutes into the second half, De Gea plunging with whip-crack speed to get a hand to Alexandre Lacazette’s low shot, then leaping up to deflect Alexis Sánchez’s follow-up over the bar. This was goalkeeping that seemed to bend the normal physical rules, that defied any sense of reasonable cause and effect. As De Gea ambled off to retrieve the ball Arsenal’s players looked genuinely pained not to have scored, ready to appeal, fruitlessly, to the referee, or the fourth official, or God. Except at the Emirates God was wearing a turquoise shirt and playing in goal for the visitors. With United 2-0 up early on, there was a brilliant first-half save from Lacazette that almost got lost in the scramble, De Gea showing bravery and outstanding reflexes to deflect the ball up on to the bar from point-blank range. Shortly afterwards he produced something just as hair-raising. Romelu Lukaku, defending in extremis at the back post, propelled the ball towards his own goal off a shin. De Gea leapt, adjusted in mid air and clawed it away with the spatial awareness of an Olympic diver. Afterwards Arsène Wenger mused on fairness in football, but was honest enough to put the blame for defeat on his own players’ lack of ruthlessness. Plus, of course, goalkeepers have always been the most deceptive of random elements in football. A good or bad goalkeeper skews and remakes the narrative, just as here De Gea’s brilliance helped turn a dominant performance from Arsenal into a home team picked off with surgical brilliance on the break. Make no mistake, this was a tide that for long periods seemed to surge only one way. Arsenal made 562 passes to United’s 147. Arsenal had 12 corners to United’s one, 75% of possession, and 33 shots to United’s eight. Running under all this like a constant riff, De Gea made 14 saves across 90 minutes. It is hard to remember a routine one. Some were almost throwaway moments of brilliance, an everyday plunge down to palm away, a bog-standard last-ditch block with the legs. De Gea has an endearing habit after each save of simply standing up and mooching off back into position, while lesser goalkeepers might be up on their feet punching the air, roaring with triumph, high-fiving the nearest team‑mate. But then he plays so well so often that the idea of goalkeepers altering the way a game should or would have gone starts to fall apart. Goalkeepers are, after all, part of the team too, in many ways the most important bit. Every great team tends to have a great goalie. As do some almost-there teams, like this evolving Mourinho United, who were also thrillingly decisive in attack when the moments came. It was that kind of game. For the opening 10 minutes United were brutally efficient in taking a 2-0 lead. For an hour they were reliant on the maniac in the gloves to keep Arsenal to just the one in reply from Lacazette. Finally United were dogged and depleted, Paul Pogba having capped an otherwise fine performance by getting himself sent off for a stamp on Héctor Bellerín. For all that, the opening goal arrived with disarming ease as Arsenal’s defence collapsed at the first hint of pressure like a fine-milled wafer biscuit dunked in a mug of boiling tea. Pogba gave the scoring pass, but the author of the goal was Laurent Koscielny, whose horrible cross-field waft was intercepted by Antonio Valencia. Pogba paused, drew three defenders and played a perfect little back-spun nudge to Valencia. His low shot went through first Nacho Monreal’s legs and then those of Petr Cech for a double Ecuadorian nutmeg – always a popular thing at this time of year in the coffee chains of north London. Seven minutes later Jesse Lingard added a second, helped by Anthony Martial’s wonderful reverse pass. In the second half there was another for Lingard after a fine break. In between it was over to De Gea who just kept plunging and grasping and clawing away, always with a bit of a shrug, producing in the process surely one of the great Premier League goalkeeping performances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/30/trump-tweet-anti-muslim-far-right-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T22:52:07Z","webTitle":"Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos to 'elevate the conversation', White House claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/trump-tweet-anti-muslim-far-right-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/trump-tweet-anti-muslim-far-right-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos to 'elevate the conversation', White House claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House has claimed that Donald Trump was trying to “elevate the conversation” by sharing anti-Muslim videos from a British far-right group. But the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, acknowledged that she does not believe the US president was aware of the identity of Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First who first posted the films. Trump sparked international uproar on Wednesday when he retweeted three inflammatory videos purporting to show violence being committed by Muslims. Their authenticity has been strongly challenged. Asked if he was aware of the risk of elevating fringe rightwing groups, Sanders told reporters: “Look, I think what he’s done is elevate the conversation to talk about a real issue and a real threat, and that’s extreme violence and extreme terrorism, something that we know to be very real, and something the president feels strongly about, talking about, and bringing up and making sure is an issue every single day, that we’re looking at the best ways to protect Americans.” The spokeswoman was challenged over whether Trump knows who Fransen is. “No, I don’t believe so,” she admitted. “But again, I think he knew what the issues are, and that is that we have a real threat of extreme violence terrorism and violence, not just in this country but across the globe, particularly in Europe and that was the point he was making, and I don’t really have much to add beyond that.” The descriptions of the posts by Fransen read: “VIDEO: Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” and “VIDEO: Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” and “VIDEO: Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” Questioned over whether Trump watches many such videos, Sanders said only: “I’m not sure of every single video the president has viewed.” Sanders and other White House officials have staunchly defended the president’s retweeting of the videos and suggested that their veracity is not a high priority. They declined to comment on his tweeted criticism of Theresa May after she said he was “wrong” to have done it. The press secretary added at Thursday’s press briefing: “I think the president feels that bringing up important issues of our time like extreme violence and terrorism are important to do. That’s what he was doing in that process, and I think he’s going to continue to do that in a number of venues, whether it’s through speeches, whether it’s through Twitter or other social media platforms.” The stance puts Washington directly at odds with its old ally in an extraordinary public rift that prompted an emergency debate in parliament. Politicians ranging from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to Nigel Farage, the former head of Ukip and a Trump cheerleader, have condemned the retweets. Many have called for the invitation of a state visit to be formally withdrawn, and for the government to demand that Trump take down the retweets. On Thursday the White House did not respond to calls, text messages or emails asking whether such a request had been made, or whether Trump would consider it. Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, and his counterpart Woody Johnson, appointed US ambassador to the UK by Trump, said they had raised concerns about Trump’s retweets with the White House. Responding to a flood of critical responses to a callout he had started on Twitter, Johnson said: “Thank you for your questions and feedback. I have relayed your concerns to Washington. The US and UK have a long history of speaking frankly with each other, as all close friends do. Our relationship is strong, vital and enduring.” A typical response to the ambassador’s hashtag was: “I’d like to #askwoody why his president is promoting fascism and hatred in my country and if he thinks this is acceptable.” Sir Christopher Meyer, the former British ambassador to the US, praised May’s handling of the situation so far. “I think she’s actually judged her reaction to Trump’s extraordinary and horrible behaviour just the right way,” he told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme. “She’s emphasised the importance of the relationship with the United States, as she should have done, and she has publicly rebuked the president for retweeting as he retweeted. “I can’t remember, in my entire life, let alone my entire career, ever a British prime minister publicly rebuking an American president for misbehavior.” Sanders also announced that Trump will deliver his first State of the Union address on 30 January next year, and that the president will donate his third quarter salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to assist in the response to the opioid epidemic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/30/nathan-redmond-defends-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T20:51:40Z","webTitle":"Nathan Redmond defends Manchester City’s Guardiola over pep talk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/30/nathan-redmond-defends-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/30/nathan-redmond-defends-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton","fields":{"headline":"Nathan Redmond defends Manchester City’s Guardiola over pep talk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nathan Redmond has defended Pep Guardiola following their on-field altercation at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. The Southampton winger was confronted by the Manchester City manager immediately after City’s 2-1 win. Redmond issued a statement on Twitter in response to growing media speculation, confirming “nothing negative or offensive was said”. “[Guardiola] commented on my qualities as a young English player and how we wanted me to attack his team more during the game, in a similar way to last season,” Redmond said. The 23-year-old scored the opening goal in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad in October 2016. “I told him I was doing what my manager had asked me to do in the game. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. Nothing negative or offensive was said towards me from Pep and that’s what makes him one of the best managers in world football.” Redmond posted the statement in response to an article published on the Sun’s website, which featured a lip reader claiming Guardiola had called Redmond a “wanker” and had accused him of “taking me for a mug”. A Manchester City spokesperson disputed the lip reader’s claims. “I want to make it absolutely clear Pep Guardiola did not say what the Sun is falsely claiming in this story,” Redmond said. “Yes he was very passionate, intense and aggressive but he was only very complimentary and positive to me. “Losing the game the way we did in the last kick of the game after working so hard for 90-plus minutes, I was very disappointed. But when one of the world’s best managers compliments you or gives advice in any way, you listen.” Redmond’s comments support Guardiola’s version of events, with the manager insisting he had not been critical of Redmond in their animated conversation. “[I told him] how good a player he is,” Guardiola said. “Last season he destroyed us here. I didn’t know him last season, I realised how good he is.” Guardiola admitted frustration that Southampton “didn’t want to play” and “were time wasting from the ninth minute”. Mauricio Pellegrino’s side looked set to earn a point after Oriel Romeu’s equaliser, before Raheem Sterling struck a dramatic winner in the 96th minute."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-bullies-never-respect-sycophants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T20:16:42Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Donald Trump: bullies never respect sycophants | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-bullies-never-respect-sycophants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-bullies-never-respect-sycophants","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Donald Trump: bullies never respect sycophants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"All relationships have boundaries. Those between nations can be particularly fraught, freighted with ties forged in history and culture. In diplomacy the manners, customs and morals of others need to be acknowledged and respected. But humanity begins with acts, not just with thoughts. The question is how to deal with a man like Donald Trump, a taunting braggart with a weakness for flattery? The stakes are high: when nations fall out, people get hurt. By using social media as a flame-thrower, Mr Trump uses words as weapons. He does not care who gets burned. In retweeting anti-Muslim video clips promoted by a leader of a far-right fringe group in Britain and then rounding on the prime minister for reproaching him, Mr Trump proves again that he panders to bigots and is no friend of this country. This is an important – and dangerous – moment for Britain as it launches itself into the choppy waters of Brexit. The vain hope of politicians who pushed for this nation’s exit from the European Union was that we could hitch ourselves to the United States. True, the US is Britain’s most important partner on the global stage. As nations we have a sense of shared values and a long history together. Both have worked to uphold the international rules-based system. After the end of the cold war it was a partnership, along with others, that guaranteed a short period of relative peace. What was not taken sufficiently into account was that this was not only a physical equilibrium but also a moral one. Mr Trump has few morals. He is a thuggish narcissist who is no respecter of Britain’s national security and wellbeing. After the London Bridge attack in June, he went after the capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, for urging, quite reasonably, calm. He attacked Scotland Yard, in September, for not being “proactive” after a terrorist bomb failed to detonate in London. Then, as now, Theresa May rebuked the US president. It was the right thing to do. The prime minister should go further and withdraw the invitation for a state visit. Bullies never respect sycophants. Britain should not allow Mr Trump’s racism to be dressed up in pageantry. Mr Trump’s strategy is to stoke a climate of paranoia, both at home and abroad. He seeks advantage in the politics of division and hate. He operates by instinct rather than sober analysis. The truth is that Mr Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of democracy. Nor does he care for the decency necessary to sustain citizenship. Democracy cannot survive without letting reasonable debate bring the truth to light. Instead Mr Trump appears to have nothing but contempt for our intelligence. For the US president the show is all about one man. His secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, looks set to be replaced by a cheerleader for Trumpism. Mr Tillerson’s error was to realise what everyone suspects: his boss was, in his own reported words, a “moron”. As a former British prime minister wisely noted, “nations have no permanent friends or allies, they only have permanent interests”. Britain must have a relationship with the United States, just as we have relationships with unsavoury regimes which are tempered by the understanding that we do not share their scruples. Our own foolishness means that we are no longer useful as a bridge to Europe. The longer Mr Trump is in office, the more America’s folkways will become unfamiliar to Britain. Like all relationships, Britain and America’s will experience rocky times. We are living through one of them. With Mr Trump in the White House the US has become flighty when it comes to “special” relationships, heaping praise on America’s adversaries and downgrading ties with allies. To be credible our bond needs to be grounded in self-respect. Speaking the truth may be difficult, but that is what friends are for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-threats-to-the-media-man-bites-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T20:09:25Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on threats to the media: man bites watchdog | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-threats-to-the-media-man-bites-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/the-guardian-view-on-threats-to-the-media-man-bites-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on threats to the media: man bites watchdog","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“News is what someone wants suppressed; all the rest is advertising.” That maxim is overly reductive – would a medical breakthrough make the cut? – but captures an essential truth. The instinct to share information has always been matched by the instinct to prevent its spread. Andrew Pettegree’s history The Invention of News demonstrates how the sphere evolved over centuries and yet how many current issues are recognisable in its early days: from the blunt use of force by the powerful to the state’s deployment of propaganda dressed up as news and the crude pursuit of business interests. So the pressures on news are hardly new – but they shrink or swell, and at times these swirling forces can amass to become a perfect storm. A new study says that media freedom around the world has fallen to the lowest level for at least a decade. The report by the freedom of expression campaign group Article 19, working with V-Dem, a political and social database, shows that diversity and independence is under growing threat in democracies such as Brazil and Hungary as well as authoritarian regimes such as China. “Turkish media is under immense pressure from the government, more than at any point in history,” one veteran correspondent told the Guardian. Frequently – as in Turkey, or indeed Cambodia or Poland – this tightening is part of a broader turn towards repression. The problem is not only one of the state. Governments, officials, organised crime and other powerful interests employ measures ranging from libel suits and commercial ruses through to harsh laws and violence. When Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta, was killed by a car bomb in October it made headlines worldwide. But her case is exceptional for its geography rather than its brutality. Unesco says that on average a journalist is killed every five days for bringing information to the public. New technologies have allowed digital surveillance and brought harassment through social media – sometimes fuelled by political leaders denigrating journalists. If anyone doubts how toxic the atmosphere can become even in a country guaranteeing freedom of the press in its constitution, Walmart’s website has just removed a T-shirt (offered by a third party seller) reading “Rope. Tree. Journalist. SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED”. There are other challenges too. In the US there is concern that the rightwing billionaire Koch brothers have agreed to put $650m into Meredith Corp’s purchase of Time. They have a record of huge donations to libertarian causes and groups denying climate change, and of attacking unions and workers’ rights. Meanwhile, the growth of the internet has increased competition – not only from new media organisations, but through the expansion of advocacy or plain propaganda masquerading as journalism. And Russia and China are pumping money into the global expansion of state media, promoting government messages or simply casting doubt on reports in western media. These attempts are – like other challenges – a kind of compliment, however unwelcome. They testify to the impact and necessity of journalism: the powerful will always seek to control the spread of inconvenient information. Defending the freedom of the press and its role in upholding the public interest is more essential than before. This will require renewed commitment and inventiveness, and not only in harnessing new technology. Collaboration with other media outlets can be a source of strength – as when 96 partners, including the Guardian, revealed the secrets of the global elite’s hidden wealth in reporting on the Paradise Papers. But a still greater source is the support of audiences, and their demand for honest, accurate reporting. Fighting off challenges is not enough. The media must keep reminding people why it counts to win the trust and commitment of readers and viewers and thereby maintain its freedom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/30/theresa-mays-week-is-strictly-business-and-cheering-on-debbie-mcgee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T22:00:25Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's week is strictly business - and cheering on Debbie McGee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/30/theresa-mays-week-is-strictly-business-and-cheering-on-debbie-mcgee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/30/theresa-mays-week-is-strictly-business-and-cheering-on-debbie-mcgee","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's week is strictly business - and cheering on Debbie McGee","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has enjoyed a tricky few days during her Middle East trip, facing questions about Donald Trump’s apparent endorsement of a British far-right group while trying to outline a post-Brexit UK policy for the region. But the prime minister has suggested she at least has something to look forward to this weekend – the latest Strictly Come Dancing. Speaking to reporters on the trip, May said she was not only a big fan of the BBC1 Saturday evening dance competition, but also has been cheering on contestant Debbie McGee. The broadcaster best known as magician’s assistant to her late husband, Paul Daniels, lives in the prime minister’s Maidenhead constituency. May revealed the information when asked whether she had been watching the other much-talked about reality show, ITV’s I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, which this year stars Stanley Johnson, the father of May’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the former Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale. May replied: “I have to confess that with one or two other things on my mind I haven’t actually been watching I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here. “What I have been watching, when I can, is cheering on my constituent Debbie McGee in Strictly Come Dancing. She’s doing very well. “She’s very good, Alexandra Burke is also very good. But one or two of the men seem to be quite dark horses, so it’s a good quality competition this year.” McGee and Burke, the X-Factor winning singer, have both wowed the judges with their dancing. On Saturday they will be taking part in a musical theatre-themed episode, among the final six celebrity dancers hoping to go through to the quarter finals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricky-gervais-advice-quit-job-moment-that-changed-me-tefl","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T08:00:37Z","webTitle":"A moment that changed me: when I took Ricky Gervais’s advice and quit my job | Andrew Hankinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricky-gervais-advice-quit-job-moment-that-changed-me-tefl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricky-gervais-advice-quit-job-moment-that-changed-me-tefl","fields":{"headline":"A moment that changed me: when I took Ricky Gervais’s advice and quit my job","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s June 2003 and I’m at the post office, about to send an envelope to South Korea. The postage is £4.06. Inside is my degree certificate. I am on the verge of diverting my life from being a bit crap to being possibly not crap, inspired by a friend and a Ricky Gervais quote. The state of my life was my own fault. I’d been a goody-goody child: never naughty; always trying to answer questions; always polite (sometimes weirdly so). But amid some family chaos and teenage bullying, I decided to be crap: crap in lessons, crap in exams. I pretended it was funny. Only teachers noticed. Nobody else cared. Luckily I got into a university that accepted crap grades. I did a computing and business degree. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I met people from private school, but still didn’t realise life was a competition, that there were people around the country who were trying to be good rather than crap. I thought I was clever enough for it not to matter. At the end of my first year a friend from Hampshire suggested we go to Australia. I remember being surprised. Can people really do that? In the summer I got a day job and a night job. I saved up. A few of us spent a month in Australia among new pubs, tanned Brits and imported Boddingtons. Wow, I thought. During a placement year I saved again and went to South Africa with a different friend. He got me into Talib Kweli’s music and rugby. I’d always said rugby was shit. I’d never watched it. In my final year I wrote my dissertation – “Managing a network-wide desktop upgrade: The Problems encountered by GlaxoSmithKline and how to remedy them” – and moved back to my mum’s house in Newcastle. A letter told me I’d got a 2:2. I don’t regret the fun and the drinking, but I regret the consequences. My call centre awaited. I worked for a company that provided telephone support to BT customers with computer problems. There were hardly any calls. On late shifts I’d read books. I remember watching the invasion of Iraq on my game console between taking calls from people whose printers weren’t working. I’d spent years expanding my world and now it was contracting. You know those people who are vibrant regardless of their situation? That’s not me. I’m only as interesting as the last trip I went on; only as confident as the number on the weighing scales. So having to tell people I worked in a call centre … Maybe you’re better than me. My friend saved me: a Manc called Jon Sealey. We met at university. We were in Australia together. I think he’d also been surprised at the thought we could go to Australia. After graduating he got an office job. He hated it. So one lunchtime he walked to a travel shop and bought a ticket to Hong Kong. Then he went back to the office and printed out his notice. He went to Asia and ended up teaching in Daegu, South Korea. My second saviour was Ricky Gervais. We used to quote The Office at work. All these characters not living the life they want to lead. Will Tim quit? Will Dawn? It was inspiring. I had a Ricky Gervais quote on my computer screen. I can’t find it now, but it was something about not spending your whole life doing a job you hate then retiring with a pat on the back. That quote made my heart hurt. What was I doing? So I emailed the language school where Jon was teaching, just a few classrooms above some shops, and they said I could teach there. I put my degree certificate in a brown envelope and took it to a post office in Newcastle. My dad had recently had a stroke and that was part of it: fuck it, you get one life. The school sent me a plane ticket. I left on 12 June 2003. In Daegu, Mr Lee picked me up at the airport and took me to the school. I met up with Jon. We went straight out and drank soju and ate live octopus – they said to swallow it quickly or it’ll suck on to your throat. We saw American soldiers who left the bars at curfew. We became friends with Koreans who headbanged to Rage Against the Machine then line-danced to Korean pop. They didn’t care about the UK. They’d never heard of Newcastle. I was free from the prescriptive life of back home: save for a mortgage, get a mortgage, pay off your mortgage, die. I’m facing the consequences of that now, but I don’t regret it. I enjoyed writing emails to my sister. She said they made her laugh. I read autobiographies by Andrew Neil, Toby Young and Martin Amis. I wanted to be a writer. Why hadn’t I tried? So I tried. These days I have to stop myself boring on at people in their 20s. When they mutter about hating their job but sticking with it for the money, I think of the friends I’ve seen drift into middle age without figuring out what they want to do with their lives. Dreams become regrets. But when you’re young, you can do it: just quit, get on a plane and get out of your life. You figure it out once you’ve gone. • Andrew Hankinson is a feature writer and author of You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/01/morning-mail-dutton-takes-aim-at-union-super","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T19:53:53Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Dutton takes aim at union super","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/morning-mail-dutton-takes-aim-at-union-super","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/morning-mail-dutton-takes-aim-at-union-super","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Dutton takes aim at union super","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 1 December. Top stories Peter Dutton says the Coalition’s U-turn on holding a royal commission into the banking sector has provided a golden opportunity to investigate unions’ links to industry superannuation funds. The commission was regrettable, Dutton said, but “hopefully for some people they can present their cases and there can be some closure around what’s been a difficult situation. There’s also another element to it – that is, to have a look at some aspects within the industry super funds which have union members and whatnot on the board.” The senior minister in the Turnbull government said: “I think people lose a lot of their super through fees and through donations and all sorts of support for unions. So I think it’s a good opportunity in that sense to have a look at the detail and people can put all of that information forward and we can see the recommendations from the commission.” The Industry Super Australia chief executive, David Whitely, said Dutton’s comments about industry super funds were “deeply surprising” but he would welcome the scrutiny. The Australian Bankers’ Association says the commission is “unwarranted” and fails to recognise that Australia’s banks are now undergoing “the largest reform program in decades”. In a comment piece on the royal commission Martin Farrer writes that it won’t improve competition, and could lead to costlier mortgages, but may still expose systemic problems. The British prime minister, Theresa May, has said she is not afraid to criticise Donald Trump, as tensions escalated between the two world leaders over Trump’s rogue and dangerous tweeting. Speaking in Amman, Jordan, on the final stop of a tour of the Middle East, May said she was “very clear” that Trump’s retweeting racist images from a far-right British group was “the wrong thing to do”, but stressed the importance of the special relationship between the US and the UK. Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, confirmed on Thursday that he had personally raised the issue of the tweets with the White House. As opposition continues to grow to Trump’s state visit to Britain, privately, ministers do not expect the visit will take place any time soon, as there are serious concerns about the possibility of widespread protests. Read Martin Kettle’s analysis of the standoff here, and why he thinks Britain should demand an apology from America and cancel Trump’s visit. The White House is reportedly planning to replace secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, with the current CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, within weeks, but it is unclear at this stage whether Donald Trump has signed off on the switch-up. Asked if he wanted Tillerson to stay on on Thursday, Trump said: “He’s here. Rex is here.” Tillerson’s departure would end a troubled tenure for the former ExxonMobil chief executive, who has found himself increasingly at odds with the president over policy challenges such as North Korea and under fire for his planned cuts at the state department. In October Tillerson was reported to have called Trump a “moron” – a claim he has not denied, and Trump responded by challenging his secretary of state to an IQ test. Decades of unsustainable logging could trigger an ecosystem-wide collapse in Victoria’s central highlands within 50 years without urgent intervention from the state government, ecologists have warned. According to modelling produced by Australian National University, there is a 92% chance the mountain ash forests will not be able to support its current ecosystem of arboreal animals, such as the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum, by 2067. If current logging practices continue, or if the forests experience another Black Saturday-level bushfire, the likelihood of collapse approaches 100%. Guardian Australia understands it is one of the top three issues the premier, Daniel Andrews, wants resolved before the 2018 state election. A major EU investigation has found that one of Europe’s largest brewers may have been charging Belgians more for their beer than people in other countries for years. AB InBev, the world’s biggest brewing company, has been accused of charging less for its popular Jupiler and Leffe beers in France and the Netherlands than in Belgium, and using its dominant position in the Belgian market to get away with it. For Belgians, where beer is one of the few unifying cultural artefacts of its multilingual society, the finding is particularly galling.

Thinking time Is the Australian white ibis the Donald Trump of Guardian Australia’s bird of the year poll? Ben Raue certainly thinks he might be. “The results so far of the Guardian’s bird of the year poll have not been without controversy,” he writes. “The Australian white ibis, a bird that is disliked by many who encounter it, took an early lead and has maintained that lead for more than a week. Raue credits the bin chicken’s success to the first-past-the-post voting method – everyone gets one vote, and the candidate with the highest vote wins.

The transfer was conducted by absolute force and, as always, the Australian government denies the truth and has declared it a ‘voluntary and peaceful’ transfer,” writes the Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani in his latest dispatch from Manus Island. “Conversely, what we experienced – and what the huge volume of footage and photos distributed in the news and social media reveal – is something different from the government’s claim.” Lou Chamberlin has been photographing street art in Melbourne for more than a decade, and offered to take the Guardian for a stroll through a few of her favourites. The title of her new book, Burn City, plays off the term “burners”, which some street artists use to describes a work so vivid or hot that it burns off the wall. From local artists including Rone, Adnate and 23rd Key, to big international names such as Austria’s Nychos and London’s Fin DAC, Chamberlin has a fondness for them all. What’s he done now?

Nonetheless, the search operation for the ARA San Juan would continue in waters of up to 500 metres deep, he added. “Despite the magnitude of the effort made it has not been possible to locate the submarine,” said Balbi, referring to the multinational response that has included US, British and Russian aircraft, ships and personnel. The submarine had 44 people on board. Luis Tagliapietra, whose son Damián was a 27-year-old trainee on the submarine, told the TN news channel: “This is perverse and impossible to understand. They’re playing word games,” referring to the navy announcing it was calling off rescue efforts while agreeing to continue searching for the submarine as long as it is not in too deep waters. “What they are really saying is that they’re not going to be looking for it any more.” The San Juan went missing on 15 November when it lost radio contact with the naval base in Mar del Plata, but it was not until two days later that the navy announced publicly that the submarine had gone missing. “More than double the number of days than it would have been possible to rescue the crew have passed,” Balbi told reporters. The huge sea and air rescue effort for the German-built submarine will now be reduced to trying to locate the vessel itself. Relatives of the crew had already abandoned hope that they would be found alive. “They lied to us from the start,” Tagliapietra said to the Guardian. “We don’t know what happened and it’s impossible to tell the truth from fabrication.” Relatives of the crew are bitter at the amount of misleading misinformation they received from the government in an apparent attempt to keep their hopes alive in the first few days after the submarine disappeared. These included a tweet by the defence minister, Oscar Aguad, three days after the submarine went missing saying that seven satellite phone call attempts from the ARA San Juan had been picked up by navy listening posts, a report that later turned out to be false. Relatives had already started abandoning hope one week ago when the navy announced it had received information from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation, an international body based in Vienna that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret nuclear blasts. The agency said on 23 November that it had detected an unusual signal near where the submarine went missing on 15 November that seemed to be a “non-nuclear” explosion. The long delay in the announcement, which came a full week after the reported blast occurred, surprised relatives. “I’ve started legal proceedings in the name of my son to find out what happened,” said Tagliapietra, speaking from the coastal town of Caleta Olivia in southern Argentina where he had travelled on Wednesday to speak to the judge in charge of investigating why the submarine disappeared. “I’m a lawyer and I’m acting in my son’s name, but seven other families of crew members have already asked me to represent them,” Tagliapietra said. He is particularly angry about the navy withholding information that was later revealed by the press, showing that shortly before it lost contact the submarine warned naval commanders that water had entered through its snorkel and had got into its batteries. “Why did the navy keep this a secret?” Tagliapietra asked. “Why was this turned into a secret of state? What does it matter reporting that a submarine had a problem? What does it change?” Other relatives blamed the government for the delay between the submarine going missing and when the military made the news public two days later. “If they had made it public as soon as they lost communication, rescue efforts could have started two days sooner,” said Tagliapietra. Other relatives questioned the wisdom of sending a 34-year-old submarine to make the 3,000km trip from the southern naval base of Ushuaia to Mar del Plata in the north. “I don’t think such an old submarine was ready to do such a long voyage,” said María Itatí Leguizamón, whose husband was on board. Leguizamón had already given up hope her husband could be found alive before the navy’s announcement on Thursday. “My husband was very religious and I had a funeral mass said for him last weekend,” Leguizamón told the Guardian. “There was an explosion, that’s a fact we have to face and the only answer I have is that they all died. Faith isn’t hanging on to something impossible, faith is believing in an afterlife.” This article was amended on 1 December 2017 to correct the spelling of Luis Tagliapietra’s surname."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/30/chronicling-homelessness-newsletter-outside-in-america","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T23:44:26Z","webTitle":"Chronicling homelessness: the photographer living on streets all over the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/chronicling-homelessness-newsletter-outside-in-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/chronicling-homelessness-newsletter-outside-in-america","fields":{"headline":"Chronicling homelessness: the photographer living on streets all over the world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ed Gold, a British photographer, is currently living in central Australia, in an Aboriginal community amid an expanse of heat-baked red earth and whirls of waving grass. But he is not spending much time photographing: instead he is keeping himself afloat by refueling cars and planes and working in a store. Despite having had numerous series published by the BBC on subjects ranging from the Afghan war to a day in the life of a Polish nurse, Gold, 48, is homeless and, much of the time, penniless. He has lived on the streets while working on shoots in Alaska, Vancouver and Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off British Columbia. When he’s back in the UK, he sleeps in doorways or in tents pitched behind his motorbike. The brutal economic realities of photojournalism leave him “in a situation where I’m poverty-stricken, but I’m not going to give up”, he said by phone recently. As employers increasingly offer temporary contracts and minimal benefits instead of traditional full-time roles, the security of many occupations has been eroded. Labor experts define such jobs as “precarious employment”. Adjunct teaching positions are a prime example, as we revealed recently. Facing shrinking newsroom budgets and the devaluing of their profession, photojournalists like Gold are also confronted by difficulties. He knows he can’t go on like this forever. He has a heart murmur and says he’s almost a decade overdue for a heart valve replacement. “I’m already starting to feel the symptoms of it, which is increased tiredness” and severe double vision, he said. Sometimes mere subsistence is a struggle. “I never eat properly,” he said. Yet Gold thinks in grander terms. “How many other people are doing this?” he said. “I’m giving people a voice who don’t normally have a voice, and that’s what’s the most important thing to me.” Follow me on Twitter for our latest stories: @alastairgee.

He ventured into the storm-drain tunnels beneath the city and met some of the 300 homeless people estimated to be living there, in the silent darkness. Sambamurthy was told a moving story that never made it into the film we ran recently. When the horrific mass shooting that claimed 58 lives near the Mandalay Bay hotel began, a Swat team went to an entrance to the tunnels. “They were just yelling: ‘Get up, get out or you’re gonna die,’” a man named Joel said. He and others were brought out into the daylight. It was like an “apocalypse”, he said. Another tunnel-dweller, Dan, was aboveground when the shooting started, and heard gunfire. “It was like it wasn’t even Vegas at that moment,” he said. Although the streets were blockaded, he managed to get back home – he knew a secret route, he said. “If you know the tunnel system, you can get around wherever you want to get to,” he confided.

As we’ve written, conditions on Skid Row in Los Angeles are some kind of nadir: at night there are only nine toilets for almost 2,000 people sleeping on the street. There, at least, a small shift is on the horizon. On Monday, the Skid Row Community Improvement Coalition is unveiling a cheery, temporary hygiene center with toilets and showers. Initially, it will only be open during the daytime, but in the near future it plans to expand to nights. “There is no negotiation when it comes to basic needs,” said an activist who is known in the community as Louise Mbella “Sinai” (Frenchy). “People may say: ‘Oh, this hygiene center will bring more homeless.’ Well, it doesn’t matter whether there are homeless or no homeless – it is our duty as a society to provide clean public toilets and showers to those who do not even have a roof over their head.

The 19-year-old student, who asked not to be named, said she was stopped in a north London McDonald’s by a security guard who repeatedly told her to remove her hijab on Thursday evening. When she refused, she said the guard appeared shocked but continued to ask, so she decided to film the incident on her phone. A friend later uploaded it to Twitter on her behalf. In the video, the woman, who is a British Muslim of Middle Eastern descent, asks the guard why she cannot come into the McDonald’s. He responds: “It’s just a matter of taking it off.” “It’s not just a matter of taking it off. I wear this for religious reasons and I’m not ashamed of it, and I will stand in line and I will get the food I want, because this isn’t OK,” she replies. A member of the public intervenes to tell the security guard he cannot ask the woman to remove her hijab, to which he responds: “It’s none of your business.” When the woman says “this is fucking ridiculous”, a member of staff replies “don’t be rude” and tells her to stop filming. She refuses. She is then told she will be served but says: “I don’t want want anything any more.”The student told the Guardian: “I thought: ‘It’s finally happening to me,’ like it has to so many hijabis. It didn’t feel real because I had seen so many videos like this and it was finally happening to me in real life. I was in so much disbelief. “The friend I was with was shocked and scared, and said it was a risky situation. When it was over, I finally realised how these situations can become dangerous. This is not a one-off thing. “I will never walk into a McDonald’s again,” she added. A spokeswoman for McDonald’s said the chain “does not have a policy in place which restricts or prevents anyone wearing a hijab, or any other religious dress, from entering” one of its restaurants. She said: “We welcome customers of all faiths and would like to apologise to the customer as this situation should not have taken place. We are taking this matter extremely seriously and are addressing this with the individuals involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/dec/13/im-a-safe-pair-of-ears-life-lessons-from-an-86-year-old-business-mentor","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T07:30:13Z","webTitle":"'I'm a safe pair of ears': life lessons from an 86-year-old business mentor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/dec/13/im-a-safe-pair-of-ears-life-lessons-from-an-86-year-old-business-mentor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/dec/13/im-a-safe-pair-of-ears-life-lessons-from-an-86-year-old-business-mentor","fields":{"headline":"'I'm a safe pair of ears': life lessons from an 86-year-old business mentor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Business people come to me and talk about the issues they’ve got – and it doesn’t stop with someone trying to acquire their company or a technical director they want to fire. It can be about very personal or family problems, like they’re married and having an affair. I’d never turn somebody away if they want to talk because I’m a safe pair of ears. I call myself a professional listener. For the past 25 years, I’ve mentored chief executives (CEOs) and managing directors as a chair of Vistage, a leadership development group for small- and medium-sized businesses. About 80% of the issues that CEOs want to discuss relate to managing people. One of the issues for a business leader these days is that the higher up you go, the fewer people there are to talk to. There’s this sense of isolation, and that demands emotional stamina. You can’t imagine the relief some of them have, just being able to talk about their business in a safe environment with people with no hidden agenda. I began my working life in aircraft manufacturing, went on to run my own business and later became a management consultant. When I started out the business world was very authoritarian and finger wagging, with the boss giving orders. A leader today is more likely to say: “What help do you want from me in order to achieve higher performance?” Than: “You need to do better, or you’re out.” My advice to entrepreneurs is to join a peer group and continue to learn, because you don’t know everything. Leadership is about being as open and transparent as possible and recognising your own weaknesses. Make sure the people you’ve got around you are better at the job than you are. Don’t ever view talent as a threat – it’s important to have the very best people in your business. A few years ago I realised my eyesight was deteriorating and that I could no longer drive to group meetings. I was very nervous about it and when I told the group they instantly said: “We’ll come to you.” My mentees drive to my home and one of the members drives me to meetings. The fact that they were kind enough to want to do that was wonderful. As you get older it’s important to keep the brain as active as possible. Whenever anyone asks me about retirement I think of a dear friend of mine who was running two business groups at the age of 93. He said: “I’m going to continue until they have to carry me out on the flipchart.” It’s a line I’m using. If anyone said you must retire tomorrow I wouldn’t cope with it. My wife is still working and she’s over retirement age too. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like sitting in the house all day (with the dog admittedly, but the conversations would be a bit one-sided). I bless the day I started working as a mentor.

While most media attention has been on the transatlantic spat between the US president and UK prime minister Theresa May over Trump’s posting of three virulent videos on his Twitter feed, behind the scenes a different kind of fallout was unfolding – that could in the long run be even more significant. Trump’s retweets spawned a rash of Islamophobic comment on social media that is helping to disseminate hate speech and fuel the growing confidence of the far right. The pattern was set by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First, whose tweets containing incendiary videos purporting to show acts of Muslim violence and intolerance were picked up by Trump and reposted. She initially responded to his supportive action with incredulous delight, declaring: “God bless you Trump! God bless America!” Fransen had reason to sound grateful. In a single day, thanks to the behavior of the US president, she put on an extra 22,000 Twitter followers, substantially extending her political reach. Fransen has already begun to use the moment to her advantage. She posted a video on Thursday in which she appealed to Trump for help in fighting her current prosecution; Fransen faces up to two years in prison for giving a speech in Belfast in which she said: “The biggest threat to civilization across the world is Islam. We are at war with Islam.” Within a matter of hours of Trump’s retweets, a sense of affirmation of the anti-Muslim sentiment contained in them fanned out in far-right circles. Robert Spencer, a leading American Islamophobe who was banned from entering the UK in 2013 for his anti-Muslim history, posted on his website Jihad Watch that doubts about the veracity of the retweeted videos were beside the point. “The real question is not whether this or that video is accurate, but whether there is a problem with jihad terror and Islamic supremacism in Britain and elsewhere.” Breitbart News, the revived mouthpiece of Steve Bannon since his expulsion from the White House in August, gave a dispassionate account of the row swirling around the videos. But the site then went on to publish its own gallery of disturbing images of Islamic State militants executing captives. One picture showed four smiling men with the caption: “Militant Muslims from Bangladesh shortly before they murdered diners in a restaurant.” Other far-right groups that joined in the bonanza were American Renaissance, the white nationalist American Freedom party and Gateway Pundit, run by the arch conspiracy theorist and troll Jim Hoft. One striking feature of the way the hate-filled message normalized by Trump spread like wildfire through the internet was how many people were prepared to put their real names beside extremist opinions rather than hiding behind internet handles. “He speaks truth … need to wake up to this evil,” wrote Janice Barlow, a Christian nurse educator from California in a comment on Gateway Pundit’s Facebook page. “Just exposing these corrupt Muslim loving governments for what they are. Thank you Mr President,” chimed in Kim Leonard, a former Papa John’s general manager in Ohio. Perhaps most alarmingly, the outpouring of Islamophobic remarks triggered by the US president was not confined to the extreme margins of public life. The unofficial fan page for Judge Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News and NBC celebrity, was also full of toxic comments praising Trump and warning Britain that it was about to become a Muslim state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/03/colorado-strip-club-sign-toxic-masculinity-glendale","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T10:00:38Z","webTitle":"'Our business is men, and men are not toxic': Colorado strip club sign raises ire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/colorado-strip-club-sign-toxic-masculinity-glendale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/colorado-strip-club-sign-toxic-masculinity-glendale","fields":{"headline":"'Our business is men, and men are not toxic': Colorado strip club sign raises ire","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Deborah Dunafon knew that a big sign outside her strip club that read “Toxic Masculinity Welcome Here” could land her in trouble. But she thought it needed to be said on behalf of her clientele and men everywhere, who she says have been given a bad rap in the news lately. “I think it’s horrible to accuse men of being toxic, because they’re not,” said Dunafon, who owns the 35-year-old Shotgun Willie’s strip club and a marijuana dispensary in Glendale, Colorado. “Our business is men, and men are not toxic. “How many men are we gonna pick on until finally there’s no men standing? How would you like a society with men meekly running around with little bonnets on their head?” Shotgun Willie’s is located in Glendale (whose mayor is Dunafon’s husband, Mike), a hamlet surrounded on all sides by Denver – the city where a coffee shop recently found itself in hot water over a sandwich board sign that read: “Happily Gentrifying the Neighborhood since 2014.” That sign was not received well in a historically black area where residents had been displaced. A statement from the ad agency behind it said it was intended to be a “cynical perspective” on the issue, and claimed a misunderstanding about the definition of gentrification. At Shotgun Willie’s there is no cynical marketing gimmick, and certainly no apology. “I didn’t put that up because of marketing,” Dunafon said in an interview. “I put it up because I’ve been watching what’s going on in our country as far as men are concerned and it’s infuriating. “I have a son, I have four grandsons, and I feel sorry for my grandsons because they’re all teenagers and I’m afraid for them. I’m wondering if they’re gonna have to make girls sign a contract before they can even go on a date.” A photo of the sign was taken by Bonnie AD, a Denver activist for “conscious sexuality”, who posted the image on her Instagram account. It duly made the rounds on social media. “I had a visceral reaction of disgust when I saw the sign, because toxic masculinity is not a joke,” AD said. “I wanted to share the image because I think that community accountability is vital for social change. Largely, the response on social media has been one of disgust. “This message is approving of toxic masculinity, which is socially irresponsible and culturally poisonous. Anyone on the feminine spectrum, especially sex workers, already have to deal with the covert problems of toxic masculinity and rape culture, so when an establishment publicly makes this kind of commentary, they are adding unnecessary weight to an issue that is already a burden, and a danger, to many people.” Dunafon put up her sign on Tuesday, a day before revelations that two popular media hosts, Matt Lauer, of NBC’s Today show, and Garrison Keillor, of public radio’s A Prairie Home Companion, had been fired: Lauer over allegations of sexual misconduct and Keillor over allegations of inappropriate behavior. The accusations were the latest against powerful men in the torrent since the public downfalls of Bill O’Reilly and Harvey Weinstein. “I think almost all of them are being accused unfairly,” Dunafon said. “In my business I’ve dealt with sexual harassment a lot, because it is a provocative business.” Harassment was “a very subjective thing”, she said. “Like today, the Garrison Keillor thing, I’m sorry, but that’s obscene.” Shotgun Willie’s is located in an area used by shoppers at Target, Home Depot and the Cherry Creek Mall. It is no stranger to controversy. Just before they were married, Mike Dunafon cast the deciding vote on the approval of his then fiancee’s application to add a marijuana dispensary to her strip club – the first such endeavor in the nation. Mike Dunafon is a cigar-smoking former Denver Bronco who ran for governor in 2012 on a pro-marijuana, anti-mass incarceration platform, landing the endorsement of rappers Snoop Dogg and Wyclef Jean, who recorded a campaign song and accompanying video with him. Earlier this year, four former dancers filed a class action lawsuit against Shotgun Willie’s alleging a pay-to-play arrangement with performers. An erotic dancer who works for multiple strip clubs around Denver other than Shotgun Willie’s – and wished to remain nameless – said she had seen pictures of the “toxic masculinity” sign on social media, and found the message problematic. “I believe that Dunafon’s heart is in the right place, but toxic masculinity isn’t about targeting men, it is about fighting the current social concept of what is manhood,” the dancer said. “As a sex worker, I find that the current strip club environment is a place where many can embody these negative qualities, qualities that might lead to actions that would get them punished in the real world. “Not to say all men come into my place of work to intentionally treat women poorly. But I have had many men, and women, harass me, grab me inappropriately, trying to pull on my clothing or me while I am on stage, trying to place body parts or cash into random orifices. “I have been working in strip clubs for almost four years and while I have had many great exchanges with people, I have also had my fill of people who come to strip clubs as if they are places to treat the women that work there as objects. It might not always be intentional, but toxic masculinity does seem to rear its head more aggressively in these businesses.” At Shotgun Willie’s on Wednesday, an attempt to talk to some of the dancers was rebuffed by an employee. Deborah Dunafon resented the idea that any of her dancers were exploited in the course of their work, and said her entire team stood behind the statement about “male toxicity”. “We believe that men in society today are totally being picked on,” she said. “Shotgun has a lot of different guys come in – blue-collar guys, white-collar guys –and I’d say 98.99% of them are good guys. And they don’t want to be accused of being monsters, because really they’re not. They come in for fun. “Every once in a while one of them is unruly and we kick them out, but the entertainers are in total control of them.” This article was amended on 4 December 2017, to clarify that Shotgun Willie’s is a separate business to the Smokin’ Gun Apothecary marijuana dispensary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/arm-vagina-hollywood-female-self-flagellation-jennifer-lawrence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"The ‘arm vagina’ – Hollywood’s latest form of female self-flagellation | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/arm-vagina-hollywood-female-self-flagellation-jennifer-lawrence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/arm-vagina-hollywood-female-self-flagellation-jennifer-lawrence","fields":{"headline":"The ‘arm vagina’ – Hollywood’s latest form of female self-flagellation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It all started with the muffin top, that telltale spillage of flesh over the top of a tight waistband. Then came the bingo wing, the supposedly shaming droop of flesh beneath middle-aged arms; or maybe it was the cankle (chubby ankle), or the saggy knee. I forget now. It’s hard for women to keep track of which specific body part is currently being shamed to death, when it seems to be open season on all of them. But even by the demented standards of female self-flagellation, the emergence of “arm vagina” – aka the slight fold of flesh created where the average arm meets the average body – is a low point. If you’re reading this in a public place and unable immediately to check whether you have arm vagina, then let me help; you almost certainly do. Everyone does. It’s basically a normal human armpit, which tends to involve some spare capacity in the flesh department, what with it being difficult to raise your arm otherwise. But in Hollywood, having a freakishly fat-free underarm, as taut and smooth as a plastic Barbie doll’s, is apparently the new goal. In a long list of mad things female actors are conditioned to worry about exposing on the red carpet, arm vagina is “the one that comes up all the time”, as the celebrity stylist Rebecca Corbin-Murray told the Times this week. Merely having abs that could crack walnuts and a face betraying no sign of human ageing isn’t good enough any more – presumably on the grounds that nothing is ever good enough for women making a living in the public eye, and consequently for self-conscious teenagers striving to copy them. Spend hours in the gym diligently removing all possible vestiges of flesh beneath your arms and the snipers would only move on to something else, although God knows there isn’t much left to pick on. Eyebrow pudge? Overweight elbows? Do the back of my knees look big in this? In fairness to Corbin-Murray, she wasn’t arguing that ordinary women should panic about the beauteousness or otherwise of their armpits, or that doing so was in any sense rational. She was merely pointing out, as a person who gets paid to protect women from public shaming on the red carpet, how freakishly difficult that has become. But she was doing so as part of one of those fluffy “what not to wear this Christmas” spreads aimed at perfectly normal, intelligent women who read stuff like this at the end of a long day because fashion’s meant to be fun, a cheery distraction from worrying about Donald Trump accidentally starting a nuclear war. And the trouble is, this isn’t fun. It’s cruel, and it goes way beyond projecting an ideal of female beauty in the way the movie industry always will. Men in real life don’t go around sexually rejecting women solely on the grounds that their armpits could have been a bit more toned. No sane person ever chose a film to watch on this basis. All moral qualms aside, there’s not even an obvious commercial imperative to making actors feel quite this paranoid. So why do the fashion, film and media industries still contrive to make women feel there’s something gross and hateful about their very flesh, the space they occupy in the world? The way Hollywood exercises power over women has been a hot topic since the first allegations against Harvey Weinstein emerged, and yet we have in some ways been slow to join the dots between individuals’ behaviour and the culture in which this power came to seem almost normal. It’s striking how many of Weinstein’s victims say that before he lunged, he would tell an actor or model that she could do with losing a few pounds. The inference was that she was lucky even to be invited to his hotel room, given how embarrassingly short of the ideal she fell. There is more than an echo here of the way abusive men chip away systematically at a partner’s confidence until she feels worthless, undeserving of better treatment. But in treating women like lumps of meat, Weinstein was in a way simply doing what his industry has been doing to them for years: fuelling insecurity, and using it to keep them in their place. It’s hard to be assertive when you’re constantly terrified of getting one tiny thing wrong and being publicly humiliated for it. If the only victims of such warped expectations of perfection were women paid handsomely to appear on screen, that would be bad enough. But these expectations filter down so alarmingly fast through the culture. Complimented a couple of years ago by a female reporter on the strapless dress she was wearing, the actor Jennifer Lawrence responded by tugging nervously at it and apologising because “I know I have armpit fat, it’s OK … armpit vaginas, it’s awful!” And the reporter responded in the self-deprecating way women automatically do, by tugging at her own dress and saying that now she was worried about her arms. What lesson does a watching teenage girl draw from that? From size zero to the “thigh gap”, or having legs so stick thin they don’t touch in the middle, today’s freaky A-list neurosis so easily becomes tomorrow’s fitness blogger’s goal, and next week’s impossible aspiration for your daughter. This stuff is infectious, and it stops being a frivolous issue when over half of British teenage girls say they’re unhappy with their looks, and when a smaller but still heartbreaking number feel driven to starve and punish the flesh that they have begun to see as repulsive. Somehow we need to get across to girls that this is bonkers, unreal, insane: twisted norms that have nothing to do with their own lives or with the boys they will encounter. They need to know there’s no party worth being “red carpet ready” for, if that means systematically eliminating every last fold and crease. They don’t need any more “insider” fashion tips. If anything, this is an industry that needs to hear a bit more sanity from the outside. For the truth is that audiences don’t care quite as much as performers have been made to think. The world wouldn’t end if actors came to premieres flaunting actual creases where their arms join their bodies. Frankly, they could show up in jeans and it would look refreshing. The only real ugliness on display here is buried deep within an industry that long ago jumped the shark when it comes to norms of female beauty. And that really is the pits. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricicles-victims-millennials-peculiar-tastes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T12:02:29Z","webTitle":"Ricicles are the latest victims of millennials’ peculiar tastes | Daisy Buchanan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricicles-victims-millennials-peculiar-tastes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/ricicles-victims-millennials-peculiar-tastes","fields":{"headline":"Ricicles are the latest victims of millennials’ peculiar tastes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spin, spin sugar. Kellogg’s has announced it is discontinuing Ricicles from January, as part of its commitment to offer customers a slightly healthier breakfast. Coco Pops have survived the cull, but it’s thought that their sugar content will be cut by 40%. Frosties packets will no longer contain free gifts aimed at children, as Kellogg’s says that adults form the largest part of its UK market. They’re for grrr-own-ups! The news takes on an extra poignancy as we begin December. Ricicles are a staple of variety packs, the multipack selections of small boxes of cereal that are an odd but necessary Christmas breakfast staple. This year, thousands of 20-, 30- and 40-somethings will rush down to breakfast on Christmas morning and pour milk over the dusty contents of a tiny box that seems to contain about 80% air, knowing that next year they will have to ladle sugar over the Rice Krispies, and it won’t be the same, no matter what our mums say. It feels like the end of an era, even though I’m not sure I could name anyone who has bought a full-size box of Ricicles since 1992. I wonder whether that’s part of the problem. When every brand, from Coco Pops to Coca-Cola, is claiming to be serious about reducing its sugar content, a slightly healthier version of Ricicles would have been easy enough to make. However, millennials don’t eat cereal – in 2015, a Mintel survey found that 40% of respondents said it was “an inconvenient breakfast choice” because you had to wash your bowl afterwards. (Presumably we’ll only get our hands dirty if there’s an avocado on offer.) Kellogg’s may well be committed to getting us to eat less sugar, but I don’t think they’re simply doing it for the good of our health. They’re following a trend, and the way we eat breakfast has been changing significantly over the last few years. I’ve always believed cereal to be the staple of the Gen Xer. The most prolific cultural cereal eater I can think of is Jerry Seinfeld who, in his eponymous sitcom, kept an array of cereals on his kitchen shelf, and tucked into them at all times of day. He even ordered cereal as an entree when he ate at Monk’s, the diner he frequented. Cereal seemed to be the signature meal of the proud slacker, and its demise makes me wonder whether most millennials are a bit too earnest and sensible to really enjoy it. While the research might claim that we’re too lazy to do our own washing up, my Instagram feed is packed with elaborate millennial meals. We’re smoking our own tofu and crafting carbs from kale. We eschew dairy for cashews. Admittedly, we might be our own worst enemies when it comes to the ratio of deliciousness to effort expended, but when we’ve spent a whole day slogging our guts out milking nuts, we’re not likely to tip the results over a bowl of Sugar Puffs, no matter how moreish they might be. It’s easy to mock millennials, but our eating habits seem to be triggering a broader change, and that might not be a bad thing. This November, it was found that the UK is the most obese country in western Europe. Most nutritionists agree that reducing the sugar we eat has demonstrable health benefits, and starting your day with a bowl of it isn’t the best way to refuel and sustain your energy. It’s easy to get sentimental about the products we associate with our childhood, but if losing Ricicles is part of the price we must pay for longer, healthier lives, perhaps it’s time to let them go. While it might seem churlish to ban an occasional treat, we might look back and wonder why we gave these cereals to our children in the first place. That sounds dramatic, but I suspect my great grandmother eventually felt the same way about the single cigarette she allowed her children on Christmas Day. I’m not entirely convinced that we’ve seen the last of Ricicles. Look at the Wispa, the chocolate bar that keeps being cancelled and brought back due to “popular demand”. It’s had more comebacks than the Rolling Stones. Similarly, Lucky Charms, a cereal that was enormously popular with my sisters and me during the 90s because it contains marshmallows, was briefly withdrawn from sale, as it contained genetically modified ingredients. However, it returned to the UK via some of London’s more exclusive department stores, and it’s currently on sale in Tesco for a fiver a box. Nostalgia is a lucrative market. Perhaps cereal sales will follow a similar pattern to the vinyl revival. No one wants to buy it now, but in 10 years, maybe an old-fashioned fondness for sugar will creep in and bring our appetites back. • Daisy Buchanan is a freelance columnist and features writer covering arts, entertainment and women’s issues"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/30/scotland-must-keep-devolved-powers-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T19:12:52Z","webTitle":"Scotland will fight Brexit power grab, Westminster is warned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/30/scotland-must-keep-devolved-powers-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/30/scotland-must-keep-devolved-powers-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Scotland will fight Brexit power grab, Westminster is warned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Scotland’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, has said his government will refuse to sign any exit deal unless it gets guarantees in legislation to protect Holyrood’s powers. Russell and Damian Green, the UK’s first secretary of state and de facto deputy prime minister, agreed on Thursday that substantial progress had been made in agreeing how to share out EU powers between the London and Edinburgh parliaments. After their latest meeting in Edinburgh, Russell said there had been good progress while Green said both sides “have come a long way in a few months. The two governments are now making real progress.” Green said civil servants on both sides were getting into the “deep detail” of joint frameworks by which former EU rules and regulations would be managed across the UK, and in other technical areas. But Russell, who attended the meeting with John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said the entire deal would collapse if the UK government did not also agree to amend the EU withdrawal bill. Accusing UK ministers of a power grab, the Scottish and Welsh governments have insisted the withdrawal bill include a specific promise that EU powers currently exercised by devolved administrations will not be held in Whitehall after Brexit. The Scottish and Welsh governments are expected to press that case again when all the administrations meet in London in mid-December for a fresh round of talks. Russell said the Scottish government had made clear at the meeting with Green and David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, that the devolved administrations had to be fully involved in the Brexit talks. While both sides have dropped the warlike rhetoric of earlier this year, both the Scottish and Welsh governments have been irritated that UK ministers have refused to consult them directly on policy papers and negotiations with the European commission. Russell said that as things stood the Scottish government could still not recommend to Holyrood that it give legislative consent to the withdrawal bill. Legally, the UK government could still enact the Brexit legislation, but if the Welsh, Scottish and potentially Northern Irish parliaments refused to give it their approval it would lead to a political crisis that all the governments want to avoid. “It is extremely important that the UK government continue to engage with the devolved administrations so we can find a path that works for all the nations of the United Kingdom,” Russell said. “This is particularly important in relation to future talks including trade as it is essential that Scotland’s interests are represented in any negotiations. “It must be recognised that fundamentally nothing can be agreed until agreement is reached on both frameworks and amendments to the bill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/dec/01/families-at-inquests-should-get-funding-if-police-do-says-chief-coroner","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T17:08:11Z","webTitle":"Families at inquests should get funding if police do, says chief coroner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/01/families-at-inquests-should-get-funding-if-police-do-says-chief-coroner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/dec/01/families-at-inquests-should-get-funding-if-police-do-says-chief-coroner","fields":{"headline":"Families at inquests should get funding if police do, says chief coroner","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bereaved relatives should be granted legal aid at inquests in which the government pays for lawyers to represent police officers or other state employees, the chief coroner has urged. Judge Mark Lucraft QC’s recommendation in his first annual report will add to the growing pressure on the government to grant special funding to families seeking justice in controversial cases such as deaths in police custody, in prison or while waiting for an ambulance. Among his proposals for changes to the law, Lucraft’s report, published on Thursday, proposes that the lord chancellor, David Lidington, “gives consideration to amending the exceptional funding guidance (inquests) so as to provide exceptional funding for legal representation for the family where the state has agreed to provide separate representation for one or more interested persons”. The chief coroner noted that in “a small number of inquests” the family of the deceased wish to have representation but do not have the means to pay for it themselves and are unable to obtain legal aid funding. “In some cases, one or more of the agencies present such as the police, the prison service or ambulance service, may be separately represented,” he explained. “In some of these cases, individual agents of the state such as named police officers may also be separately represented. “While all of these individuals or agencies may be legally represented with funding from the state, the state may provide no funding for representation for the family.” The “inequality of arms may be unfair or may appear to be unfair to the family”, Lucraft observed. “It may also mean that the coroner has to give special assistance to the family which may itself give the appearance of being unfair to others.” Deborah Coles, the executive director of the charity Inquest, which supports relatives at coroners’ courts, welcomed the report. “The new chief coroner has supported the call for legal aid,” she said. “We now have unequivocal evidence that this needs to happen. The government can no longer fail to act. “We have had former chief coroners, the Angiolini report into deaths in police custody and the report by the chair of the Hillsborough Independent Panel all calling for bereaved families to have legal representation in deaths related to the state or its agencies. “It’s now time for the government to make this a political priority. Access to justice should not be determined by your financial situation. These families perform a public service in scrutinising the deaths that have occurred. It’s for the benefit of all of us.” The government has previously argued that the relative informality of inquests and their inquisitorial, as opposed to adversarial, nature does not, save in exceptional cases, require bereaved families to be legally represented. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “It is vital that inquests are sympathetic to the needs of the bereaved.” They said ministry guidance on legal aid was changed in November “to ensure that the starting presumption is that it should be available for representation at an inquest”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/robert-finley-the-vietnam-and-rb-veteran-coming-to-fame-half-a-century-late","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Robert Finley: the army and R&B veteran finding fame half a century late","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/robert-finley-the-vietnam-and-rb-veteran-coming-to-fame-half-a-century-late","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/robert-finley-the-vietnam-and-rb-veteran-coming-to-fame-half-a-century-late","fields":{"headline":"Robert Finley: the army and R&B veteran finding fame half a century late","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the Vietnam war had not come to an end, Robert Finley might not have released this year’s best classic R&amp;B album. Finley, from rural Louisiana, joined the US army aged 19 in 1974. His father had been killed in a car crash a couple of years before, and he needed to help support his mother and get himself an education. “They say when you grew up as a sharecropper you have to pick cotton when cotton need picking and chop cotton when cotton need chopping and you go to school in between, so we really only got to go to school three months out of a year,” he says. He trained in aircraft weapons maintenance, but by the time he was deployed, the war was winding down and he added another specialism to his army duties – entertainment. “My first duty station was in Germersheim, Germany, and the first day I was there I met the leader of a band that had just lost its guitar player,” he says. “I was just playing my guitar in the recreation centre, and this guy heard me and asked if I would play with them. He said: ‘We’ll play what you were playing. You just play and we’ll follow you.’” For the next couple of years, Finley learned his trade as guitar player and bandleader, playing social events in US bases in Europe: “Some songs I wrote myself, and I played stuff that was popular in the States – even if it was old there, it might be new in Europe. A lot of James Brown stuff, BB King, Temptations, Staples Singers. If somebody in the band knew the song, we used it.” In 1976, though, he was busted from acting sergeant down to private following a fight. “Here’s the deal. I grew up in a church and in a home where they said: ‘Turn the other cheek, and forgive.’ Then I go into the military and they train me to fight. This is against everything I grew up doing. But I’m trained to fight. I’m a fighting machine.” He left the army. Now, he was sure, he could put his musical skills and discipline to work and make it as a musician. The problem wasn’t his music. It was everybody else. “In the military, everyone was going to be where they was supposed to be,” he says. “But in the real world, if they show up, they show up, if they don’t, they don’t. And ain’t nothing you can do about it. It’s a nervous wreck to be wondering if your guitar player is going to show, if your drummer is going to turn up, and I wasn’t used to that stress.” And so his musical career wound down. He went back to his hometown of Winnsboro, singing gospel and working as a carpenter. And then, a few years back, his eyesight started failing. Unable to take on carpentry jobs, he started playing music. Someone from Music Maker Relief Foundation spotted him busking, which led to a low-key debut album, Age Don’t Mean a Thing, last year. And then, finally, the big break came, when a friend of Black Keys singer Dan Auerbach sent him a clip of Finley playing. Auerbach was convinced this unknown guy was “one of the best singers ever” and approached him about working on a soundtrack to a graphic novel, Murder Ballads. He then signed him to his Easy Eye imprint, pairing him with the cream of southern soul and R&amp;B session musicians for this year’s brilliant Goin’ Platinum!, a record that sounds as if it could have come from any year between 1964 and today, and has made him a minor sensation at the age of 63. Not that Finley was blown away at first. For a start, he had never heard of the Black Keys. “When Dan walked in I didn’t know who he was,” he says. “I lived in a town with a population of 1,600. I was way outside the box. But I went because they said it was a great opportunity to work with some rock stars and do some music. And it wasn’t costing me anything upfront.” “It was unusual how easy it was,” Auerbach says. “He took to it like a fish to water and he impressed everyone – and these were lifelong studio musicians. They were giddy at working with such a great singer. It just clicked.” Auerbach wrote the songs for Finley, giving him 10 numbers that suited his gravelly, rasping voice to the ground. “He was like: ‘This is the story, tell it your way.’ I always wanted to be an actor anyway, so all I had to do was become that person. There was a lot of things I had given up on that came alive, and when I heard the music I loved the music. It was the grace of God that brought us together.” The experienced studio professionals fretted they were working Finley too hard, tiring him out. But no. “I was just tired of waiting for this opportunity.” These days, Finley lives in Bernice, Louisiana – he’s now become the seventh person on Wikipedia’s list of notable locals. Does that mean he’s not the town celebrity? “As long as I can get up in the morning and put a seven-and-a-quarter-inch hat on my head, that means my head didn’t swell up overnight.” He chuckles. “Maybe the girls are smiling a little longer, but other than that everything’s the same.” All he wants now is to win some Grammys, just like his friend Dan. And who’s to say he won’t get a fairytale ending – another one? Goin’ Platinum! is released on 8 December on Nonesuch"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/01/david-davis-threatens-to-quit-if-damian-green-sacked-unfairly","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T18:56:37Z","webTitle":"David Davis and other Tory MPs rally behind Damian Green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/01/david-davis-threatens-to-quit-if-damian-green-sacked-unfairly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/01/david-davis-threatens-to-quit-if-damian-green-sacked-unfairly","fields":{"headline":"David Davis and other Tory MPs rally behind Damian Green","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Davis and a string of other Tory MPs have rallied behind Damian Green, the effective deputy prime minister, after a former detective came forward with fresh allegations about pornography on Green’s Commons computer nine years ago. The Brexit secretary let it be known that he would resign in protest were Green to be forced out solely on the basis of allegations by former Met officers, although he accepted that other factors could lead to Green having to quit as first secretary of state. In a BBC interview on Friday, Neil Lewis, the detective who examined Green’s computer in 2008, said he had “no doubt whatsoever” that it was Green who accessed pornography, and not someone else in the office. Lewis said: “The computer was in Mr Green’s office, on his desk, logged in, his account, his name. In between browsing pornography, he was sending emails from his account, his personal account, reading documents … it was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it.” The former officer said the images were not extreme or illegal, as earlier reports claimed, and featured no images of children or sexual abuse. Previously the man who headed up the 2008 investigation into Green, Bob Quick, had only said pornography was found on a computer in the MP’s office.Green’s future has been in the balance since Theresa May ordered a Cabinet Office inquiry into allegations he made improper sexual advances to Kate Maltby, a Tory activist 30 years his junior, in 2015 and 2016. Green strongly denied the allegations, but the inquiry was subsequently expanded to take in claims that pornography was found on his Commons computer when it was raided in 2008 as part of an inquiry into Home Office leaks. Conservative MPs leapt to Green’s defence, saying evidence obtained in a police raid, which did not expose illegality, should not be used to undermine a politician in this way. Davis, who was Green’s boss as shadow home secretary for a time, is said to feel so angry about the way that his friend has been victimised that he could resign. “David has made it clear that he will not stand idly by if as a result of wrong behaviour by the police then Damian is forced out,” said a close ally of the Brexit secretary. “The police are using tactics straight out of the mafia playbook.” Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the actions of the retired officers in leaking the allegations against Green had “the smack of the police state”. “This can’t be right. They are in flagrant breach of their own code of conduct and practice,” he told BBC Two’s Newsnight. “Eight years later they choose to put material that an ordinary citizen would be prohibited from acquiring under data protection rules into the public domain on their own judgment ... I find it very worrying. We give the police powers that other people do not have. They are not and must not be allowed to abuse those powers.” Backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said the police “behaved disgracefully as a political arm of the then government” when they raided Green’s office in 2008, adding that they should not be “using information obtained improperly to damage a politician”. And in an article for the Guardian Crispin Blunt said: “I am deeply concerned by the way in which the people we need to protect us and help safeguard our democracy felt free to smear the reputation of a fine public servant.” Blunt also said Lewis’s account of how pornography was supposedly viewed on Green’s computer for long periods was “wholly inconsistent with the normal pattern of an MP’s parliamentary life”, when they would not have time for such activity. The threat by Davis to resign would only come into play were Green to be forced out on the word of the police, according to Davis’s friends. If the Cabinet Office inquiry were to prove that Green had lied, or other misconduct, then Davis accepts May would be entitled to act. Green issued a brief statement of denial about the Lewis claims on Friday. “I’ve maintained all along, I still maintain – it is the truth – that I didn’t download or look at pornography on my computer. But obviously while the investigation is going on I can’t say any more at the moment.” Downing Street has confirmed that the Cabinet Office investigation is primarily looking at possible breaches of the ministerial code, even though the pornography allegations relate to a time before Green was a minister. The inquiry is being carried out by Sue Gray, head of ethics at the Cabinet Office. A claim that her report was already with May was swiftly denied on Friday, and No 10 has refused to say when it would conclude. The final decision about what happens to Green will be up to May. The 2008 leak inquiry led to no charges against Green. Lewis now faces a Scotland Yard investigation into his decision to go public. The Met responded to his intervention by saying: “Confidential information gathered during a police inquiry should not be made public.” A spokesperson said the case would be examined by the directorate of professional standards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/04/meghan-markle-mixed-race-community-prince-harry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T08:59:05Z","webTitle":"If Meghan Markle represents the ‘mixed-race community’, what about me? | Georgia Chambers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/meghan-markle-mixed-race-community-prince-harry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/meghan-markle-mixed-race-community-prince-harry","fields":{"headline":"If Meghan Markle represents the ‘mixed-race community’, what about me?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Prince Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle it was clear she was going to be a very “different” kind of princess. Markle is a successful American actor and campaigner for women’s rights. But the many headlines that labelled her “unconventional” did so not because of her career or anything particularly striking about her personal life, but because of the fact that she is mixed-race. Media coverage of their engagement focused heavily on Markle’s ethnicity, with the BBC doing a feature on interracial couples and an article in the Metro boldly stating: “It’s a great day for interracial couples and mixed-race girls everywhere.” It could have been a moment to open up a wider and much-needed conversation about the diversity of the mixed-race experience. Markle herself has spoken about growing up biracial, telling an interviewer that she remembers not knowing whether to tick “black” or “white” when filling out a diversity form, so she left it blank. She says how this sense of uncertainty followed her into her acting career, being too “black” for white roles and too “white” for black ones. However, the media mostly responded by using Markle’s ethnicity to “prove” how far we’ve come as a nation in terms of embracing people from all races and cultures. The truth is, if we insist on depicting her as symbolic of the mixed-race experience, Markle serves as a reminder that no matter what we achieve, our ghost of “incompleteness” will continue to haunt us. The incredible scope of the mixed-race experience is continually glossed over. Former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman said there was a “perfect type of mixed race”, with fair skin and straightened hair, that Markle conforms to. However, many women of black and white heritage, myself included, have darker skin and curly, afro hair that, thanks to our Eurocentric standards of beauty, are seen as less desirable. The media’s effort to paint Markle as a patron for this imaginary mixed-race community therefore excludes many of us who do not have this commonly assumed “beauty privilege”. Today, advertisers have hit on the idea of selling us the multicultural dream, using the mixed-race experience to symbolise modernness, diversity, and integration – though hardly ever treating it as a racial identity in its own right. What’s more, it lulls us into believing that our nation is a tolerant one, a description that many ethnic minority individuals would disagree with: given the rise in hate crime, the fact that black and minority children account for 60% of child arrests, and the day-to-day micro-aggressions we face. Nevertheless, I will be glued to my television when the royal wedding takes place. I think it’s important that we see it for what it is – a celebration of love and commitment between two individuals. Forcing a multicultural symbolism on top of it is just too complex and heavy a burden, and in reality proves how far we still have to go as a nation in understanding racial identity. • Georgia Chambers is a freelance journalist and writer.

A quietly spoken maverick in the corporate world, he was also a lifelong supporter of the Labour party. As a friend and supporter of Tony Blair he chaired the Rock the Vote campaign, persuading young people to register to vote in the run-up to the 1997 general election. During his time as managing director of RCA Records UK (1985-89) the company was bought by Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). He went on to become chairman of BMG Entertainment (1989-98). There he oversaw very different labels, including RCA, and expanded the range to include anything from classical music to Simon Cowell’s signings. Preston brought in Cowell as an A&amp;R consultant, and gave him the freedom to sign and develop such unlikely, and massively commercial, pop acts as the actors Robson &amp; Jerome. Cowell described Preston as “an absolute gentleman to work with. He inspired incredible loyalty and I owe a lot to him.” While at RCA UK and then BMG, Preston worked with a large number of successful artists, from Eurythmics to M People and Take That. Alison Wenham, former managing director of the classical label Conifer, which joined BMG in 1995, saw him as “a smart businessman and scrupulously fair. He liked the idea of a big corporation being enlivened by independent entrepreneurs – the grit in the oyster. And it was unheard of in the music industry that he worked with three female MDs.” Alongside Wenham were Diana Graham, whom he promoted to MD of Arista UK, and Lisa Anderson, who became MD of RCA UK. Preston became close friends with many artists, especially Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Lennox described him as “a thoroughly good man – a rare diamond”, while Stewart said he was “a free spirit and understood artists completely”. They both had houses in the same French village where, according to Stewart, “John spent many hours in my home studio, with me playing guitar along to tracks or just listening to music … John was a music fanatic and he loved guitars.” It was typical of his free-wheeling approach to life that he retired at the height of his success, when he was 48. Eurythmics gave a surprise performance at his leaving party. He then spent seven years building a boat with his wife, Roz. It was named Sweet Dreams, after the Eurythmics hit. Born in Nottingham, John was the son of Major Ian Preston, who served in the Royal Artillery and later worked for an Edinburgh brewery, and a talented actor mother who insisted on using her unlikely middle name, Michael (nee Cochrane). He went to Shrewsbury school and Trinity College, Oxford, to study history before moving on to Liverpool University, where he gained a BPhil in Latin American history (1972). To his parents’ horror, rather than join the Foreign Office he took a job working behind the counter at Bruce’s Record Shop in Edinburgh in 1974. The owner, Bruce Findlay, found that Preston had “impeccable taste in music”, and he was promoted to marketing manager and began co-managing the Edinburgh rock band Café Jacques with Findlay. He met Roz (nee Rosalind Tosh) when she was selling advertising for the Scotsman and Evening News. In 1976 he moved to London, Roz soon followed, and they were married two years later. He got a job as export clerk at One Stop Music, and moved on to EMI’s new artist development department. One of his colleagues there, David Munns, later MD at Polydor Records UK, described him as “a modern marketer, thinking about image and promotion, not just running an ad in the NME”. He worked on campaigns for Kate Bush and for Bow Wow Wow with Malcolm McLaren. Preston moved quickly up the industry ladder, first moving to Decca, then to Polydor, where he was managing director (1984-85), before joining RCA. He expanded his political contacts thanks to his wife’s career – Roz worked in Blair’s office (1990-96) and co-ran Cherie Blair’s office with Fiona Millar (1996-98). However, as a council member and then chair (1996-97) of the BPI (British Phonographic Institute), the trade organisation for the recorded music industry, Preston found himself in dispute with Gerald Kaufman. The Labour MP was then chair of the National Heritage select committee, and in 1993 asked for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into CD pricing. After a £1m inquiry, the record companies were cleared of over-charging. Wenham said that Preston’s “intellectual rigour … was crucial in steering us through”. After training at the Boat Building Academy in Lyme Regis, Dorset, he and Roz completed their ocean cruising yacht in 2007, and then spent two or three months sailing every year. They moved back to Edinburgh in 2009, where Preston was on the board of the Queen’s Hall music venue until last year, and that of the Scottish Drugs Forum. He is survived by Roz and his half-sister, Prue. • John O’Driscoll Preston, music business executive, born 29 August 1950; died 19 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-nottingham-jason-williamson-sleaford-mods","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T14:13:37Z","webTitle":"Nottingham doesn’t need you, Harry | Jason Williamson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-nottingham-jason-williamson-sleaford-mods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-nottingham-jason-williamson-sleaford-mods","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham doesn’t need you, Harry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Did the Windsors’ PR look at statistics for which area of the UK holds the highest number of bloodless cap doffers?

The library said that Fitzgerald’s archive would be “valuable in elucidating her professional, intellectual and writing life”. Unusually, the acquisition includes the novelist’s personal library, in particular heavily annotated works by Samuel Beckett, John Milton, James Joyce, George Eliot and other writers, which she used teaching English literature. “They provide the entry point to a writer’s reading life, as well as documenting the gap in the record of Fitzgerald’s life in her 40s and for much of her 50s when she was struggling to make ends meet through her teaching, deferring the point when she began to write seriously herself,” said Rachel Foss, head of contemporary archival and manuscripts collections. “They’re very valuable for researchers … the marginalia give some detail about the preoccupations that would later come into her novels – how she particularly liked fictional treatments of restraint, for example, and how much she foregrounds minor characters. Both offer clues to her own aesthetic – her own critical response to literature and what she wanted to highlight as a teacher, and enable us to understand more about the process of her own writing.” Fitzgerald, who won the Booker for her third novel, 1979’s Offshore, published her first, The Golden Child, at the age of 58, in 1977. The archive includes all of the notebooks relating to The Golden Child, which was originally titled The Golden Opinion, showing how extensively the published edition was cut by publisher Duckworth. “They wanted to make it a lot tighter and more focused,” said Foss. “She originally wrote it as an amusement for her husband when he was ill … She didn’t start writing until quite late on, but once she did, she very quickly became an established presence.” According to Foss, Fitzgerald’s notebooks also contain a lot of unpublished material; “ideas, sketches, the beginnings of projects that were never realised”. A series of diaries about the trips Fitzgerald took to China, which were never published, are also featured, along with family letters – Fitzgerald’s father EV Knox was editor of Punch magazine during the 1930s – and correspondence from AS Byatt, Muriel Spark, AN Wilson, Rebecca West, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively. The British Library said that Fitzgerald had been “confronted with domestic and economic crises throughout her life”, in particular a difficult period after she moved the family back to London to live on a barge in 1960. Matters deteriorated further “when the boat filled with water and sank in 1963 (taking with it some of the archive). Fitzgerald’s early fiction draws heavily on her own life and working experiences. Offshore is a novel about 1960s life among the Thames river-boat community.” Drafts and notebooks for novels including The Gate of Angels (1990) and The Blue Flower (1995) are also included in the archive, which is currently being catalogued. Lead curator Joanna Norledge described it as a “great source to be mined”. Fitzgerald, who died in 2000 at the age of 83, was shortlisted for the Booker four times, and won it once. She was awarded the Golden PEN award by English PEN for a lifetime’s distinguished services to literature in 1999."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/01/if-you-lived-in-bitterness-you-wouldnt-enjoy-anything-exeter-chiefs-zimbabwean-rugby-union-exiles","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T14:53:45Z","webTitle":"‘If you lived in bitterness you wouldn’t enjoy anything’: Exeter’s Zimbabwean rugby exiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/01/if-you-lived-in-bitterness-you-wouldnt-enjoy-anything-exeter-chiefs-zimbabwean-rugby-union-exiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/01/if-you-lived-in-bitterness-you-wouldnt-enjoy-anything-exeter-chiefs-zimbabwean-rugby-union-exiles","fields":{"headline":"‘If you lived in bitterness you wouldn’t enjoy anything’: Exeter’s Zimbabwean rugby exiles","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For every Zimbabwean living in long-term exile, the removal of Robert Mugabe as president has stirred powerful emotions. Exeter’s Don Armand and Kai Horstmann are no different: both grew up on farms outside Harare, enjoying a youthful freedom seldom found on Britain’s frost-covered school playgrounds. Until, that is, Mugabe’s notorious fast-track land reforms drove their families out, forcing them to seek new lives elsewhere. Armand, Horstmann and their compatriot Dave Ewers have fared better than many, helping Exeter Chiefs to become England’s champions, but their sun-kissed childhood memories are still bittersweet companions. Armand and Ewers were 12 and 13 respectively when they left Zimbabwe; Horstmann was in his late teens. Livelihoods ruined, dreams trampled, the what ifs never-ending. “If you lived in bitterness you wouldn’t enjoy anything here,” says Armand, acutely conscious of those who suffered far worse when Mugabe’s war veterans brutally targeted farmers and their workers between 2000 and 2002. The fact all three men have subsequently prospered in such a mentally challenging profession may not be entirely coincidental. Horstmann and Armand, capped by England in Argentina in June, suspect their resilience and work ethic comes from their parents. The former, in particular, has vivid recollections of the day his future plans fundamentally changed: “I remember being at boarding school in England, opening a newspaper and seeing a picture of my mum demonstrating on the streets of Harare. I rang home and spoke to someone who told me she’d subsequently been locked up. She was held for four or five days and was pretty shaken up. There were 40 or so women in one cell. She said it was the most horrific thing she’d ever experienced.” In happier times his mother Ann’s family had two farms in Zimbabwe; his German father, Heiko, was a surgeon. When her farm was taken and her husband relocated to Majorca, her son, now 36, understandably remembers them as tough years. “It hammered home to her the value of life. She’d had a gut full of it. Seeing that sort of struggle was really hard.” At least Ann’s passion for Zimbabwe’s natural beauty and its long-suffering people has remained intact, despite her move to Stellenbosch in South Africa. “She travels back once every four months and loves it. Her absolute dream is for it to be a legitimate option to move back. I know Mum would have loved one of her children to have run the farm. We’ve still got title deeds … the dream is that one day it gets given back.” Armand, perhaps the Premiership’s most consistent back-row forward, also has family still in Zimbabwe. His parents, Wade and Adele, grew plants and flowers for export to Europe before moving to South Africa for their children’s sake. “They’re the ones who had to change their whole lifestyles and their plans to accommodate us,” Armand says. “I didn’t experience anything negative about moving off the farm because my parents hid it very well. They bore a lot of the brunt of the really hard stuff. I don’t really find myself living in bitterness. I have my memories and they were amazing.” It is a slightly different story with Ewers. His uncles had farms around Mutare, near the border with Mozambique, but as the political climate worsened his family sent their 13-year-old son to live with his paternal grandparents in Ivybridge. It remains a sufficiently sensitive period for him to decline to contribute to this article. “By his own admission he’s tried to shelve it,” Horstmann says. “He doesn’t want to talk about it.” All three Devon-based Chiefs, however, hope Zimbabwe is now inching towards better times, though the appointment of certain senior military figures to Emmerson Mnangagwa’s first cabinet is not immediately encouraging. “Getting rid of Mugabe should have happened a long time ago,” Horstmann says. “He hadn’t had a legitimate election in probably 20 years. The fact he’s gone is a really big plus, although Emmerson Mnangagwa has been involved with Mugabe for a long time. The words ‘leopard’ and ‘spots’ spring to mind but the world’s eyes are on him. “There’s an election next year which, fingers crossed, will be legitimate. The country hasn’t had that in a long time. It was once the ‘bread basket’ of Africa and there’s no reason it couldn’t be again. It’s going to take some convincing to get people back there but the potential for Zimbabwe is huge.” Armand, whose mother and sister have now joined him in Exeter, would like to think Zimbabwe’s shattered agricultural economy could one day be revived. “I have a few ears to the ground there and they are saying there have been post-Mugabe plans in existence since 2007.” His father and uncle are involved in organising what they hope to establish as Africa’s most lucrative pigeon racing event, based at Victoria Falls. “All the people there want to work for something better,” says the 29-year-old. “That’s the challenge for the government. You will always get your extremists like the war veterans who would blindly follow Mugabe, beat people up and kick them off their farms. What is there to guarantee it won’t happen again?” Discussing rugby, by now, feels absurdly mundane if not totally irrelevant. Just imagine, though, the stellar back row Zimbabwe could conceivably field: David Pocock at openside alongside the outstanding Armand and bullocking Ewers, with Leicester’s forceful Mike Williams and Worcester’s David Denton as backup. Do not underestimate, either, the input of Exeter’s three hard-working Zimbabwe boys to the club’s rise, not least Armand whose omission from Eddie Jones’s autumn plans still has everyone west of Taunton baffled. Horstmann jokes that a beard trim might advance his claims; last year’s Premiership final man of the match is relying on more obvious solutions: “Rob [Baxter] just says to me: ‘Keep playing the way I’m playing and they’ll find a place for you.’ It’s about making sure my performances are at a standard where, if a place does open up, Eddie can justify picking me.” Send third-placed Bath back home empty-handed and the Chiefs, already leading the table by five points, will be one step closer to reclaiming their title. “The biggest thing I’ve noticed about this squad is that every season has created more and more belief,” says Horstmann, previously with Worcester and Harlequins. “There’s now an innate belief the possibilities are endless.” The Chiefs’ Zimbabwean trio would dearly love to say the same about their homeland one day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-twitter-attack-will-only-increase-uks-post-brexit-angst","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T14:02:08Z","webTitle":"Trump's Twitter attack only serves to increase UK's post-Brexit angst | Patrick Wintour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-twitter-attack-will-only-increase-uks-post-brexit-angst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-twitter-attack-will-only-increase-uks-post-brexit-angst","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's Twitter attack will only increase UK's post-Brexit angst","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As UK diplomats picked over the rubble of the special relationship caused by Donald Trump’s twitter attack on both Theresa May and the UK’s multicultural society, seasoned foreign policy hands pointed out that there have been serious high level breakdowns in Anglo-US relations in the past, but it is rare for a disagreement to be so public or for a US president to be so insulting to a prime minister or the UK’s sense of its own identity. The row – at one level banal – may also inject an urgency into a growing debate about UK’s foreign policy alliances in the wake of Brexit, diplomats said. The UK’s strategic ties with the US are too important to be abandoned, but the relationship is going to be deprived of any warmth and passion so long as Trump remains president, according to Lord Ricketts, the former national security adviser. On the immediate issue of the proposed state visit, Ricketts, who has long held the view the invitation was foolishly premature, said: “It had now become an embarrassment, and the can will have to be kicked further down the road into the very long grass.” For others, such as the former ambassador to Washington Sir Christopher Meyer, it is best to got the visit over with. “To cancel the visit would give wide offence beyond Trump’s core support. We have too many interests – economic, defence, intelligence – invested in the relationship to risk that, especially at a time when our relations with Europe hang in the balance.” One option is to hold a low-key visit at the government-owned estate at Chevening, away from any crowds at Buckingham Palace. But the image of an American president being smuggled in and out of the country by his hosts is said not to attract Trump, and prompted him previously to tell May he did not want to come if the protests were going to overshadow everything. Either way, the difficulty now is that the imminence of the visit, or otherwise, is going to be a constant awkward barometer of the state of Downing Street/White House relations. The speed and aplomb with which Emmanuel Macron, no admirer of Trump, managed to pull off Trump’s swift Bastille Day visit to Paris stands as a stark rebuke to the UK’s relative flat-footedness. Ricketts accused Trump of incredibly bad judgment, and added he did not think the president was going to change. Nor does it mean the British were wrong to get close to the Trump team. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has made every effort to develop friendships with figures such as Jared Kushner, the president’s son in law. In efforts to ingratiate himself Johnson even implausibly described Trump as essentially a liberal New Yorker. But even he has retreated from role as spokesman for the administration in the Commons. The retweeting of the far right lies about the UK appears to have crossed a line that even protocol-conscious ministers in the Foreign Office could not tolerate. In tweets both the Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, and the Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad did not just confine themselves to a defence of Muslims in the UK, but instead personally criticised Trump. The hope inside the Foreign Office is that Trump will delete the tweets and apologise, but it is not something any minister has yet dared demand in public, partly because Trump is unlikely to alienate his political base by doing so. There is also an overriding need to keep an open door to the grown-ups in the rest of the Trump administration. Many Republicans are appalled by Trump’s behaviour, with one accusing him of single-handedly wrecking the special relationship. Ricketts argued on Sky News that it was best to take the long view. “The crucial thing is the strategic relationship we have with the US – the defence and intelligence relationship – they are much longer lasting and much bigger than one round of tweets.” In the immediate term the UK may increasingly work around Trump on key issues such as the Iran nuclear deal, climate change, counter-terrorism or trade relations, including the tariffs imposed on Bombardier. Many diplomats, and not just in the UK, said the critical task would be to build relations with other branches of the Trump administration. Ricketts concluded by saying the episode threw up a wider challenge: “I would like to see a serious debate going on about how we are going to perform as an independent country after 40 years of always thinking how do we influence the EU, and how do we work within the EU and alongside the US. “Honestly, it needs a foreign secretary who is out there with authority, who commands respect and who is doing a serious representation of Britain as a post-Brexit country. I do not see that at the moment.” To that extent, the row with Trump, ironically a great supporter of Brexit, has just increased the angst that “Global Britain” may turn into “Irrelevant Britain”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/01/v-and-a-chinese-outpost-oasis-calm-kitsch-jumble-shenzhen","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T17:13:53Z","webTitle":"The V&A's new Chinese outpost: an oasis of calm in a kitsch jumble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/01/v-and-a-chinese-outpost-oasis-calm-kitsch-jumble-shenzhen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/01/v-and-a-chinese-outpost-oasis-calm-kitsch-jumble-shenzhen","fields":{"headline":"The V&A's new Chinese outpost: an oasis of calm in a jumble of kitsch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A fake iPhone is on display next to a mobile designed for the elderly in the V&amp;A’s new outpost in Shenzhen, southern China, the first overseas branch in the museum’s history, which opens on Saturday. Both phones were made nearby, one the product of the region’s many counterfeit factories, the other developed by a young local designer with an enlarged keypad and SOS button. It might look like a simple moral pairing of the bad copy vs the good innovation, until you learn that the knock-off iPhone was also an improvement on the original: it features a double SIM-card slot, essential for the many people who shuttle between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. “We wanted to show that the ‘copycat China’ stereotype isn’t as black and white as people might think,” says Brendan Cormier, curator of the V&amp;A’s inaugural exhibition, Values of Design, which sees 250 items loaned from the London institution’s collection for the next two years, including a handful of new contemporary Chinese acquisitions. “Shenzhen has gone from being a place where things are simply made, to a centre of innovation where these truly disruptive products are being designed.” Transformed from a sleepy fishing village to a 15-million strong megalopolis in just 35 years, Shenzhen is a suitably high-speed laboratory for the venerable museum’s first foray into setting up an international outpost. Initiated just three years ago, the idea for the V&amp;A satellite came at the invitation of China Merchants Group, which wanted a cultural anchor for its latest waterfront property development – an idea it had tested by hosting an architecture biennale on various industrial sites slated for redevelopment. As one of the country’s oldest and biggest state-owned conglomerates (with fingers in every pie, from container shipping to mining, banking and real estate), CMG led China’s first flirtation with free-market capitalism in 1979, when the Shekou peninsula, where the museum is located, became the test bed for Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening policy. As the outward-looking cradle of modern China, where land reform, private enterprise and foreign investment were first nurtured, it is a fitting place for the V&amp;A to be testing its own international ambitions. “It is increasingly important to be showing what the UK is good at overseas,” says the museum’s deputy director, Tim Reeve, echoing the Brexit-conscious rhetoric of his new boss, Tristram Hunt. When the Louvre opened its outpost in Abu Dhabi last month, Hunt hailed the project as “a template for the mix of ingenuity, vision and spirit of collaboration which post-Brexit Britain will need to display on the world stage”. Although it was conceived by his late predecessor, the energetic Martin Roth, the Shenzhen project is the V&amp;A’s light-footed version of that ambition. “It’s a very different model to the Louvre,” says Reeve. “We want to be more nimble and responsive, creating something suitable to the particular context here, then we might go somewhere else.” The V&amp;A gallery occupies part of the ground floor of the new Sea World Culture and Arts Center, a vast RMB 1.3bn (£146m) building designed by the 89-year-old Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, sandwiched between luxury apartment towers and a Hilton hotel. Cascading steps lead up between boxy white cantilevered volumes of granite and aluminium to a big planted roof terrace, from where you can take in expansive views across the bay to Hong Kong, and back to the bristling skyline of Shenzhen. Perhaps in response to president Xi Jinping’s plea for “no more weird architecture”, the building provides a blank foil to the mad Las Vegas jumble of Sea World next door, a kitsch fantasy of Venetian-styled restaurants, gothic apartment buildings and a landlocked cruise-liner hotel. But for all its architectural straightforwardness (which verges on the dull), the museum doesn’t quite seem to know what it is on the inside. “We see it as a vibrant ecosystem of interconnected design communities,” says Ole Bouman, the Dutch director of Design Society, the organisation co-founded by CMG and the V&amp;A to oversee the curation of the complex. “It’s a cultural podium for China to show its creative drive to the world and to nurture its quest for international inspiration,” he says. It is a strange hybrid institution, containing a mix of galleries, restaurants and luxury lifestyle shops, its six levels connected by escalators around a big atrium, giving more the feeling of a mall than a museum. It is a distinctly Chinese combination, where the propaganda-heavy Shekou Museum of Reform and Opening sits side by side with exclusive private dining suites, a handmade silk clothes boutique and a Unesco-affiliated gallery to showcase Shenzhen’s “city of design” status. A gaping ground-floor exhibition hall opens with a big survey of digital design, displaying a wide range of things variously squirted out by 3D-printers, milled by robots and manipulated by algorithms. The whole thing feels like an apt reflection of contemporary China, good and bad. The V&amp;A fits into this heady cocktail as a strategic partner, having signed a five-year deal in 2014 to provide expertise in setting up the institution, curating one of the galleries and establishing a wide range of educational programmes, for an undisclosed sum. “It’s enough to cover our costs,” is all Reeve will say, “and then a bit more on top.” Drawing on the museum’s recent “rapid response collecting” initiative, of acquiring topical items relating to stories in the news, his team has done a good job of curating a show that fuses historical objects from the V&amp;A’s 2.5m-strong collection with more recent acquisitions to spice things up. Local success stories include the Phantom drone, a popular consumer quadcopter produced by Da-Jiang Innovations, a Shenzhen tech startup founded in 2006 and now valued at more than $8bn. It is only trumped by the WeChat phone app, a messaging and payment service now used by 800 million people, developed by Shenzhen-headquartered company Tencent – which was recently valued at $522bn, making it worth more even than Facebook. Some items are displayed as pairs to draw parallels or make a particular point: in a section on the communicative role of design, a celestial globe from 17-century Pakistan is shown next to the Blackphone, a smartphone designed with extra security privacy features. A section on performance pairs an astrolabe with an absurd Swiss army knife that has 80 different functions, while a display on problem-solving shows an iron corset with a paralympic running blade. The approach can sometimes seem a bit scattershot, but it provides an intriguing overview of the V&amp;A to an uninitiated audience, enhanced by an exhibition design that revels in its voracious palette of novel material combinations. The section on performance employs foamed aluminium and colour-changing dichroic film, the area on cost combines lavish slabs of green marble (matched to the V&amp;A’s own lobby in South Kensington) with the plywood of museum packing crates, while the display on “wonder” is enveloped in a slinky curtain of chainmail. “We imagined it as something between a cathedral and a shopping centre,” says the exhibition’s designer, Sam Jacob. “You are browsing, but also worshipping.” It is a good metaphor for the entire building, whose nave-like atrium is lined on either side with alternating chapels of culture and consumerism – not all yet fully tenanted. The main question hanging over it all is what will happen when the V&amp;A deal expires in two years, by which time the complex is supposed to be financially self-sustaining. China’s recent museum boom (which saw 415 new museums open in 2014 alone, bringing the total to 4,510) has left many echoing exhibition halls struggling to find content. Design Society has no plans to acquire a collection of its own, so there is a danger that the mall could ultimately swallow the museum. “Every day is a new day for us,” is the gnomic answer from Zhang Lin, CMG’s deputy general manager. “Things will change, but our international friendship will always remain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/13/stop-big-corporations-dodging-tax-avoidance-paradise-paper","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"There’s a simple way to stop big corporations avoiding tax.

Here’s how","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Paradise Papers revelations have again raised concerns over the way multinational corporations arrange their tax affairs. Why, with high turnovers in countries such as the UK, do they pay so little tax there? The answer is often quite simple: because legally, under international corporate tax rules, they are not required to. In our globalised economy, where production chains are spread across the world and highly movable, it is difficult to determine under existing rules where and how the profits of big firms should be taxed. In effect, we can no longer properly identify the countries that have both the legitimacy and ability to tax those profits. Our response has been somewhat contradictory. On one hand there has been a multiplication of anti-avoidance rules and initiatives, at national and international levels, to prevent companies shifting profits between countries. On the other hand there has been an intensification of tax competition, with countries offering ever lower rates of corporate income tax in order to foster investment, thus incentivising that same corporate mobility. In the process we have given multinationals massive bargaining power: the power to pit countries against each other. There is therefore only one long-term means of effectively taxing corporations: we must remove the incentives to corporate mobility for tax reasons. How to achieve that is the key question. For years, people have advocated the introduction of a common method of taxing corporations – but political agreement, even within Europe, has proved exceptionally difficult. The likelihood of achieving that global agreement seems extremely low. In 2008 a paper by professors Michael Devereux at Oxford University, Alan Auerbach at the University of California, Berkeley, and Helen Simpson at Bristol University came up with a new solution: what if we taxed profits in the country where the customers are? Their idea was to tax corporations at the least movable point of the production chain, at a point that corporations could not shift or manipulate. The most common tax avoidance techniques rely on one crucial premise: that moving your headquarters or activities will affect where profits are taxed. If your patents are located in a country with lower corporate income tax rates, then the income they generate will be taxed at lower rates; if your management activities are located in that country, most of your profits may be taxed there. What these avoidance schemes have in common is their reliance on mobility: moving can result in a lower tax bill. If we taxed at the destination, or sales endpoint, there would be no benefit in moving headquarters or patent registrations to a lower-tax country. Because customers are relatively immobile, a destination-based tax would remove mobility from the equation. At a single stroke, we could almost completely eliminate tax competition and avoidance. Crucially, although international cooperation would make that more effective, it could still work if only one country unilaterally moved towards a destination-based corporate income tax. But is it feasible to tax corporate profits in the country of destination? And is it legitimate? In 2014 Michael Devereux and I set out the reasons why we think it is both. We already have another tax based on destination – VAT. Many of the administrative features developed for VAT could be applied, with some adaptation, to a destination-based corporate income tax, even though one is based on consumption and the other on profits. How would such a system work in practice? The first step would be to identify the country of destination. This would usually be where the customer lives. In the case of digital transactions, it could be decided on the basis of the bank card used for payment. The scope for fraud would be smaller than if the destination country were determined, for instance, by the customer’s computer IP address, which can be easily manipulated. An exception to using the customer’s country of residence would have to be made for cases such as restaurants, concert venues or shops, where customers cross borders to make purchases. In these circumstances, the sale could be taxed where the business is located. Once the country of destination was identified, corporate income tax would be applied to sales made in that country. If international cooperation could be achieved, even within a small group of countries, they could delegate tax collection to each other. This would mean companies could concentrate all the compliance for tax regulation in their country of residence, a one-stop shop. There is natural anxiety about how developing countries would fare in a system that taxed profits in the country where sales take place: with smaller consumer markets, if corporate income tax is based on sales, would their revenues decrease? But this anxiety may not be warranted: many developing countries, such as most of Latin America and India, for instance, already use destination-based taxation in relation to services. They tend to import significant amounts of products, which would be a good indicator for estimating sales; and those with natural resources could easily apply a natural resources tax. More importantly, the end of tax competition would end the pressure of the race to the bottom felt by developing countries. They could freely establish their tax rates. The alternative to a destination-based corporate income tax is not a perfectly functioning international tax system for developing countries: it is a system that at present is fundamentally rigged against them. The proposal has been progressively gaining traction. In 2013 the House of Lords economic affairs select committee recommended a detailed study on the possible adoption of a destination-based tax, both internationally and unilaterally. A 2014 report from the European commission on how to tax the digital economy pointed in the same direction. Then in early 2017 the proposal became a hot topic in the US. Although the destination element has now been removed from the US tax reform debate, the issue was picked up again in recent OECD proposals on the digital economy. Changing the fundamentals of our tax system would present short-term challenges. As in every tax reform, there would be winners and losers. But the mid- to long-term rewards of such a move could be extremely significant. Imagine a world where we do not need to constantly close loopholes with anti-avoidance measures; where countries do not have to erode their tax bases to attract investment; where developing countries can take back control of their tax systems; where digital businesses are fully integrated and taxed like any other business. No tax is perfect, but this vision of the world may just be worth fighting for. • Rita de la Feria is the chair in tax law at the school of law at Leeds University, and international research fellow at the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/01/for-pittas-sake-eu-parliament-threatens-to-make-doner-kebab-a-goner","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T15:09:13Z","webTitle":"For pitta's sake: EU kebab meat move could make doner a goner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/01/for-pittas-sake-eu-parliament-threatens-to-make-doner-kebab-a-goner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/01/for-pittas-sake-eu-parliament-threatens-to-make-doner-kebab-a-goner","fields":{"headline":"For pitta's sake: EU kebab meat move could make doner a goner","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s the news that none of Europe’s late-night revellers want to hear: the end of the doner kebab could be nigh. A move by the European parliament to ban the phosphates necessary to keep seasoned kebab meat moist and flavoursome, even after the most arduous periods on a spit, is said to pose a direct threat to the future of the high street delicacy. An estimated 1.3m doner kebabs are sold every day in the UK from more than 20,000 outlets. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was even guest of honour last year at the British kebab awards. Across the whole of Europe, some 200,000 people work in the industry. In Germany, where the doner kebab is by far and away the most popular fast food, consternation at the development has prompted some apocalyptic visions. “If the European parliament gets its way, this would be the death sentence for the entire doner kebab industry in the European Union,” said Kenan Koyuncu of the German association of doner kebab producers. Renate Sommer, a member of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat party in the European parliament, wrote on Facebook that “a ban of the phosphate addition would be the end of doner production and would lead to the loss of thousands of jobs”. A scientific review in 2012 suggested a possible link between phosphates, when used as food additives, and heart disease, although the evidence remains inconclusive. EU rules normally prohibit the use of phosphate additives in meat preparation, where they are used to protect flavour and retain water, but there are exceptions, and the law is currently silent on their use in frozen kebab meat. The European parliament’s health committee this week voted down a proposal from the European commission that would have allowed the use of phosphoric acid, phosphates and polyphosphates in kebab meat made of mutton, lamb, veal, beef or poultry. The full European parliament is now due to vote on the issue when it sits in Strasbourg in two weeks time. If it is rejected by the parliament, that would send the proposal back to the commission, leaving the future of the doner in limbo. The European parliament’s Socialist and Democrats (S&amp;D) and Greens/European Free Alliance groups have drafted a resolution to veto a proposal to authorise the use of phosphates in “frozen vertical spit meat” because they argue that there is no proven technological need. But Baris Donmez, the owner of a 24-hour kebab shop in Berlin’s Mitte district told the Associated Press that he believed the doner’s popularity would shield it from a ban. “Germans love doner,” he said. “Nobody’s going to take away it away from them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/damian-green-porn-work-police-mp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T12:08:03Z","webTitle":"If Damian Green looked at porn at work, that’s not a police matter | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/damian-green-porn-work-police-mp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/damian-green-porn-work-police-mp","fields":{"headline":"If Damian Green looked at porn at work, that’s not a police matter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Is everything an MP sees on his office computer a matter of public interest? That phrase in law does not mean public prurience or gossip or fascination, but what impinges on his or her public duties. Nine years ago police were sent, on the initiative of the then Labour government, to raid the office of a Tory MP, Damian Green, now deputy prime minister. They wanted evidence of a leak of a Home Office document, which he never denied receiving. It came from a dissident civil servant. In the course of the raid, which involved 20 officers and extended to Green’s home and car, Green’s computers were seized and opened. No further action was taken and the incident caused outrage on both sides at Westminster. This led some of the police officers to resent the criticism. One of them, though he had been ordered to destroy the seized computer archive, copied it and has since revealed its pornographic contents to the media. When challenged as to why no action was taken on the pornography, former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson correctly pointed out that it had nothing to do with the case. It involved “no criminality, no victims, no vulnerability”. There was nothing extreme, illegal or involving children or abuse, and therefore no public interest, no matter how improper one may consider viewing pornography at work. Nonetheless Green, who denies all the accusations, is now at risk of losing his job and his career under a general hue and cry. The idea that the police, on the orders of an opposing political party, can invade an MP’s office and seize and disclose to the public any material it hopes might blacken his name is worthy of a totalitarian regime. Even if there was cause to suspect document theft, the purloining of unrelated material against a rainy day is hardly ethical policing. As Stephenson says, there is nothing in the Green case to suggest any harm to anyone, beyond the possible misuse of a parliamentary computer in office time. In Dave Eggers’ dystopian novel of the digital future The Circle, all politicians are required to wear microphones and cameras during all their waking hours. Everything they do is to be “clear”, or they are assumed “to have something to hide”. It eventually destroys them. There can be few people in any walk of life who would be happy to open their entire computer archive to public view. Such intrusive surveillance should anyway be unthinkable in a free society. We should be innocent until proved guilty. Green is treated as guilty, and has not even a court in which to prove his innocence. I recently asked a group of sixth formers if they wanted to go into politics. No, was the reply. They wanted some privacy in their lives.

So that’s something to look forward to, no? Kick off is at 6.45pm, so join me here then – in the meantime you can find me @heidistephens on Twitter If you want to come and give me a wave. Thank you all for joining in and being entirely splendid – have a fab week, and I’ll see you next week! Hx Davood and Nadiya dance their final dance to So Long, Farewell from The Sound Of Musical. Quite hard to bum lift to, but Davood gives it a go anyway, and promptly drops Nadiya to gasps from the audience. Well that’s one way to go. Davood looks gutted – he’s been a superstar, and really should have been in the final. But hey, such is the way of Strictly. All the judges vote to save Alexandra and Gorka, which means it’s time to say goodbye to DAVOOD AND NADIYA. That means Joe is the last Strictly man standing. I still love this Charleston, and Alexandra really shouldn’t be in the dance off (even though that dress is something quite atrocious). Right, let’s revisit this Argentine. I’m not sure there’s much Davood can do – the choreography is very much All About Nadiya. And Nadiya’s knickers. That was, however, considerably better from Davood. “Mollie is willing to spend 300 hours training with me” says AJ. “And only half that time is spent kissing”, says Claudia. What larks. Mollie can’t believe she’s a semi finalist. None of us can, Mollie #justiceforaston Ah, this is bad news for Davood and Nadiya – barring a miracle, their Strictly journey is about to come to an end. I’m really sad about this, really wanted to see Davood in the Grand Final – he’s made the biggest improvement this year, but has been let down on occasion by Nadiya’s choreography. It also seems like the public is voting for Mollie and Gemma in droves, and not warming to Alexandra at all – it’s quite a feat to end up in the dance off when you’re top of the leaderboard. Very difficult to call how this series might end right now – the safe bet has to be Joe, but Debbie could easily win the public vote on the night. I wouldn’t even discount Gemma right now, she appears to be bulletproof. Mollie and AJ are safe (sigh), as is Gemm and Aljaz – which means ALEXANDRA AND GORKA are in the dance off. Bum and double bum. So who is joining Davood and Nadiya in tonight’s dance off? Please not Alex, I can’t handle another forgone conclusion. Shirley and Darcey are both wearing fabulous frocks, but they really shouldn’t sit next to each other - my EYES. KEY CHANGE. Yes I’m singing. We’re all singing. If you’re not singing, you’re dead inside. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of the Leading Ladies. As if one musical megastar wasn’t enough, we get Beverley Knight, Amber Riley and Cassidy Janson all in one supergroup. AND they’re singing I’m Every Woman, which is a solid gold CHOON. What’s not to love? Anyone for a dance round their handbag? SING ALONG LADIES. So who is through to next week’s semi (TWO DANCES), and who is the first couple in tonight’s bottom two? Debbie and Giovanni are safe (obvs), along with Joe and Katya (also obvs) - all as predicted so far. First couple in tonight’s dance off: DAVOOD AND NADIYA. Ah, we suspected that might happen. But I’d like to think he could win through if he’s against Mollie or Gemma. Last night on Strictly: Musical Mayhem. Highlights: Joe and Katya’s surreal Samba (also Joe’s arms – why have we never spotted these before?), Debbie and Giovanni’s dreamy American Smooth, Alex and Gorka’s swivel-tastic Charleston. Lowlights: Davood’s wobbly Argentine, Gemma’s so-so Quickstep, Mollie and AJ’s sexless Rumba (because apparently we give 9s for an illegal lift now), and Alexandra’s Mary Poopins dress. Can we all agree that this is Tess’s worst dress of the season? It’s a tough field, I know, but this one looks like she got jacked up on Pimms and passed out on a tennis court while the lines were being painted. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a semaphore cry for help, Claudia fabulous in red. Well that was marvellous. Didn’t really need the dancing, to be honest. Tonight’s pro dance is a Dreamgirls tribute, featuring sparkly contempo-waft from Janette and Gorka. And now we have Aljaz thrusting to “One Night Only”, which I’m very much here for. Ooh, it’s a medley. We LOVE a medley. And we’re off! Enjoy these opening credits, we’ve only got a couple more weeks. On the upside, we don’t have to look at Brian’s thumb much longer. Tonight’s Countryfile Casual Weatherperson is weathered dad Philip Avery, wearing a manky fleece like a man who’s just swept the patio but still needs to scrub the water butt before he can put everything in the garage for winter. I feel like Philip has taken the ‘casual’ brief a bit far, if I’m honest. Helen Skelton swigging tea out of a flask, staring wistfully at some hills in the distance, then dropping in a quick plug for the calendar is peak Countryfile. Evening all, and welcome back for some Strictly Sunday Results. Thought last night’s show was an absolute corker, helped enormously by only being an hour long (my typing hands are thankful), and some decent efforts at capturing a bit of Broadway razzle-dazzle. So who is in the firing line tonight? The only ones I reckon are totally safe from the dance-off are Joe and Debbie – any of the other four could be dancing for a space in next week’s semi final (TWO DANCES). I’m hoping for a dance-off tussle between Mollie and Gemma, but I have a sneaky feeling Davood might be in trouble. Kick off is at 7.20pm, so see you then! WAIT DON’T GO - stay for this two minute animation, it’s WONDERFUL. My favourite Christmas ad of the season. Bit dusty in here. And with that, another week of dancing is over bar the results show at 7.20 tomorrow, so please join me then. Thank you for joining in and being sparkle-tastic as usual – we’re only two weeks from the Final now, which leaves me sad and elated in equal measure. Enjoy the rest of your evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow! Hx So Alexandra and Gorka and Debbie and Giovanni are joint top of the leaderboard, and the voting is open! Another good week on planet Strictly - my pseudo-votes this evening would go to Debbie and Giovanni, Joe and Katya and Alexandra and Gorka. Who do we think is in this week’s bottom two? I reckon Gemma and Aljaz are pretty much guaranteed a spot, but can’t call which of Mollie and AJ/Davood and Nadiya will be joining them. Either way, the dance off could be a close-run thing for the first time since Aston-gate. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - another 39 for Alexandra and Gorka. Craig is clearly saving his ten for a special occasion. Bruno thought it was practically perfect in every way, and just the showstopper they needed to end the show. Craig thought Alexandra had better swivel than Gorka, and Darcey agrees that it was terrific - incredible detail and absolutely fabulous. Shirley thought it was amazing and Alexandra was incredible. I *think* they liked it. No idea why Alexandra isn’t recycling her Eliza Doolittle outfit from Movie Week, it was quite a lot more Mary Poppins than this skimpy affair. Clearly this is the adult version of Mary Poppins. But good lord, Gorka can sweep my chimney any day. Unsurprisingly, Alexandra has brilliant swivel, impeccable timing and acting skills by the bagful. Great lifts, great fun, just what we needed on a wet and chilly Saturday. Marvellous. And finally, it’s Alexandra and Gorka! This week they’re dancing the Charleston to ‘Supercalifragilistic’ from Mary Poppins. It was a bit of a shock seeing them in the bottom two last week, but at least they’ve got the Rumba out of the way. This Charleston should be an absolute showstopper, particularly with Alexandra’s West End experience – I have very high hopes. Comedy VT. DRINK. 7,8,7,7 - a total of 29 for Davood and Nadiya. So balance/control issues only apply to Davood and not Mollie, it seems. Good to know Shirley liked the character and the lifts, but Davood had some balance issues and didn’t look entirely in control. Bruno liked the powerful, menacing character, but a bit unsteady and uneven. Craig didn’t feel that Davood was leading the dance, but he loved the concept. Darcey agrees - started well, but Davood had issues once it got faster. Davood descends from a chandelier, and does a bit of solo shaping. It’s all quite dramatic, but I feel like Davood is mostly providing a pole for Nadiya to dance around/leap on, and Davood doesn’t look hugely comfortable with the technicalities of this. Some nice leg weaving, but not clipped enough to feel like a real Argentine. Hmm. It’s time for Davood and Nadiya! This week they’re dancing the Argentine Tango to The Phantom Of The Opera from the eponymous musical. BONUS DRINK if Nadiya mentions that the Argentine is hard for a man. Alright Debbie and Giovanni, get a room. I’d much prefer these two to be a couple, would quite make my year. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Debbie and Giovanni. Come on Craig, get your ten out. Darcey thought it was stunning, and she is purring with delight at Debbie’s fluidity and coordination. Shirley thought it was beautful - intimate, polished and hugely impressive. Bruno thought it was a smash hit - Debbie and Giovanni told the story beautifully, and it was mesmerising. Craig just growls - four tens, maybe? Debbie looks like Bonnie Tyler in feathery cuffs, but this is wonderfully moody and romantic - fabulous footwork from Debbie and bags of swing and sway. And those LIFTS - really enjoyed that, one of my favourite performances from these two, I think. Next up it’s Debbie and Giovanni! This week they’re dancing the American Smooth to ‘Memory’ from Cats. I’m expecting lots of lifts, and bags of style and class – this kind of dance is very much Debbie’s happy place. Scores: 9,9,9,10 - a total of 37 for Joe and Katya. I’m glad, I thought that was amazing. Craig was totally ready for this Samba to fail, but it was incredible. Darcey thought the characterisation was wonderful, and Shirley thought Joe’s acting was off the chart - fantastic. Bruno thought it was divinely decadent and slightly twisted - it could not have been better. Joe in full makeup is all kinds of fabulous, and I loved the ‘head in the curtains’ opening. This is an bizarre song for a Samba, but Joe is giving it both barrels regardless, and his acting skills have entirely come into their own. Absolutely bonkers, but I completely loved that. It’s time for Joe and Katya! This week they’re dancing the Samba to ‘Money Money’ from Cabaret. Joe came top of the leaderboard last week, and right now he’s looking very good for a spot in the final. However his Latin has been a bit shaky in previous weeks, so a decent Samba definitely won’t do him any harm. Scores: 6,7,9,9 - a total of 31 for Mollie and AJ. I have no idea why. Bruno could feel the fireworks (YES WE ALL KNOW THEY’RE DOING IT LET IT GO), and he loved the quality of movement. Craig didn’t like the illegal lift and it felt like dancing by numbers, but good hip action. Darcey loved how Mollie played the pure Sandy, but she wanted it to be more sensual, it felt too girly and not womanly enough (isn’t that kind of the point of Sandy?). Shirley loved how Mollie embraced the character, and her timing was impeccable. OK, so acting really isn’t Mollie’s thing, but it’s not as bad as AJ’s baby poo jacket. Mostly this Rumba is about looking wistful, without a huge amount of hip action or actual Rumba - nice timing but a bit sickly sweet for me. Don’t worry if you missed this one, you can watch it again tomorrow. ALSO, my daughter played Sandy in her college production of Grease in May, so I associate this song with bursting with pride as I watched her sing it on stage. I fear it’s about to be ruined forever. Next up it’s Mollie and AJ! This week they’re dancing the Rumba to ‘Hopelessly Devoted To You’ from Grease. Originally the BBC website said they were dancing this to ‘I Dreamed A Dream’ from Les Mis, which filled me with absolute horror – the sexy Rumba does not belong with a song about how shitty your life is, sung by a French prostitute. But luckily for us, instead they’re dancing the sexy Rumba to a song about how heartbroken and lovesick you are, sung by a wet blanket teenager with questionable taste in boyfriends. THANK GOODNESS. Reading the terms and conditions this week - Russell Grant singing them to the tune of ‘A Whole New World’ from Aladdin. Nope. Scores: 6,7,8,8 - a total of 29 for Gemma and Aljaz. Shirley thought it needed about 20% more in the acting skills, but she liked the swan-like posture. Bruno loved the Broadway Diva entrance, but Craig thought it looked a bit laboured and heavy and Gemma’s frame was bouncing around. Darcey loved the character, but agreed Gemma’s frame needed to to be more taut. Bonus drink for Shirley’s Newton’s Cradle earrings - can’t wait for them to start biffing each other. Aljaz looks dashing as ever, and there are already too many dancers (DRINK). I’m a bit worried that the sheer volume of Gemma’s cottage loaf hair/feathers will create too much drag and slow her down. This is a perfectly serviceable Quickstep, but way too much gapping and Gemma needs to point her toes. All good fun, but not sure that’s good enough at this stage in the competition. First up tonight it’s Gemma and Aljaz! This week they’re dancing the Quickstep to ‘Hello Dolly!’ from the musical of the same name. I’d really like to see Gemma in this year’s final, but she really needs to sharpen up the details if she’s going to get through this week. Can she keep up with Aljaz’s fast-moving feet? OUT COME THE STARS! Nadiya has forgotten to put a skirt on again. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a blue satin coffin lining and bouffant 80s hair, Claudia in all the buttons. I love them both, my favourite outfits of the season. OUT COME THE JUDGES! Shirley has gone fishing.

It was for women to train for the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), and although the competition was intense her application was successful. As a result she went on to become one of 164 female pilots during the second world war who were given the important job of ferrying military planes around the UK from one air base to another. Lofthouse, who has died aged 94, showed great aptitude for flying. Her first solo flight was in a Miles Magister, an open, low-winged monoplane. After qualifying, her initial work focused on delivering Magisters and Tiger Moth biplanes to flying schools. Later she moved on to fighter planes, including Spitfires. She was born Joyce Gough, always known as Joy, in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Her father was a professional footballer who later became a hairdresser, and her mother was a dressmaker. Educated at Cirencester grammar school, both Joy and her older sister, Yvonne, were dedicated to sport in general and to tennis in particular. Joy began working in the local Lloyds bank just as war broke out. But she had greater ambitions than to be a cashier, and sought inspiration in the pages of the Aeroplane magazine, the journal whose then editor had proclaimed that “the menace is the woman who thinks she ought to be flying a high-speed bomber when she really has not the intelligence to scrub the floor of a hospital properly”. When Joy applied to the ATA she had no idea that Yvonne had also put in an application, just before her. Both were successful and served together until the end of the war. As a flying member of the female section of the ATA – which also had 1,153 men in its employ – Lofthouse was one of what the press liked to call the Attagirls, working on pay rates equal to those of the men. That there was a women’s section and that it attracted pilots from around the world was substantially due to the efforts, before and during the war, of their senior commander, Pauline Gower. The pilots’ work expanded rapidly from the transport of medical supplies and personnel to ferrying fighters and bombers to bases around the country. For Lofthouse this meant a posting to Hamble, near Southampton, in 1944. Alongside workaday aircraft she also flew more spectacular machines. There were Hawker Tempest Vs, North American Mustangs and Supermarine Spitfires, all 400mph fighters. She flew a total of 18 types of aircraft – relying on a map and the view out of the cockpit for navigation – but the Spitfire was her enduring favourite. By 1945 she completed training for twin-engined planes, only to quit the ATA after the end of the war; it was wound up that November. In 1946 EC Cheeseman’s book, Brief Glory: The Story of ATA, was published, listing, on page 230, “Third Officer Gough, Joyce, Miss”. But jobs for women pilots were then practically nonexistent, and she had to turn to other things. After the war she married Jiri Hartman, a Czech Spitfire pilot whom she had first encountered while working at Lloyds. The marriage ended in divorce in 1966. Two years later, while training to become a teacher in Portsmouth, she met Charles Lofthouse, a former bomber pilot who had been held at Stalag Luft III prison camp in what is now Poland, where he had worked on preparations for the 1944 Great Escape. They married in 1971, by which time he was a headteacher and she was teaching children with special needs. It was only towards the end of the 20th century that the scale of the achievement of women such as Lofthouse began to be appreciated. Throughout her life she retained her links with her former female comrades in the ATA and attended many reunions. In 1990 she met young women aspiring to be RAF pilots at Biggin Hill, and in 2008 she was a recipient of a commemorative badge for the Attagirls issued by the government. She was also a patron of the Fly2Help charity, which encourages young people to take up flying. In 2015, at Goodwood in Sussex, she took to the air in a (dual-control) Spitfire for the first time in 70 years. She and Charles retired to Cirencester. He died in 2002. She is survived by a son, Peter, and a daughter, Lyn, from her first marriage, and a grandson. Another son from that marriage, Michael, died in 2008. • Joy Lofthouse, pilot, born 14 February 1923; died 15 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/after-years-of-toxic-oil-spills-indigenous-peruvians-use-tech-to-fight-back","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"After years of toxic oil spills, indigenous Peruvians use tech to fight back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/after-years-of-toxic-oil-spills-indigenous-peruvians-use-tech-to-fight-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/after-years-of-toxic-oil-spills-indigenous-peruvians-use-tech-to-fight-back","fields":{"headline":"After years of toxic oil spills, indigenous Peruvians use tech to fight back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Armed with territorial knowledge, rubber boots, smartphones and drones, indigenous Amazonians in Peru are doing what state and private oil companies have long failed to do: report oil spills that have been polluting their corner of the rainforest for decades. Fidel Sandi, 33, a leader in the indigenous Achuar community of San Cristobal, plunges a stick into the spongy soil of a palm swamp and watches as sticky crude bubbles to the surface leaving an oily sheen on the water. “The trees are drying out, the people gather fruit here for the market, there are animals here that they hunt, but everything is polluted,” Sandi sighs with a mixture of anger and exasperation. Gazing at the palms, he has a keen eye for the signs of oil contamination. Now he can use his smartphone to gather geo-referenced photographic and video evidence to report to Peru’s environmental supervision agency OEFA . His community still collect aguaje palm nuts and hunt peccary in this patch of wetland, part of Oil Block 8 which has been concessioned to Pluspetrol, the largest oil and gas producer in Peru, for the last 15 years. A company sign says it was environmentally remediated in 2009 but Sandi says crude deposits mean the food chain is contaminated. Oil drilling began around his village on the bank of the Corrientes river before Sandi was born. Oil contamination is not just a problem for this Achuar village but for fellow communities upriver; in the neighbouring Pastaza river basin; for the Kichwa in the Tigre river and the Kukama and Wampis in the Marañon and Santiago rivers, across a swath of Peru’s northern Amazon. Environmental monitors have come from all these places to San Cristobal to learn how to use this technological toolkit with a team from the International Institute of Social Studies at Holland’s Erasmus University and the NGO Digital Democracy . “With the internet and drones we can get images from the depths of the Amazon to the boardrooms of companies in a matter of seconds when before it would take days or weeks,” says the NGO’s Gregor MacLennan. “The modern world is already here in the shape of the oil companies. We believe that indigenous people need to be able to fight on equal ground.” Rafael Rojas, in charge of hydrocarbons supervision at OEFA says the drones “help to determine the affected areas with much greater speed and accuracy” when there is an oil spill. There have been scores of spills in the last year particularly linked to the deteriorating North Peruvian pipeline run by the state oil operator Petroperu. Petroperu has said it will expand the pipeline’s infrastructure and has a contingency plan in place to deal with spills. San Cristobal’s oldest residents can chart the oil drilling’s deadly legacy back more than 45 years. Sandi’s mother, Anacha Hualinga, says she doesn’t remember a time before there was oil in the Corrientes river. She believes its toxic impact has tragically marked her life. “My son died vomiting blood. My children have died, also my grandchildren, because of the contaminants, their bodies could not endure them. Others were born dead because they could not bear the pollution,” she said. Two of her children died as infants and three of her many grandchildren also died very young, she explained. “Today it continues, children are born with pains or wounds. For me it is very painful to lose my children and grandchildren.” In 2006, Peru’s health ministry found more than 90% of Achuar men, women and children in the Corrientes basin had levels of toxic-heavy metals in their bloodstream well above safe norms. In the same year, Pluspetrol signed an agreement pledging to reinject production waters laced with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and barium deep into the ground so they would no longer enter the water cycle. Pluspetrol, which has run the nearby oil block since 2001, has blamed a previous operator – the US-based Occidental Petroleum – for the pollution. In 2015 the US company paid an undisclosed sum to the Achuar people in an out-of-court settlement. Pluspetrol did not respond to questions. Peru’s health ministry has yet to carry out a toxicological study in the area and the people receive no medical attention for their specific symptoms, says América Arias, a public health specialist working for Equidad, an NGO. “Conditions are starting to emerge which can have no other cause than the pollution; cancer cases, deformities in newborn babies, congenital diseases, low cognitive development in children,” she said. Several scientific studies show the build-up of heavy metals in soils, as well as fish and animals consumed along the Corrientes, is potentially carcinogenic. The Amazon region of Loreto is one of nine regions in Peru where toxic-heavy metals produced by mining and oil drilling are damaging health, according to Amnesty International. Representatives have petitioned the government in Lima demanding a specific health plan and potable water. After a visit by the delegation, Peru’s health ministry said it would coordinate with the environment, housing, finance and energy and mines ministries to control and reduce the causes of the contamination. But Peru will have to start from scratch, says Fernando Serrano, an occupational health professor at the University of Missouri and an expert on toxic-heavy metal pollution. “To this day there is no national assessment of how many people have been exposed to lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury … and many other toxic metals which we know cause disease,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/01/lab-notes-abominable-news-for-yeti-hunters-but-a-strong-week-for-womens-bones","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T15:04:36Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: abominable news for yeti-hunters but a strong week for women's bones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/01/lab-notes-abominable-news-for-yeti-hunters-but-a-strong-week-for-womens-bones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/01/lab-notes-abominable-news-for-yeti-hunters-but-a-strong-week-for-womens-bones","fields":{"headline":"Lab notes: abominable news for yeti-hunters but a strong week for women's bones","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This week’s biggest stories Not yeti: that was the disappointing message for those hoping DNA analysis of nine ‘yeti’ specimens would at last prove the existence of the abominable snowman.

But they ultimately agreed to start talks about a rerun of the conservative coalition. Merkel is casting around for a coalition partner after her centre-right bloc shed support to the far right in the 24 September election. Her attempts to form a three-way tie-up with the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) and the Greens failed. Schulz insisted his party would continue to talk about all options, which could include tolerating a Merkel minority government, possibly in tandem with the Green party. He added that he had called the chancellor to complain about “inacceptable” leaks to the press. Whether the SPD is prepared to go all the way towards a coalition agreement with Merkel remains unclear. Schulz fronts a party which is split evenly down the middle on what he should do next. “We need big ideas for our country,” said Manuela Schwesig, the state premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and a former family minister. “As before, I remain sceptical that you can do that by carrying on ‘business as usual’ in a grand coalition.” The youth branch of the SPD is organising a petition which rejects a third grand coalition under Merkel and advocates that the centre-left should tolerate a Christian Democrat minority government instead. “We remain clear: the SPD’s rejection of a continued grand coalition was mandatory and right,” says the petition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/02/stormy-seas-in-canberra-as-nationals","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T19:00:03Z","webTitle":"Stormy seas in politics as Nationals under pressure in their heartland | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/02/stormy-seas-in-canberra-as-nationals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/02/stormy-seas-in-canberra-as-nationals","fields":{"headline":"Stormy seas in politics as Nationals under pressure in their heartland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senior Liberals have everything crossed that Barnaby Joyce will be heading back to Canberra after Saturday’s byelection in New England – if only to restore some order within the Coalition. To say the Nationals have been off the long run in Joyce’s absence would be a gross understatement. It would also be an understatement to characterise the Nationals-led rebellion against Malcolm Turnbull on the banking royal commission as merely audacious. Audacious really doesn’t get us there. Let’s consider what happened. A group of National MPs ran down the executive in full public view, and they ran down the prime minister and senior economic ministers at a time when the febrile political and media conversation has become consumed with a public seminar, fanned by the usual suspects in the rightwing media rantosphere, about whether Turnbull should still be the prime minister. Now, that’s some game of chicken: Nationals declaring open season on a Liberal prime minister. That’s a phenomenon I’ve not witnessed in two decades covering federal politics, and it’s one that pitches the governing Coalition into deeply challenging territory. But while the Liberals will be looking to Joyce to calm the whole show down in the event he is not taken out on Saturday night in some epic upset (upsets in politics being the new normal) – I’m not convinced the Nationals leader has a magic wand at his disposal. To understand this, we have to consider the fundamentals. The political order in Australia is disrupted. The Nationals are playing up, not because they are at a loose end, or a bit bored, but because they are under pressure in their heartland. The Queensland election shows us that voters in regional areas are again on the hunt for alternatives to the major parties. What the Queensland election also shows us, though, is that what works in the regions doesn’t work in metropolitan Australia. As Tim Colebatch points out in a blog for Inside Story, Brisbane is where the Coalition (which runs as the LNP in the state) lost the election. “Ignore that reality, and they’ll keep losing,” he said. So that’s the difficulty the Turnbull government faces – Australia appears to be pulling progressive in the cities, but conservative in some regional areas – and trying to marry the two, and speak to all audiences, is very difficult. You tend to trip on your own contradictions. The challenge of the split constituency is exacerbated by the obvious inclination of some disaffected voters to park a protest vote with One Nation, which fuels the outbreak of populism from the Nationals we’ve seen recently in Canberra. And on it goes, Mars and Venus. What resonates in one place costs you support in another. Basic logic suggests the Liberal and National parties will have to walk different roads to manage the various undercurrents in the electorate and better represent their constituencies, and in theory, this is no bad thing. I’ve advocated that the structural separation on the right should also extend to liberals and conservatives, given the broad church of the Liberal party these days is reduced to a factionalised, feuding congregation, with parishioners pushing one another over for the collection plate and the hymn sheet. Given these folks can’t get along, or compromise without bitching and finger-pointing and pointless revisionism, and given pretty much everything disintegrates into winner-takes-all, why not break apart and reform as a coalition with distinct but overlapping interests? I suspect the right in Australia would be stronger, and better represented as a consequence, and there would be more viable options for governing coalitions in the political centre than currently exist. But that’s not the current reality, and given everything is so fractious, given the resting pulse of the Turnbull government is either grim resignation or persistent agitation, it is hard to sanction a bit of pragmatic product differentiation without seeing it spiral into grandstanding and the kind of bold adventurism we’ve seen play out during the recent internal battle over the banking royal commission. And adventurism is highly combustible when disciplined Liberals, upset by what they would see as self-interested posturing by the junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, then either lose patience, or jump on the bandwagon, because in a parliament as finely balanced as this one numerically, everyone can play every man or woman for themselves. That game is, in fact, the easiest game in politics to play. The hardest game at the moment seems to be don’t lose your mind in public. Fortunately for Turnbull, one game Joyce has absolutely zero interest in playing is the abiding killing season favourite – let’s change the prime minister. While some in the Queensland Nationals might fancy a bit of sport which adds to generalised destabilisation and intrigue, which might just deliver a more conservative prime minister than the current besieged incumbent of the Lodge, Joyce wants none of it, and has made that clear both privately and publicly. So while Joyce’s return is a whole lot better than nothing, unfortunately for Turnbull, the remainder of this grim and gruelling political year is studded with a whole lot of something. Assuming Joyce survives, there is still the Bennelong byelection to come, and Labor, backed by its formidable campaign operation, is throwing everything at that contest. As of early next week, the declarations from MPs about whether or not they meet the basic eligibility requirements set down in the constitution will also start hitting the deck, doubtless setting off another round of hand-wringing, chest bumping and mayhem. In Canberra, it is all stormy seas, with no calming horizon in sight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/02/bruised-joyce-remains-new-england-favourite-after-dirtiest-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T01:54:40Z","webTitle":"Bruised Joyce remains New England favourite after 'dirtiest campaign'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/02/bruised-joyce-remains-new-england-favourite-after-dirtiest-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/02/bruised-joyce-remains-new-england-favourite-after-dirtiest-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Bruised Joyce remains New England favourite after 'dirtiest campaign'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce says he and Malcolm Turnbull are the “odd couple” but insists they have a relationship that is delivering for regional voters, and he says the prime minister is safe in his job “as far as I am concerned”. Before today’s byelection in New England, Joyce has leapt to Turnbull’s defence after a fortnight of open revolt against the prime minister by various National party figures, culminating in a call by the top-ranking New South Wales National, John Barilaro, for Turnbull’s resignation. Joyce told Guardian Australia he was dismayed by Barilaro’s intervention during an appearance on the radio program of the Sydney shock jock Alan Jones on Friday. “I feel hurt on Malcolm’s behalf,” Joyce said. “What possessed him to say that?” Joyce said the Liberals under Turnbull had delivered for the bush and he couldn’t fathom the instability in Canberra, which had degenerated into open conversation in political and media circles about whether the prime minister should remain in the top job. He said Turnbull had his full support. “He’s safe as far as I’m concerned.” Joyce is expected on Saturday to hold New England despite triggering the byelection by failing to check whether he met the eligibility requirements under the constitution to sit in parliament. He faces competition from 16 candidates, with the ALP, the Greens, and a swag of independents in the race – but neither One Nation, nor the shooters party fielded a representative. Losing the seat would be a disaster for the Turnbull government, which has already lost its working majority in the lower house because of the departures of Joyce and the Sydney Liberal John Alexander, who is fighting to keep his seat of Bennelong. Over the course of the campaign, Joyce’s personal life became part of the conversation around the electorate. An elliptical report in the Daily Telegraph in late October noted he was “struggling with issues that have affected his marriage of 24 years”. Party sources were quoted saying a “scandal” in Joyce’s private life and the existence of a “dirt file” were upsetting conservative voters. There have been security incidents during the campaign, with Joyce involved in an altercation with a man in an Inverell pub earlier this week, and reports emerged on Friday that a bullet and a threatening note were found at a school that will be a polling station on Saturday. In Armidale, the town hall and Joyce’s former electoral office were vandalised, with graffiti reading “no Barnaby”. Asked by Guardian Australia early last month whether he had done anything in his private life that he shouldn’t, Joyce replied: “My personal life is my personal business.” Asked again on election eve, Joyce replied: “That’s my private life and my private life is my business. What should not be done is people trying to make your private business, public business”. As well as facing questions about his private life, Joyce also had to issue a public explanation after the mining magnate Gina Rinehart awarded him a $40,000 prize for his efforts in the agriculture portfolio – a cheque he had to return. Joyce said the past several weeks had been a hard contest “and one of the dirtiest campaigns I’ve ever been in”. But smaller candidates are also crying foul, objecting to Joyce failing to appear at candidate forums throughout the contest, and also to a late blast of digital targeting after the media blackout. A social media campaign authorised by the NSW National state director Nathan Quigley tells voters in New England who lives in the electorate and who does not. Pete Mailler, a Boggabilla farmer and former chairman of Grain Producers Australia, is contesting the poll for the rural micro-party, CountryMinded. Mailler said the digital campaign was underhanded given Joyce did not live in Tamworth when he first made the move from the Senate to the lower house to contest New England. He told Guardian Australia the campaign was a “slur” and “pretty ridiculous” and symptomatic of the whole byelection campaign – “which has been anything but decent”. On Saturday, the federal transport minister, Darren Chester, hit the hustings for Joyce in Tamworth, handing out how-to-vote cards at the Tamworth town hall. “We just want to see Barnaby poll very well today, get returned and get back into Canberra and lead out team into the future,” Chester told the local newspaper, the Northern Daily Leader."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/30/republican-tax-bill-senate-republicans-votes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T02:42:04Z","webTitle":"Senate Republicans rush to win support for tax overhaul, seeking Friday vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/republican-tax-bill-senate-republicans-votes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/republican-tax-bill-senate-republicans-votes","fields":{"headline":"Senate Republicans rush to win support for tax overhaul, seeking Friday vote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senate Republicans are scrambling to corral votes for a sweeping overhaul of the US tax code, eyeing a vote on Friday with changes to the bill expected overnight. Republican leaders had initially hoped to advance their bill on Thursday. But a nonpartisan analysis released hours ahead of a planned vote compounded the late-stage drama by projecting the Republican tax plan would add $1tn to the federal deficit over the next decade. Republicans had contended the vast tax cuts enclosed in their plan would in effect pay for themselves through economic growth. But the analysis, released by the congressional joint committee on taxation, forecasted the tax bill would balloon the deficit even after factoring in the economic growth the bill is expected to generate. Senate Republicans are using a vehicle known as “budget reconciliation” to pass the tax plan using a simple-majority vote, leaving them room for only two defections. As several Republican lawmakers continued to express an array of concerns, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said late on Thursday that there would not be another vote related to tax reform until 11 am Friday. The Republican plan promises $1.5tn in tax cuts, which many independent analysts say would overwhelmingly benefit corporations and the wealthy. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average hit another record high on the prospect of tax cuts, pushing past the 24,000 mark for the first time to close 1.4% higher at 24,272.35. Republicans in the House of Representatives passed their own tax reform legislation this month. If the Senate succeeds in passing its own plan, differences in the two bills would have to be reconciled before a final round of votes – presenting further hurdles in the coming weeks. While no Republican senators have formally come out in opposition to the tax plan, as many as nine members have publicly voiced concerns over the bill in its current form. Among the issues was a so-called “trigger” mechanism that would automatically raise tax rates after a certain number of years if economic growth proved insufficient. In a dramatic twist on Thursday, three Republicans withheld their votes for more than one hour on the Senate floor after learning that the trigger did not comply with budget rules. Senators Bob Corker, Jeff Flake and Ron Johnson demanded assurances that there would be further changes to the bill if they voted against a Democratic amendment that would have sent the plan back to committee. Corker and Flake, self-proclaimed deficit hawks, had tied their votes to the trigger mechanism and wanted an agreement that changes would be made to offset the deficit, while Johnson bargained for fixes related to the corporate tax rate. After the tense showdown, McConnell suspended votes for the evening and announced that the chamber would reconvene on Friday, as Republicans were left to search for a way to offset the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. Earlier on Thursday, Republican Senate leadership had expressed confidence that their tax plan would pass by the end of the week. But with a 52-48 majority, McConnell has little room for error. “We are on the cusp of a great victory for the country,” McConnell said at an event with small business owners on Thursday morning. Less than one hour later, the Republican senator John McCain of Arizona announced that he intended to vote in favor of the tax plan. McCain, whom colleagues viewed as a wildcard because of his tendency to buck leadership, said he was satisfied the tax plan went through “regular order” in the Senate. McCain acknowledged in a statement that the tax plan was “not a perfect bill” but said he ultimately determined it would “deliver much-needed reform to our tax code, grow the economy, and help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money”. Meanwhile, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said she remained concerned by the impact of the bill’s proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate and the ability for taxpayers to deduct certain state and local taxes. However, Collins said she was optimistic after multiple discussions with GOP leadership and the president that both issues would be addressed. “Still, I am not committed to vote for this bill, because who knows what is going to happen on the Senate floor,” Collins told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Republican leaders were nonetheless bolstered by the support of McCain, who over the summer thwarted efforts to dismantle the healthcare law in dramatic fashion. Democrats seized on the report by the joint committee on taxation as proof that the Republican tax plan was not what they promised it would be: a middle-class tax break that would pay for itself. Holding a copy of the report, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said the analysis proved the bill was nothing more than a “holiday bonanza to multinational corporations and special interests”. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, kicked off a 24-hour rally to protest against the Republican tax plan. Expectations are soaring for the Republican party, which, despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the presidency, has yet to produce a single major legislative accomplishment this year. Donald Trump has called for a tax bill to reach his desk by the end of December, vowing to deliver a “big, beautiful Christmas present” to Americans. The president and Republican lawmakers already suffered a series of embarrassing blows this year by failing on multiple occasions to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s healthcare law amid opposition within their own party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/01/sia-review-when-she-transcends-spectacle-she-soars","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T04:52:11Z","webTitle":"Sia review – when she transcends spectacle, she soars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/01/sia-review-when-she-transcends-spectacle-she-soars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/01/sia-review-when-she-transcends-spectacle-she-soars","fields":{"headline":"Sia review – when she transcends spectacle, she soars","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Global Australian pop exports are rare; rarer still singer-songwriters who have become household-name pop stars in the second decade of their career. Yet Adelaide’s own Sia Furler – who’s been based in California for the better part of a decade – has made coming late to fame fashionable. Last night, she kicked off her first tour in Australia since 2011 with her first Australian stadium gig. Sia’s Nostalgic for the Present tour sounds like a paradox, but she has a point: pop trends move so quickly that we rarely stop to appreciate the art form’s progress. Supported by Amy Shark, Charli XCX and MØ, Sia’s homecoming doubles as a celebration of women in pop. The genre’s most successful and unique female auteurs owe much to Sia, both as a public figure and a behind-the-scenes songwriter. These are Gold Coast native Amy Shark’s first stadium shows, two days after winning her first Aria awards. As she opens her set at the start of the evening, Melbourne’s 30,000-capacity AAMI Park is less than one third full. But the few who are early get to witness a new artist with the self-assurance of a veteran. Shark’s performance is unpretentious but she has effortless rockstar poise. Adore has become an unlikely breakthrough hit, an uncomfortably naked devotional with a modern pop sheen that only makes it more moving. Her voice is intimate but her arrangements are grand enough to uplift a stadium. She’s the rare up-and-comer who’s more than worth the hype. Britain’s Charli XCX is only 25, but she might be this decade’s most restless popstar. Since 2012, she’s gone from goth synthpop to bratty pop-punk to futurist electropop. Though not yet a household name, she has a surprising number of crossover hits, having written Icona Pop’s I Love It, Iggy Azalea’s Fancy, and her own Boom Clap. Between running around the stage dressed like Sporty Spice, she delivers Fancy standing fearlessly atop the crowd barrier, holding an audience member’s hand for support. Charli is yet to write her own definitive song, but her latest work is beginning to unite her philosophies: romance and irreverence, new-wave synths and hip-hop beats. Her image is bubblegum pop but her artistry’s deadly serious. You could mistake the Danish artist MØ’s voice for Sia’s – she too sings from the throat and has the same charming disregard for clear enunciation. But MØ has a sly, wild charm – her voice can be cartoonish and disarming. Her music fuses the organic with the electronic, turning horns, harmonicas and her own voice into chopped-up samples. The growing audience is never more eager to dance than to the raucous Kamikaze or Final Song, but her Major Lazer collaborations are her best-known songs for a reason: they have the bigger hooks. MØ sings Cold Water acoustic and unadorned, outdoing Justin Bieber’s studio version – and Lean On is the most joyous song of the whole night. No one knows what to expect from Sia. As the sun finally sets, black curtains fall to reveal the artist in a giant white dress, face covered by her trademark black and white wig. She delivers Alive like she does every song – her voice is raw, her body almost completely still. Then, her dress comes apart to reveal a flock of dancers, with Maddie Ziegler at the centre. Only 15, making her name on the reality TV show Dance Moms before starring in the film clip for Sia’s Chandelier – and then five subsequent Sia clips, and multiple TV performances – Ziegler is a physical virtuoso to match Sia’s vocal acrobatics, embodying the songs’ emotional turmoil. The stage is sparse, backed by a blank wall projected with coloured light: a canvas for the dancers to bring Sia’s music to life. Sia’s aesthetic is a mix of childlike innocence and adult weariness – if she’s JM Barrie, Maddie Ziegler is Peter Pan. Sia is most moving when her vocals are understated. She reclaims Diamonds – her own composition – from Rihanna, as spotlights mingle with the crowd’s lit-up phones to recreate that song’s sparkling imagery. Reaper, the high point of 2016’s This Is Acting, is the most soulful song of her set. She plays only two songs from her pre-popstar days, but Soon We’ll Be Found and Breathe Me translate perfectly to a stadium setting. Their dramatic staging and expanded arrangements connect old to new. Through the night, Sia’s dancers tell a story of people trapped by their own emotions. As the songs grow more triumphant, they learn to break the cycle of depression and dance out of joy, not pain. But while their silent-film-mime-acting is graceful, you can’t always say the same for the songs themselves. Sia has radically reimagined how a live pop concert can be staged, but she’s not doing the same for pop music. Sia’s core product is the power ballad, often written around a simple central metaphor, a formula she calls “victim to victory”. Her best songs – Chandelier, Elastic Heart – are instantly captivating. Her lesser songs – Big Girls Cry, Fire Meet Gasoline – follow the same formula, but they’re pitched at emotional heights their lightweight metaphors can’t support. She’s smoothed out the old quirks in her songwriting, while pushing her voice to breaking point on nearly every song. Even Cheap Thrills and Move Your Body – ostensibly dance songs – operate at the same fever pitch. It’s hard to dance when it feels like Sia’s commanding you; the overall effect is exhausting. Great live shows are defined by the connection between artist and audience. The artist’s little, spontaneous gestures of acknowledgment are the difference between a recital and a performance. Sia’s wig – a novel way to maintain her privacy – has become a crutch. Without facial or physical expressions, her uncanny stillness makes her look marginalised in her own music. She’s a generous ringmaster – her dancers are always impressive – but unlike a singer, they can’t project intimacy all the way to the back row. You get the sense that they perform an identical show every night. All pop shows are choreographed, but they shouldn’t feel like they’re on rails. Too often, spectacle outweighs the empathy of her older work – but when she transcends formula, Sia soars. The Greatest is a worthy encore, possibly the most buoyant song she’s ever written. Her dancers collapse on the floor, exhausted, as the track fades to a whisper: “Don’t give up / I got stamina.” But the most fascinating moment happens after the show. The video screens follow Maddie Ziegler as she walks backstage through props and costumes into broad daylight, breaking the fourth wall. She greets Sia – wig on, back facing the camera – and suddenly, the true unmasked artist walks into the shot, smiling. Finally, Sia Furler has been humanised again. • Sia plays Allianz Stadium, Sydney on Saturday 2 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/01/honduras-election-protesters-clash-with-police-as-opposition-cries-foul","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T02:11:10Z","webTitle":"Honduras election: protesters clash with police as opposition cries foul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/01/honduras-election-protesters-clash-with-police-as-opposition-cries-foul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/01/honduras-election-protesters-clash-with-police-as-opposition-cries-foul","fields":{"headline":"Honduras election: protesters clash with police as opposition cries foul","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Honduras is teetering on the brink of its worst political crisis since the 2009 military coup after the beleaguered electoral commission failed for the fourth day to declare a winner in the presidential race amid mounting irregularities and allegations of vote rigging. The incumbent Juan Orlando Hernandez, a rightwing autocrat representing the National party, is accused of illegally meddling in the Sunday’s election in an attempt to hold on to power and deny victory to the opposition Alliance leader Salvador Nasralla. Protesters and police clashed near the vote counting centre (Infop) in Tegucigalpa on Thursday night as frustration at the unprecedented delays spilled out on to the streets of the capital. At least one man was reported dead and several others injured after police hurled tear gas and charged the demonstrators who burned tyres and threw rocks. Scores of security forces have been deployed across the country since Sunday’s vote for what activists fear will be a repeat of the repression meted out after the 2009 coup. The criminal code was reformed in the run-up to the election to enable protests to be classified as terrorist offences Carlos, a 17-year-old student outside Infop, said that Hernandez had to go. “We want a change, we don’t want this corrupt president any more … he’s committing a fraud, the people don’t want him and the people have the right to choose.” Anger is also mounting at the perceived failure of the international community to speak out despite a series of events which the opposition say point to premeditated fraud. For the first time since 1980, when Honduras transitioned from dictatorship to democracy, the TSE failed on Sunday to issue early results and the projected winner – saying nothing until nine hours after voting closed. The first results on Monday gave Nasralla a seemingly insurmountable five-point lead with more than half the vote counted. Nasralla, a former Pepsi executive and TV sports journalist, represents the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship which is dominated by the leftwing Libre party, which emerged from the grassroots resistance to the coup. Nasralla and his supporters celebrated and the third-placed candidate, Luis Zelaya of the Liberal party, conceded. But Hernandez and his media allies continued to insist victory would be theirs once the rural vote was counted. The TSE then echoed the National party’s claims about the delayed rural vote and Nasaralla’s lead started dwindling. But no technical reason could explain the delay as tallies from all 18,000 polling stations were transmitted electronically as soon as voting closed. And a test run conducted in the presence of diplomats and international observers identified no issues with the electoral computer system or flow of results. On Wednesday afternoon the TSE claimed the computer system “went down” for five hours. The alleged hitch happened just after Nasralla and Hernandez signed a document agreeing to respect the official results. Nasralla has since withdrawn from the agreement, claiming it was a trap. By Wednesday night, Hernandez had overturned Nasralla’s lead by several thousand votes, prompting thousands to spill onto the streets. “All the irregularities have been about buying time in order to reverse the real voting trend in order to declare Hernandez the winner. It’s obvious that electoral fraud has taken place … in a manner which was predetermined,” said Hugo Noe Pino, an economist, former minister, and professor at the Central American Technological University (Unitec) in Tegucigalpa. In another twist on Thursday, election tribunal magistrate Marcos Ramiro Lobo cast doubt on the credibility of his institution’s own results, blaming the alleged computer glitch on the sudden turnaround in favour of Hernandez. Ramiro called for an independent audit of the results. Nasralla said nationwide protests would continue until a recount of the paper voting tallies from each polling booth was conducted in the presence of party representatives and international observers. Jesuit human rights leader Ismael Moreno, known as father Melo, said Honduras was at risk of another coup by the National party. “The international community especially the EU, US, and OAS need to drop the false impartiality and instead take an active role in demanding and observing a physical recount as the TSE is clearly not credible. If this doesn’t happen, it will be catastrophic for the Honduran people, as we have no choice but to resist and defend the popular vote and sovereignty of the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/01/turnbull-appoints-former-high-court-judge-to-lead-banking-royal-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T07:07:33Z","webTitle":"Labor takes aim at focus of banking royal commission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/turnbull-appoints-former-high-court-judge-to-lead-banking-royal-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/turnbull-appoints-former-high-court-judge-to-lead-banking-royal-commission","fields":{"headline":"Labor takes aim at focus of banking royal commission","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has warned the Turnbull government it must get its terms of reference right for its royal commission into the financial industry, otherwise the “scandals” will continue and the public will remain dissatisfied. In a letter to the treasurer, Scott Morrison, he said it was a worrying sign that the government did not consult the corporate regulator before drafting its terms of reference, and Labor had serious concerns about the government’s narrow focus on industry super funds. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, claimed on Thursday the royal commission would be good because it would put industry super funds under more scrutiny, given they had “union members and whatnot on the board”. Malcolm Turnbull announced on Friday former high court judge Kenneth Madison Hayne would head the royal commission into the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. In a statement, Turnbull said Hayne’s “wealth of experience at the highest levels of Australia’s judiciary” made him the ideal person to conduct the royal commission. “He is renowned for his brilliant mind, his forensic skill, and his deep sense of justice,” Turnbull said. “The royal commission has been established to consider the conduct of banks, insurers, financial services providers and superannuation funds (not including self-managed superannuation funds). “All Australians have the right to be treated honestly and fairly in their dealings with the financial services industry.” Hayne’s appointment comes a day after Turnbull, and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, made the surprise announcement that the Coalition would allow a royal commission into the banking industry. With Coalition partners in the Nationals in open revolt, joining the Greens and Labor in the push to set up a banking commission of inquiry, the cabinet decided on Thursday morning to head off what Turnbull said was “a sense of inevitability” about an inquiry. The announcement was made after Australia’s big four banks sent Morrison a letter asking for a “properly constituted inquiry into the financial services sector” in a bid to end the constant “political uncertainty” for the sake of the national interest. In Bowen’s letter, the shadow treasurer told Morrison it was essential to have bipartisan agreement on the terms of reference, which he said must allow the royal commission to comprehensively investigate “the rorts and rip-offs”, including issues associated with the culture of banks, and executive remuneration. “It is also critical that consultation with banking victims’ groups occurs, to ensure that the victims are able to tell their stories. We also believe there should be strong protections put in place for whistle-blowers,” he said. He also requested the commission be asked to investigate how the roles and responsibilities of Australia’s regulatory agencies had changed dramatically since the financial crisis, with little parliamentary oversight. He said the commission should also be empowered to look into the conduct of liquidators. He said he had serious concerns about the focus on industry super funds. “This comes as the minister for immigration and border protection said that industry super funds will face more scrutinty, given they have “union members and whatnot on the board”,” he said. “Australians will be rightly concerned if such a narrow focus into industry funds simply means fulfilling a Liberal party agenda against industry funds and the union movement.” David Whiteley, the chief executive of Industry Super Australia, said the government had to ensure the public respected the commission’s recommendations. “Presumably they see a royal commission, in part, as a circuit-breaker, so it’s imperative that it achieves that. It’s going to have to be seen to be addressing all of the concerns that the public holds about banks and their vertically integrated business models,” he said. Bowen told Morrison it was critical Labor was formally consulted about the terms of reference, along with regulators and victims’ groups. “Failure to consult will raise serious concerns and doubts about the way in which the royal commission is constituted, given that the government has spent 18 months doing everything to avoid one,” Bowen said. Hayne was a justice of the high court from 1997 to 2015. He was first appointed to the bench in 1992 as a justice of the supreme court of Victoria, later serving on the Victorian court of appeal until his appointment to the high court. He began practice at the Victorian bar in 1971, and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 1984. He holds degrees in arts and law from the University of Melbourne, and was Victoria’s Rhodes Scholar in 1969, graduating as a bachelor of civil law from Oxford University. He was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2002."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2017/dec/01/every-little-thing-weve-won-since-weve-had-to-fight-for-sol-bellear-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T02:58:07Z","webTitle":"‘Every little thing we’ve won since, we’ve had to fight for’.

Sol Bellear dies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bundjalung man Sol Bellear had a dream that became a plan. He wanted to get a boulder, so big that the authorities couldn’t easily shift it, and put it prominently in Redfern Park. He wanted to affix to the boulder a plaque inscribed with some of the words delivered by former prime minister Paul Keating at that park exactly a quarter of a century ago. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us. With some noble exceptions, we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. Bellear died this week at 66, way too young by general Australian standards but old compared with the men in some Aboriginal communities, for whom he advocated, where male life expectancy hovers, a source of national shame, around the mid-forties. He introduced Keating onto the stage at Redfern in 1992 to deliver the speech that Sol, one of the leading Aboriginal activists of his generation and a rugby league legend, considered to be the most important gesture of black-white conciliation Australia has seen. That is why he wanted the words on that boulder placed immovably in the park, despite the resistance he said his plan had always met from council and state government authorities. We sat in the autumn sunshine at a café where Redfern Park intersects with the oval that remains the spiritual home of his beloved South Sydney Rabbitohs, the club for which he played. It was almost half a century since the 1967 so-called “citizenship” referendum for Aboriginal people and, while he sipped Red Bull and English Breakfast tea, Sol, who lived just across the road, wondered aloud “how the fuck is it that the lot of my people has since improved so little”. “Mate, it still makes me so angry,” he said. “And I’m not really an angry bloke.” He recalled how the black crowd was initially pretty cynical about neophyte PM Keating, thinking he was probably “just another white politician come to deliver platitudes to the blackfellas”. “As Keating started, he was a bit nervous, you know, and you could see the anguish on the faces of non-Aboriginal people ... and then the looks on the faces of Aboriginal people as he started to talk about the murders and the oppression. And you could see Aboriginal people in the park saying to each other, ‘fuck yeah – that’s right, that’s it – he’s nailed it’. Keating called it – the history – for what it was. And it all goes back to history in this country. All of it,” he said. “It’s all about Australia not having the balls to get up there and admit what happened [to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people] in the past. They just want to forget about all of the atrocities. The reactionaries of the world say, ‘Well Aboriginal people want this and that, why can’t they just let go of the past?’ Well, for fuck’s sake, Anzac Day is coming up again and the commemorations for that go on and on and, well you lost that [the Gallipoli operation] so why the fuck don’t you let that one go, eh?” History, he said, was important because its legacies – the trauma of massacres, stolen children, imprisonment and dispossession from traditional lands – reverberate generationally and manifest in entrenched poverty, disadvantage and third-world health outcomes. Governments of all persuasions (including Keating’s) had sought and found – but all too often, because of realpolitik considerations including public opposition to “Aboriginal welfare”, refused to implement – the solutions. “They did deaths in custody (royal commission), the national Aboriginal health strategy, then you had the royal commission into the stolen generation and it goes on and on. All these reports just sit there and gather dust. Now and then someone will pick one up and say: ‘Maybe we should implement such and such’ – or maybe not, because it’s all too hard.” A string of Rabbitohs players, for whom he has been an informal mentor and confidant, greeted Sol. One of them, Greg Inglis – one of South’s greatest ever players – stopped by our table. The two men bear hugged, talked about the season’s mixed fortunes and the injuries besetting the squad. We walked through Redfern streets that house the organisations he helped establish after moving from Mullumbimby in the late 1960s. They include the Aboriginal Legal Service (he was inaugural chairman), the community-run Aboriginal Medical Service Redfern, of which he was former chairman (his sister LaVerne Bellear is director), and the Aboriginal Housing Company. He was also deputy chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the 1990s and, more recently, a delegate to the Uluru convention on constitutional recognition earlier this year. People stopped him in the street. He knew everyone – including the beggars, to whom he often gave food – by name. As we walked he talked about the emergence of white Australian activism in the late 1960s and how so much of it focused on human rights of dark-skinned people in other countries, not least those oppressed under South African apartheid. “Some of us said, ‘Well that’s all well and good but what you are fighting for over there is what we are suffering from here’. Then the students were right behind us but we made it clear that it had to be abut Aboriginal people – we didn’t want someone else coming in and telling us what we should be doing. Over all they listened to what we wanted.” The cooperation with – and support from – non-Indigenous, educated people (doctors, lawyers, people with, for example, board experience) helped make possible the establishment of organisations such as the medical, housing and legal services. Sol Bellear’s life, ended way too early, made a difference to so many others. His strategy for Indigenous advancement was predicated on his belief that every incremental improvement for Indigenous lives would have to be hard won. “Things should be so much better for Aboriginal people. I think the country saw 1967 as the end of the fight. Before 1967, we weren’t counted in the census or anything as people. Dogs and cats and pigs and sheep were counted in Australia before Aboriginal people,” he said. “After the referendum, though, it was like the work was done for the rest of the country and governments – when it was actually just the bloody beginning. Every little thing we’ve won since, we’ve had to fight for.” He was still steadfast in his intent on seeing that boulder placed in Redfern Park, where he was such a fixture, when last we spoke. He bequeaths a legacy as large as he was in life. But unfortunately it doesn’t include that immovable boulder, which really ought to serve as a monument to Sol, too, in Redfern Park. Not yet anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T08:01:10Z","webTitle":"Tech firms fail to stop abusive content – leaving the public to do the dirty work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/05/youtube-offensive-videos-journalists-moderators","fields":{"headline":"Tech firms fail to stop abusive content – leaving the public to do the dirty work","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The viral YouTube videos featured screaming children being tortured, conspiracy theorists taunting mass shooting victims and webcam footage of young girls in revealing clothing. The disturbing clips drew millions of views and, up until recently, were continuing to spread on the site. Then, hours after reporters highlighted them to YouTube, asking for comment, the videos disappeared. The removal of the harmful footage illustrated a dark pattern in Silicon Valley and a common feature of some of the biggest tech scandals of 2017: journalists have become the de facto moderators for the most powerful social media corporations, exposing offensive content that the companies themselves have failed to detect. In the face of increasing recognition that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others have had detrimental impacts on society – whether enabling harassment and violence, spreading misinformation or threatening core functions of democracy – the companies have largely resisted fundamental changes that would reduce the damage. On the contrary, Silicon Valley has stuck to its foundational belief that tech firms are ultimately not accountable for the content on their platforms. They have outsourced social responsibility to journalists, watchdogs and other citizens, who have increasingly taken on the role of unpaid moderators – flagging abusive, dangerous and illegal material, which the sites then remove in the face of bad publicity. By many measures, it’s a system that is failing. “They’ve been quite content to let the general public or conventional news media do their work for them,” said Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, who has criticized Facebook’s impact on journalism. The philosophy, she said, was: “‘Maximize our presence and our money, and if something goes wrong, we will ask for forgiveness.’” On a weekly basis, reporters discover glaring flaws and alarming content, launching a predictable cycle of takedowns, apologies and vague promises to re-evaluate. Often, the companies’ arbitrary enforcement efforts and inadequate algorithms have failed to reject the abusive material, even though it violated official policies and standards. YouTube, for example, had allowed a wide range of videos and “verified” channels featuring child exploitation to flourish, in some cases enabling violent content to slip past the site’s YouTube Kids safety filter. Dozens of channels and thousands of videos were recently removed from the Google-owned site only because of revelations reported in BuzzFeed, the New York Times and a viral essay on Medium. Some families of mass shooting victims have also spent countless hours trying to get YouTube to remove harassing videos from conspiracy theorists. They’ve described an emotionally taxing and often unsuccessful process of flagging the footage. But when the Guardian recently sent YouTube 10 such videos, the site removed half of them for violating “policy on harassment and bullying” within hours of an email inquiry. YouTube also changed its search algorithm to promote more reputable news sources after a day of negative news coverage surrounding offensive video content attacking victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting. On Monday, YouTube said that it would hire thousands of new moderators next year in an effort to fight child abuse content in the same way the site has tackled violent extremist videos. With more than 10,000 moderators total across Google, the company said it would still continue to rely heavily on machine learning to identify problematic content. Facebook, too, has repeatedly been forced to reverse course and publicly apologize after embarrassing or unethical decisions by algorithms or internal moderators (who have said they are overburdened and underpaid). ProPublica reported this month that Facebook was allowing housing advertisements to illegally exclude users by race. That’s despite the fact that Facebook previously said it had instituted a “machine learning” system to spot and block discriminatory ads. The tech company said in a statement that this was a “failure in our enforcement” and that it was, once again, adopting new safeguards and undergoing a policy review. Facebook, Google and Twitter were all also forced to change policies this year after reporters revealed that users could buy ads targeted to offensive categories, such as people who consider themselves “Jew haters”. “They are concerned about getting as many eyeballs on to as many advertisements as is humanly possible,” said Don Heider, founder of the Center for Digital Ethics and Policy. “That doesn’t always bode well for what the results are going to be.” Facebook and Twitter have both faced intense backlash for allowing abuse and false news to flourish while simultaneously shutting down accounts and posts featuring legitimate news and exposing wrongdoing. For affected users, sometimes the best way to get action is to tell a journalist. Facebook reinstated a Chechen independence activist group this year after the Guardian inquired about its decision to shut down the page for “terrorist activity”. Reporters’ inquiries also forced the site to admit that it had erred when it censored posts from a Rohingya group opposing Myanmar’s military, which has been accused of ethnic cleansing. There are no easy solutions to moderation given the scale and complexity of the content, but experts said the companies should invest significantly more resources into staff with journalism and ethics backgrounds. Facebook’s fact-checking efforts – which have been unsuccessful, according to some insiders – should involve a large team of full-time journalists structured like a newsroom, said Kirtley: “They have to start acting like a news operation.” Reem Suleiman, campaigner with SumOfUs, a not-for-profit organization that has criticized Facebook for having a “racially biased” moderation system, argued that the companies should be more transparent, release internal data and explain how their algorithms work: “Without the work of journalists chasing down some of this information, we’re just completely left in the dark.” Claire Wardle, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, said the platforms were starting to develop more robust specialist teams doing moderation work. Still, she said, it was “shocking” that Twitter would not have detected propaganda accounts that a group of BuzzFeed reporters without access to internal data was able to uncover. “The cynical side of me thinks they are not looking, because they don’t want to find it,” she said. A Twitter representative touted its machine learning technology and said it detected and blocks 450,000 suspicious logins each day. The statement also praised the work of the media, saying: “We welcome reporting that identifies Twitter accounts that may violate our terms of service, and appreciate that many journalists themselves use Twitter to identify and expose such disinformation in real time.” A Facebook representative noted that the company was hiring thousands of people to review content and will have 7,500 total by the end of the year. That team works to evaluate whether content violates “community standards”, the representative noted, adding, “We aren’t the arbiters of truth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/01/friday-briefing-unwelcome-guest-trump-state-visit-in-peril","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T06:28:54Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Unwelcome guest?

Trump state visit in peril","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Diplomatic row over Britain First retweets deepens Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s daily briefing. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Friday morning. Opposition is growing over plans to allow Donald Trump a state visit next year after Britain’s much-vaunted special relationship with the US suffered one of its darkest days. Overshadowing her own three-day visit to the Middle East, Theresa May was forced to issue a mild rebuke to Trump in their ongoing exchange about the president’s retweeting of a video by rightwing group Britain First. The prime minister, in carefully chosen words, said during her visit to Jordan that she was “very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do”. But as UK diplomats waited in vain for an apology from the White House or for Trump’s tweets to be deleted, politicians of all stripes expressed concern about a full state visit next year. Justice minister Sam Gyimah told BBC’s Question Time he was “deeply uncomfortable” with the idea while a debate in parliament earlier heard criticism of the president. Still with Trump, and Washington is alive with rumours that he is about to sack his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and replace him with CIA boss Mike Pompeo. Multiple reports said on Thursday that the president planned to axe the former Exxon chief with whom he has enjoyed an uneasy relationship. Trump’s non-denial of the story on Thursday only fuelled the speculation – “He’s here. Rex is here,” was all Trump would say when asked – although the state department says it has been assured by the White House there are no plans to oust its boss. So no Rexit before Brexit then? * * * Set ideas – Preschool children are being grouped by ability and behaviour in classrooms in England, according to research. Around half of the 118 nursery school teachers questioned for the survey by academics at the University of London said they grouped their two- to four-year-olds for teaching reading, and a third did so for maths. The tendency to use groups increased later in primary schools. The researchers found children quickly worked out that they had been grouped according to different abilities despite the efforts of teachers to conceal the differences. * * * ‘History in the making’ – The world’s largest lithium-ion battery has officially been turned on in South Australia in a development that promises to transform the production and storage of electricity. Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Tesla, delivered on his pledge to build the 100-megawatt facility on deadline or for free after the state was blacked out last year. Critics blamed the state’s pro-renewable policies for the power cuts but Labor premier Jay Weatherill had the last laugh in the acrimonious debate when he flicked the switch to plug the battery into the grid on Friday. He called it “history in the making”. * * * ‘No one will be rescued’ – The Argentine navy has called off the search for the missing submarine, San Juan, which went missing in deep waters off the coast of Patagonia 15 days ago. “No one will be rescued,” said navy captain Enrique Balbi. “Despite the magnitude of the effort made it has not been possible to locate the submarine,” he said, referring to the efforts of countries including the UK, US and Russia to help find the boat. However, he added that the search would continue to waters less than 500m deep, angering relatives of the 44 sailors feared lost. * * * Pot luck – If the 3pm kickoff for today’s World Cup draw feels quite traditional, then the location of the Kremlin looks a tad unusual. England’s group stage opponents will be decided this afternoon in the unlikely surrounds of Moscow’s famous medieval fortress as the buildup to next summer gets under way.

And if that’s not enough, check out our equally wonderful venue/stadium guide, from Kaliningrad in the west to Ekaterinburg in the east. * * * Chain of fool – A Belgian performance artist who chained himself to a block of marble representing the “burden of history” from which artists cannot escape has been cut free after abandoning his plan to chisel himself out. Mikes Poppe was locked to the stone in Ostend and intended to slowly extricate himself but admitted defeat after 19 days. “This block was symbolic of history, the history of art, which I am trying to free myself from. I discovered that this is not possible. It is burden which I must always carry,” he said. Lunchtime read: National symbol or national disgrace? Deep in the bowels of the Houses of Parliament wires and cables run so thickly across the ceilings and walls that they have shrunk the space. Grease and fat from the kitchens drip on to the cabling, much to the alarm of our reporter Charlotte Higgins, who has visited the nation’s favourite gothic pile to see what is being done – or not being done – to stop the buildings falling into total disrepair. Billions need to be spent to rebuild the place, she says, but the problem is the political class fear the much-needed change will see the palace lose its mystique and perhaps its place as the “symbolic centre of the nation”. Our photographer David Levene went along too and has produced a picture essay on Westminster’s crumbling grandeur. Sport Joe Root’s England players intend to use the image of Steve Smith laughing at them after Brisbane as a source of extra motivation when they look to level the Ashes series in the historic day-night second Test that starts tomorrow night. Meanwhile, Ben Stokes has ploughed on with his plans to make a comeback in New Zealand despite his Ashes hopes suffering a setback and England’s players being told to move on from the prospect of his arrival in Australia. Tiger Woods has said he is “very thankful” after making a successful comeback from back surgery by shooting a 69 in the first round of the Hero World Challenge. And football fans at next year’s World Cup in Russia will be allowed to fly rainbow flags to highlight the rights of LGBTIQ supporters but must not promote same-sex relationships to minors, according to the former Chelsea player Alexei Smertin. Business The prospect of Trump pushing through his plans for $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts helped the Dow Jones hit a record high of 24,272.35, a jump of 1.4% for the day. Asian investors were more circumspect, however, as some US senators emerged as potential deal blockers after the US market closed. The FTSE100 is forecast to open down 0.24%. The pound is up to $1.355 and €1.135. The papers It’s all about Trump and his attack on Theresa May – well almost. The most imaginative front page award goes to the Mirror, which has an image of the Donald with the word “Wanted” on the top and a scribbled “Not” next to it. Metro doubles down with a headline saying “Twit hits the fan”. And the i has the headline “Special relationship in tatters”. The Times says the far-right group retweeted by Trump has been given a huge boost by the publicity and had received “hundreds” of membership applications. The Guardian splashes with “PM joins storm of protest over Trump tweets”. Interestingly the more rightwing UK papers play down what was undoubtedly the story of the day – a case of burying what its editors see as bad news perhaps? The Mail fails to mention Trump on its front, opting for a story about the NHS and prescription rationing. The Express goes for a health story saying cheese helps fight heart disease. And the Sun focuses on two army dogs or “hero hounds” who are going to be put down. The Telegraph joins the tabloids in the anything-but-Trump lead – splashing on warnings over levels of debt in Britain and only giving a few hundred words to the unprecedented war of words between the UK and US. Lastly, the FT has a financial angle on UK politics saying Jeremy Corbyn has “lashed out” at “big bank gamblers and speculators”.

This is a theory that has gathered so much pace that there is even a Mythbusters segment about it, meaning that the self-effacing director is frequently forced to explain how movies work to people who seem to be missing that lobe. Back in January, it was the Daily Beast putting it to the director. “Look, it’s very, very simple,” came Cameron’s reply. “You read page 147 of the script and it says: ‘Jack gets off the board and gives his place to her so that she can survive.’ It’s that simple. You can do all the post-analysis you want.” And people are. Latest to ask the question is Vanity Fair, in the course of an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of the film’s release. “Had he lived,” runs James’s response to the magazine, “the ending of the film would have been meaningless … The film is about death and separation; he had to die. So whether it was that, or whether a smoke stack fell on him, he was going down. It’s called art,” he concludes, gamely managing to just keep a lid on it. “Things happen for artistic reasons, not for physics reasons.” Ooh! At the current rate of seethe acceleration, Cameron is THIS CLOSE to answering the next inquiry along these lines with a rant akin to Jack Nicholson’s in A Few Good Men. “You can’t handle the movies! Because that’s how it effing works, you effing imbeciles! That’s how stories work! Of course they don’t both survive! Did you even watch the three hours of motion picture beforehand? Did you honestly think they were both getting out of there? CHRIST! I bet you think they should have got together at the end of Casablanca, too. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain my seminal boat movie to you or anyone like you! YOU’RE GODDAMNED RIGHT I ORDERED HIS DEATH!” Needless to say, the best comment on this kind of to-and-fro remains Robert Altman’s The Player, where Richard E Grant originally pitches his impossibly profound and idealistic movie and insists it must have absolutely no stars in it, much less resolve itself. He is adamant that the falsely accused heroine must be executed at the end “because … That. Happens.” By the time this thing makes it to the big screen, of course, we see Julia Roberts being rescued from the gas chamber just in the nick of time. As she looks into his eyes and asks: “What took you so long?”, Bruce Willis smiles back: “The traffic was a bitch …” So maybe fans should hold out for James giving in to pressure and substituting the alternative ending by the time we get to Titanic’s 30th anniversary reissue. Picture it: Rose hauls Jack back on to the floating door, and tells him how really quite cold she is now. “That’s OK,” he smiles, like he’s literally Roger Moore at the end of The Spy Who Loved Me. “I know a way we can warm up”. Yay! Yay for “up” endings! They can blow their rescue whistles later. I have a feeling the Carpathia will wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/30/mp-sammy-wilson-warns-brexit-talks-endanger-tory-dup-deal-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:39:54Z","webTitle":"DUP MPs warn Brexit talks could endanger party's deal with Tories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/30/mp-sammy-wilson-warns-brexit-talks-endanger-tory-dup-deal-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/30/mp-sammy-wilson-warns-brexit-talks-endanger-tory-dup-deal-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"DUP MPs warn Brexit talks could endanger party's deal with Tories","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"DUP MPs have told senior government officials in Downing Street that any Brexit deal giving Northern Ireland a separate customs or trade regime from the rest of the UK would jeopardise the deal that keeps Theresa May in power. The Conservatives’ minority government is propped up by the DUP’s 10 MPs, in a confidence and supply arrangement that sees them back the Tories in key votes. But senior DUP figures demanded a meeting on Thursday after reports that the government was preparing to agree that trading relations in areas such as agriculture and energy would remain harmonised between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit. One DUP MP, Sammy Wilson, said publicly that any move to “placate” the Irish government and the EU – by seeking to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union, for example – could see the DUP withdraw its support. “If there is any hint that, in order to placate Dublin and the EU they’re prepared to have Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK, then they can’t rely on our vote,” said Wilson. “They have to recognise that if this is about treating Northern Ireland different, or leaving us half in the EU, dragging along regulations which change in Dublin, it’s not on.” May was travelling in the Middle East on Thursday but Wilson said he and his colleagues would seek clarification from her in person. The government has been scrambling to reassure Dublin that it will reach an agreement with the EU27 that will obviate the need for customs controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Downing Street sources insisted the government would not countenance an outcome that involved any part of the UK remaining in the single market or customs union. But the government believes it can still safeguard cross-border cooperation in a series of key areas by agreeing to keep rules and regulations closely aligned. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said last week that any attempt to treat the region differently in terms of Brexit and relationships with the rest of the EU would appear to unionists as an attempt to decouple Northern Ireland from the UK. Although other DUP MPs privately emphasised they would be seeking a response from the government that would rebuff the border proposals, Wilson is seen as an important gauge of opinion inside the party. He said the DUP would be “making clear to the government we have a confidence and supply arrangement with them”. That deal allows the DUP to vote against some government policies but guarantees support in crucial votes of no confidence in the Commons and on critical policy measures such as the budget. The arrangement is predicated on a £1bn-plus aid package the DUP extracted from the Tories after the June election. Wilson’s remarks came as hostility increases between Belfast and Dublin over Brexit, with former DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson joining in the hostilities saying “the south needs to wind its neck in”. He accused Ireland of “lecturing the UK” and said it was doing “significant harm to north/south relations”. Earlier on Thursday Ian Paisley, issued a veiled threat to the Irish government warning “if you try to trip us up” it would “reflect badly” in post-Brexit agreements. His remarks on Irish radio followed his scathing attack on Ireland in Westminster on Wednesday in which he accused the country of acting “disgracefully” over Brexit and of being ungrateful for a £7bn loan during the 2010 International Monetary Fund bailout. By contrast, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, told the parliament in Dublin on Thursday that Ireland would not be painted into a corner on Brexit. He said the DUP might hold the balance of power in London but it did not in the republic. He stressed that there could not be “two jurisdictions on this island” after decades of co-operation and peace. Coveney reiterated that Ireland was willing to block progress of Brexit talks if a form of words offering regulatory convergence was not forthcoming. The row comes as parliament’s Brexit committee highlighted the challenge of resolving the Irish border problem in a new report on the state of the negotiations. The committee’s chair, Hilary Benn, said: “Our report concludes that we cannot at present see how leaving the customs union and the single market can be reconciled with there being no border or infrastructure. Even by their own admission, the government’s proposals are untested and speculative, so it has yet to set out how no border can in practice be maintained with the UK outside the single market and the customs union.” The cross-party group of MPs also called on the government to publish a white paper by March next year about its plans for an implementation period after Britain leaves the EU. “Businesses need certainty and reassurance to stop firms triggering contingency plans which could see activities and jobs move abroad. Ministers assured us that detailed arrangements for the implementation period could be published by March 2018. This deadline must be achieved,” said Benn.The former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble also warned that the Brexit border proposals on harmonising trading relations between the region, the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU were “extremely dangerous”. Lord Trimble, one of the key architects of the Good Friday agreement, said any move to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK would clash with the 1998 peace deal, which was based on the key principle that there would be no change to the region’s constitutional status without majority consent. The former first minister, now a Conservative peer, called on the prime minister to “quash this idea very quickly” as it would start to alarm the unionist electorate in Northern Ireland. Unionist voters might start to believe the Irish government, in pushing this policy through, was trying to break up the UK, Trimble said. Officials from the UK led by Olly Robbins, and from Michel Barnier’s team, have been engaged in intensive talks as they try to finalise the formal offer May will make in advance of the summit of EU leaders later this month. The UK hopes it has done enough to persuade the EU27 to move on to the next phase of talks, covering a future trade arrangement. That will require agreement that sufficient progress has been made on three key areas, including the Irish border, as well as the so-called divorce bill, now expected to be about £50bn, and the future status of EU citizens in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/04/ed-sheeran-comic-relief-film-poverty-porn-aid-watchdog-tom-hardy-eddie-redmayne","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T10:40:53Z","webTitle":"Ed Sheeran Comic Relief film branded 'poverty porn' by aid watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/04/ed-sheeran-comic-relief-film-poverty-porn-aid-watchdog-tom-hardy-eddie-redmayne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/04/ed-sheeran-comic-relief-film-poverty-porn-aid-watchdog-tom-hardy-eddie-redmayne","fields":{"headline":"Ed Sheeran Comic Relief film branded 'poverty porn' by aid watchdog","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Poverty porn” appeals fronted by celebrities Ed Sheeran, Tom Hardy and Eddie Redmayne are simply reinforcing white saviour stereotypes, according to an aid watchdog. The three films, made for Comic Relief and the Disasters Emergencies Committee (DEC), which raises cash for 13 major UK aid groups including Save the Children, Oxfam and ActionAid in emergencies, were nominated for “most offensive” campaigns of 2017 by the Radi-Aid awards. The annual contest, organised by the student-run Norwegian Students and Academics International Assistance Fund (Saih), is aimed at challenging aid groups to shift away from stereotypes about people living in poverty. The criticism followed comments by Liz Warner, the chief executive of Comic Relief, admitting the organisation had lost its creative touch and needed to be “edgy again”. The Sheeran-fronted Comic Relief video, during which the singer offers to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia, verged on “poverty tourism”, according to the jury. They described DEC’s Hardy-fronted Yemen appeal, which contains graphic images of unidentified starving and sick children, as “devoid of dignity” and a throwback to the 1980s, when exploitative pictures of poor people were rife. But it did offer some political context, the jury said, unlike the group’s Africa appeal, featuring Redmayne. The DEC’s Africa video was deemed “poverty porn and people waiting to be saved”. All were nominated for the Rusty Radiator award. Beathe Øgård, president of the Saih, said the three British films showed local people as victims and was an over-simplistic, outdated way to communicate about development. “We have been presented with these kind of images since the 1980s,” she said. “They are horrible to watch. People are so used to them that for many they reinforce that feeling of hopelessness and apathy – and even a negative view of development in that nothing is going in the right direction.” She acknowledged celebrities bring in donations – the DEC’s east Africa appeal raised £60m, while the Yemen appeal raised £27m – but said that they can distort the narrative, particularly when they are uninformed about the issues. “Ed Sheeran has good intentions,” she said. “But the problem is the video is focused on Ed Sheeran as the main character. He is portrayed as the only one coming down and being able to help.” Øgård said that in the four years the organisation had run the awards, she had seen more creative appeals, often by small organisations. Among those nominated for best fundraising film, or the Golden Radiator award , is one from War Child Holland, praised by judges as “powerful and positive”. “It shows it is possible to play on our emotions without playing on guilt,” Øgård said. “You see a child using his imagination and playing. It is a refugee in Yemen but could be a child in Norway. It really hits a nerve.” The film features a child in Yemen, laughing and playing with a Batman character. At one point, bombs drop and the family are forced to move, and we see “Batman” morph into the boy’s father. The words “For some children, fantasy is the only way to escape reality” flash on to the screen. The Radi-Aid awards grew out of a satirical video on aid fundraising in 2012 Radi-Aid: Africa for Norway, which went viral. Jennifer Lentfer, director of Thousand Currents, a San Francisco-based charity supporting grassroots organisations, said she had noticed a return to the use of images of so-called poverty porn among larger NGOs, as public funding is squeezed. “It is not surprising,” said Lentfer. “Pity and shame are easy emotional levers to pull. They are proved to bring in the dollars. It’s a transactional way of looking at viewers and readers, to say, ‘I just want your money.’” DEC’s Nicola Peckett said: “DEC is not about general poverty in Africa and the developing world. It is specifically for urgent and large-scale humanitarian crises where rapid action and funding are needed. We need to mobilise the public and the response very quickly.” Peckett said the model, where broadcasters film appeals on behalf of DEC, was a successful one, but the nominations had given the organisation food for thought. “We will discuss it with our broadcast partners when we review our appeals,” she said. Warner, at Comic Relief said its nomination would serve as a “constant reminder of the need to stay as relevant as possible going forwards and to give a voice to the people affected by the issues we care about”. “If we do win this award, I would still like to say thank you to the artists whose support means we have reached mass audiences and raised vital funds for life-changing projects in the UK and around the world,” she said. The public poll for the Golden Radiator and Rusty Radiator awards closes on the 4 December and winners will be announced on 7 Dec."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/01/fortnum-mason-struggling-to-recruit-staff-after-brexit-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Fortnum & Mason struggling to recruit staff after Brexit vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/01/fortnum-mason-struggling-to-recruit-staff-after-brexit-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/01/fortnum-mason-struggling-to-recruit-staff-after-brexit-vote","fields":{"headline":"Fortnum & Mason struggling to recruit staff after Brexit vote","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The boss of Fortnum &amp; Mason says the world famous London store is struggling to recruit staff after the Brexit vote with the situation most acute in its restaurants. Fortnum’s chief executive, Ewan Venters, said one in five of the chef posts across its six restaurants were unfilled as the fall in sterling’s value and concerns about anti-migrant attitudes deterred applicants. “Brexit is an alarming issue for me in terms of our ability to hire and retain good people,” said Venters. The collapse in the pound’s value means wages sent home to relatives are worth less but the businessman also sensed a change in mood among workers from the EU. “They are asking: ‘Do I feel welcome?’ That’s more the problem today.” Venters’ comments echo concerns of other business leaders who are worried about a shortage of workers. EU citizens make up a quarter of the 3 million people working in the UK hospitalitysector, according to a report by KPMG. Fortnum &amp; Mason, founded in 1707 and best known for its flagship store in Piccadilly, central London, employs 800 people. About a tenth of the staff are chefs working in its upmarket dining venues which include the restaurant 45 Jermyn St, which occupies the corner of the Piccadilly store. Venters was speaking as the retailer reported record annual sales and profits. Sales rose 14% to £113m while pre-tax profits increased 23% to £7.6m as the store becomes a destination for epicures seeking out British fare such as organic smoked salmon and salt-aged steaks from Northern Ireland’s Glenarm Estate. Fortnum &amp; Mason is also benefiting from Britons drinking more upmarket brews, with tea sales up 18% buoyed by unusual flavours such as lemon curd, gin &amp; tonic and bloody Mary. Sales of its famous monogrammed wicker hampers were also up 15%. “We are now anticipating a busy and successful Christmas period,” said Venters. “In times of uncertainty, customers turn to brands they trust and we have noticed an upsurge in the sales of traditional products recently.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/01/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T07:59:56Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/01/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/01/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) Giroud to get his chance against United? Olivier Giroud has had to be patient this season. Although he has been a regular starter in the Europa League, the man who was once Arsenal’s leading striker has not started a game in the Premier League this season. Alexandre Lacazette has overtaken his fellow Frenchman since his arrival from Lyon, giving Arsenal’s attack greater unpredictability with his elusive, speedy movement, and the 26-year-old scored his seventh goal of the season in the 5-0 win over Huddersfield. Lacazette then went off with a groin injury at half-time and his enforced absence against Manchester United on Saturday will force Arsène Wenger to make adjustments up front. Giroud, who scored twice as a substitute against Huddersfield, will hope that his chance has arrived. He would be the obvious choice. Yet Arsenal will not be as mobile if Wenger brings in Giroud. If their performance in the win over Tottenham Hotspur is anything to go by, they will look to implement a high pressing game out of possession. Danny Welbeck does not look ready to start such a big game, so it could be Alex Iwobi who steps off the bench, with Alexis Sànchez taking Lacazette’s role in the middle. Jacob Steinberg Jonathan Wilson: fear remains for rejuvenated Arsenal Mourinho delighted by Manchester United’s firepower 2) Allardyce to profit from travelling Terriers Considering the horrors that preceded it, few could have begrudged David Unsworth his caretaking curtain-call that was the shellacking of West Ham and with the Everton interim manager presumably off for a lie-down in a darkened room, it’s time for Sam Allardyce to take the reins. While it’s true that you can only beat what’s in front of you, Everton fans need to bear in mind that a win over the current rabble representing West Ham will not necessarily kickstart their season, even if it does provide solid foundations on which to build. Anyone expecting instant improvement under Allardyce may be disappointed; he needed six games to mastermind his first win at Crystal Palace and lost three of his first four as Sunderland manager. While he can be counted on to get the job done when parachuted in before Christmas to save struggling sides, his philosophy can take time to impart. In Huddersfield, who have lost their past four away games by an aggregate score of 14-0, he could scarcely have handpicked more suitable visitors for his first game in charge. Barry Glendenning Allardyce is appointed new Everton manager Rooney: Everton wonder goal ‘might be my best ever’ 3) Stuttering Spurs may be stung by Hornets It is more than three decades now since Watford last beat Tottenham in a meaningful match (there was an irrelevant Lee Nogan-inspired League Cup second-leg success at White Hart Lane in 1994, a rambunctious first leg having been lost 6-3) and last season Spurs scored four both home and away. However, not only is this season’s iteration of Watford a considerable improvement on the last, but Mauricio Pochettino’s side arrive at Vicarage Road in a bit of a funk, having followed defeat to Arsenal with a point against West Brom and another loss at Leicester. This should be the period when they hoover up points in preparation for a title tilt, with their 12 opponents between the Arsenal game on 18 November and the visit of Manchester United on 31 January including only one member of last season’s final top six, but so far they have failed to do so. Pochettino says fatigue is to blame and that “we need to rest players”; six of his squad have played at least 1,500 minutes of first-team football so far this season, compared with four at Chelsea, three at Manchester United and nobody at Arsenal. The last time Spurs encountered Saturday’s referee, Martin Atkinson was when he took charge of their 4-2 FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea last season. He last oversaw a Tottenham league defeat in 2012; Watford have lost seven of their last 10 Atkinson-officiated games. Simon Burnton Lamela admits he feared he would never play again Pochettino slams Spurs players’ lack of fight 4) West Ham head to City fearing the worst It is strange to think that West Ham won at Manchester City two years ago. Slaven Bilic looked like an inspired choice as manager, Dimitri Payet sparkled and West Ham’s defence held firm in the face of a relentless assault from City in the second half. On Sunday, though, they visit the Etihad Stadium fearing the worst, ready to adopt the foetal position after Wednesday’s capitulation at Everton underlined their miserable decline. There has to be a vast improvement if West Ham are to clamber out of the bottom three, but it is difficult to see the situation getting much better against Pep Guardiola’s flyers. Home games against Arsenal and Chelsea follow the trip to the league leaders and this is precisely the scenario that David Moyes wanted to avoid when he replaced Bilic last month. Conscious that December would bring a horrible run of fixtures, he was desperate to start on a positive note, but West Ham have picked up one point from the Scot’s first three games, scoring one goal and letting in seven. They face City with the worst defensive record in the division, with 30 goals conceded in 14 games, and could end the weekend in 20th place if results go against them. JS Football Weekly Extra: Sterling, English managers and more 5) More firepower needed for Newcastle Chelsea have won five and drawn one of their last six league games; Newcastle have lost four and not won any of their last five. Goals are the issue at Newcastle: Rafa Benitez’s side scored 46% of their season’s tally during a three-match winning run that straddled August and September. In budget signing Joselu, they have a striker who appears to have lost all sense of how to trouble a goalkeeper. He has started 11 of Newcastle’s last 12 league matches and contributed two goals – the most recent two months ago – and no assists in that time. “You cannot expect a player who cost £5m to perform like a player who cost £80m,” Benitez said of the forward before Wednesday’s visit to West Brom, when he again toiled fruitlessly, “but Joselu’s doing well, because he’s doing a great job for the team.” Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has not scored in any of his limited appearances since August, may replace him here. The teams have never met on 2 December, but though Chelsea have comfortably the better of their head-to-head record, Newcastle have won four and drawn one of the five games played on the second day of any month.

In an interview conducted with the Guardian 13 months ago, Alan Pardew, then the manager of Crystal Palace, mentioned himself in conjunction with the England job while conveying the – presumably false – impression that he would rather focus on leaving a legacy at Selhurst Park. He came across as being ambitious, progressive, a good communicator and – being Alan Pardew – more than a little pleased with himself. Karma, renowned for being a bitch, saw to it that his team lost eight out of their next 10 matches and he was duly sacked. It is against struggling Palace that he begins his reign as West Brom manager and his former club have every right to be concerned. While Pardew’s managerial spells at Charlton, Southampton, West Ham, Newcastle and Palace all ended badly, he enjoyed early success at all five clubs. While the famous Pardew effect inevitably ends with the sides he manages going into a tailspin, for now West Brom supporters will be relishing the prospect of his trademark early impact on a dressing room that had in recent months looked jaded under his predecessor Tony Pulis. BG Pardew out to ‘free up’ West Brom by injecting flair Sachin Nakrani: Premier League remains progressive 7) An intriguing first half at the Amex Both of these teams are having some trouble in the first half of matches. Brighton are yet to score a goal in the first 40 minutes of a home game, while Liverpool have scored eight between the 11th and the 30th minute of away games, but are 7-0 down on aggregate in the remainder of the opening period and 9-8 down overall. Jürgen Klopp’s side have somehow won three of their seven away matches despite drawing their second halves 7-7 on aggregate, and only keeping their first away clean sheet at Stoke on Wednesday. It is getting on for six years since these teams last met, when Liverpool strolled to a 6-1 win in the FA Cup with Luis Suárez in attack and Jamie Carragher at the back. They can expect a sterner test on this occasion, though given that Mohamed Salah, Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho played just 34 minutes between them at Stoke they will at least have fresh players in key positions. SB Gatecrashers at Amex a return to ‘dark days’, say police 8) Will Redmond respond to Guardiola’s pep talk? The way Guardiola was remonstrating with Nathan Redmond on Wednesday night, you could have been mistaken for thinking that the Southampton winger had said something insulting about polo neck sweaters. Instead it turned out that City’s manager was simply unhappy with Redmond’s failure to entertain him with his talent. “Last season he destroyed us here. I didn’t know him last season, I realised how good he is,” Guardiola said. “Southampton have some super-talented players, Redmond is so good one against one. But they didn’t want to play, they were time wasting from the ninth minute. I just wanted them to play. Today he could not attack because they defend all the time, but that is what it is.” Guardiola has been criticised for the way he delivered the message, on the pitch and just after the game, but maybe he had a point. Redmond is goalless this season and the 23-year-old can be inconsistent. He has a lot of talent, but Guardiola is not alone in wanting him to apply it more often. Southampton’s manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, would certainly be happy to see Redmond respond by taking the game by the scruff of the neck at Bournemouth on Sunday. JS Redmond defends Guardiola over on-pitch altercation 9) Managers under pressure as Stoke face Swansea Following the appointments at West Ham, Everton and West Brom, Stoke and Swansea are the only two clubs in the bottom five of the Premier League not to have changed their managers this season. Mark Hughes and Paul Clement have every reason to fear they are next in line for the chop, which ought to make their respective approaches to this tale of two Citys interesting. Between them, the Stoke and Swansea managers have masterminded victory in just five out of 28 Premier League matches this season, a state of affairs that is unsurprising considering the differences between their goals for and against columns. Swansea can defend but have the league’s bluntest attack, while only West Ham have conceded more goals than Stoke, whose strike rate in the opposition half is superior to nine other teams in the division. Quite what clues these statistics provide to the likely outcome to this game is anyone’s guess, but defeat for either team may result in the Premier League’s sixth managerial casualty of the season with Christmas Day still more than three weeks away. BG Match report: Stoke City 0-3 Liverpool 10) Wood has a point to prove at Leicester Following the rollocking midweek win over Tottenham that temporarily put paid to the notion that their football under Claude Puel would be dull, Leicester take on the team who have just replaced Spurs in the top six of the table. Burnley are unlikely to be as obliging as a Tottenham side that were 2-0 down (and should have been 3-0 down) against Leicester before any of their leggy and tired looking players thought to flick the switch. Following his masterclass in hold-up play during Burnley’s midweek win over Bournemouth, Chris Wood will arrive at the King Power Stadium with a point to prove. The New Zealand international striker made 62 appearances during Nigel Pearson’s reign as Leicester manager, but was restricted to just seven Premier League appearances during his final season at the club. Playing the best football of his career and the focal point of a sometimes breathtaking Burnley attack that aren’t afraid to mix things up a bit, Wood is unlikely to have any qualms about celebrating against his former side should he score and help continue his side’s remarkable ascent.

Issuing a joint statement for the first time since the tragedy, 50 bereaved families and a large number of survivors launched a petition calling on the prime minister to “take urgent action to restore our faith” in the inquiry. The petition asks the government to appoint a group of panel members with decision-making powers to sit alongside the inquiry chair, to better represent the backgrounds and experiences of those affected by the fire and “to ensure that those whose lives were devastated in the fire have confidence in and are willing to participate in the inquiry”. Survivors and the bereaved are asking that the inquiry is not led by the retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick alone but assisted by this panel made up of people with a “real understanding of the issues facing those affected”. They also want their legal representatives to be able to question witnesses during inquiry hearings rather than having to send questions in advance. Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the fire, said: “The prime minister has said she is committed to discovering the truth, but it’s hard to have faith in a process initiated by an establishment that’s been distant, detached and unresponsive to our concerns and an inquiry led by a judge who is far removed from the realities of our lives. To build trust and to discover the truth, we need diverse panel members to share decision-making power with Sir Martin Moore-Bick. “We have been told that our questions to witnesses must be submitted a week in advance to the inquiry. Not committing to giving our legal representatives the ability to question witnesses on the day is not a picture of a balanced, impartial or fair process.” Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, said the decision to launch the petition was a significant step for the bereaved because “it is the first time we have come together to issue a statement. We want to be listened to. At the moment we feel we are being ignored again, just like before and after the fire.” He said it was quite possible that survivors and the bereaved would not want to participate if the inquiry’s structure was not changed. “We don’t want that to happen because we all want to get to the truth, but they need to work with us. We have launched the petition because we’re losing faith in the public inquiry. We want it to give us answers and help to heal the trauma we have experienced, but at the moment our concerns are being belittled and ignored, which is causing more upset and anxiety.” Mussilhy has made a video explaining why he feels it is important to have panel members sitting alongside the judge to represent the experiences of the bereaved. It would help, for example, if some panel members had experience of living in tower blocks or going through the social housing system, he said. Sandra Ruiz, whose niece died, said she was also worried about the direction of the inquiry. “Unless the prime minister takes urgent action to increase confidence in the process, the inquiry risks perpetuating the gross sense of injustice we feel and becoming a whitewash,” she said. Public inquiries are either led by panels, with decision-making powers, or by a judge, as in this case, assisted by a small number of advisory “assessors” with niche areas of expertise, who have no decision-making powers. It is in the prime minister’s power to appoint the judge or panel members, which is why the families are addressing their concerns to May. The inquiry is due to hold two days of preliminary, procedural hearings on 11 and 12 December. A government spokesperson said: “The prime minister has given a commitment to consider the inquiry panel after the chair determined what further expertise he required and this process is ongoing. “We would like to assure all those affected by the tragedy that legal representatives of core participants will receive all relevant evidence, be able to offer opening and closing statements at hearings and will be able to suggest lines of questioning for witnesses.” Shahin Sadafi, the chair of Grenfell United, the biggest group representing the bereaved and survivors, said: “After all they have been through, the voices of the bereaved families and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire deserve to be heard at their inquiry. We urge the government to act quickly to address these reasonable requests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/02/supermoon-search-sundays-skies-for-decembers-moon-before-yule","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Supermoon: search Sunday's skies for December's 'moon before yule'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/02/supermoon-search-sundays-skies-for-decembers-moon-before-yule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/02/supermoon-search-sundays-skies-for-decembers-moon-before-yule","fields":{"headline":"Supermoon: search Sunday's skies for December's 'moon before yule'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first and last supermoon of the year will rise above the horizon in the east on Sunday and loom larger and brighter than normal as it climbs in the night sky until it sets the next morning. Known in the Farmer’s Almanac as the cold moon, the long night moon, and the moon before yule, the event comes as the December full moon coincides with the body’s close approach to Earth, making it appear 7% larger and 15% brighter than average. The moon’s orbit is not perfectly circular and its distance from Earth varies from around 222,000 miles to more than 250,000 miles over the course of a month. A full moon arises when the Earth sits directly between the sun and the moon. The supermoon will rise from around 4.15pm GMT in Britain, but will be nearest to Earth shortly before 9am on Monday morning. When close to the horizon, the moon may take on a reddish hue, because the sunlight it reflects passes through more of the Earth’s atmosphere, which strips out blue light more than red. For most observers, the shorter distance to the moon will make so little difference to its appearance as to be imperceptible. The difference between the largest full moon and the smallest as seen from Earth is on a par with the difference between a 1p and 5p coin. “It’ll be slightly bigger and brighter, but whether you can tell that from looking at it without an average full moon to compare it with is a moot point,” said Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The most dramatic views of the supermoon in the UK are expected soon after moonrise when it still hugs the horizon and appears huge against the backdrop of the skyline. The effect is down to the poorly-understood “moon illusion”, in which the moon seems bigger when viewed next to familiar, nearby objects such as trees, churches and tower blocks. “A full moon is always a really lovely sight to see,” said Kukula, “And as the moon rises on Sunday, you’ll get a feeling that this is a big-looking moon.” As ever for observers in Britain, the sight could be completely obscured by cloud. According to the Met Office, much of the country may be under cloud on Sunday afternoon and evening. With weather coming in from the west, the best spots to view the supermoon are expected to be in the east of England, through thinning and occasional breaks in the cloud. If the weather fails to cooperate, a virtual telescope project aims to livestream footage of the supermoon from its robotic telescopes. But if watching on a screen misses the mark, it is not long until the next supermoon, when conditions may be more favourable. The next two full moons, on 2 and 31 January, both qualify as supermoons. The latter is technically a super blue moon, as it will be the second full moon in a calendar month. Rarer still, it will pass directly through Earth’s shadow, creating a super blue moon eclipse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/07/my-credit-rating-was-sullied-after-fraudster-took-out-a-payday-loan","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"My credit rating was sullied after fraudster took out a payday loan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/07/my-credit-rating-was-sullied-after-fraudster-took-out-a-payday-loan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/07/my-credit-rating-was-sullied-after-fraudster-took-out-a-payday-loan","fields":{"headline":"My credit rating was sullied after fraudster took out a payday loan","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Somebody took out a payday loan in my name with Lending Stream.

Who are we, and what kind of world do we want to live in? Issues of loss, displacement and fractured identity were central to Boy Blue Entertainment’s powerful hip-hop work Blak Whyte Gray, which launched in January, and these themes were echoed by dance makers in the months that followed. Shobana Jeyasingh’s scintillating Material Men Redux examined the ancestral journeys of a breakdancer and a bharatnatyam performer, and Crystal Pite’s Flight Pattern (for the Royal) laid bare the suffering of refugees through choreography that engaged the eye, the heart and the mind in equal measure. In these post-truth days, conspiracy theories abound. Choreographer Rosie Kay and film-maker Adam Curtis spotlit some of these in their hallucinatory MK Ultra, a danced decryption of the fantastical threads running through popular culture. Director David Rosenberg and choreographer Frauke Requardt nailed the mordant mood in DeadClub, a surreal meditation on death and identity, whose illusions – wires, disguises, trapdoors – are all in plain view. Both pieces attempt the near impossible: to give form to the shape-shifting forces acting on our lives today. Ballet companies rarely attempt this, preferring to stake out the safe terrain of the past, and to outsource the present, with its more challenging and elusive texture, to contemporary choreographers such as Pite and Wayne McGregor. This is unlikely to be a long-term solution. The year has seen the premieres of several fine neoclassical works, with Kenneth Tindall’s Casanova (Northern Ballet) and Liam Scarlett’s Symphonic Dances (Royal Ballet) perhaps the most distinguished. But if British ballet is to win the younger and more diverse audiences flocking to contemporary work, it needs to use the language of classical dance to address our own times. The visionary choreographer Kenneth MacMillan died 25 years ago, and this autumn, in celebration of his career, his works were performed by all the UK’s major ballet companies.

Nightcrawler, the documentary or Alan Partridge’s Crash Bang Wallop: What a Video gone stateside. Why you’ll love it: there are true-crime shows that hide their prurience under a classical soundtrack, arty camerawork or a Scandi-noir aesthetic. But Shot in the Dark is pure, undiluted rubbernecking with barely an attempt at justifying the content. Look at this crash. Look at this fire. Look at this crashed car that then goes on fire. Drag your knuckles this way because have we got a show for you. A documentary crew follows three Los Angeles stringers, journalists who listen to the emergency wavelength at night and then race each other to the scene of newsworthy tragedies. Their footage can be sold for top dollar to news networks that fill their airtime with fiery spectacle and pixelated corpses on gurneys, wheeled into the back of the ambulances they so love to chase. Howard Raishbrook and his two brothers run RMG News and divide LA up between them, cameras always ready to zoom in on an almost dead man being cut from his vehicle or a half-naked drive-by victim receiving CPR at the roadside. Their chief competitors are Scott Lane, the embittered loner who hates every other stringer in town, and cocky young Zak Holman, who took over Scott’s business from him and expanded it rapidly in order to crush him. The documentary cameras piggyback on the stringers who piggyback on the emergency services, like lice on fleas on dogs. While the impulse to make a film about such people is understandable, the thigh-rubbing delight of the programme-makers here is not. Very occasional attempts are made to talk about the moral implications of profiting from prying on others’ suffering. But it just gets in the way of the flames getting higher or the newly widowed woman howling into the chest of her friend. They only stop filming when they’ve got enough to sell the story. Instead of trying to understand the psychology of a person who wants to spend their nights waiting to feed on human misery, the lens is too busy pointing at the flaming wreckage or the pool of blood. Their pumping adrenalin is underscored by beat-heavy music as the last plasma drains from the head-wound of the person they’re hoping to see zipped into a body bag. “I almost watched some people die,” says Scott as he puts his camera away shakily after sitting on the hard shoulder of the freeway, filming a broken-down car he was fairly sure would be hit by speeding traffic. He leaves empty-handed this time as the highway patrol arrives. But in episode one, Howard’s brother Austin does exactly this and is rewarded with the full impact/inferno. His resulting post-traumatic stress and decision to take a break from ambulance-chasing is just a side-note; one short scene in a diner between the brothers before we’re back to the thrills. The city at night looks cinematically cool, often depicted as an aerial-style graphic pointing out the positions of the stringers and their proximity to the bus fire or hit-and-run they’re all breaking their necks to get to. Every visual decision makes sense, but morally this production stays in the toilet throughout. “I hope they add more episodes soon. I’m addicted to this show,” says one over-excited IMDb reviewer. That’s the true crime genre in a soundbite. But change “episodes” for “dead bodies” and “show” for “seeing other people die in flames”. Everything that’s wrong with everything. Where: Netflix. Length: Eight episodes available now. Stand-out episode: I managed four and a half episodes and I don’t recommend any of them.

House lights dim. “Holy moley!” pipes a voice. All other exclamations are stilled by a strange howling. Two waist-high, rangy dogs lope onto the banner-fringed stage, bare but for a single bone. This causes contention. A snarling quarrel escalates into a farting competition. The older dog wins. He introduces the action (both dogs are puppets, operated by fully visible humans). This is set 200 years earlier, in the bustling Baghdad of market-sellers, musicians, storytellers, sultan and Scheherazade. Playwright Suhayla El-Bushra crafts, for the ancient stories of The Arabian Nights, a frame that brings out their power to transform our thoughts, just as they transform the shapes and fortunes of their characters. Scheherazade’s mother is a storyteller. She is imprisoned by the sultan (a ferocious Nicholas Karimi), who has forbidden storytelling (and sneezing and fun - most of the market traders are locked up). Scheherazade (wily Rehanna MacDonald) attempts to change the sultan’s mind, capturing his imagination via the very stories he claims to despise. If the sultan is captivated, so too is the audience. Francis O’Connor’s architecturally patterned, wittily mobile set uses the simplest means to suggest impossibilities and wonders. A sheet + some shadows = transmogrification of people to animals; a circle made of solid wood is suddenly a treasure-filled cave; while, with the help of another sheet, Mark Doubleday’s lighting, and nifty timing from Nebli Basani and Neshla Caplan, a whole, solid person disappears into a narrow-necked bottle. Joe Douglas’s direction combines with Ross MacKay’s puppet direction and magic effects to ensure that scenes cascade as El-Bushra’s thrilling script intends. The 10-strong cast juggle, perform acrobatics, play musical instruments and sing and dance to Tarek Merchant’s live music and Emma Jayne Park’s clever choreography.

About half of the 118 nursery school teachers questioned by researchers grouped their two- to four-year-olds for teaching reading, and a third for maths, with the use of grouping increasing later in primary schools. “Teachers have concerns about the negative impact of grouping on children’s confidence, self-esteem and aspirations, potentially leading to mental health problems,” concluded the research team based at University College London’s Institute of Education, who were commissioned by the National Education Union (NEU). About 80% of teachers in reception classes for four- and five-year-olds said they used ability groups to teach phonics – the first stages of reading, linking sounds to letters – while by year 2, 65% of teachers used groups for teaching maths. The researchers contacted and surveyed about 1,300 teachers and school leaders in English primary and nursery schools. The use of grouping covers all forms of differentiation, including streams, where children are separated into different classes, and setting, where children are grouped within the same class, as well as targeted interventions for specific pupils. The researchers found the groups were based on factors other than ability alone, including children’s friendships, behaviour and concentration levels. “Our findings suggest that grouping decisions are not made solely on the basis of attainment or perceived ability: issues such as classroom management, the need to balance the number of boys and girls and friendships were also key to grouping decisions,” the report says. It comes as the Ofsted school inspectorate published its own review of reception year teaching, which found “many teachers were devising tasks simply to tick off and record elements of the early learning goals, rather than developing a proper plan”. The NEU research, including surveys of its members and focus groups, found that many children quickly discerned which level of ability groups they had been placed into, despite the efforts of teachers to conceal differences. Two-thirds of teachers agreed that the children were aware of different ability groups being used, even if seemingly neutral names for each group were applied, such as types of fruit or animals. “We might call them foxes and rabbits, but they know,” one teacher was quoted as saying. Many teachers involved in the research defended the practice as a necessary response in dealing with children whose abilities varied considerably. “You have some children who already know all their sounds and everything like that, where you have other children who still can’t hear a sound, so it’s very difficult to teach those children together,” one school leader told the researchers. Half of the teachers who responded said they believed grouping improved overall attainment. “I personally think it’s better for the children because otherwise your more able children get bored and frustrated, and your less able children just get left behind. So grouping means that you can focus your attention,” one school leader said. Others warned that grouping could limit children at a young age and produce “disenchanted” groups that were more difficult to teach. “Ability groups can be highly limiting and lead to disruptive behaviour, especially at the lower ability end,” one classroom teacher said. “Grouping this way doesn’t particularly boost anyone’s confidence and self-esteem – the higher ability compete and feel inferior of each other and … the lower ability tend to be more disruptive.” Previous research has found that disadvantaged children are more likely to be in lower sets and have less experienced or qualified staff. Boys and children with special needs are also more likely to be placed in lower-ability groups. Ofsted’s report noted that 72% of pupils achieved a good level of development in reception class in 2016, although only 54% of disadvantaged pupils did so. The minister for children and families, Robert Goodwill, said: “Teachers and early years staff are best placed to make decisions about the teaching methods they use. There is no statutory requirement that suggests children should be grouped by ability. “We are clear that while assessment is a fundamental part of children’s education to measure progress, it should not cause significant stress or anxiety.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2017/dec/10/best-video-games-of-2017-observer-critics-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Simon Parkin’s best video games of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/10/best-video-games-of-2017-observer-critics-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2017/dec/10/best-video-games-of-2017-observer-critics-review","fields":{"headline":"Simon Parkin’s best video games of 2017","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As social media shrinks and quickens the world, and the threats we face seem to grow ever taller and closer, the relevance of entertainment (and, whisper it, art) appears to diminish. Surely the king’s ransom it takes to fund a blockbuster film would be more usefully and perhaps profitably applied to combating climate change, or Boris Johnson’s gaffes? What is a commissioned oil portrait if not the most extravagant of all selfies, taken in a world to whose indignities and injustices no one can claim to be blind? In this context, video games can seem like the hollowest endeavours of all. They cost ever larger sums to build, require ever greater numbers of talented minds to make, and distract ever more humans from the practical issues of reality. And yet in video games we often perceive some of the mathematical building blocks of existence, often follow the logical chains of cause and effect that follow our actions and reactions, and occasionally catch ghostly, flitting shadows of how life works and maybe even what it means. David O’Reilly’s Everything, released earlier this year, encourages empathy with other living creatures in the simplest way imaginable: offering you the chance to embody a moose, a rabbit, a cockroach, a raspberry, a pebble, a tuba, a star, through the spectral act of possession. You emerge, hours later, feeling a little closer, not only to fellow man, but also to fellow matter. At the other end of the scale, Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds (abbreviated to the preposterous, unpronounceable PUBG) shows the cruelty and duplicitousness of our species, by dropping 100 people on to an abandoned island and letting them fight it out using whatever weapons they find there, until only one person remains. Yes indeed: video games reflect humanity’s appetite for competition as much as cooperation. What a year, meanwhile, for Nintendo, a company that belligerently plots the opposite course to its competitors, to outcomes that can be as damaging as they are profitable. This year the gamble paid off, bookended by two of the finest works of escapism yet devised: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey. Neither game says much about the current world (although, extraordinarily, the latter briefly hops to New York City) but each deliciously provides a refuge from which even the most beleaguered soul will surely emerge newly ready to fight. Five best games What Remains of Edith Finch A young woman returns to the derelict island home of her youth where she inhabits vivid flashbacks that describe the various eccentric fates of her characterful family. This elegiac, memorable tale of family secrets could only be possible in the video-game medium, and shows how careful design can produce stories as affecting as any in the higher arts. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild After close to a decade of misfortunes – the toppling share price, the failure of the Wii U and, in the death of Satoru IwataBreath of the Wild arrived as a sweet wind of change. It refines many of the prevailing fashions in contemporary game design with Nintendo’s untouchable wit and flair and, along with the Switch hardware for which it was designed, is the crowning achievement in the company’s spectacular year. Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds With today’s concerns over home ownership and climate change, it seems fitting that the 2017’s most popular video game should feature people scrambling for resources and territory on an island threatened by a deadly approaching tide. The record-breaking independent game, which is based on the premise of the film Battle Royale, has now sold more than 20m copies, yet its spell on players is only strengthening. Everything A game in which you can inhabit, one by one, every animal, vegetable and mineral in the known universe. You start out as a moose, switching to a monkey or an apple or a frog, and eventually a planet or a sun, exploring the world at a speed and perspective appropriate to your size. As you dreamily play, you listen to snippets of a lecture delivered by the British philosopher Alan Watts on the nature of existence. The weirdness is intoxicating and, at times, moving. NieR: Automata This hyperactive action title from the idiosyncratic Yoko Taro – the closest thing Japan has to a Tim Burton – examines a time when humanity has been driven from Earth by the robots we have designed. A timely game for a current anxiety, then, and Taro’s fearless, fourth-wall breaking design plays with the theme in fascinating and varied ways. Turkey Life of the Black Tiger Such is the variety of game-making tools and distribution methods that even the most amateurish video games can appear on a global stage. So it is with Life of the Black Tiger, a game of such comprehensive deficiency (the juddering animations, the demented camera, the oppressive pointlessness of it all) that its shortcomings seem almost charming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/work-baby-mothers-infants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Why should work be a baby-free zone?  | Melanie Reynolds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/work-baby-mothers-infants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/work-baby-mothers-infants","fields":{"headline":"Why should work be a baby-free zone?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The care of kids, and I use this colloquial term deliberately, for that is how I was taught to name children as a working-class mum from Yorkshire, is debated ad nauseum. The stats tell us there are a million more working mothers today than 20 years ago. We know mothers give the bulk of care to children at home, but when the need to work arises – and maternity and paternity leave have been exhausted – they resort to a variety of providers: state-funded or private nurseries, creches and/or relatives. Usually, when childcare is discussed as a policy issue, the attention is on cost, with political parties competing to make it more affordable. This, it is often assumed, will make them more popular with female voters. The idea that both parents should be out at work, and their children cared for by other people, is rarely questioned. This is as true on the left as on the right, and as true of female politicians and commentators as it is of men. Not without good reason, feminists fear that standing up for the idea that babies and young children should be cared for by their parents is a short step from forcing women out of the workplace. Yet many women, and some men – particularly those in low-paid and unsatisfying jobs – go out to work only reluctantly and in spite of the fact that they do not believe separation from their very young children to be in their best interests. Today, as in the 19th century, the main reason for many mothers going out to work is that male wages are too low to support a family. Yet history tells us that there is, or once was, another way. During the industrial revolution mothers used the same childcare model they had in pre-industrial times and worked with their babies and toddlers alongside them. In my work as a historian, I have discovered accounts by female mill workers of how they took their infants with them to the factory, placing them at the side of the loom “in a basket”. Similarly, female salt mine workers around Manchester “carried their infants to work and once there, breastfed them and placed them down safely to sleep”. Women nail-makers hung swings from the ceiling as soothers and used large egg cartons to make cots, while Birmingham button-makers used sawdust tubs for the same purpose. For many women workers in the 19th century, taking their babies to work was their legal and customary right. This is not to idealise the Victorian working environment, which was harsh and dangerous. The abolition of child labour in favour of education was one of a huge raft of measures that made 20th- and 21st-century workplaces easier and more safe. But we can still learn from the example of the women workers who had no choice but to set about softening, strengthening and shaping their workplaces around their maternal needs. They domesticated workshops and mills by building makeshift cookshops, as they needed to eat in order to produce enough breast milk, and employed girls to run errands and clean for them. Some of these women were also top-class trade unionists. In 1875, an all-female strike committee, the Dewsbury and Batley Heavy Woollen Weavers Association, successfully opposed a 10% wage cut put to 25,000 workers and their families in 50 mills. Women trade unionists did not suddenly emerge for the 1888 Match Girls Strike, or indeed to become the Dagenham girls 80 years later. Unfortunately, these innovative childcare practices were outlawed after 1900 in favour of the male breadwinning wage. This meant that men had the sole responsibility of providing for their families, a political choice enshrined by David Lloyd George’s welfare state reform in 1908 via male unemployment insurance. I say “unfortunately”, in part because the hopes built upon the male breadwinning wage – that it could provide for families on its own – were vastly overplayed. The consequence was millions more families in poverty, and a situation that continues today in which, if the mother of a baby or small child wants to help boost her family’s earnings, she must effectively split her wage with a carer. Of course, punishing poor women is nothing new. Under the cruel 19th-century poor law, mothers had to pass their children over to a nurse upon entry to the workhouse. The economic difficulty facing single mothers is legendary – and forced many thousands into lifetimes of pain in the last century when they were forced to give their babies up for adoption. Even today, single mothers disproportionately bear the “scrounger” label, as do some married mothers who have to rely on state benefits because they can’t take their babies to work. Ten years ago, the Parenting in the Workplace Institute was founded in the US with the aim of providing resources for a growing number of employers, allowing new parents to bring babies to work. Currently, it suggests there are around 200 companies with such programmes, who have between them “hosted” 2,100 babies, usually for the first six months of life. Typically, parents who join such schemes are able to interact with their babies at all times, while their workplaces have designated rooms for changing and feeding. In the UK, our much stronger parental leave entitlements mean such arrangements are arguably less urgently needed, particularly by professionals who can afford to take time off. But many others cannot afford to take full advantage of their leave entitlements. Meanwhile, thousands of home workers are already combining paid work with parenting. In many small, family-owned businesses such as local shops, having children around – playing behind the counter, or helping out – has long been the norm. Nannies and childminders too sometimes combine looking after their own children with the paid work of looking after other people’s. Extending such working patterns to other professional settings won’t appeal to everyone – and in places such as hospitals or building sites, it would clearly be unsafe. But the idea that taking a baby or young toddler to work might be one of a menu of options would provide further choice for parents facing difficult decisions and reduced incomes in the first year of a child’s life. Ask yourself if it would really be so difficult to buy a frock from a shop assistant with a baby in her arms, or sleeping in a swing or sling. Would this stymie anyone’s sales technique? Perhaps we should be shocked to see a new mother in a shop without her baby rather than with it. Wider acceptance of breastfeeding in public places is arguably a first step towards more child-friendly workplaces. To get any further down this road will take committed campaigning, and backing from unions, MPs and feminist groups. But we can find succour in women’s history, which reminds us that in the 19th century some working women found ways to combine employment and motherhood, that I believe meant they had more rights and independence in respect of childcare than many women do today. • Melanie Reynolds is an associate lecturer at Oxford Brookes University and author of Infant Mortality and Working-Class Child Care 1850-1899"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/01/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-story-of-black-american-struggle","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T10:51:41Z","webTitle":"Arthur Jafa’s Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death: a story of black American struggle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/01/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-story-of-black-american-struggle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/01/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-story-of-black-american-struggle","fields":{"headline":"Arthur Jafa’s Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death: a story of black American struggle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shine a light When Jafa’s seven-minute montage film set to Kanye West’s Ultralight Beam debuted in New York last year as Trump became president, its power was immediately recognised.

As the snow begins to fall and the ice begins to form, Hera’s life is thrown into chaos when her brother, Aslam, is arrested as part of a counter-terrorism operation. Their parents Hektor and Calypso are distraught at the disappearance of their son, whom the authorities remove with neither warning nor information. Hera and her Uncle Lyle try to negotiate with the Kafkaesque bureaucracy that has taken Aslam. Her parents are suddenly, shockingly useless: “In that moment and with no warning I saw them as they really were, their powerlessness and their defeat.” But the weather conspires against them, as much as the police officers who ignore their questions and their smashed windows, once the arrest has been reported in the newspapers. Hera is not a good Muslim girl, according to her brother, with her art degree, her refusal to cover her hair, and her love for Raphael. Raphael, an older man who nurses a dark secret, has faced similar horrors before escaping a totalitarian regime and fleeing to London. Hera’s devotion to the man she first sees in a cafe is beautifully drawn: “I still had no idea how old you were. But I didn’t care. I just wanted to sleep with you.” Disappearance is a theme of Sri Lankan-born Tearne’s often affecting novel. Now, after 27 years, the ice is melting, and Hera begins to face up to her past. The scenes of post-apocalyptic London are compelling enough: the novel begins with Hera walking along The Cut, just behind the South Bank, and seeing a street sign released from its white prison for the first time in decades. But although the novel is intentionally dreamlike at times (with such a strange landscape, it could scarcely be anything else), this means that it lacks focus. It seems as if every plague that could hit a country has done so: the arrival of a perpetual winter, a pre-existing fuel shortage, food shortages, a rise in Islamic terrorism, even an actual plague.Although some of these disasters are contingent on one another (you can’t grow food in sub-zero temperatures), Tearne’s dystopia feels as though she has thrown everything at it. The precision employed in, say, Adrian Barnes’s Nod, where society is devastated by collective permanent insomnia, or Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven, in which the majority of humanity is wiped out by a virulent flu strain, is missing here. And it is that precision that makes the best post-apocalyptic novels seem so horribly plausible. Tearne sets up her world, but she doesn’t quite trust her readers to work things out for themselves, so we occasionally hear what sounds suspiciously like the author’s voice through the narrator’s: “With the scarcity of bees – no government had stopped the use of pesticides in spite of all the protests – some plants had died out.” The novel is at its best when it concentrates on Hera and the disconnection she feels from her family and her background. In the aftermath of Aslam’s arrest, she is chastised by a superstitious neighbour. “I wanted to punch her, to shout, to run out of the house. I felt as though I was drowning in my childhood. My whole life has been one long struggle to survive, I wanted to scream at them both. Being born in the West isn’t enough.” The use of names from Greek myth is a curious choice – Hera shows little sign of resembling her goddess-namesake, any more than Hektor seems a tower of strength for his beleaguered family. Scylla is a local soothsayer, but not sea-monsterish. That Raphael has a Spanish-Greek name (Raphael Kalchas – the latter the name of a Greek priest in the Trojan war) blurs the difference between his background (non-specifically South American, though the book’s acknowledgments imply Chilean) and Hera’s, and thus their affair feels less transgressive, and less magical. The Trojan war is cited as an archetypally futile conflict, but that doesn’t seem reason enough for Tearne to take the names of most of her characters from Homer, and it obfuscates rather than illuminates her story. But her prose reflects the icy beauty of the snow: “We crossed the snaking bone of the river.” And the novel is a thoughtful exploration of what it is to be a migrant and the child of migrants in a time of global crisis. • Natalie Haynes’s The Children of Jocasta is published by Mantle.

Less than 48 hours ago, Hernández, 45, was deported to Tijuana after 25 years as an undocumented migrant in southern California. Her five children, aged three to 23, were born in California, and they now have to live without their mother. Minutes before being escorted to the border, US immigration agents informed her that she was banned from entering the US for 10 years. Sitting tensely on a patio chair within a gated migrant shelter just a couple of miles from the border, Hernández is dazed, weepy, and tormented about what to do next. “I have to go to my children but I’m scared to cross again. What if I’m caught and they lock me up for a long time? What if I’m attacked by criminals? Maybe I should stay here and get a job so I can send money to my children, or go to my family or send for the youngest and let the others stay in school,” Hernández asks frantically, while checking her phone for the umpteenth time. “I don’t know what to think, or what to do. What should I do?” Hernández is waiting for a call from her eldest daughter, aged 23, who visited Madre Asunta, the Scalabrini nuns’ shelter for women and children in Tijuana, bringing her a sports bag filled with clothes, toiletries and the all-important phone. In one fell swoop, Hernández lost her children and her partner. Her three-year old has a different father and a different surname to her siblings, which makes crossing the border difficult. The child’s father, Hernández’s partner for the past five years, is also undocumented, and cannot cross the border. “My little girl won’t stop crying. She wants to know when I’ll be back, I don’t know what to tell her?” ‘Where could I run with five children?’ For Hernández, the nightmare started three months earlier when Ice agents surrounded her car as she was about to set off for work. It wasn’t entirely unexpected. Two weeks earlier, the Mexican restaurant where she worked under her real name and a black-market social security number was raided. “I knew they’d come looking for me, but where could I run with five children? I kept going to work, but my time was up.” Hernández was jailed for falsifying work papers. Nevertheless, deportation still came as a shock. She was planning to seek asylum, frightened by the escalating bloodshed in the southern state of Guerrero, where she was born and where her parents still live. Every person who asks for asylum has the right to a “fear interview”, to gauge the level and type of threats they could face if deported. But out of the blue, Hernández says she was handed over to Ice agents and told to sign deportation papers written in English she didn’t understand. “I asked about asylum but the agent got angry. ‘Los Angeles is violent, there’s violence everywhere,’ she told me, and that was that.” An hour or so after being handed over by prison guards to Ice, she was in Mexico – and the life she’d built in America over 25 years over. Tijuana, where she arrived, is a bustling coastal metropolis bordering San Diego, and one of the fastest growing cities in Mexico with 1.7 million habitants. It’s an economic and cultural hub, which has long been a magnet for economic migrants drawn here by jobs at the 500-plus maquiladoras that take advantage of cheap labour and free exports thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Hernández was 20 when a cousin persuaded her to leave the tropics of Guerrero in southern Mexico to find work in California, paying a coyote or smuggler just $200 to guide them across in 1992. After being deported in 2004 and 2009, she crossed back within a couple of days. Today, the going rate for coyotes ranges between $8,000 and $14,000. These days, relatively few people attempt this section of the border: it’s partially walled, and heavily patrolled by agents armed with high-tech surveillance equipment. (Eight aesthetic prototypes for Trump’s promised metal wall loom across the border, just east of Tijuana airport.) Instead, Tijuana has become a land of the deported, its 15 or so shelters full of ruined lives. It is Mexico’s top deportation destination, where one in five deportees are placed, irrespective of whether they have a connection to the city. Almost 24,000 people were deported here between January and September this year; most were living and working in California when detained. ‘My three children are in America. I won’t let Trump beat me’ Outside Tijuana’s modern immigration facility, a hotchpotch of street vendors hawk chewing gum, hotdogs and sugary peanut bars while a police officer swigs an energy drink between blowing his whistle at taxi drivers to keep the traffic moving. This is the world’s busiest border crossing, with 300,000 or so visitors using the connecting bridge by foot or car into Tijuana every day. Day and night, a constant flow of tourists, shoppers, partygoers and businessmen emerge here, within walking distance from the seedy downtown bars where prostitution and drugs are rife. The deportees step out dazed and confused into this edgy junction. Those in prison-issued grey sweats are the easiest to spot, but there are plenty of other clues. After a couple of hours waiting under the blazing sun, three young men saunter out wearing Los Angeles street getup and trainers without laces, each carrying a brown paper bag. They were born in the central state of Michoacán, speak Spanish poorly, and say they met in juvenile detention. Two are heavily tattooed, full of swagger and head straight to the pharmacy opposite to buy pills. The third says he was jailed for stealing a truck and seems genuinely stunned to be here. “Where am I, is this T?” he asks, using Los Angeles slang for Tijuana. “We don’t need help, I have money,” he says pulling out a small wad of dollar bills before realising he has the wrong currency. “Oh, do I need pesos?” Local advocates say that at the entry point, Mexican authorities do a good job. The deportees get food, free phone calls and emergency medical care, and bus tickets are available to anywhere in the country. (The Guardian was denied access to the facility.) Activists stationed inside offer transport to shelters. The city’s dark underbelly of drugs and violence can also swallow up deported migrants. “The problems start the minute they leave immigration,” says Victor Clark, who runs the bi-national human rights office in Tijuana. “They’re disorientated, in shock, easy to identify and so ideal victims to be swept up by police under pressure to give the impression they are combating crime.” Downtown police sweeps are common, and freshly deported migrants are perfect fodder for officers with arrest quotas, according to one long serving officer who asked not to be named. This year is Tijuana’s bloodiest on record, with at least 1,600 murders so far. The spiralling violence is closely linked to the fractured drug market competing for tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of crystal meth and heroin addicts. Scores live in makeshift cardboard and stone caves along the Tijuana river, known as the canal, which stretches across the city. It’s in the drug world that deported gang members may find work opportunities, while others can be sucked into addiction by free samples offered to newcomers. The shelters try to catch people before it’s too late. It’s 7am and already there’s a queue outside the downtown Salesian Father Chava soup kitchen as dozens of volunteers – deported migrants and churchgoers – prepare breakfast for the city’s homeless, unemployed, or disabled. Inside, a towering sombre statue of Jesus on the cross welcomes you into the dining room, where a thousand or so breakfasts are served every morning. Cheers erupt as news breaks that pork tacos are on the menu, rather than the usual beans and rice. “It’s a miracle, it going to rain,” jokes Flaco [Skinny], who was deported “years ago”. His sunken eyes, skittish gait, and rapid speech suggest chronic drug use, but he doesn’t want to talk about it. Also queuing is Andres Perez, 43, who chirpily shares how he’s tried and failed to re-enter the US 25 times since being deported four months ago. “I was driving drunk, it’s our [Mexican] weak point. But my life is over there, my three children are in America. I won’t let Trump beat me.” Around 20% of those deported to Tijuana try to return to the US, unable to let it go. Half return to their town of origin; the rest stay in Tijuana to find work and be close to their families or because they have nowhere else to go or nothing left to lose. “Deportation is like bereavement, it’s a huge loss and if there’s no help, the streets will take you,” says project coordinator Claudia Portela. A veteran deported after 70 years Finding help is often down to luck. Miguel “Rocky” Hernández, 71, was just one year old when he arrived on American soil. A Vietnam veteran, he was deported in June after more than 70 years in the US. Hernández, a talented drummer who back in the day played on the Latin music circuit with Freddy Fender and Jorge Santana, was handed over to immigration after serving five years for drink driving violations and cloning DVDs. An Ice agent asked Hernández if he knew Spanish because he was going home. “I am home, I told him, but he just laughed.” Hernández arrived in Tijuana late at night still wearing his prison sweats. “I had no money, I didn’t know where I was, what to do, or what to say,” he tells me, preferring to speak English. Confused and disorientated, a passerby took pity and paid a taxi driver 60 pesos, just over $3, to take Hernández to the Scalabrini men’s shelter. Within a few weeks Hernández, a seasoned hustler, found work at a barber’s shop and rented this apartment, decorating the walls with Marilyn Monroe posters. Things were looking up, when Hernández was attacked by muggers on his way to work and suffered a fractured hip. He needed emergency surgery but the surgeons at the public hospital were in Mexico City, treating the September earthquake victims. He applied for humanitarian parole, requesting permission to return briefly to San Diego for free treatment at the veterans’ hospital. It was rejected. Hernández spent a month in hospital in terrible pain, waiting for surgery. There are no official figures, but activists believe thousands of veterans like him have been deported in recent years. “When I stood up and gave my oath of allegiance to the US, the army told me I was an American, and that’s what I’ve always believed. I had my social security number, driver’s license, a house, cars, a salon, so didn’t worry about citizenship. That was stupid I know, but it never crossed my mind that I’d end up in this situation. “I’m over the initial shock and trying to move forward, but denying me access to the veterans’ hospital was hurtful, it was cruel.” A couple of days later Hernández attends a Thanksgiving dinner for veterans and children from a nearby orphanage, hosted by two former marine corps chefs who’ve built a holiday home a few blocks from the beach. There’s plenty of food and the children are happy with the lopsided bouncy castle, but it’s a tough day for the vets, a reminder of what’s been taken away. “I’m trying not to dwell,” says Hernández, “but this is bittersweet.” ‘Only deporting bad hombres? It’s a lie’ It’s Friday night just before 8pm, when a small group of fresh deportees turn-up at the Scalabrini men’s shelter – the first of its kind in Mexico, it opened in in 1993 for exhausted migrants heading north. Now, nine out of 10 men passing through are deported migrants, with 35% banished after at least 11 years in the US. Father Pat Murphy, the straight-talking, long-bearded shelter director, likens deportation to bereavement. “First comes the denial, and then it feels like life is over. We try help people build new lives, but for some it will always feel like a life sentence.” Gretchen Kuhner, director of the Institute for Women in Migration (Imumi) in Mexico, says the current deportation drive kick-started by Barack Obama – nicknamed deporter-in-chief – is hurting American children. “The Republican party espouses family values, yet Trump is pushing for more deportations which will leave even more American children growing up without parents. It’s hypocritical and doesn’t make sense to use tax dollars to split up families and remove people contributing to the economy.” Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant campaign threats have not, however, resulted in more deportations. In fact, just under 120,000 Mexicans were deported between January and September – a 27% drop on the same period in 2016. This is mainly down to fewer people trying to cross the border – the so-called Trump effect (figures, however, suggest this may be fizzling out). Detentions inside the US are definitely up, however, and even though many migrants are putting up a fight, here in Tijuana the shelters are bracing themselves for mass deportations. “If you’ve no papers, the American authorities don’t care. It’s a lie that they’re only deporting bad hombres. We’re getting people with cancer, mental illness, and the elderly, who’ll never find work in Mexico,” says father Murphy. “Soon they’ll empty the jails, then we’ll get the mass deportations.” In the meantime, Tijuana is full of lonely people with regrets. Isaias Morales Garcia, 54, was deported two weeks ago, leaving behind his wife and seven children. A big man with a kind face, Morales was deported after 14 months in federal detention trying to fight what he says was a stupid misunderstanding. Ice accused him of trying to escape after his GPS ankle bracelet was damaged working on a construction site and briefly lost signal, even though he reported the incident straight away. He was on bail for illegally re-entering the country. “I broke rules, but I wasn’t a burden, I was contributing, so this feels unjust. But I couldn’t take prison any more, so I stopped fighting and accepted deportation. At least here my children can visit, and one day ask for a pardon so I can go back legally. ” His children are ‘legal’: the two eldest are Dreamers, the other five American-born citizens. His wife is not; they’ve been married 34 years. “Maybe we were wrong, but we went to America in 1990 to make a better future. If I can’t go back, maybe my wife will come here. I don’t know, I’m still confused. I miss her.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/04/uk-government-warned-over-sharp-rise-children-pensioner-poverty-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T00:01:01Z","webTitle":"UK government warned over sharp rise in child and pensioner poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/04/uk-government-warned-over-sharp-rise-children-pensioner-poverty-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/04/uk-government-warned-over-sharp-rise-children-pensioner-poverty-study","fields":{"headline":"UK government warned over sharp rise in child and pensioner poverty","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hundreds of thousands of children and older people have been plunged into poverty in the past four years, according to a stark analysis laying bare the challenge to families trying to keep up with the cost of living in Britain. The research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found almost 400,000 more children and 300,000 more pensioners in the UK were living in poverty last year compared with 2012-13, the first sustained increases in child and pensioner poverty for 20 years. The foundation warned that decades of progress were at risk of being unravelled amid weak wage growth and rising inflation. The thinktank urged the government to unfreeze benefits, increase training for adult workers and to embark on a more ambitious house-building programme to provide affordable homes for struggling families. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, seized on the report to call for the minimum wage to rise to £10 an hour and for the government to remove the cap on salaries in the public sector. “Working people are not getting a fair deal from the economy, with real wages still worth less than a decade ago,” she said. The foundation’s latest research, titled UK Poverty 2017, found a gradual increase in poverty rates over the past four years, reversing a trend of falling numbers since the mid-1990s. About a third of children were living in families lacking the resources for their minimum needs in 1994-95 before the rate fell to 27% in 2011-12 with the help of higher employment rates and tax credits introduced under the last Labour government. The proportion of pensioners living in poverty fell from 28% to 13% over the same period. However, poverty rates increased to 16% for pensioners and 30% for children last year, while the charity also found as many as one in five people across the UK may be in poverty – which it defines as being when someone earns less than 60% of median earnings, adjusted for size and type of household. The JRF chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “These worrying figures suggest that we are at a turning point in our fight against poverty. Political choices, wage stagnation and economic uncertainty mean that hundreds of thousands more people are now struggling to make ends meet.” Recent analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the number of children living in poverty is set to rise to a record 5.2 million over the next five years, up from about 4 million at present. The thinktank said frozen benefits as well as the introduction of universal credit would contribute to the surge, which it said would be most profoundly felt in the most deprived parts of the country. Tax cuts and minimum wage increases have proved beneficial to some families – as the government has raised the personal tax-free allowance and imposed a “national living wage” of £7.50 an hour – but the JRF report found the gains were outweighed by the reductions from benefit support. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, unveiled an additional £1.5bn for reforming the rollout of universal credit, helping to cut waiting times for claimants. However, the government still plans to cut working-age benefits by nearly £12bn over the next five years. The JRF analysis also found evidence that some families were trapped in poverty despite being in work, and were unable to progress much further. It found a rate of one in eight workers, or 3.7 million people, do not earn enough for their needs and that 40% of working-age adults living in poverty have no qualifications, making it harder to earn better pay. Rachael Orr, head of UK programmes at Oxfam, said it was “deeply concerning” to see more evidence that having a job was not enough to escape poverty. “It’s not just working adults who are affected, but their children too, and it’s a real worry to see progress on child poverty going into reverse,” she said. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “As today’s report shows, we know how to reduce child poverty in the UK – we’ve done it before. Yet at the start of a sustained rise in the rate of child poverty – bewilderingly – there is inaction. The question the report begs is why are we not investing in our children? “Families with children have had a decade of cuts to their incomes and the damage is showing. Unless there is action now to protect the living standards of low-income families, we will pile up problems for future generations and for the UK economy.” •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/12/traders-cashing-in-rohingya-bangladesh-coxs-bazar","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T06:30:26Z","webTitle":"The traders cashing in on Rohingya misery: 'It's the best profit of my life' | William Worley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/12/traders-cashing-in-rohingya-bangladesh-coxs-bazar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/12/traders-cashing-in-rohingya-bangladesh-coxs-bazar","fields":{"headline":"The traders cashing in on Rohingya misery: 'It's the best profit of my life'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nurul Afsar is one of the many entrepreneurial Bangladeshis who is thriving as a result of the human crisis on his doorstep. “I am very happy,” says Afsar, 27. “Everyone is profiting, every car, every vehicle. I know a bamboo seller who makes twice what he used to.” Afsar, from nearby Ukhiya, drives Rohingya refugees in and around Kutupalong refugee camp on his blue motorbike taxi. His income has more than doubled since the Rohingya refugee crisis began in August. More than 620,000 people have fled violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, arriving in the Cox’s Bazar district of southern Bangladesh. With them have come new economic opportunities. “Once upon a time, there were no refugees here and the road was bad, and I didn’t like to come here even if I was paid 500 taka [£4.50],” says Afsar. “But now, the road is OK and there are so many passengers – so I love to work here.” Before the current crisis, Afsar says, on a good day, he could make 1,000 taka (£9). “Now, I make at least 2,000 to 2,500 taka [£18-22] on a normal day.” The annual per capita income in Bangladesh is £1,200, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. In Kutupalong, the most populous camp, a bustling market area known as Lamba Chiya Bazar has sprung up in a matter of weeks. Stalls and shacks line the road, selling everything from food to clothing and electrical goods. And practically everywhere stocks betel nuts. Abdul Shakkur, 35, runs an eatery nearby. He returned to his native Ukhiya with savings after eight years working as a labourer in Dubai, and set up his business almost two months ago. “Earlier there were no refugees, but then the market started and I thought it would be a good idea to sell food here,” he says. But few Rohingya eat there – they are largely reliant on food aid. It is other Bangladeshi vendors who come for lunch. Shakkur paid 8,000 taka for the site, and now employs three staff, who receive 700 taka a day. He makes a daily profit of 1,000 to 1,500 taka, which is “enough to provide for my wife and parents”. For the small number of Rohingya who run businesses, the picture is bleaker. Mir Kashim, 70, from Foira Bazar in Maungdaw township in Myanmar, has a stall with a dirt floor and homemade benches. For two months, he has sold tea, cigarettes, pulses and betel nut. “I brought some money from Myanmar, which I changed for 500 taka,” Kashim says. “Then we got a loan of 4,000 taka from our community to pay for the land. We are repaying it now.” Every morning, Kashim buys goods on credit from wholesalers in Kutupalong and repays them in the evening. He also pays the landowner, a local government official who controls the area, 10 to 20 taka a day. Other Rohingya businesses do the same. Kashim’s little shop makes between 200 and 300 taka a day, and supports five families. “We are just managing to get by,” he says. “There are some in the camp who don’t even make one taka.” Other refugees have sold jewellery or received money from relatives abroad to start their businesses. As Rohingya refugees are not allowed to travel, they can only buy goods from wholesalers in the towns around which the camps are built. As a result, prices have increased. “It’s the best profit of my life,” says Montudash, 40, who owns Baba Mayer Archibad shop in Balukhali bazar. “Before the Rohingya came, I made just 7,000 to 8,000 taka a day. The situation was terrible, I couldn’t look after my kids. But now, it is normal to make 18,000 taka a day. If my child asks for 10 taka, I give him 15.” Montudash estimates that 95% of his customers are refugees, who buy everything from pots to cables to soft drinks. “It was very quiet before the new influx,” he says. The Rohingya entrepreneurs have to deal with extortive wholesalers and thugs from nearby villages who frequently threaten to destroy their shops. They have little choice. “We can’t do anything here – it’s like in Myanmar,” says Taher Udin, 18, from his shop, Lamba Chiya. “But if we didn’t have this business we would have to suffer like the others.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/03/scotland-sink-blame-it-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:05:26Z","webTitle":"Politicians ignore the poor but love saving foxes | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/scotland-sink-blame-it-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/scotland-sink-blame-it-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Politicians ignore the poor but love saving foxes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In modern and progressive Scotland, very few months are allowed to pass before something beastly and disreputable catches the eye of the political elite and thus must quickly be eradicated. With each new piece of hastily drafted legislation, the cultural arbiters who make up this social junta convince themselves that they have made this country just a little bit more enlightened. That none of these self-indulgent caprices ever make the merest improvement to the lives of the overwhelming majority of our citizens cuts no ice with them. What matters above all else is that a veneer of edgy and sophisticated liberalism is achieved to camouflage the policy sinkholes that exist in those areas that really matter, such as education, healthcare and social inequality. The die was cast in the earliest days of the new Scottish parliament when Mike Watson, a Labour MSP whose constituency included Castlemilk, won the right to introduce Holyrood’s first member’s bill. For those who have never visited Castlemilk, it is a housing estate on Glasgow’s south side which strives daily to meet the challenges of health inequality, poverty, unemployment and violent crime. Thus, we all expected that Watson’s bill would seek to address one of these issues. We were wrong. Instead, Watson opted to introduce a protection of wild mammals bill, which eventually led to a ban on fox hunting and hare-coursing. This was an eye-opener for the residents of Castlemilk, who had been largely unaware that the plight of Basil Brush and Hartley Hare were a significant element in Castlemilk’s pattern of deprivation. Ah well, every day’s a school day. Nearly two decades later, the Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone is seeking to introduce a bill to tighten the ban on fox hunting in Scotland. That’s right; at the end of a year in which food bank usage reached record levels, the educational attainment gap was as wide as ever and Scotland’s largest city was yet again revealed to be the UK’s unhealthiest, the Scottish Greens kept their crown as the nation’s most irrelevant political party. At least we now know what vexes our political classes when they sip their skinny decafs in Edinburgh’s salons. It seems that Johnstone was responding to Lord Bonomy’s review, which concluded that around 800 foxes are killed by hunts every year in Scotland, with one in five foxes killed by packs of hounds, in breach of the Protection of Wild Mammals Act (2002). The poor are always with us, said Jesus, but in Scotland it seems you can’t get enough healthy foxes. The last few weeks of 2017 have seen our political elites indulge in a frenzy of legislation that won’t bring about the slightest improvement in the lives of Scotland’s poor. These delusional and self-serving careerists think that setting a minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol will somehow break Scotland’s ruinous relationship with drink. In nearly 20 years of continuous left-wing government, these people have failed abysmally to break the patterns of deprivation and sprawling inequality that are the key factors in alcohol abuse. But hey, who cares about that when you can just flick a switch and make alcohol dearer? As well as being an elixir not to be messed with, Buckfast Tonic Wine, the favourite target of Scotland’s indolent classes, is also very expensive. This, though, has failed to diminish its appeal in Scotland’s disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Our politicians have gorged themselves on bringing forward empty and self-indulgent legislation that hints at a pernicious obsession with social control. In doing this, they seek to convey a sense of getting things done; doing the day job, when all that they achieve is to detach themselves further from the everyday reality of people’s lives. John Swinney, the education secretary, is still trying to peddle his ridiculous and illiberal “named person” legislation, which has been universally exposed as another scam aimed at blacklisting Scotland’s most hard-pressed families. Similarly, the proposed ban on smacking is further proof of Holyrood’s obsession with the way ordinary people manage their families. They would rather seek to criminalise than offer anything resembling a radical idea. This insincere collection of political confidence-tricksters is less concerned with the welfare of Scotland’s children than they are with disguising their wholesale betrayal of our poorest communities while blaming it all on the Tories. In the same way that the 9/11 effect was exploited for years by unscrupulous entrepreneurs to cut and run from their failing enterprises, so Brexit is already being used as a one-stop convenience store dealing in political excuses. In its crazy and sinister compulsion to make Scotland a petri dish for social experimentation, this government has ceased to govern in the best interests of the majority of its people. It is the worst possible advert for the cause of Scottish independence. It can only be a matter of time before Holyrood imposes its will on the ruinous way in which ordinary people insist on celebrating Christmas. The traditional nativity scene will soon become overcrowded. Any schools that still insist on having a crib will have to include a “named person” among the traditional nativity personnel; perhaps they could become the hitherto overlooked fourth wise man. Meanwhile, the baby Jesus must be clothed in non-binary apparel, in keeping with Holyrood’s proposal to allow young people to choose their own gender two years earlier than at present. Naturally, among the beasts present to witness the birth of the saviour of the world, there will have to be an obligatory fox or two. The blessed Virgin Mary must source all her new-born accoutrements from the Scottish government’s standard issue baby box. The shepherds watching their flocks by night could be a tricky one, in the light of the Scottish government’s troubles with paying EU farming subsidies. Might they invite unwelcome speculation about claims for overtime? Local authorities and government departments seeking to hold charitable carol-singing events will be encouraged to use hymn-sheets containing a few subtle changes: Oh Come All Ye Careful, Circumspect and Prudent Oh Come Ye oh Come Ye to Salem Come and abjure them Buckfast, Jägermeister Oh Come Let Us Adore them Oh Come Let Us Adore Them Oh Come Let Us Adore them Drinks You Can’t Afford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/03/corbyn-fear-sees-pension-fund-body-advise-labour-council-to-invest-abroad","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T16:54:44Z","webTitle":"‘Corbyn fear’ sees pension fund body advise Labour council to invest abroad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/corbyn-fear-sees-pension-fund-body-advise-labour-council-to-invest-abroad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/03/corbyn-fear-sees-pension-fund-body-advise-labour-council-to-invest-abroad","fields":{"headline":"‘Corbyn fear’ sees pension fund body advise Labour council to invest abroad","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Labour-controlled council has been advised to invest some of its £250m in pension assets overseas because of the “political risk” of a Labour election victory and “renationalisation” by a Corbyn-led government. A Camden council document posted online last week summarises the advice given by London CIV, a £5.6bn fund management group set up by local authorities to manage the pension funds of London councils. London CIV is chaired by Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, and includes board members that control schools and hospitals in London. According to the document, Camden has been warned against investing too much in UK infrastructure, such as bridges, ports and social housing, because of the “political risk” of both Brexit and “a potential future change of government” that could lead to a “sharp repricing of assets due to concerns over renationalisation”. The document, revealed by Room151, a specialist news service covering local authority finance, said it would be “imprudent” to expose London pension funds to infrastructure investments that are entirely UK-focused. A spokesman for London CIV said: “London CIV is responsible for investing significant sums on behalf of the boroughs and therefore has a duty to consider all potential risks. In carrying out this duty, we are in discussions with all boroughs as to consider all risks which might potentially impact on infrastructure. These discussions are ongoing and the London CIV is continuing to debate with its members the shape of its infrastructure strategy. No decisions on this strategy have been made.” Earlier this week, investment bank Morgan Stanley warned that the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister is a more serious threat to British business than Brexit. It provoked a stinging response from the Labour leader, who accused Morgan Stanley of being part of the same “speculators and gamblers who crashed our economy in 2008”. Camden Council sought to distance itself from any suggestion that its pension fund endorses or opposes any political party. In a statement, it said: “Our Pension Committee view and discuss reports from a variety of industry bodies and independent advisers ... Viewing other organisations’ reports in no way reflects either our endorsement of or our opposition to any political party’s policies and no decisions were made at the meeting, or subsequently, regarding changes to our future infrastructure investment.” Labour’s renationalisation plans largely revolve around bringing key utilities, such as energy supply networks, the water companies, railways and the Royal Mail, back into public ownership. Infrastructure investment has been a huge growth area for pension funds seeking a regular and stable income from things such as road tolls, railway tracks, power distribution networks and water pipes. But they have been accused of extracting super-normal profits from companies that behave as quasi-monopolies, raising charges to consumers significantly above inflation. Recent polling has found renationalisation is a popular policy, with the public keenest on taking the water companies back into public hands. Water topped the poll by Populus with 83% thinking it should be renationalised, followed by electricity (77%), gas (77%) and the railways (76%).

The brothel madam kept her earnings “safe” – shoving the notes into her bra – and whenever Roy needed money, she would never get the full amount she asked for. Roy, 36, did not have a bank account. When she needed money to treat her father’s heart condition seven years ago, she was forced to visit a loan shark to borrow 2,000 rupees (£23). In one year, 13,000 rupees extra (£150) was due from the interest. “When I couldn’t repay it, the money lender posted two men outside the kotha [brothel] to harass me every time I went out to shop,” says Roy. But now she has a bank account with the Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Society, which is run by and for sex workers. It began with 13 women pooling their savings – 30,000 rupees – in 1995. Today, the bank’s turnover is 300m rupees a year and it has a membership of 31,000 sex workers from across West Bengal. Sex workers are surrounded by ill-wishers – madams, pimps, “boyfriends” and often relatives trying to relieve them of their money. Usha bank provides a safe place for the women to deposit money. Interest rates encourage them to save, and access to loans liberates them from money lenders’ rates of up to 300% annually. But the bank’s blue passbook also gave Roy dignity, a sense of being part of society, a feeling of equality with other Indians, and the power to make her own decisions. Even more important, it enabled her to get an official ID, as the book states her name and address – a prerequisite for renting accommodation, receiving welfare benefits and registering to vote. Roy now works as an assistant secretary at the bank, which was set up under the auspices of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, an NGO that supports sex workers. The women who come to the bank have needs similar to Roy. She has taken out three loans: for her father’s medical treatment, to buy a small plot in her village, and to send her nephew to college. In his office next door to Roy’s, Smarajit Jana, a chief adviser, says he has “too many stories to tell” about how the bank has changed lives. “[The women] have bought land and built homes, educated their children, sent money back to support aged parents, opened a small business,” he says. “The bank gave them a security they had never known before.” Jana used to work on HIV prevention in the early 1990s, and realised that handing out condoms was not enough. “They needed control over their lives. They are at the mercy of the madams, who take 50% of their earnings. What’s left is at the mercy of goons and policemen, who extort money. They needed control over their finances,” he says. Such is Usha’s success that this month it will begin offering banking and credit facilities to domestic helpers and construction workers. Subhash Shaw, the child of a sex worker, collects deposits and loan repayments for Usha. His education was thanks to his mother’s savings at Usha. “Very few of them default on loans. They are very responsible,” he says. In the litter-strewn alleys that lead to the brothels in the sex-worker district of Sonagachi, food sellers heat up huge cauldrons of oil to fry snacks. Tea is boiled in gigantic saucepans. Up a narrow flight of stairs, in a decrepit building, Manju Dutt sits inside a tiny cubicle that serves as her living room. A young woman is asleep on the concrete floor. Dutt is older than 50 and has spent almost her entire life in Sonagachi. She takes out her passbook from under her mattress. It shows the repayments for loans: for her daughter’s wedding, for gallstone surgery, and for her granddaughter’s wedding. “I trust Usha because sex workers run it – they take all the decisions. When I am unwell, Subhash comes to collect my deposit or to get my signature if I need to withdraw money,” she says. Outside, in the corridor, grey-haired Renu Singh is now a madam. Her granddaughters, Nisha and Nikita, come running to hug her when they see her being photographed. Singh has educated and married off all four of her children. “I didn’t take any loans. I saved the money,” she says. “For years, I wasted my earnings, spending it all. Then, with Usha, I got into the habit of saving.” Many of the women had been abandoned by their husbands, forcing them into sex work to support themselves, their children and siblings. Rita Das, who has come to deposit 500 rupees, raised two children on her own after her husband ran off with another woman. Anu Maiti was married at 16 and widowed at 17. Now 35, she rents her own room for clients. She has come to the bank to make a deposit. “Without my bank passbook as proof of my ID, no landlord would have given me a room. I have no children, so I must be able to support myself later in life. I try to save a bit every day,” she says. Roy is looking to the future. “That tiny plot I bought with a loan from Usha? I’m going to take out another loan and build two rooms. If I succeed, Usha bank will save me from destitution in my old age,” says Roy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/04/what-do-universities-look-for-in-a-personal-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T14:28:24Z","webTitle":"What do universities look for in a personal statement?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/04/what-do-universities-look-for-in-a-personal-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/04/what-do-universities-look-for-in-a-personal-statement","fields":{"headline":"What do universities look for in a personal statement?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Your Ucas personal statement is one of the main ways universities will assess your application. It needs to be based what you’re good at, why you’re good at it, and how that makes you an ideal candidate for the course. So what exactly should you write and what should you avoid? We asked admissions tutors for their dos and don’ts. Don’t waffle. “Use one sentence for the intro and conclusion. The rest of the personal statement should focus entirely on the criteria they’re looking for,” says Simon Atkinson, who interviews medical students at Bristol. Do keep it simple. In some cases, personal statements are read numerous times – particularly at results when a student misses their required grades. “The admissions director needs to read them swiftly. Straightforward and confident language works best,” says Alix Delany, head of admissions at UEA. Do get a proofreader. Atkinson advises making friends with your English teacher and having them check it for you. “Show it to as many people as possible – especially if you know anyone with a background in human resources.” Do focus on what the university says it wants. Universities usually publish admissions statements which outline what they’re looking for in their candidates. Each uni will be looking for something a little bit different: some will focus entirely on your academic activities, others will also pay attention to your hobbies. Do show that you’ll be active at university. Any personal examples of work experience, weekend jobs or school activities can be of use. Almost any hobby can be relevant in some way. Be sure to relate them to your studies. Playing an instrument, for example, shows application, stamina and the ability to study and practice, as well as teamwork if you play with other people. Don’t try too hard to be funny – it doesn’t always come across well in writing. “You’re not a professional writer and the person who reads it won’t be looking for that. All they’re looking at is whether you fit their criteria,” says Atkinson. Don’t bother with quotes. Julie Tucker, from the applicant services team at Falmouth University, says the statements that get an academics’ attention are less formulaic. “Avoid using well-known quotes from famous people, and avoid stating the obvious,” she says. “If you are applying to join a fashion design course, steer clear of Coco Chanel quotes. If you’re applying to study film, don’t open by saying you’ve watched films from a young age.” Do use your own voice. “Personal statements are largely scored in an objective way. You need correct English, without looking like you’ve swallowed a thesaurus,” says Atkinson. “I would avoid grandiose or highly idealistic statements such as ‘from the moment I was born I was destined to cure people’. That’s the kind of thing people write. Keep it prosaic and to the point.” Do be honest. For courses that interview their applicants, academic teams often use the personal statement to guide their questioning. “With that in mind, applicants shouldn’t use anything they’re not comfortable talking about in detail,” says Tucker. Dr Sam Lucy, director of admissions at Cambridge, agrees. They often refer to personal statements at interview. “We’re checking that their enthusiasm is genuine. In particular, we should get an idea of where within your subject this enthusiasm lies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/01/jamie-oliver-and-david-walliams-go-head-to-head-for-christmas-no-1","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T16:09:34Z","webTitle":"Jamie Oliver and David Walliams go head to head for Christmas No 1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/01/jamie-oliver-and-david-walliams-go-head-to-head-for-christmas-no-1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/01/jamie-oliver-and-david-walliams-go-head-to-head-for-christmas-no-1","fields":{"headline":"Jamie Oliver and David Walliams go head to head for Christmas No 1","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Competing visions of domestic life square off against each other this Christmas, as Jamie Oliver’s latest cookbook jostles for the No 1 bestseller spot with David Walliams’s Bad Dad. Both writers have strong pedigree for the contest, with TV chef and campaigner Oliver having taking the prize no fewer than five times in the past, and actor and children’s author Walliams securing the top slot last year. A market that has been swamped by satirical takes on children’s classics for the last two years is turning away from spoofs, according to the Bookseller, with last week’s non-fiction sales down 16% in volume compared to last year – a decline the magazine attributed to the “wane in popularity” of humour titles. This year’s biggest seller to date from the Ladybird for Grown-Ups series is How it Works: The Baby, which has sold 10,741 copies. Last year, Five on Brexit Island had sold more than 50,000 copies by December. This year, Walliams has been topping charts with his latest children’s novel, which has sold around 80,000 copies for the past two weeks, according to Nielsen BookScan. Another children’s title, Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Getaway, is second, selling almost 50,000 copies a week, with Oliver’s 5 Ingredients surging from almost 30,000 copies two weeks ago to more than 37,000 copies last week. The Bookseller predicted that it could be a two-horse race for the No 1 spot this Christmas, between Walliams and Oliver. “I’d be surprised if [it] didn’t end up in the hands of either Jamie Oliver or David Walliams,” agreed Waterstones’ Chris White. “But then Christmas is all about surprises. Maybe Lee Child or Dan Brown will claim the crown for fiction.” White also cited titles including Blue Planet II, Mary Beard’s “timely” Women and Power, which he said “is providing further proof of the popularity of politically engaged writing in the era of Trump and Brexit”, and Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage. The latter, he said, was “providing a huge boon both to our tills and to the underlying health of the cultural world in which we operate”. “We’re seeing a range of titles perform very strongly, while lacking a book to compare with the enormous reach of Fantastic Beasts last year (although a new EL James may help to rectify that),” said White. “I’m not sure how much of a dark horse it is, given the success of The GCHQ Puzzle Book last year, but Bletchley Park Brainteasers looks like being the book which will be asking the questions in the most family homes this festive season.” At Blackwell’s, David Kelly said: “The army of satiric Ladybirds appears to have halted their monopoly of the humour and gift market but, unsurprisingly, anything taking a lighter look at Trump and Brexit is doing well for us – in particular Alice in Brexitland and Trump’s Christmas Carol”. “I sense a unique Christmas for us ahead, where a vast range of outstanding publishing will bring in our sales rather than a smaller amount of big titles,” said Kelly, “which as a range bookshop, with many expert buyers, suits us perfectly. For our specifically inquisitive customers, titles such as The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus sums us up and is selling really well.” The title promises to provide “the most elegant mathematical solutions to your Christmas conundrums, from how to avoid a secret Santa disaster to how to win the festive family games”. Kelly added that “usually, there’s at least 20 books at this stage of the season that could be competing for our bestsellers”, but that “this year I see it as being a small field of high quality competing for the bestselling book – between The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert Macfarlane, Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage and Women and Power by Mary Beard”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/04/millennials-donating-10-of-their-pay-to-save-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"The millennials donating 10% of their pay to save the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/04/millennials-donating-10-of-their-pay-to-save-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/04/millennials-donating-10-of-their-pay-to-save-the-world","fields":{"headline":"The millennials donating 10% of their pay to save the world","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"WITH a six-figure salary from a London private equity firm, it could be expected that Grayden Reece-Smith would be living it up on eye-wateringly expensive holidays or driving a suitably flash sports car around south London, where he lives. Instead, the 28-year-old lives a very different existence to his peers and gives away everything he earns over £42,000 – a figure he calculated he could comfortably live on. Over the past five years, Reece-Smith has handed over more than £250,000 to organisations such as International Care Ministries, which helps poverty stricken families in the Philippines, and the Against Malaria Foundation. He is part of a growing number of young professionals described as “effective altruists” who claim to use evidence and analysis to accomplish good. Influenced by his protestant faith, Reece-Smith was tempted to work in the charity sector after graduating but calculated he could make a bigger difference by donating a significant chunk of his salary. He had volunteered as a teacher at a school in Tanzania but believed that earning and giving would be more effective. “I realised that the cost of my flights there could have paid the salaries of two teachers for an entire year.” Instead, he says, he could “stay at home, living a very nice life and still make a huge difference in the world”. “£42,000 is more than enough to live on and still save,” he says. “I still fill my Isa every year.” He is not frugal – last year he holidayed in Cuba and spent a few grand on a new sofa – but his lifestyle certainly isn’t as luxurious as his colleagues. “I tend to buy branded food products, and I don’t own a car. Other people [on my salary] might have a bigger house. We only bought what we needed – a two bedroom flat; some of my colleagues have four-bedroom houses.” Effective altruists typically donate regularly to a charity they think will have the most impact rather than a cause that pulls at their heart-strings. Some switch careers to generate more money which can then be given away. Advocates tend to believe people should explore giving money abroad. The Australian moral philosopher and author Peter Singer, who supports the movement, once pointed out that it costs thousands of pounds to train a guide dog and its user, while less than £50 in the developing world could cure a blind person with trachoma, an infectious eye disease. “You could provide one guide dog for one blind American or you could cure between 400 and 2,000 people of blindness,” he said. “I think it’s clear what’s the better thing to do.” The Centre of Effective Altruism, based in Oxford, estimates there are between 500 and 1,000 people who identify with the practice in the UK and it is also becoming popular in California. Singer says many millennials have become interested and want their donations of time and money to have the most impact possible. After leaving Oxford University in 1971, Singer started to donate 10% of his income. As his earnings increased, so did his level of donations, and today he and his wife, a writer, give away 40%. He recommends 10% as an amount many people could afford. “I think it’s an amount that most middle-class people can comfortably afford,” he says. “It depends on how much people are earning and how happy they are to live modestly.” Singer says he leads a happy yet modest life. “I probably holiday less, and in terms of house purchases we live in a one-bedroom apartment [in New York]. We would have perhaps bought a larger apartment if I hadn’t been giving it away but it’s a nice apartment in a good area.” Emily Dally, 27, earns £48,000 a year as a lawyer for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and has given away 10% of her salary since she signed the Giving What We Can Pledge three years ago. “I’d just finished law school and was taking a job in the city and feeling a bit funny about it. I was morally conflicted about whether it was the right thing to do, and I saw this as a good way of carrying on [with her career],” she says. Over the past three years, she has donated about £20,000 to the Against Malaria Foundation. The amount she gives away has not hugely impacted her quality of her life – she and her boyfriend, Sam, who also gives away 10% of his income, were still able to put a deposit down on a flat in Hackney, east London, last year. “I might have spent more on holidays or gifts for people, and I suppose I’d be saving more,” she says. “I might question whether I should get that last drink or go to that fancy restaurant, but I still have plenty of money. “My parents were shocked. Their initial response was, ‘God, that’s a lot. I hope you can still manage.’ They were worried that when Sam and I ever start a family that it might be problematic.” As a result of the donations from effective altruists, organisations ranked by charity evaluator GiveWell are reporting a jump in donations. “We’ve seen a very significant increase in donations that we can directly attribute to the growth of the effective altruist community,” says Rob Mather of the Against Malaria Foundation, which saw donations rise 280% to £3.27m in 2012 when it was ranked the number one most effective charity by GiveWell. Some of the ideas of the effective altruism movement have drawn criticism. Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, is sceptical that its focus on giving to developing nations can ever have broad appeal. “For most people, charitable giving is, and will remain, a more emotional and instinctive activity, often grounded in religious commitments, local connections, or personal experiences,” he says. “It might make more sense… to give money closer to home where you can observe how it is used, and may feel stronger emotional rewards than are offered by the rather abstract process of sending money off to a foreign country and never seeing the results.” Posner is also vocal about a view raised in the effective altruism movement that it can be more effective to choose a career in a higher-paid job in order to donate more to charity. “Many of the highest-paying jobs – say, in finance – will seem reprehensible to the sort of person who is altruistically inclined. I think most people won’t be able to sustain a double life in which they do things they are ashamed of even if it does much good for others.” Singer is slightly optimistic about the growth of the movement, pointing to a wave of effective altruism groups spreading across university campuses. “Some people suggest there might be a limit, as not everyone will be interested in living more altruistically or thinking about effectiveness, but even if we got 10% of affluent people involved, it could make a big difference.” By the book Kat Steiner, 27, lives in Oxford and is an assistant librarian at the Bodleian Education Library. She earns £25,000 per year and receives around £10,000 a year from investments (made by her parents on her behalf). It was while studying at Oxford that Steiner was introduced to the ideas of thinking critically about giving to charity and potentially donating a significant portion of your income. “Studying philosophy meant that we often talked about things in terms of abstract ideas, but this was a more practical discussion of whether it was the right thing to do and the possible consequences,” she says. At first, Steiner resisted signing up to Giving What We Can, a body in which members pledge to give at least 10% of their earnings to charity until they retire. “I was concerned about making such a big decision before I’d even had a full-time job.” However, with many of her friends taking the pledge and Steiner road testing the idea by donating 10% of her income as a trial run for a year, she decided to sign the pledge in 2014. While the librarian says she doesn’t have very “expensive taste or hobbies”, she’s aware that the decision may result in less financial security. “I was concerned that if something very expensive happened, I wouldn’t be able to cope. But I’m pretty happy that I’m saving enough, and my family is financially secure as a whole.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/01/senate-republicans-reform-bill-us-tax-code","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T16:48:56Z","webTitle":"Senate Republicans pass sweeping overhaul of US tax code","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/senate-republicans-reform-bill-us-tax-code","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/senate-republicans-reform-bill-us-tax-code","fields":{"headline":"Senate Republicans pass sweeping overhaul of US tax code","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senate Republicans have passed the most sweeping overhaul of the US tax code in three decades, a significant step that moves Donald Trump closer to achieving the first major legislative victory of his presidency. The Senate passed its tax plan in a 51-49 vote early on Saturday morning, with Vice-President Mike Pence presiding over the chamber and after a frantic rewrite. Bob Corker was the sole Republican to vote against the bill, which would bestow huge benefits on US corporations and the wealthiest Americans. “We think this is a great day for the country,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said at a celebratory press conference. On Saturday morning, Trump praised lawmakers and said he was looking forward to signing the bill before Christmas. “It was a fantastic evening last night,” the president told reporters outside the White House before he left for New York. “We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and many other things along with it. “Now we go on to conference and something beautiful is going to come out of that mixer. People are going to be very, very happy. They’re going to get tremendous, tremendous tax cuts and tax relief, and that’s what this country needs.” The vote marked a significant feat for Republicans, who suffered a series of embarrassing blows earlier this year by failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump and Republicans in Washington staked their political fortunes on the hope that tax reform would not suffer the same fate. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said: “For the first time since 1986, both the House and the Senate have passed a major overhaul of our nation’s tax code. Now we will move quickly to a conference committee so we can get a final bill to President Trump’s desk.” The rush to pass the bill sparked outcry from Democrats, who said it would be impossible to fully digest the legislation before voting began. Lawmakers received the nearly 500-page bill, some of it handwritten, hours before they voted on a plan that will affect nearly every US business and taxpayer. “I defy any member of the Senate to stand here, take an oath that they have read this and understand what in the world it means to businesses and families and individuals,” said Senator Dick Durbin, the minority whip from Illinois, holding up pages with notes scribbled in the margin. In New York on Saturday, before a fundraising event at Cipriani restaurant on 42nd Street, Trump said: “We got no Democrat help and I think that’s going to cost them in the election because they voted against tax cuts. I don’t think politically it’s good to vote against tax cuts.” After closing debate, the Senate began the tedious process of a vote-a-rama, in which senators can offer an endless series of amendments. At midnight, Pence arrived to break a tie on an amendment offered by Ted Cruz that allows parents to start savings accounts to fund tuition at private and religious K-12 schools known as 529 plans. The provision prevailed. Democrats scored a small victory when four Republicans joined them to strike a provision that appeared tailored to benefit a single Christian college in Michigan with ties to family of the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. Not a single Democrat crossed the aisle to support the plan, which they attacked as a “scam” and a handout to corporations and the wealthy. “I don’t think there is a person more bipartisan than I am,” said Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, lamenting his frustration with the partisan nature of the process. Earlier this week, he joined red-state Democrats to urge Republicans to work with them on tax reform. “This, as I have seen it unfold tonight, it is not designed to have one Democrat on the bill,” he added. The House passed its own tax legislation earlier this month. The two bills will now be reconciled, presenting further hurdles in the coming weeks. Republicans have contended the $1.4tn package of cuts enclosed in their plan will in effect pay for themselves through growth. A series of independent projections found they would not. The nonpartisan joint committee on taxation projected that the plan would add $1tn to the federal deficit over the next 10 years – even after factoring in the economic growth the bill is projected to generate. On Friday, the independent Tax Policy Center released similar findings, predicting that the Senate bill would add $1.2tn to the federal deficit over the next decade after accounting for increased economic growth. McConnell parried, telling reporters: “I’m totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill. I think this will be a revenue producer.” Senate Republicans used a vehicle known as “budget reconciliation” to pass the tax plan using a simple-majority vote, leaving them room for only two defections. On Friday morning, three key holdouts had announced their support. Leadership nonetheless spent the night locked in negotiations. Corker and Jeff Flake, of Arizona, had sought to extract an agreement that would scale back some of the tax cuts in the event growth projections were not met. On Thursday, they unexpectedly held court on the Senate floor, after learning that a mechanism they created to limit the impact on the national debt was not compliant with the Senate’s budget rules. The tense showdown led Republicans scrambling to find a way to offset the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. Ultimately, the plans were rejected by Senate leadership, Cruz told reporters, after he and a number of others objected. “That proposal did not carry the day,” Cruz said. “Those $350bn in tax increases are not in the bill … and larding the bill up with new tax increases would have been going the wrong direction.” Flake announced that he would support the bill, saying in a statement he had secured two priorities: the elimination of an $85bn “expensing budget gimmick” and a “firm commitment” that Congress would enact permanent protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Corker said he would not support the plan, adding in a statement: “At the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations.” Key to winning over Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana was an agreement to expand tax cuts for millions of businesses known as “pass-through entities”. Democrats remained united in their opposition, attacking the legislation as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. “In the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families,” said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, in a floor speech on Friday. “Every time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/01/fashions-favourite-designers-unveil-their-topsy-turvy-christmas-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T17:46:53Z","webTitle":"Fashion's favourite designers unveil their topsy-turvy Christmas trees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/01/fashions-favourite-designers-unveil-their-topsy-turvy-christmas-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/01/fashions-favourite-designers-unveil-their-topsy-turvy-christmas-trees","fields":{"headline":"Fashion's favourite designers unveil their topsy-turvy Christmas trees","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Elsa Schiaparelli said that “in difficult times, fashion is always outrageous”, she probably wasn’t talking about Christmas trees. But this week – as Britain’s most chi chi shops and hotels unveiled their festive decors – an unorthodox aesthetic has emerged that proves her point. Following a fashion of recent years, many of the Christmas trees in top hotels have been created by world-famous designers and artists. At London’s Connaught, for example, Tracey Emin’s tree eschewed traditional baubles and tinsel and was populated with handwritten neon words that made up a love poem. Elsewhere in Mayfair, little forests of Christmas trees had sprung up in the windows of designer shops, dramatically lit and sparsely decorated. The upside-down Christmas tree in the grand reception of Claridge’s hotel is similarly spooky. Designed by Karl Lagerfeld, it is a towering inverted V, with silvered roots fanning out, like something from the Nightmare Before Christmas. This upside-down aesthetic is not just a conceptual statement. It has also become an unlikely real-life festive trend, with topsy-turvy trees being sold on Amazon. Even more avant garde is Matty Bovan’s neon pink tree, at the Ace hotel’s Hoi Polloi brasserie in east London. Bovan – a young designer shortlisted for an emerging talent gong at the Fashion awards on Monday – has created a pink Lurex vision, dotted with mini-sculptures. He calls this a “modern folk tale full of disturbing, sweet and sculptural pieces” and adds: “The objects on my tree reflect both the horrors and joys of 2017, and there is an overall positive feeling of hope radiating through the whole tree looking towards to 2018, pushing through the only way we really can, which is to keep being creative.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/03/ashmolean-museum-to-showcase-famous-us-artists-unknown-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T11:13:15Z","webTitle":"Ashmolean Museum to showcase famous US artists 'unknown' in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/03/ashmolean-museum-to-showcase-famous-us-artists-unknown-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/03/ashmolean-museum-to-showcase-famous-us-artists-unknown-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Ashmolean Museum to showcase famous US artists 'unknown' in UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An exhibition of artists whose works have rarely or never been seen outside the US, dubbed “cool” in the 1920 and 30s when the word signified admirably restrained rather than achingly hip, will open next year at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Seventeen of of the 83 works have never left the US before, a further 21 have never been seen in the UK, and others haven’t been seen in Europe for almost a century. “This is a rather selfish exhibition, originating in my own excitement in these artists who have only been viewable in the United States,” said Alexander Sturgis, the Ashmolean’s director. “These are revelatory works of great power and significance, simply not known in this country for the most part. This was the era of speakeasies, of Scott Fitzgerald, the Jazz Age that we speak of in every other genre, so it is really surprising that we do not speak more of its artists.” Most of the museum’s exhibitions are linked to its own huge collections. But America’s Cool Modernism makes an exception for works also missing from the walls of most other UK and European collections. The exhibition is bookended by two world-famous names, Georgia O’Keeffe and Edward Hopper, but will include many artists well known in the States but barely known beyond its shores because all their work has remained in American collections. The Metropolitan Museum in New York is sending an exceptional group of 18 loans, which Sturgis said was “not unrelated” to 26 drawings by Michaelangelo being sent to New York by the Ashmolean. The works are being sent on five separate flights. The Met loans will include a painting that has become an American icon, I Saw the Figure 5 In Gold, though in his lifetime Charles Demuth could not sell it and left it to his friend Georgia O’Keeffe. Intended in 1928 as a conceptual portrait of the poet William Carlos Williams, it is now seen as a remarkable precursor of postwar pop art, and was described by the critic Robert Hughes as “the one picture so famous that practically every American who looks at art knows it”. The other painters are now better known for their work in other media, including the poet EE Cummings, and Edward Steichen who destroyed many of his own paintings on the singular grounds that they were too popular and distracting attention from his photographs: his brilliantly coloured Sunflower was last exhibited in Europe in 1922, the year he painted it in Paris. Katie Bourguignon, exhibition curator of the Terra Foundation in Chicago, which is a partner in the exhibition, said what united many of the paintings – whether urban, industrial or rural scenes – was that they were eerily empty of people, at a time of mass immigration and industrialisation. “It is a question to be asked: who are these missing people and why?” Hopper is best known for his desolate figures in late-night diners or bleak hotel rooms. In his Manhattan Bridge Loop there is only one human, a tiny figure of a hunched man walking through an intimidatingly depopulated scene. Bourguignon said she was surprised to find how early the term “cool” was widely applied to the artists in their day. The hard, sharp framing and the absence of visible brush strokes also led to their being labelled “the Precisionists”, or even “the Immaculatists”. They were very well aware of contemporary art in Europe, she said, and of artists such as Cézanne, Picasso and Matisse, but were instead trying to create a distinctive cool American aesthetic whose mood was often, but not always, celebratory. In some of the views from high among the towers of industry and apartments there is a palpable unease about the ant-like figures of humans and vehicles almost invisible at their feet: the Great Crash was coming.

The ruling by a family court judge makes clear that the hearing was concerned only with the impact of the parents’ unusual lifestyle on their young children, who are all under the age of five and will now be placed for adoption. The application was made by social workers acting for Sandwell borough council in the West Midlands last August and was granted in October this year. The parents nor children have been identified. Social services officials described the couple’s relationship as “open”, although both parents denied that was the status of their relationship. The father chose to see other women and the mother had relationships with men she met online, the judge Elizabeth Williscroft explained in her judgment. “The father had his own lifestyle outside the family home which plainly included going clubbing until the early hours as well as being involved with other people,” she said. “In respect of both parents, the court is not concerned about their private lives and how they will conduct them unless it impacts on the care of the children – which at this time was neglectful.” The Wolverhampton-based judge said the couple continued their “dysfunctional relationship” while living in the same house. “All of this must have been confusing for the children.” She said of the mother: “It is plain some complete strangers have visited her house while the children were there to have sex with her.” The father “didn’t fully understand either why the presence of strangers at the home meeting the mother for sex was worrying”, the judge said. Social workers said the couple found it hard to supervise their children, and Williscroft added: “Mother was observed parenting ‘from the sofa’ and relying on others to keep the children safe from hazards.” The judge concluded: “After balancing the possibilities of care for these children, my analysis is there are no realistic alternatives to meet the children’s welfare needs throughout their lives but adoption. “I bear in mind and balance that each child has a loving relationship and attachment with their parents but has also been harmed by neglect and would be at risk of harm in their care.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/30/supermans-tache-and-armie-hammers-crotch-is-movie-cgi-getting-out-of-hand","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:00:19Z","webTitle":"Superman’s tache and Armie Hammer’s crotch - is movie CGI getting out of hand?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/30/supermans-tache-and-armie-hammers-crotch-is-movie-cgi-getting-out-of-hand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/30/supermans-tache-and-armie-hammers-crotch-is-movie-cgi-getting-out-of-hand","fields":{"headline":"Superman’s tache and Armie Hammer’s crotch - is movie CGI getting out of hand?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From Transformers to Aliens, we all know that computer-generated imagery features heavily in big-budget Hollywood blockbusters – it’s right there in front of us on the big screen. But most CGI is imperceptible. Take the revelation this week that Armie Hammer’s genitals had to be digitally edited out of the acclaimed gay romance Call Me By Your Name. The actor’s oh-so-short shorts had failed to contain him and some work was required in post-production to tidy things up. This is an arthouse, realist drama that is using visual effects to alter what audiences see – and it’s increasingly common in indie movies. Just ask people at one of London’s busiest post-production houses. “Simple but high quality digital visual effects are now at price point where low budget movies can afford them. We change the time, on clocks, on wristwatches. We grade day for night. We fix cloud continuity in the sky. We make summer shoots look autumnal and we add snow and rain when called for,” says Ben Robards, a creative partner at Absolute Post. “If your 80s movie isn’t convincingly period, we can liberally sprinkle Rubik’s Cubes and Walkmans around; if your Jane Austen adaptation has electricity pylons and hybrid cars in shot, we can remove them.” So, much of CGI is about what you are not seeing, rather than what you are. Hammer has had many predecessors – not all of them human: legend has it that one poor animator on the movie Babe spent months painstakingly removing every frame of the title character’s anus. More recently, editors on Justice League had to remove a moustache grown by Superman himself, Henry Cavill, for his role in Mission: Impossible 6. All these practical considerations are perfectly understandable, but the possibilities are becoming extreme. Audiences were divided when the late Peter Cushing was digitally reanimated for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, asking if it was ethical to put words into the mouths of deceased actors. Writer-director Rupert Jones, who recently directed the British thriller Kaleidoscope, is relaxed about such techniques, citing a scene in Blade Runner 2049 that incorporated iconic film-star footage into the sci-fi epic’s futuristic setting. “The replication of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe in that extraordinary fight sequence was clearly adding to the world and the story. Oliver Reed being ‘reborn’ in Gladiator meant that the film could be completed. I suppose what I would object to is the idea of resuscitating old stars because we’d rather regurgitate what worked before than try to imagine new things. That feels like the ‘show’ being finally swallowed by the ‘business’”. More concerning is the possibility that real moving images can be manipulated for nefarious influence. Now that experts are warning that fake news purveyors might soon digitally doctor video and audio, should similar concerns apply to moviemaking; and in particular to documentaries? “We are getting close to the point where the moving image can be altered, supplemented and synthesised to such a convincing degree that even experts seek additional cues to find veracity,” says Robards. “But the intention to alter visual history and warp public perception is nothing new – the ancient Romans redacted names from monuments, Stalin airbrushed opponents from photographs. I take comfort from the fact that, historically, we have usually found an ethical redress against the misuse of power no matter what technology is deployed.” Maybe this ability is dangerous only in the wrong hands. And of, course, developments in technology may have made us more alert to potential deception. “Common wisdom suggests that society is less deferential than it was half a century ago when TV was a relatively new innovation for many households,” says Prof Patrick Leman from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. “What may be changing is what people are likely to be believing of. Take the recent photo of Osama bin Laden after his death. Many in the west will trust the accuracy of the image, but some conspiracy theorists elsewhere will regard it as fake. Same as the moon landing photos and numerous other examples such as the Zapruder film of Kennedy’s assassination. I think people may be more trusting of images from a source they believe is reliable (and corresponds to their general worldview), but less trusting of those that do not come from such a source.” Perhaps it’s my general worldview, but, as a film critic, I trust that the vast majority of film-makers use visual effects for the best reasons. Dazzling sci-fi aliens and animated worlds aside, studios need to use visual effects for more practical reasons, including legal, factual and certification issues. And in the case of arthouse fare, I have found that directors are passionate about communicating with their audience and making sure their story is told with clarity and without distractions. Surely trust is all part of the process, as it is when reading a novel by an author? “As a film-maker, one is trying to engage the audience to such a degree that it forgets itself and ‘disappears’ into the story,” says Jones. “One has all these creative resources – the lighting, the design, the hair, the acting, the grade etc – with which to persuade the audience of the story’s verisimilitude. Visual effects are no different. If it doesn’t draw attention to itself, then it’s working – and so trust doesn’t really enter into it.” “There is an unspoken contract with the audience,” adds Robards. “A documentary demands a very different level of authenticity to fiction, for example. There does seem to be a tacit understanding of what is acceptable and what is not. If Blue Planet II was shown to be ‘faking it’, people would feel far more aggrieved than if we had enhanced an eruption of an unidentifiable volcano for an historical recreation.” And if anyone is feeling aggrieved about the absence of Hammer’s genitals, perhaps they should be seeking out another kind of film altogether."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/30/sam-allardyce-appointed-new-everton-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:55:59Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce appointed new Everton manager before Huddersfield game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/30/sam-allardyce-appointed-new-everton-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/30/sam-allardyce-appointed-new-everton-manager","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce appointed new Everton manager before Huddersfield game","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce has been appointed the new Everton manager just a day after watching from the stands as the team cruised to a 4-0 victory against West Ham United at Goodison Park. The 63-year-old has signed a deal to the end of June 2019. Allardyce has succeeded Ronald Koeman, who was sacked more than five weeks ago, and returned to management six months after leaving Crystal Palace. He will take over from the caretaker manager David Unsworth, who will stay on the staff at the club, for Everton’s home game against Huddersfield Town on Saturday. The new manager had first been approached by Everton nearly three weeks ago but was reportedly not the club’s first choice and pulled out of talks then. Everton’s failure to attract Marco Silva from Watford and the decision to offer Allardyce a longer-term contract has persuaded him to return to the Premier League fray. Allardyce, who has managed Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham Sunderland and Palace in the Premier League, has never been in charge of a team that has been relegated from the top division. “The attraction of the club itself, the people I’ve known at the club – Peter Reid is one of my best mates, so are Andy Gray and Paul Bracewell whom I worked with at Sunderland – these people have always made me aware of just how special and unique a club Everton is and I feel really enthused and energised to come in as manager,” Allardyce said. “I’ve always thought Everton was a great club. It is a great club. Obviously, the club has gone through a difficult spell and hopefully I can put that behind us as quickly as possible and start looking upwards again. Because, ultimately, it’s the ambition of the club, the ambition of the owner and the board, allied to the fact that it’s Everton and all the fantastic history, which have proved to be key for me. “Ambition is important for any manager or coach, owner or director. It’s what you need to have and hopefully we can deliver to the fans to get this club high up the league. That’s what we’re aiming for. “I think that whatever’s happened before we’ve just got to all rally around together. Because we are all in it together and let’s all pull in the same direction. Let’s try to get a healthy spirit around the club. That’s difficult when you’re losing but the win last night over West Ham and the magnificent atmosphere around Goodison, which was just brilliant, well that’s lifted everybody around the club. “The fans are the most important people at any football club, of course, and we have to give the players every possibility to play to their best, really give them no excuses for not playing to their best and get them right back up to the top level we believe they’re capable of. “Last season showed what the club is trying to build and we need to demonstrate that level of ambition and assuredness again. We can. It’s a question now of putting in the work to do that and I’m really enthused by the prospect.” Everton’s majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri said: “I’m delighted to confirm Sam as our new manager. His strong leadership will bring great motivation and get the best out of players. “Sam understands the long-term ambitions we have for this great club and I know he is a man who gives it his all and is focused 24 hours a day on the club. “Evertonians are the most passionate and best fans in the world and when the club does badly we all suffer. But in football everything changes very quickly, so I hope this will help to propel us to where we should be. “I would like to put on record our thanks as a club to David Unsworth for stepping up when we needed him over the last few weeks. He is a real Evertonian, embodying the commitment, pride and passion we all feel for the club.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/30/matt-lauer-ashamed-and-embarrassed-by-reports-of-sexual-misconduct","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:05:30Z","webTitle":"Matt Lauer 'ashamed and embarrassed' by reports of sexual misconduct","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/30/matt-lauer-ashamed-and-embarrassed-by-reports-of-sexual-misconduct","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/30/matt-lauer-ashamed-and-embarrassed-by-reports-of-sexual-misconduct","fields":{"headline":"Matt Lauer 'ashamed and embarrassed' by reports of sexual misconduct","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former US morning show anchor Matt Lauer said reports of his sexual misconduct had “enough truth” in them for him to feel “ashamed and embarrassed” in his first public statement since NBC fired the star host for inappropriate sexual behavior. NBC announced on Wednesday that it had received one complaint about Lauer, anchor of the Today show for 20 years, and hours later new accusations were published in newspapers that had been investigating him. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry,” Lauer said in a statement his representative sent to the Guardian on Thursday morning. The statement was released at the same time as Lauer’s former co-anchor on Today, Savannah Guthrie, read it on-air. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier, Guthrie had announced that Lauer was fired because of a detailed complaint by a colleague. “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed,” Lauer said. “I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.” Variety on Wednesday published the results of a two-month investigation of Lauer that included accounts by three women accusing him of sexual harassment. The women asked to be anonymous because they did not want their disclosures to have professional repercussions. Two of the women said Lauer had a button under his desk that allowed him to “lock his door from the inside without getting up”, according to Variety. Variety reporters spoke with the women’s friends and families, who had told them previously about the harassment, which included claims of exposing himself to one woman and giving another a sex toy. The women and other former and current NBC staff members also described to Variety other uncomfortable incidents involving Lauer and his female colleagues. “For Lauer, work and sex were intertwined,” Variety said. The New York Times, which had also been pursuing an investigation of Lauer, said on Wednesday that NBC had received two new complaints about him after he was fired. Lauer’s involvement with the woman who made the first complaint began while they were covering the Winter Olympics in 2014, according to the Times, who cited two anonymous people that attended an editorial meeting with the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack. Lauer is the latest powerful media figure to be embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal as accusations of sexual harassment and assault are made in Hollywood, politics and other industries. Lack said in a statement on Wednesday that the network received its first complaint against Lauer on Monday. “We were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,” Lack said. Lauer said on Thursday his full-time job was now repairing the damage he had caused. “The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It’s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.” Every day people gather outside the Today show studio, hoping that family will see them on TV, or simply waiting to catch a glimpse of the show’s hosts. On Thursday morning Lauer was at the forefront of some people’s minds. “I liked him and trusted him and now that’s all gone,” said Alayne Smith. “I was surprised, but not shocked because so many are coming forward right now. I’m very disappointed. And more is going to come out. More celebrities and politicians.” Smith and her friend Sandy Siepman were visiting New York City from St Louis, Missouri, to celebrate their 69th and 70th birthdays. Both women are regular Today show viewers, and had brought gold and white signs marking their age. Siepman said she was pleased that Lauer and others were now being held to account. “Women have been treated poorly by men that are high up. They felt they could get away with it because of their jobs,” she said. “I guess you have to be afraid for yourself if you’ve done anything in the past.” Both Smith and Siepman said they would still watch the show – as did Brenda Ray, a 67-year-old from Dallas, Texas. “I feel very sad and disappointed,” Ray said. “I loved him. I thought he was very trustworthy and a friend – I’ve watched him for 20 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/30/michel-barnier-britain-counter-terrorism-brexit-eu-european","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T16:15:53Z","webTitle":"Barnier’s attack on Britain’s counter-terrorism efforts was crass and alarming | Shashank Joshi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/michel-barnier-britain-counter-terrorism-brexit-eu-european","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/30/michel-barnier-britain-counter-terrorism-brexit-eu-european","fields":{"headline":"Barnier’s attack on Britain’s counter-terrorism efforts was crass and alarming","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The crass remarks made by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, in his speech to the Berlin Security Conference yesterday, illustrate the damage being done to Europe’s long-term cohesion as Brexit unfolds, as well as the wider challenges to the future of UK-Europe security and defence cooperation. With agreement over the divorce bill seemingly imminent, Barnier’s task was simple enough. Instead, he started his speech – on the future of European security after Brexit – by expressing shock that Britain voted to leave the EU “after a series of attacks on European soil”, and months after France had called for solidarity against Islamic State. “Rather than stay shoulder to shoulder with the union,” said Barnier, “the British chose to be on their own again.” This was a disingenuous and dishonourable line of attack. While I have little sympathy for the cack-handed manner in which this government has pursued negotiations with the EU, this framing of security as all or nothing – with us, or “on their own” – is a dangerous and counterproductive tactic. The UK was at the forefront of the fight against Isis and other terrorist groups, long before the attacks in Paris in November 2015. Within weeks of those atrocities, the British government set out its case for expanding airstrikes into Syria, winning a vote in parliament the next month. Since then, other European nations have played important supporting roles, with Germany and Poland sending reconnaissance aircraft, for instance. But over two years on, perhaps Barnier should reflect on the fact that the UK is one of only three European states – among 28 EU members – currently conducting airstrikes as part of the coalition against Isis’s sham caliphate. “It is for us, Europeans, to maintain this stability and promote our values around the world,” declared Barnier. Let’s fact-check this. The Netherlands abandoned the offensive air campaign in June 2016 – though it plans to resume strikes in January – and Denmark dropped out six months later. Today only the UK, France, and Belgium remain, with Belgium deploying around a half-dozen combat aircraft and the UK and France around 14 apiece. According to data compiled by Airwars, the UK has conducted a higher proportion of allied airstrikes than any nation, besides the US. It has also provided more than 1,400 military personnel to the coalition. These figures belie Barnier’s misguided effort to call into question the UK’s solidarity. Yet Barnier’s dismissive attitude reflected a deeper problem, which was his glib assumption that Europe could maintain “strategic autonomy”, with the UK relegated to an ad hoc supporting role. The UK would be a country of no more significance than two dozen other partners. “Norway,” he drily noted, “is one of the countries with which we cooperate closely.” The small problem with this is that the UK accounts for a quarter of the EU’s overall defence spending, whereas Norway makes up less than 3%. The comparison is facile. Perhaps all this is a necessary corrective to the delusion that the UK can have its cake and eat it. But Barnier veered to the other extreme, at times seeming to revel in the worst case. “The UK will no longer be involved in decision-making, nor in planning our defence and security instruments,” he announced. But it’s not as simple as that. The EU is obliged to take account of the interests and concerns of non-EU Nato allies (ie the UK, from March 2019), and to hold “intensive” consultations with them, when it considers how to respond in a crisis. More importantly, the minute the EU drew on Nato assets under the so-called Berlin Plus arrangements, the UK would have the right not only to participate in any operation, but also play a role in “planning and preparation”. None of this seems to bother Barnier. Why? Because the EU is making an “unprecedented effort” towards a defence union, and the UK contributes “barely 5%” of personnel to EU-led military operations. These missions, stretching from Bosnia to Somalia, are valuable initiatives that go largely unnoticed by European publics. But they are limited in scope. Barnier’s speech praised the 1998 Saint-Malo declaration, a pioneering Anglo-French agreement that set out an ambitious agenda for EU military capability. But Lord Peter Ricketts, a drafter of Saint-Malo and later the UK’s first national security adviser, recently noted that these ambitions “were never fulfilled”. This is why the EU is tackling people smugglers and pirates, rather than liberating Raqqa and Mosul. On paper, Brexit does not hurt Nato or the UK’s bilateral ties to key partners, such as France or Poland. In practice, Brexit – as a decision, and as a process – has unleashed a bitter cocktail of nationalism, resentment and mistrust that already seems to be corroding what Barnier rightly called our “common destiny”. British politicians bear much responsibility for this – perhaps the lion’s share. But some have also sought to rise to the challenge, proposing constructive ways to insulate security cooperation from the maelstrom. William Hague, for instance, has suggested that the UK might continue to play a role in the EU’s political and security committee. Barnier’s gratuitous remarks on terrorism do little to foster trust or goodwill, on an issue where both sides share the goal of an ambitious partnership. • Shashank Joshi is a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"games/2017/dec/03/where-do-online-worlds-go-to-die-simon-parkin","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T09:30:37Z","webTitle":"Where do online worlds go to die?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/03/where-do-online-worlds-go-to-die-simon-parkin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2017/dec/03/where-do-online-worlds-go-to-die-simon-parkin","fields":{"headline":"Where do online worlds go to die?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In times like these the anxious among us are spoiled for choice when it comes to imagining fitful scenarios of how the world might end. Will we expire in a plume of nuclear smoke, or under a sloshing tide? Will the intricate machinery that stocks supermarket shelves and hospital pharmacies fail in the hazy chaos of a pandemic, or a genocide of bees? It’s truly a golden age for apocalyptic dreamers and fretters. While doom impends our world, it has already visited scores of virtual ones, all of which die in the same way: their servers are taken offline. Demon’s Souls, the 2009 opus by Japanese video game auteur Hidetaka Miyazaki, is the latest game world scheduled to die. Sony, its publisher, announced last week that it will be taken offline. In the Mayan style, the date for the end of the world has been set: February. The game will still work, but in diminished form: the tens of thousands of helpful or misleading messages that players have scrawled into its fantastical landscapes will, in an instant, disappear. Video game apocalypses have, since the rise of the internet, become almost commonplace. More than 50 online worlds have closed since the mid-1990s, usually in response to dwindling populations of players who, through inactivity, render the project commercially unviable. The earliest examples closed without ceremony, but developers soon found that this kind of sudden and unexpected conclusion caused a kind of trauma for the remainers – they realised that it was better to end with a bang than a whimper. More recently, the game’s designers have usually folded the end of the world into their fiction. When Rubies of Eventide closed down in 2009, for example, its creators set fire to the capital city, a blaze that took every player down with it. That same year Tabula Rasa closed when an alien species invaded. When Star Wars Galaxies closed in 2011, the ending was marked with wonder, rather than violence: in the last few hours the skies flickered with a firework display set to mournful music, a swansong for digital existence. Sometimes, when the game’s developers fail to put on a closing ceremony, the players mark the end of the world themselves. In City of Heroes, which closed in 2012, thousands of players gathered in the capital city’s square, clutching flaming torches and protest signs while listening to the final broadcast of the game’s player-run radio station. Dr Henry Lowood, curator of History of Science and Technology Collections for Stanford University Libraries, was present when publisher EA switched off the servers for The Sims Online in 2008. He watched its world’s trees and structures pop from existence. At the time, Lowood described the scene as like seeing “a tidal wave or an earthquake wiping out a town”. The passing of a virtual world presents a unique challenge to the documentarians of our nascent digital culture. Even offline video games can be difficult to preserve, requiring, as they do, specific and outdated hardware to run. How do the historians capture for posterity online worlds that constantly change, evolve and then disappear? Weirdly, the kind of oral tradition that preserved the tales of antiquity has re-emerged, capturing fragments of evidence and experience in blog posts, radio programmes and YouTube clips. Unlike an old film, which can be revisited time and again in its original form, even after its actors and makers have all died and its sets long been demolished, an expired video game world is gone for ever, and certainly in the form in which it was first experienced by its inhabitants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/29/anna-jones-recipes-for-root-vegetable-winter-stews","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T12:00:47Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones' recipes for root vegetable winter stews | Anna Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/29/anna-jones-recipes-for-root-vegetable-winter-stews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/29/anna-jones-recipes-for-root-vegetable-winter-stews","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones' recipes for root vegetable winter stews","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deep winter is my favourite time to be in the kitchen. January brings roots to roast, fat apples to stew, blood oranges and fennel to slice thinly into salads, porridge and rice pudding to stir. My winter cooking is done softly, sometimes slowly, the flavours gentle, round and warm; turmeric, saffron, buttery garlic, mellow ginger and the warming hum of star anise. Of all the cooking I do in winter, a deep pot of stew is what I find myself drawn to most often – sometimes merely the sum of what I have in the fridge, other times more layered and considered. Time to hunker down. Braised January roots with orange, chilli and turmeric Neither of the winter roots used in this recipe – celeriac and swede – will ever win a beauty contest, which is probably why, by and large, they get overlooked in favour of parsnip or sweet potato. This stew uses a generous amount of olive oil, which adds depth and richness, backed up by the sunny haze of turmeric and a pep up from the pul biber. Giant couscous adds a pleasing bite. Prep 10 min Cook 40-45 min Serves 4 150g giant couscous (wholewheat, for preference) 1 kg celeriac (ie, 1 big one or 2 small) 1 small swede 1 fennel bulb 4 carrots 8 tbsp olive oil ½ tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 orange, juiced Salt and black pepper 1 tbsp pul biber (Turkish flaked chilli), or 1 pinch other dried red chilli flakes 1 tsp ground turmeric, or fresh, peeled and grated 1 small bunch parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped 1 x 400g tin or jar butter beans, drained First put the couscous in a bowl, cover with cold water and leave to soak while you get on with the rest. Peel the celeriac and swede, and cut both into irregular, bite-sized pieces. Cut the fennel bulb into thin wedges and finely slice the stems, reserving any of the feathery fronds. Peel and cut the carrots into coins. Heat half the oil in a heavy-based casserole, then sweat the celeriac, swede, carrot and fennel for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until they soften and pick up a little colour. Add the cayenne, cumin, the juice from the lemon and orange, a good pinch of salt and 400ml cold water. Bring to a simmer, cover, turn the heat to low and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make a dressing by mixing the rest of the oil in a small bowl with the lemon zest, then stir in the pul biber, turmeric and parsley. Once the vegetables have been cooking for 30 minutes, they should be soft, with a decent amount of thick, soupy broth; if the stew looks a little lean on liquid, add more hot water, because the couscous will absorb a lot of liquid, too. Drain the couscous and stir into the pot with the butter beans, put the lid back on and cook for 10 minutes more until the couscous has fluffed up and softened. Season to taste and serve hot, with a drizzle of the lemony dressing to finish. A six-ingredient squash stew – and five ways to eat it I’m aware there are nine components if you count the oil, salt and pepper, but everyone has those, so they don’t really count. I usually have most of the rest of these ingredients to hand at home, but the dish is very adaptable. This is the kind of base I use when I’m cooking on autopilot, with my imagination low, but my need for flavour and warmth the opposite. I’ve suggested some swaps to make it more accessible; a tin of beans is another great addition – add one to the leftovers, so they go further. Prep 6 min Cook 30-40 min Serves 4 Olive oil, for frying 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 fennel bulb (or 2 sticks celery), finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped Salt and black pepper 1.5kg squash or a 1.5kg piece of pumpkin (I used a crown prince) 1 small bunch thyme (or rosemary, or a few sage leaves) 1 handful split red lentils Heat a glug of oil in a large casserole, add the chopped veg and a big pinch of salt, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring, until soft and sweet. Meanwhile, chop the squash into bite-sized pieces (there’s no need to peel it). Once the onion mixture looks good, add the squash, thyme, a handful of lentils and boiling water just to cover, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, until the squash is tender and the stew has thickened. To serve, the choice is yours: 1 Add some chickpeas, and top with yoghurt, mint and nigella seeds; 2 Instead of adding it all to the pot, bash some thyme leaves in a mortar with good olive oil and chopped chilli, and serve on top of the stew; 3 Finely chop half a clove of garlic, roughly chop a small bunch of parsley, and mix with the zest of an orange and some salt and pepper. Spoon on top of the finished stew; 4 Fry a finely sliced onion in olive oil, then pile on to the stew with chopped coriander and mint; 5 Tear some good bread into chunks, drizzle with oil, season and bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for eight minutes, until golden. Tumble all over the stew and top with some pesto (homemade, if you can muster the energy). Photography: Emma Lee for the Guardian. Food and prop styling: Anna Jones.

But in a week in which Austria’s burschenschaften have come under assault from newspaper exposés and feminist pranksters, some of the country’s steadfast frat boys have started to flinch. Austria’s vice-chancellor and Freedom party (FPÖ) leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, is expected to don the pill-box cap of his Vandalia fraternity on Friday night for an annual ball at Vienna’s imperial Hofburg Palace that will gather members of rightwing student societies from across Austria. Yet days earlier, Strache had to insist “fraternities have nothing to do with the FPÖ”, after prosecutors started to investigate the songbook of one of his party colleague’s fraternities for containing lyrics mocking the Holocaust. Organisers of the FPÖ-funded “Academics Ball” have also been unnerved, imposing heightened security such as facial recognition cameras after a satirical feminist fraternity announced plans to infiltrate and disrupt the event. Vienna police said they were likely to employ as many 3,000 officers to protect the ball’s 2,500 visitors in anticipation of more vigorous protests than in recent years. The far-right FPÖ has struggled to divert the spotlight from its roots in nationalistic student networks since it formed a coalition government with the centre-right Austrian People’s party of the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in December. When the FPÖ last formed a government at the start of the millennium, its former leader Jörg Haider kept party activists with fraternity backgrounds out of prominent positions. But the FPÖ’s current leadership has until now been more open about its past. Out of the party’s 51 MPs, 18 are active members of rightwing fraternities, including five of its six chairmen. They include not just its leader, Strache, but also the FPÖ negotiator, Harald Stefan, whose Olympia fraternity has called for Poland and Austria to be included in German reunification. “I feel German,” he told Austrian television in 2008. They also include the transport minister, Norbert Hofer, whose fraternity Marko-Germania’s founding document rejects the modern state of Austria as a “history-defying fiction”, and who in a speech at last year’s Academics Ball emphasised that he wore the colours of the German flag “with pride”. “It is no exaggeration to say that the fraternities have taken control of the Freedom party,” said Hans-Henning Scharsach, the author of a prize-winning book on the subject, Silent Takeover. While German fraternities can range from far-right national socialists to liberal societies, Scharsach explained, Austria’s fraternity movement has to be located on a more narrowly nationalistic spectrum. “Because they were based outside German borders, Austrian corporations have always had to be more vocal about their commitment to the idea of a ‘Greater Germany’ based on ethnicity,” he said. One such vocal declaration of allegiance to the pan-German idea landed the FPÖ in hot water this week. On Tuesday, the weekly newspaper Falter published excerpts from a songbook used by the fraternity Germania zu Wiener Neustadt that celebrated atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht and mocked Holocaust victims. “In their midst comes the Jew Ben-Gurion: ‘Step on the gas, you ancient Germanic peoples, we’ll manage the seventh million,’” ran one of the lyrics quoted, a reference to Israel’s first prime minister and the 6 million European Jews murdered by the Nazis during the second world war. Germania’s deputy co-chairman, Udo Landbauer, is running as one of the FPÖ’s top candidates in Sunday’s state elections in Lower Austria. His spokesperson told Falter he had only seen a copy of the book with pages and passages torn or blackened out. Friday’s Academics Ball in Vienna illustrates the FPÖ’s dilemma: political calculation may command the party’s politicians to distance themselves from a pan-German ideology that is unpopular with the overwhelming majority of Austrian voters, but their fraternities demand unflinching loyalty to their traditions. The ball’s organiser, the FPÖ member Udo Guggenbichler, told the Kurier newspaper this week that Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, had also once been a member of an Austrian fraternity. He did not mention that Herzl had left the Albia fraternity two years later because of its antisemitic tendencies. Last year’s Academics Ball was interrupted when a satirical feminist fraternity called Hysteria unfurled a banner featuring a picture of a laughing hyena, which the group described as its “heraldic animal” because “it lives in matriarchal structures dominated by females, in which only the most docile males can survive genetically”. On its website, Hysteria announced it had “officially” taken over the Academics Ball this year and planned to provide “might-night entertainment” for the event, which it renamed the “ball for the protection of men”. In an email exchange with the Guardian, a Hysteria member said the fraternity believed in the urgent need to curb men’s right to vote. “Men are very emotional and tend to ignore the consequences their decisions can have on society as a whole,” the spokeswoman said. “It is for this reason that they have for centuries ended up doing harm to their own cause. Their mode of thinking is very suitable for parental care, but not for important structural and political decision-making.” Hysteria came to the Austrian public’s attention when its uniformed members acted as stewards at a reading by the feminist author Stefanie Sargnagel in February 2016. However, the fraternity’s spokeswoman claimed it had been founded in 1810 – 40 years earlier than the country’s first officially known male fraternity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/23/mogwai-sponsor-primary-school-football-team","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T18:35:28Z","webTitle":"Young team: Scottish post-rock band Mogwai sponsor primary school footballers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/mogwai-sponsor-primary-school-football-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/23/mogwai-sponsor-primary-school-football-team","fields":{"headline":"Young team: Scottish post-rock band Mogwai sponsor primary school footballers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Glasgow band Mogwai, known for their deafening post-rock music, have become the shirt sponsors of a primary school football team in their home city. St Roch’s Primary and Deaf School in Roystonhill were the recipients of the kits, emblazoned with the band’s logo. “They look amazing! We can’t thank you enough,” the school tweeted to the band, whose member Stuart Braithwaite replied “So happy about this”. The band’s drummer Martin Bulloch told BBC Scotland that the school’s deputy head had suggested the sponsorship deal to him. “They were in some old kit and he was looking to get them some new stuff. He asked if we could help out. I emailed the rest of the boys and they were delighted to do so. There is nothing in the school budget for stuff like that so you can only imagine what they were kicking around in - old kit from years ago.” Mogwai have dabbled in football-related projects before, scoring the film documentary Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which follows former French international Zinedine Zidane for an entire match. They have made four other soundtracks as well as nine studio albums – the most recent two reached the UK Top 10, and they played the biggest hometown concert of their career at Glasgow’s Hydro in December 2017. Other bands have meanwhile come to the aid of teams with sponsorship deals: in 1999, Fatboy Slim’s label Skint sponsored Brighton &amp; Hove Albion when they languished in the third division, while other Scottish bands Biffy Clyro, Wet Wet Wet and the View have all previously sponsored kits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/29/can-you-really-save-for-a-deposit-by-ditching-coffee-and-avocado-toast-i-tried-to-find-out","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T06:20:40Z","webTitle":"Can you really save for a deposit by ditching coffee and avocado toast?

I tried to find out​","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At 26 years and 10 months old, I am squarely a millennial. I have had four jobs in five years. I am flummoxed by fabric softener. I sometimes take my phone into the bathroom. And I doubt I will ever own my own home. Not because I want to rent for ever – I want too many dogs for that – but because, like so many people my age, I can’t imagine being able to afford it. House prices have grown faster than rents and incomes, moving far beyond what is considered affordable, especially for twentysomethings. The only people my age I know who have bought a house have done so outside London, as part of a couple, with help from their parents or all three. But you wouldn’t know that from the commentators who argue that a deposit would be within the grasp of all millennials – if only we would cut back on takeaway coffee and avocado toast. Beyond the last £8,000-odd to pay off on my student loan, I am debt-free. I earn considerably more than the national average salary of about £27,000 (and about in line with the average for London). I am undoubtedly in a privileged position, especially for someone my age. But I find the argument that I could afford a house simply by going without luxuries for a few years hard to swallow when the average deposit for first-time buyers is £32,899. In London, it is more than three times that: £106,577. But I have decided to test my assumption that, as a single twentysomething committed to living in a major city, I will never be able to buy a house. I will record all my spending for a month, then the money-saving expert Martin Lewis will assess the results. I call him the day before I start my diary exercise to discuss. (The same day I buy a £100 Taylor Swift ticket – not a coincidence, but not the most expensive seat available, either.) Lewis tells me that the issue of unaffordable housing is not as simple as splicing it along generational lines. “There are those young people who are managing their money so badly that they can’t afford property, then those who would never be able to buy without help from the bank of Mum and Dad.” On one point he is firm, however: while it is possible to be approved for a mortgage with a deposit of only 5%, to be able to truly afford a property I need at least 10%, ideally 20%. “But that’s a very difficult amount to save when you’re already paying rent,” he says. “Where do you live?” South London, I say, in an ex-council flat I share with one flatmate; we each pay £765 a month in rent and heating. “What would a one-bedroom flat cost to buy there?” Approximately £350,000, I say. “What do you earn? I presume you’re going to be saying that in the piece; you can’t do it without.” I tell him: between £35,000 and £40,000, which according to Glassdoor is about average for a journalist. “There you go!” says Lewis. “Piece is over. You won’t get a mortgage, full stop – I don’t care what you spend. It is going to be virtually impossible for you.” Then a thought occurs to him. “Do you have a partner?” Nope. “Certainly, by yourself, you’re not going to get a mortgage for £350,000,” he confirms. But even if a house is not in my foreseeable future, Lewis says, I should still be focused on saving. “You’re 26, you’re single, you’ve got no kids, no partner,” he says. It sounds a bit depressing. Lewis adds: “You might not think it, but this is actually a good financial time for you.” With no dependants and few large expenses, I will probably be able to bounce back from any adversity, he says, but that may not always be the case. “Life changes, so this is a good time to save, whether it’s for a property or not.” I see his point – but I realise, with a sinking feeling, that it is far from the approach I have been taking. After rent, heating, electricity, groceries, internet, mobile phone and public transport costs, I am left with a bit over £1,000 each month. Of that, I save about £100 every month. The rest goes on, mostly, coffee, food, alcohol and travel. Convinced by damning house‑price-to-income ratios – 7.6 in England and Wales; more than 14 in London – that my own home is out of reach, I have resigned myself to spending for the now. In such a grossly inflated property market, any question of reducing expenditure cannot help but seem by-the-by. This is not the right attitude, says Lewis. He wants me to understand “opportunity cost”: the long-term loss that results from spending your money on option A rather than option B – in my case, spending £4.50 on lunch, rather than my future first-home deposit. “In simple, homespun terms, you can’t spend money twice,” he says. “Let’s take something trite – do you buy coffee at a coffee shop?” Yes – at least one every workday. “At least?” I don’t dare tell him that I recently started going out of my way to a new cafe near work, where the flat whites taste marginally better than at Pret and cost 45p more. “That’s £625 just from your coffee,” Lewis points out. “We haven’t looked at anything else!” It is arguably “a perfect life choice” if I feel I am getting my money’s worth, he says. “But if you spend 625 quid a year on coffee and then say: ‘I can’t save up for a deposit on a house,’ you’re starting to lose a bit of the moral argument.” I am starting to worry what else this spending diary will reveal. Bus then tube to work £3.90 Coffee from new cafe £2.80 Lunch from work canteen £4.50 Downpayment on a gym membership £70 Tube home £2.70 Dinner out £15 Snack on the way home £2.20 Total £101.10 I have managed to avoid including the Taylor Swift ticket, but this is not an auspicious start, what with the list including the most expensive flat white within half a mile of the office and two out of three meals eaten out. An old friend is staying with me and we want to try the Chinese restaurant that was booked up on his last visit. Then, on the way home, we stop at the local Turkish supermarket and the Wafe Up biscuits my flatmate and I like are four for £1.10 and, well, here we are. I may live to regret the Gymbox membership, but I have learned that scrimping on a gym means I do not go. If I experience a flutter of alarm every time the direct debit goes through, I will make the effort to bring down the cost per visit. Tube to work £2.40 Coffee £2.80 Tea from work canteen 50p Power bill £73.19 Round at the pub £12.45 Dinner and a third of a bottle of wine £19 Tube then bus home £3.90 Total £114.24 Not an auspicious day four, either, although it starts well. For the first – and only – time during this exercise, I bring my lunch in from home and feel smug about it. Then my resolve slackens and I find myself at the pub, then at Honest Burger, splitting a bottle of sauvignon blanc. Still. At least my flatmate will pay me back for half the power bill. Bus then tube to work £3.90 Coffee from Pret (economising in action!) £1.95 Lunch from work canteen £4.50 Cash lost in drunken haze at work Christmas party £20-£30 Round at Shoreditch House £20 Total at least £50.35 Scrabbling around the floor of the Big Chill in King’s Cross for the £20 (or was it £30?) I am sure I put in my bag with the broken clasp, I think back to Lewis’s “opportunity cost judgment”. All well and good – but what about when your judgment is impaired? A few hours later, at Shoreditch House, I pay another £20 – twenty pounds! – for two gin and tonics. That sobers me up. Bus to work £1.50 Coffee £2.50 Tesco sausage roll £1 Fizzy drink £1.40 Rent and heating £765 Council tax £97 Lunch from the greasy spoon £7.40 Tube home £2.40 White chocolate Magnum from the corner shop £2 Total £880.20 The day after the Christmas party, at work, at what might euphemistically be termed a low ebb, I am mostly focused on how demoralising it is to keep a spending diary. Then it hits me: this is what Lewis meant. You could not pay me to go back to Shoreditch House, but I would have paid twice what I did for the cheese omelette and Coke at the caff round the corner the day after and it would still have been good value. As for the Magnum, enjoyed in the bath – I have never known such pleasure for £2. This feels like a breakthrough. Total £0 The trick to saving money, it seems, is not to leave the house or go online. Tube to town £2.40 Sale top from &amp; Other Stories £34.50 Full-price dress from &amp; Other Stories £59 Gym leggings from TK Maxx (new year, new me!) £16.99 Supermarket snack after gruelling experience of Regent Street £3.28 Tube then bus home £3.90 Bus to party (taking me up to the daily fare cap) 30p Booze to take to party £11.39 Total £131.76 My plan for a relaxed New Year’s Eve with friends is thrown into chaos when, midway through a mooch around the Regent Street sales, I am informed that a single man is going to be at that night’s party, necessitating a second trip to &amp; Other Stories to buy a dress in a blind panic. Lewis was unequivocal that my path to home ownership would be much easier as part of a couple (“And if they have rich parents, you’re laughing all the way”). This is an investment, I reason, just like the £181 haircut and colour on day six. As it is, I end up wearing the new top with an old skirt and return the dress three days later for a refund. Lewis later clarifies, sounding a bit alarmed, that a partner is not a financial plan: “I would not be finding someone just so you can get a house.” Tube to work £2.40 Coffee from work canteen £1.60 Lunch out £14.10 Uber from work to restaurant £10.35 Dinner out £17.92 Bus home £2.40 Total £48.77 A shockingly expensive day – grotesque, really, in its lavishness. And a Monday! Through poor planning on my part, two overdue catchups with friends fall on the same day – and at more expensive joints than I would usually plump for. Yet, the only expense I regret is the Uber I call when it becomes apparent I am going to arrive unacceptably late. Both meals are delicious and the company delightful, helping to ease the deflating feeling of the first full week back at work. And, over dinner, it occurs to Sophie to set me up with her friend, a neuroscientist who has just bought a house and is “looking for someone to share it with”. That £18 at the Begging Bowl in Peckham may yet end up being the best money I have ever spent. *** Calling to discuss my spending diary, Lewis says he has two big-picture observations. The first is that it gives only a fractional view of my finances, focusing on my daily outgoings for a small window of time. If I want to make “pain-free savings”, I should check I am getting the best deals on electricity, internet, phone and other recurring expenses. “The second thing,” he says, “is that this is not the spending diary of someone who is looking to save money.” To be fair, he adds, I had said as much when we first spoke. However, on the basis of my salary and my spending, Lewis believes home ownership is within my grasp – even outside a relationship. I am astonished. Scanning my spending diary, he says it would be “very possible” for me to save from £400 to as much as £700 of my disposable income each month by cutting back on coffees, lunches out, rounds at the pub and holidays. “Let’s be blunt: you do not need a money-saving expert to tell you that.” Saving between £4,800 and £8,400 each year – hopefully more, if my salary increases in the future or I find someone to go halves on a house with – I could reach a 10% deposit of £35,000 in between four and eight years, says Lewis. “And the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll get there.” But I have to want it, he continues. He has pages of evidence that I do not. “The most telling point in the whole thing, for me, was this line: ‘Brought lunch in, felt smug about it.’ If you were deliberately saving for a house, that would be habitual. It would not be smug.” I see his point: if I had brought in my lunch every day over the four weeks, I could have saved about £90, minus the cost of groceries. This is the secret of “the golden numbers”, says Lewis: 365 days; 52 weeks; 12 months; 250 workdays. Savings build up with consistency over a long time. Spending £4.50 every workday on lunch from the canteen? That is £1,125 a year. If I were billed for that amount annually, Lewis says, I might be more motivated to bring down the total. “And: ‘Losing cash in a drunken haze’ ...” He makes a slightly strangled noise. “That’s a particular sin, regardless of your finances.” Ironically, I had only withdrawn cash to prevent myself from overspending on cards. “I think the classic problem with you,” says Lewis, not unkindly, “is that you talk about efforts to save money, but I don’t think you’re persuaded in your head of the reason for doing it. If you want to do this, you need to make that decision in your head and start to live your life – as the focused, ambitious person that you are – with one of your ambitions being to save a deposit for a house, so that you actually get a kick out of the fact: ‘I’ve brought in sandwiches to work for two months. I’ve got this much extra money. Boom!’ You need that mentality and you don’t have it.” I feel a bit ashamed, not least because I am the exception to the rule: for me, if not most millennials, Lewis is suggesting it really is a matter of cutting down on the avocado toast. “The problem with being 26 years old is that the years creep away from you,” he says, ominously. It is feasible, I suppose, that my future self and her many dogs will wish I had spent less at cafes and more on a property to house them. “Maybe the best thing to come out of this article is that you sit there, take a hard look at yourself and work out where you want to be. If you want that house, you say: ‘You know what? Screw it. I’m going to have to change my ways.’ You’re not a kid any more.” Reader, I bought a cafetiere.

She is portrayed in Slater’s bestselling memoir-novel, Toast, and was played on screen by Helena Bonham Carter in a popular adaptation. A theatrical version is apparently on its way. It’s an interesting choice of word. “Sharing” is what baring-the-breast participants do in 12-step meetings. It’s like the Catholic confessional – what you say doesn’t leave the box. Or, as the Alcoholics Anonymous chair says: “What’s said in the room stays in the room.” There’s a strong sense that what you may think of your mother, or mother figure, should be bound by a seal of secrecy. But Slater has unsealed all over the place. He’s not the first. Talk to people who keep abreast of modern fiction and you’ll often hear someone say: “Strange that Edward St Aubyn has never won the big prize.” (St Aubyn himself wrote a resentful novel about prizelessness, Lost for Words, in 2014.) I would personally shovel Bookers at St Aubyn. But one suspects there is a black mark over him for semi-autobiographical novels such as Mother’s Milk. It was OK going oedipal on his father but wrong to do the dirty on his mother as well. One’s image of one’s mother is complicated by the fact that she has known us nine months longer than anyone else on Earth – and has kept us going over that vulnerable period with oxygen, blood and bodily shielding. A Mommie Dearest-style revenge is rank ingratitude. Or, if you prefer, oversharing. I’ve overshared about my mother in print. Let me briefly reshare. It’s complicated. I loved her, passionately. Still do. And yet even today, decades after her death, I seethe with matrophobic fury. I’ve tried everything. Alcohol, principally, which worked only for as long as I was drunk. At one time, all the time. My mother left school at 14. She was clever. She had won a scholarship to the local Bluecoat school – but her parents (with four children) were disinclined to part with the cash for blue coats. In protest, she changed her name from Violet to Elizabeth. She went into service (for what that meant at that time, read Mothering Sunday by Graham Swift). “Yes, I’ve seen my daughter at Bedford College,” my grandmother liked to boast. Without adding that the girl was slopping out rooms. But Liz snooped, and picked up a better accent. She was good at that kind of upward mobility. She met my father, a Scot who, his father having refused to pay for his clever son to go to university, became a policeman in the Met. In those days, you had to be a big man. He was champion athletic. When war broke out, he volunteered for the RAF and was promptly burnt alive in training, identified by a bridge for the teeth he’d lost in the boxing ring. As a schoolboy I used to lie, and say that he’d been shot down over Germany. I was a bit angry with him, too, and made do with Biggles. Liz also joined the police force. Anything went in wartime – even women PCs. On the same principle, she slept around, exclusively with American officers. She was getting better educated all the time. The first serious books I read were American servicemen editions. After the war, she left for Argentina with a former British officer, shot up at Arnhem, editor of the Buenos Aires Herald. She was mistress not wife: he would have married her, but she wanted freedom. And freedom from me. I was shuttled around to whichever relative would have me, luggage not wanted. I came to terms with it, understood it, but never really forgave it. And so, like Nigel, I overshared and felt a lot better. Call it the writing cure. Good luck to Toast, the play. • John Sutherland is Lord Northcliffe professor emeritus of modern english literature at UCL"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/directors-no-longer-untouchable-gods-transforming-british-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"'Directors are no longer untouchable gods': transforming British theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/directors-no-longer-untouchable-gods-transforming-british-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/directors-no-longer-untouchable-gods-transforming-british-theatre","fields":{"headline":"'Directors are no longer untouchable gods': transforming British theatre","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It may be a grey January morning but a palpable frisson hangs in the air at the Royal Court. It’s not just that two plays are about to open – one new, one a revival, both, as it happens, written by women – but in the past few months, this building in London’s Sloane Square has been at the forefront of a crusade to change the culture of theatre. #MeToo sent seismic shocks through the industry, one where sexual harassment had long been the accepted behaviour of eccentric and untouchable “geniuses”. While public downfalls in theatre have, so far, been surprisingly few and far between – with director Max Stafford-Clark and former Old Vic boss Kevin Spacey the exceptions – it has also been one of the quickest sectors to galvanise for change, with the charge being led by the Royal Court artistic director, Vicky Featherstone. “The conversations I’ve had in the last three months are unlike any I’ve had in my entire career,” she says, “so I fully believe a real shift is taking place. But things definitely still need to break and be re-fixed, and that’s the phase we’re in now. It’s intimidating and scary, but lots of good stuff will come out of it.” Gathering in the basement cafe on this frosty Monday are just some of the many women who, like Featherstone, continue to mobilise (click on ‘i’ on bottom right of photo for caption). Gina Abolins, the education manager at Stafford-Clark’s theatre company, made the brave step of being one of the first to speak up last year, when she accused him of persistently inappropriate behaviour; he stepped down soon after. Abolins draws hope from Featherstone’s newly drawn up code of behaviour, where “directors are no longer untouchable gods who can do or say what they like”. Featherstone is keen to point out that this code, drawn up after a day of action held at the Royal Court in October, on which 150 anonymous testimonies of sexual assault were read out, is currently “an offering – the beginning, not the end, of the conversation”, and certainly not an edict for other organisations. But it is also the first time basic rules such as “You must take responsibility for the power you have” and “Call it out, straight away, even if it’s awkward to do so. Don’t feel shame” have ever been put down in writing for directors, producers and actors. Abolins, and Steffi Holtz, Stafford-Clark’s former assistant, intend to push for a similar code becoming the norm across the industry. “It’s the power and the hierarchy, particularly within rehearsal rooms, that still needs to be flattened,” says Abolins, who has been inundated with others asking her about the process of whistleblowing. “A code of conduct, which empowers you to be able to go to a director and say, ‘That thing you just said to me made me feel uncomfortable’ and for a director to respond, ‘I’m really sorry. It won’t happen again’ – that would change everything. Imagine if no one was untouchable?” Holtz nods in agreement. “I do think theatre, especially, calls for some sort of universal and mandatory code – because it is one big grey area, where everybody is an eccentric, and you don’t ever quite know where the line is.” For director Lucy Kerbel, the challenge is how to create an entirely new ethos. The organisation she founded seven years ago, Tonic, fights for gender equality and has long forced institutions to look at their hiring policies and ingrained bias; now, Kerbel hopes to do the same in terms of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour. The two issues are connected, she says: “It’s all about looking at the fundamentals of power. If a disproportionate number of people moving into artistic director roles are white men, this type of behaviour is more likely to continue, and these macho environments will just keep going unchallenged.” “Yes,” interjects Meera Syal, actor and writer, and currently playing Miss Hannigan in Annie. “This is all about a rethinking of what it means to hold power, isn’t it?” Like Kerbel, Syal sees #MeToo as a progression of the long-running fight for equality and diversity across theatre, though she shakes her head in disbelief that it has taken so long for the pot to boil over. “This is a wonderful place to start dismantling a scared, tight little group that is holding all the reins – but we’ve also been here before,” she says. “It takes a long time to change the culture and we have to be ever-vigilant.” She points to Sita McIntosh, the chief operating officer of WhatsOnStage, who, like Syal, has been in the industry for more than three decades and is an active voice in the diversity debate. McIntosh sighs and nods. “You think we’ve moved on, and then the Bridge, a brand new London theatre, announces its first season, and you just have to go, ‘Are you joking?’” The theatre’s debut programme, devised by former National Theatre director Nicholas Hytner, featured work only by white writers, with its three consecutive opening plays all by men. “And then, going there, I saw only three black faces: mine, the man taking the coats and the man picking up the litter outside.” “It’s not meant to sound negative – it’s just that we’ve been on the wave of change and optimism before with the whole diversity discussion. And we know from bitter experience that just signing a statement doesn’t make any difference,” continues Syal. “My hope is that, as this movement moves forward, it becomes more intergenerational and more inclusive of women of colour.” Syal looks around the table at the group of women gathered here today, whose ages range from 25 to 56, and breaks into a laugh. “But I’m not putting dungarees on again for anybody.” For theatre company RashDash – made up of Abbi Greenland, Helen Goalen and Becky Wilkie – challenging the stories that are told on stage is also fundamental to changing the male-dominated culture of theatre. “As an audience member I know how often I have to turn off my patriarchy or my misogyny klaxon, to enjoy quite a lot of the stories that I see on stage,” says Greenland, to a rousing chorus of agreement. “And that all goes towards normalising a society where people feel entitled to bully and abuse their power, and are entitled to women’s bodies. So I would really love to see 2018 become a place where people are better at investigating the stories they’re telling.” Greenland and Goalen hope #MeToo will embolden women writers. “It should encourage the gatekeepers to put on work that doesn’t necessarily fit into a patriarchal structure of storytelling, to allow that work to breathe – not just on the fringes but on the main stages as well,” adds Goalen. For Pippa Sa and Beth Watson of Bechdel theatre, a campaign and podcast challenging gender representation in theatre, solidarity is key, “creating new networks between younger and older generations”. Featherstone refuses to criticise other institutions for not following the Royal Court’s example and laying out their own code of behaviour, but others in the group are less forgiving. “When Vicky spoke up, because it’s in her blood to do so, what shocked me was that the bigger establishments weren’t embarrassed into doing something bigger and bolder. Or be just as loud, or even just join in. But they didn’t,” says playwright Rachel De-lahay. “And then you look at the announcement for the new season at a theatre like the Almeida in London, and it’s all male writers, and it shows how people are still not even trying to change things. That’s embarrassing.” Yet De-lahay, one of many women whom Stafford-Clark asked about losing their virginity, says she still feels a lot of optimism. “I feel excited that #MeToo won’t be a necessary thing for future generations,” she says. “I feel like there’s a future me that would walk into an office with Max Stafford-Clark and say, ‘Er no, that’s not an acceptable thing to say’ and walk out – as opposed to scurrying away and phoning a friend and perpetuating that culture of silence. And I feel that, as long as Vicky is there, being loud and rallying the troops – because sadly no one else is doing it – then we can make real change.” For Featherstone, the key to making a fundamental difference is not to be afraid to make mistakes – this is, after all, uncharted territory. “It’s a bit like me with the Rita, Sue and Bob stuff,” she says, referring to her decision to initially cancel a production of Andrea Dunbar’s Rita, Sue and Bob Too, her play about two teenage girls who have a sexual affair with an older married man, and then put it back on after allegations of censorship. “There isn’t a roadmap for this: we have to try things, and we fail and change when something else happens. We have to keep moving – we have to be fearless about it.” Back row from left: Sita McIntosh, COO of WhatsOnStage; Abbi Greenland, RashDash theatre company; Pippa Sa, Bechdel campaign and podcast; Gina Abolins, Out of Joint theatre company; Vicky Featherstone, artistic director, Royal Court; Meera Syal, writer and actor; Lucy Kerbel, director and Tonic founder.

And when I say, “Wear a hat”, I mean it literally as well as euphemistically. Because, to be blunt, we all know that when a man of A Certain Age begins to wear hats, it’s a sartorially polite way of saying, “Hey, guys, I’m doing the slow, swimming pool walk towards hair loss and I’m trying to cover it up with a Justin Timberlake SexyBack trilby. DOYOUTHINKANYONEWILLNOTICE?!” And I think that, yes, yes they will. So here we stand, after attempting comb-over, comb-under, comb-round, short shave, overgrown. The time has come to wear hats. This equates to an acceptance that your best hair days are behind you (probably lying on your pillow or matted sadly in a hairbrush). As you look in the mirror and see the shadow of your dad’s head approaching, you know you need to hide it with a big hat. It’s the least subtle thing in the world, and yet some hats are actually quite nice. The Frank Spencer/Che Guevara beret has been on the Prada catwalk and seen on the likes of Miguel. Meanwhile, the perennial “Mani from the Stone Roses” bucket hat was spotted at the Supreme and Barbour shows. Wearing the latter, I feel as if I’m walking about with a subtitle draped around my neck that reads, “Lad (1997-2004)”: you don’t have to be mad fer it to wear a bucket hat, but it certainly helps. With a beret on my head, I feel “peak fashion” – that is to say, I would expect to get a few quizzical looks if I wore one down the high street. Still, I reckon it’s a pretty sharp alternative to baldness. Conversely, the sheep’s fabric bobble hat I’m wearing feels nicely in the middle ground, as if I’ve placed Winter Wonderland atop my head and am parading it around. It lifts the whole look, even though I’m getting certain “East 17’s Brian Harvey wears a bobble hat” vibes from the whole thing. No bad thing. Priya wears sheepskin hat, £35, woodwood.com.

Giving evidence at Liverpool crown court, the witness, who was 15 at the time in the early 80s, said he had returned to the changing rooms of Crewe Alexandra’s Gresty Road ground after a match to find Barry Bennell with a young player on his knee “fondling [him] down his football shorts”. “Obviously Barry was startled to see me come back. He got up and shouted at me and said: ‘What the fuck are you doing?’ and I said: ‘I have come for my boots and what the hell are you fucking doing?’” the man told the court on Tuesday. “At that point he jumped up, stormed at me and pinned me to the wall. If you can imagine Star Wars and Darth Vader, it was like a Darth Vader grip.” The jury heard that the coach’s alleged victim – who was around 12 years old at the time – ran out of the changing room in tears and that Bennell told the witness: “You have not seen anything. If you say anything to anyone I will make sure I will finish your football career here and now.” Bennell stands accused of 48 sexual abuse charges relating to 11 boys from the junior setups at Crewe and Manchester City. The abuse is alleged to have taken place between 1979 and 1990 against boys between the ages of eight and 14. Bennell has denied the charges but pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexually abusing three boys aged 11 to 14. The witness said Bennell had a “psychological hold” over him after the incident. He did not tell anybody about what he had seen until he read reports of allegations against Bennell in the press at the end of 2016. “It was part of my life that I locked away,” he said. In a police interview read to the court, Bennell said he would not have “allowed himself” to abuse the boy in question because he was not attracted to him and he was a very good player, so he could not afford to lose him for Crewe Alexandra. “He was an outstanding player,” he said. The court heard that the boy – whom Bennell is alleged to have abused between the ages of 11 and 14 – “was going off the rails” by his late teens and had developed “erratic behaviour”. Another alleged victim, whom Bennell is charged with abusing between the ages of about 10 and 12, told the court that he, like many other boys, would stay over at the coach’s house before training and matches. “I remember sleeping in his bed and he just used to draw circles on your stomach and ask you to do the same [to him] and it just got worse from there,” the man told the jury on Tuesday. He described one occasion when Bennell made reference to what he was doing: “He said I did OK and ‘just pretend it’s your girlfriend’.” He recalled being abused by the coach in the changing room after the Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall had come to Crewe Alexandra to give a talk. The man contacted the police in November 2016 after seeing reports about Bennell in the press. Eleanor Laws QC, defending, asked him whether he had made the complaint in order to get compensation from Crewe Alexandra. “That is ridiculous,” the man replied. Laws asked whether the man blamed Bennell for his failed football career. “I blame Barry for my failed life, not my football career,” he said. In an interview with police, Bennell denied the allegations, saying the boy was not “his sort of lad” and that he liked boys who had nice faces and smiled a lot, which the child in question did not. “He wasn’t targeted like that,” said Bennell. “He seemed like the kind of person who would tell his mum and dad.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/23/letter-lord-quirk-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T16:38:46Z","webTitle":"Letter: Lord Quirk obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/23/letter-lord-quirk-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/23/letter-lord-quirk-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Lord Quirk obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Randolph Quirk was a longstanding family friend.

Muzna’s parents want her to be their kind of good Muslim: an obedient daughter who steers clear of boys and studies medicine. Muzna, though, just wants to do something about her facial hair, write stories and have a bit more freedom. When she meets handsome Arif at school, she’s intrigued by his interest – but Arif is under the thumb of an older brother with a sinister agenda. Will Muzna be drawn in, too? With its superb heroine, pitch-perfect dialogue, and sensitive examination of extremism preying on naivety, this assured, hopeful debut feels unprecedented and essential. Across the pond, 17-year-old film-maker Maya also considers rebellion in Samira Ahmed’s Love, Hate &amp; Other Filters (Hot Key), featuring a love triangle that sidesteps cliche with its resonant detail and astute characterisation. Maya’s choices – between family and ambition, “suitable boy” and long-term crush – are interwoven with the build-up to a terrorist attack, and the unthinking Islamophobia it unleashes, in this occasionally melodramatic, intensely readable novel. Also from Hot Key, The Cruel Prince, first in a new trilogy from Holly Black, stands out amid a plethora of fairy-court fantasies. When their human parents are butchered in their home, Jude and her sisters Taryn and Vivi are taken to Faerie and raised there by the assassin, surrounded by danger, glamour and deceit. As she comes of age, Jude fights to find where she belongs – and whether she can ward off the enmity of Prince Cardan, cruellest of the old king’s sons. Complex, nuanced characters, frank sensuality and thorn-sharp, intricate storytelling all conspire to ensnare. In Emily Barr’s contemporary thriller The Truth and Lies of Ella Black (Penguin), meanwhile, Ella has always struggled with “Bella”, the wicked alter ego she believes must remain trapped beneath her well-behaved surface. But when some mysterious news causes her family to travel unexpectedly to Rio de Janeiro, she discovers a use for her dark side after all. Evoking Ella’s intoxicating new surroundings while skewering the facile assumptions of “poverty tourism”, Barr’s second YA novel is a fast-paced, dramatic search for answers to the secrets of the self. Readers of eight to 12 are in luck, too, as Lisa Thompson follows up The Goldfish Boy with a new standalone, The Light Jar (Scholastic). Nate and his mother have left her controlling partner Gary to hide out in a deserted cottage – but now Mum has failed to return from her trip to buy food. That’s when Sam, a glowing boy who seems familiar, shows up … and a girl called Kitty, with her own puzzle to solve. This story of a flight from domestic abuse and a boy’s rediscovery of his inner resources is poignant and multilayered. From Pushkin, a Brazilian classic, My Sweet Orange Tree by José Mauro de Vasconcelos, is published in a new translation by Alison Entrekin. This tender, joyful, often brutal little book stars Zezé, a precocious and deep-feeling five-year-old, his chaotic and impoverished family, his beloved sweet orange tree Pinkie, and his former arch-enemy and substitute father “Portuga”. It will suit thoughtful readers of 10-plus down to the ground. Anarchic aeronauts and plucky poultry are the order of the day in Emma Carroll’s Sky Chasers (Chicken House). Starring Magpie, a light-fingered, loyal and intelligent heroine, alongside kindly Pierre, a cockerel called Coco and a duck called Voltaire, with a cameo by Marie Antoinette, it follows the fortunes of the Montgolfier brothers as they strive to conquer the secret of flying – and conceal it from English spies. Soaring flight, earthy detail and the power of friendship are all to the fore in this gripping historical adventure. Also from Chicken House comes Guy Jones’s delicately constructed debut, The Ice Garden, in which Jess, allergic to sunlight, cannot go out in the daylight unless she is “Full Hat” – swathed in fabric from head to toe. Stealing out one night for an illicit walk, she discovers a garden made entirely of ice, and a boy, Owen, who becomes her first friend – but the garden, though beautiful, is both threatening and threatened, and Jess soon faces a painful choice. Elegant, assured, sad and hilarious, The Ice Garden also features a particularly loving mother-daughter relationship. For readers of five to eight – or those in need of new year inspiration – Rachel Ignotofsky’s exquisitely designed Women in Sport: 50 Fearless Athletes Who Played to Win (Wren &amp; Rook) is a sensational successor to last year’s Women in Science. From Gertrude Ederle to Serena Williams, and sports from roller derby to boxing, women who trained and competed with grit are celebrated in this beautiful compendium. It’s summertime in Julian Gough’s latest outing for Rabbit and Bear: Attack of the Snack (Hodder), with sunny, luminous images from Jim Field. When a small feathery projectile lands in the lake, Rabbit and Bear have very different responses to it. Xenophobia, tolerance, blueberry poo, apologising and killer burping owls are all addressed with Gough’s characteristic mix of scatological humour and richness. For picture-book fans – especially those who have enjoyed Blue Planet II – Little Whale by Jo Weaver (Hodder) is a gorgeous, grown-up migration story, shadowy charcoal drawings evoking every ripple of the great whales’ world. In a more surreal and humorous take on the natural kingdom, Chris Naylor-Ballesteros’s I Love You, Stick Insect (Bloomsbury) features an amorous phasmid who thinks he’s found true love – but is his paramour everything she seems? Pleasingly silly, and lending itself to over-the-top performances from those reading aloud, it should raise belly laughs from small listeners. Finally, in Ying Chang Compestine’s The Chinese Emperor’s New Clothes (Abrams), a resourceful boy emperor takes on his swindling advisers, causing them to parade in rice sacks as he wins back his wealth to feed and clothe the poor. This is an appealing twist on a well-loved tale, brought vividly to life by David Roberts’s apple-cheeked, expressive illustrations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/28/100-women-on-100-years-of-womens-vote-suffrage","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"100 women on 100 years of voting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/28/100-women-on-100-years-of-womens-vote-suffrage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/28/100-women-on-100-years-of-womens-vote-suffrage","fields":{"headline":"100 women on 100 years of voting","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When the first British women gained the right to vote, the celebrations were muted. The Great War was still raging in February 1918, and the suffragette movement itself had splintered over whether to pause its campaign during the hostilities. “The pageantry and rejoicing… which in prewar days would have greeted the victory, were absent when it came,” reflected Sylvia Pankhurst in her 1931 book The Suffragette Movement. “The sorrows of the world conflict precluded jubilations.” A century later, though, we should savour the triumph as fully as we can. The Representation of the People Act added 8.5 million women – those over 30 who owned property or were graduates voting in a university constituency – to the electoral roll. It also gave the vote to 5.6 million more men after their voting age was lowered to 21, and the property qualification abolished. The general election in December 1918 consulted an electorate three times the size of the one before it. One victory led to another. The bar to women running for parliament was quickly removed, and the first female MP was elected that year (though, as an Irish republican, Constance Markievicz chose not to join the Commons). The next year, Nancy Astor took her seat, and was met off the train into London by joyful former suffragettes, one of whom gave her a badge declaring this to be a “new era”. Yet progress for women has often felt painfully slow. When a 32-year-old, pregnant Harriet Harman was elected in 1982 there were still only 19 female MPs. The 2017 election was the first time more than 200 women were elected, 208 out of 650 seats. Ask female MPs now, and many worry the climate of vitriol on social media is putting off talented candidates, as is the spectre of sexual harassment. And there is still a “motherhood trap” – childless women are over-represented at the top level because it is still so hard to balance caring responsibilities with a political career. Set against this are the achievements of the women’s movement. Maternity leave rights, equal pay, domestic violence legislation – all of these were hard fights, and they will never be truly won, because laws are not enough. When steep fees were introduced by Chris Grayling in 2013, the number of employment tribunals fell sharply – until the supreme court ruled that the charges were illegal four years later. It was a reminder that rights are of little use unless they can be enforced. Still, we should be optimistic. Female MPs now have strength in numbers – they are rarely a lone voice in a room full of men, having to apologise for speaking at all. And true to the spirit of the suffragettes – who came from all kinds of political traditions – there is always quiet, cross-party feminist work happening in the Commons. A bill to tackle violence against women is one of the few non-Brexit pieces of legislation put forward by the government in this parliamentary session. So what’s next? To commemorate the anniversary, here are politicians, campaigners and other prominent women on what the vote means to them – and where we should go next. Helen Lewis Helen Lewis is deputy editor of the New Statesman Theresa May Conservative prime minister since 2016 I first voted in October 1974. I had just turned 18 and was at university. What does voting mean to me? What I say when I’m on the doorstep and speaking to women who say they might not vote, is that everybody should vote. It is their chance to have their say in who is running their country. There are women who gave up their lives to have the right to vote in this country and people who yearn, across the world, to have this freedom and so we should use it. I want everybody to vote – it’s hugely important. Diane Abbott Shadow home secretary My parents were keen voters. In the run-up to elections, my mum would pretend to Tory canvassers that she was a supporter, so they’d send a car round on election day – then she’d go and vote Labour. I was always excited about going to vote, so standing for election for the first time for Westminster city council in 1982 seemed extraordinary. Twelve years later, I was an observer at the first free elections in South Africa. Before dawn there were already queues of people. I watched them fill in their slip, and, before putting it in the ballot box, pause and look around. It was as if, even now, someone would tell them they couldn’t vote. I tell young people that story now to get them to think about the importance of voting. Parliament today is so different compared to 30 years ago. In 1987 [when Abbott first became an MP], women used to stand up to speak and men would shout you down. They can’t do that now. Marai Larasi Executive director of BME women’s campaigning group Imkaan Huge parts of our political system need to be dismantled and reconstructed. Yet despite this, voting means something to me, as both a right and a responsibility. I vote, even when I resent the process. This sense of duty is as much bound up in the past, as it is connected to today. I have the right to vote because of those who have gone before me. I think about this not only in the context of 100 years of votes for women, but also in the context of struggles around race and class. Thus, as we celebrate this centenary, I believe it is important to acknowledge painful truths, including that some prominent suffragettes were racist and anti-working-class, and that some women are still unable to vote. This “100 years” therefore has a more complex meaning for some of us. However, if we can hold these truths, we may also be able to challenge injustice, while imagining and creating an equal future. Laura Bates Founder of the Everyday Sexism Project It’s difficult to believe that it has only been 100 years since some women in the UK were granted the right to vote, the result of a tireless battle by countless brave campaigners. Recently, I learned about the remarkable life of Violet Ann Bland, a kitchen maid at Dudmaston Hall near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, who went on to be a passionate member of the Women’s Social and Political Union. Arrested for her activism in the name of women’s suffrage, she endured force-feeding in prison in 1912 and wrote in graphic detail about the experience. Walking into the voting booth last year, I thought of Violet and countless women like her whose names are little known, many of their stories forgotten. Yet, as recent revelations from Weinstein to Westminster have proved, we continue to fight their battles to this day. It has never been more important for women to participate in democracy, to share our stories and to raise our voices. Rushanara Ali Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow since 2010 For millions of people in Bangladesh, where I was born, the UK parliament has always been a beacon of democracy. Bangladesh is a country that only came into existence because of a fight for democracy, so I grew up with an acute sense of the need to fight for the right to self-determination. When I was six years old, there was another cycle of violence in Bangladesh following a military coup, which demonstrated how rights could be taken away literally overnight and instilled in me the need to continually fight to protect our rights. When I moved to the UK, to London’s East End, I had a profound sense of the history and heritage of the area from my wonderful schoolteachers, I learned about the suffragette movement and the many sacrifices made by women to get the right to vote. We must continue to promote our values and ideals so that our democracy can flourish. Emily Thornberry Shadow foreign secretary I’m the only Emily ever elected to parliament, which is strange given what an important name Emily is – Emily Wilding Davison, for example – and how many other Emilys are out there. I particularly feel it when it’s women who say they can’t be bothered voting. I say: “Why do you think your voice doesn’t count? Collectively, it’s up to us what government we get. If you can just use that little bit of power, and exercise your vote, why would you not turn up? Why are you not important? You are important.” The younger generation have every reason to be angry. My generation have all the pensions, we’ve warmed up the planet, eaten all the fish, killed all the tigers. We are a greedy generation. The younger generation will be the ones to suffer, and they should be angry. At the last general election, they turned up. Now they need to flex their muscles and highlight the intergenerational injustice. Shirley Williams Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, 2001-2004 My father’s mother was a suffragist and so was my mother [Vera Brittain]. Hearing from my parents what people like Mrs Pankhurst had gone through, I saw not voting as a betrayal. I don’t feel that as much now, though I think if you’re disillusioned with politics, your job is to fight the disillusionment, not just give up. I voted the minute it was legal to do so, when I was 21, and at every opportunity after that. Though I was in the rather paradoxical position of being the Labour agent for Chelsea for the 1950 election when I was 17 and not yet old enough to vote. I knew more about elected MPs than I did about voting. When I first got elected in 1964, there were 29 female MPs. Being a woman in parliament was pretty odd. I remember being patronised when I first got in – men literally patted me on the head and said: “That’s a very good speech dear.” That was quite a common attitude. Catherine Mayer Writer and co-founder of the Women’s Equality party I think voting is an incredibly important exercise in democratic rights and a duty. I will vote in any democratic process that I’m entitled to participate in, including those where I don’t like any of the candidates. One reason I co-founded the Women’s Equality party was hearing women talking about not using their vote because of the lack of options available. The fact that politics is not an easy space for women makes it more important for them to be involved, not less. In 1913, Emmeline Pankhurst said that the vote would create equality for women. Of course, that’s not the case. When you get involved in politics, you get a granular sense of what the obstacles are. In this centenary, we can celebrate what progress has been made, but we also have to recognise what hasn’t been achieved – the pay gap is just one example – and how much the rights and protections that have been achieved are now under threat. Caroline Lucas Co-leader of the Green party I vote because I believe that governments can change things for the better, but that doesn’t mean I believe that voting is the only route to change. So while I go to the ballot box every few years, I also believe that demonstrations, rallies and nonviolent direct action are hugely valuable parts of our democracy too. We undervalue democracy in this country, but pride ourselves on being its greatest defenders. If we really valued the vote, we’d make sure that elections were fair, and not stitched up by an archaic voting system. It must be totally overhauled. Whatever your take on the results of the EU referendum, it demonstrated that if you give people a say, they can be very political indeed, as citizens who feel they can be genuine agents for change. Ultimately, when people start to feel their actions make a difference, they step up. Ruth Davidson Leader of the Scottish Conservative party I was in my first year of university when I cast my first vote, in the 1997 general election. My mate told me that one of the student bars was showing the results through the night. What they didn’t tell me was that it had been hired by the university’s Labour club, so I was literally the only Conservative in a room of about 250 drunken Labour supporters, as every single Conservative seat in Scotland fell and there was a total wipeout. That was quite character-building. If you count up every woman who has ever been elected to the House of Commons in the past 100 years, you still wouldn’t be able to fill the green benches – it’s only 489 out of 650 seats. In many ways women are outperforming men – last year more women than men were offered places at Cambridge – but you still see a very small percentage of women in the military, the church, in business, in politics. So we still have a long way to go. What does voting mean to you? Why is it important? Barbara Hosking Former No 10 press officer, author of Exceeding My Brief The act of voting I always find quite wonderful. I look at the expressions on other people’s faces at the polling office and occasionally they look as if they’ve just received communion. People died and shed blood for the right to vote. We’re lucky to have it – huge chunks of the world don’t. Diane Reay Professor of education at Cambridge University I grew up in a coalmining community in a solidly Tory area in Leicestershire. Both my mum and nan were inordinately proud to vote. My mum would put on a red dress to go to the church hall and we, her seven daughters, would wear red dresses too. My concern is that there’s a real deficit in terms of the representation of working-class women in parliament. Less than 1% of MPs are working-class women. It’s been a struggle to go from a coalmining background to becoming a Cambridge professor, but probably a lot easier than becoming an MP. Helen Liddell Labour MP for Monklands East (1994-1997) and Airdrie and Shotts (1997-2005), now a Labour peer I’ve been involved in politics since I was 15 or 16. Coming from my background – I’m a bus driver’s daughter from rural Lanarkshire – I saw the political process as being able to change my life. I was the first generation in my family to go to university and as time has gone on, there have been great changes for women. But we’re still not – with the current disputes at the BBC, and the problems that the #MeToo generation are highlighting – at the endgame. Helena Kennedy QC Barrister, broadcaster and Labour peer Voting is fundamental to how I live my life. It speaks to my sense of myself as a person with agency: I don’t want to feel like I’m being told what to do by those who haven’t been elected to do so, and I want to have my say in their election. I still get a lump in my throat when I pick up that little stubby pen and I put my cross down, because voting is actually about liberty, about stopping tyranny. We might not like who wins, but they won’t be there for ever. If it doesn’t go my way, then I can gather as many like-minded individuals together as possible, and we can change it. Angela Eagle Labour MP for Wallasey since 1992 We used to go to the ballot box as a family when I was a child. The importance of democracy should be taught in school, ingrained from a very young age. Change does happen. Even if the choices at the ballot box might not always be what you want, politics isn’t a spectator sport. To make it work, you have to get off the stands and on to the pitch. Stella Creasy Labour and Co-operative MP for Walthamstow since 2010 Every time you vote is special, but voting is not enough. People usually see it as the endpoint, but I see it as the start of the conversation. I always say: “I’m probably your worst nightmare of an MP because I’m going to get you involved – but that’s how change will happen.” Harriet Harman Labour MP for Peckham (1982-1997) and Camberwell and Peckham since 1997 Whatever the election, it’s a very solemn moment putting your cross in that box. I’m 67 and I’ve voted in every single election since I came of age but it doesn’t lose its solemnity. I also think about all the people around the world – and especially the women – who can’t vote, or have to vote the way their husbands or fathers tell them to vote. I’ve got that privilege that a lot of the women in the world still don’t have. Estelle Morris Labour peer, MP for Birmingham Yardley 1992-2005 For youngsters now, we’ve got to constantly remind them that their vote does count. It might be one among millions, but when I got elected in Birmingham Yardley in 1992, I took the seat from the Tories by 162 votes. All it needed was for 82 people to vote the other way and I wouldn’t have won the seat. Lola Young Actress, author, and crossbench peer I became interested in politics young – growing up in care, watching what was happening with apartheid in South Africa – so being “allowed” to vote really felt like something. If you don’t vote, the world can change around you in a way over which you have no influence. Jo Swinson Liberal Democrat MP for East Dunbartonshire (2005-2015, 2017-present) I enjoy taking my son to vote with me – he was nine months old at the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 and I remember canvassing on the doorsteps with him in the baby carrier. By the 2016 Brexit referendum he was able to walk with me to the polling station before going to nursery. I felt so strongly that it was his future at stake, and of course I was devastated by the result. Take your children to vote with you if you can. It’s important that the next generation understand what it’s all about. Leanne Wood Leader of Plaid Cymru Remember that only some women got the vote in 1918 – working-class and younger women had to continue to campaign for that right – real democracy is not something that happens overnight. A hundred years on, we know that large sections of our society continue to be disillusioned and disenfranchised. Polly Neate CEO of Shelter Equal choice still eludes women so often. Who wants to “have it all” when men can still just choose the best bits? The right to vote is one way in which women have an equal platform with men. Not just a voice about women’s things, not a presence that has to be dressed up pretty or sexy or “I’m not a feminist but...”, or careful not to nag. One person one vote. For everyone. Rupa Huq Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton since 2015 I vote to make a difference. With all its imperfections and caveats it’s our way of having our say. If you don’t vote you have no right to complain. Arlene Foster Leader of the DUP There is huge power in voting. It can be hard to imagine living in an era when women were seen as politically inept. Every time I vote I think what a privilege it is and I find it hard to fathom those who believe it doesn’t matter. Luciana Berger Labour Co-operative MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010 Every time I vote, I pause to reflect on the reasons why I can and I thank the suffragettes. I’d like to see votes for 16- to 18-year-olds. I was just a few days short of my 16th birthday when Labour swept to power in 1997. Had I been 16, I would definitely have wanted to vote in that historic landslide. Baroness Jenny Jones Green party peer, deputy mayor of London (2003-2004) Being in politics, I can see that voting really makes a difference. When I first got elected to the London Assembly in 2000, it wasn’t obvious until the last couple of days whether I might get elected, which was very powerful for me. One of the problems in the House of Lords is that you don’t get to vote in the general election anymore, so I have to sit on the sidelines and encourage other people. Liz Truss Chief secretary to the Treasury Elections are less predictable than they’ve ever been. People are more willing to switch parties, so it’s becoming more and more likely that your vote could be a deciding vote. Dawn Butler Labour MP for Brent Central since 2015 As a child I always felt voting was important but I didn’t quite know why. All I knew was it was one of the few moments that I saw my mum and dad together, as my mum worked during the day and my dad worked nights. On polling day my mum would wait for my dad and I would excitedly put my coat on and hold my dad’s hand to cross the road and watch them vote. Kerry-Anne Mendoza Editor of the Canary If you don’t think voting will change things look at Trump, Hitler and the sorry state of the welfare system. But voting is also the lowest possible form of democratic engagement – getting involved in your community, your PTA, a union, really changes things. The reason corporations influence politics so much is that they lobby government every day. People need to feel that responsibility too. Lynda Chalker Conservative peer. MP for Wallasey 1974-1992, overseas development minister 1989-97 Voting is critical if you want to take a role in your local community, and indeed in society as a whole. Liz Kendall Labour MP for Leicester West since 2010 Your vote is your voice. It’s your chance to help determine your future, and the future of the country. I understand only too well how many people think voting doesn’t make a difference, and that politicians are all the same. But it is the way to change the world. Patience Wheatcroft Conservative peer, former editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal Europe I’d feel dreadful if I didn’t use my vote, not just because people fought so hard to get it, but I want to do my part in the country I live in. I’m always upset by the low turnout we get in this country. Education is a big part of it. Having mock elections at schools is a good thing, and more politicians should go into schools. Frances O’Grady General secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) This is described as the centenary but of course most working-class women have only had the right to vote for 90 years. I never miss a visit to the polling station. The essential egalitarianism of “one person, one vote” is still worth honouring. Gina Miller Investment manager and anti-Brexit campaigner The suffragettes risked everything – their lives, homes, marriages, children being taken into care, prison, being force-fed. They were heroines. They knew that the only things we truly own are our voices, conscience and actions. One of my aims is to encourage more women to vote, as the turnout in recent years has been shamefully low. Turnout for women went up in 2017 but it’s still not good enough. When did you first vote? Caroline Criado-Perez Feminist activist and journalist When I first voted, I wasn’t a feminist. It was a local election and I voted for the person my mum told me to. It didn’t occur to me to think about how hard it had been for women to get the vote, how many obstacles had been overcome. So many women faced horrific mental and physical torture to make that happen. Every time I vote now, I think of them. Dawn Primarolo Labour peer. MP for Bristol South 1987-2015 I first voted in the 1972 local government election. I went to the polling station with my parents, it was a big deal. How could anyone not vote? Does anyone want to live in a society in which their views, hopes and aspirations are invisible? Rachel Reeves Labour MP for Leeds West Economist, shadow secretary of state for work and pensions (2013-2015) I first voted in 1997 and I was 18 years and three months old. I remember going to the polling station before school with a sense of pride and excitement. When I was born, in 1979, there were 19 female MPs. Today there are 208, nearly a third of the seats. I hope by the time my four-year-old daughter grows up, we’ll have 50-50 representation of women in parliament. Ann Coffey Labour MP for Stockport since 1992 I was 24 before I was able to vote in a general election – because it wasn’t until 1970 that the voting age was reduced to 18. It didn’t produce the result I wanted but subsequent votes did. When I entered parliament in 1992 there were only 60 women MPs. Now there are 208 and we’ve had a major impact on policy and the campaign for equality. Llin Golding Labour peer. MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme 1986-2001 When I won in a by-election in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the first vote I had in the Commons was to stop boys being beaten in school. We won by one vote. If I hadn’t won that byelection, we’d have lost it and the beating would still be happening. Margaret Jay Labour peer. Minister for women 1998-2001, leader of the House of Lords 1998-2001 My first vote was for my mum, [Audrey Callaghan], who was a local councillor in London. People are always surprised by this because I come from a political family in which my dad [former PM James Callaghan] is better known – but it was actually for my mum that I first started knocking on doors in local elections. I do sometimes wonder whether it would be useful to have something like the Australian system, where it is compulsory to vote. Sam Smethers Chief executive, Fawcett Society The first time I voted I was 17. I broke the law: my grandmother was housebound so I took her registration card down to the polling station in Tottenham and voted for Bernie Grant. It’s important to encourage women to participate in the democratic process. Younger women, black and minority ethnic women, single women and women with low incomes – in other words, women whose lives are most affected by the decisions of government – are far less engaged in voting than other groups. Chi Onwurah Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central since 2010 The first time I voted, I’d been a member of the Labour party for two years, I’d been elected MP for my comprehensive school in mock elections earlier that year and I had protested the devastating consequences of years of Thatcherite government. But marking my cross on a ballot paper in Newcastle was the first time I truly felt I was having my say. Maria Miller Conservative MP for Basingstoke since 2005, chair of the women and equalities select committee When I first voted, I was a student at LSE, living in a hall of residence in the middle of Islington. I remember many of my fellow students voting tactically and I couldn’t do that and have never been able to do that. Yvette Cooper Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee My first vote was in 1987. I wore black to my A-level exam the next day in mourning because Labour lost so badly. The newly elected Tory government brought in the hateful Section 28 and the hated poll tax – that’s why voting matters. Jane Robinson Social historian specialising in the study of female pioneers When I first voted, in the 1979 general election, I was in my first year at Somerville College, Oxford, having come from a rural comprehensive in North Yorkshire. Margaret Thatcher was a Somervillian, not that I voted for her, but it was all very exciting, and that is what got me interested in women’s history. It took such an effort to open the door, and now we walk through it without a backward glance – or don’t walk through it at all. That’s the tragedy, that some of us don’t use the voice others struggled so hard to give us. Christine Burns MBE Retired activist, author of Trans Britain I was 18, still in the sixth form in 1972. I was adamant I didn’t want to go to the polling station with my parents. I went alone after asking Mum what to do; I didn’t want to make a fool of myself. Afterwards, I felt like a proper adult. Faiza Shaheen Economist, writer and director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies The first time I was eligible to vote, in the 2005 general election, I spoiled my ballot. I just couldn’t vote for Labour because I was so against the Iraq war. I never really voted joyously until the 2017 general election. For the first time, the Labour party’s policies and vision for this country were something I really believed in. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan Labour MP for Tooting since 2016 The first time I voted, in the 1997 general election, I remember an exciting sense of possibility: I could have some say in who represented me and my family and the area that I love. Now more than ever it feels like every single vote matters. Seeing how disappointed young people were by the outcome of the EU referendum, I think they feel they do have a voice and they should use it. Jill Pitkeathley Labour peer, deputy speaker in the House of Lords Because I was raised in the Channel Islands, I wasn’t allowed to vote, so I didn’t actually vote until 1964. I remember it very clearly. I found it incredibly exciting. People do have to see that their vote counts, and perhaps with the last election, and the shock result, people did see that. When did you feel your vote made most difference? What was your most exciting voting experience? Angela Rayner Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne since 2015 For me it was the 2009 European Union elections: the fascist BNP were on manoeuvres, and were expected to win in my region in north-west England. On the day of the vote I ended up in hospital expecting to give birth, but I couldn’t have lived with myself if I didn’t vote, so I left hospital to vote Labour and do my bit to keep the BNP out. Edwina Currie Conservative MP for South Derbyshire 1983-1997 The evening I got elected in 1983 was special, but it’s the 1992 contest in South Derbyshire after I resigned from the government which still gives me goosebumps. Despite gloomy polls, turnout in our patch was a whopping 85% and we got more than 32,000 votes. Watching them pile up was a magic moment. Tracy Brabin Labour MP for Batley and Spen since 2016 My weirdest voting experience was when I voted for myself last year [to fill the seat formerly held by Jo Cox]. It was incredibly strange. Normally, after the selection process, you would just become the MP, but nine fringe parties decided to stand. So we had a very odd byelection, where I had to go around a grieving community and tell them: “I’m not your MP yet, I need your vote.” Normally it would be a celebration but after I won, everyone just went home to reflect. Jo Stevens Labour MP for Cardiff Central since 2015 Blair’s victory in 1997 was so exciting. The next day, people were smiling and there was a huge sense of relief. In contrast, the people I met in Cardiff after the EU referendum were crying and visibly upset. Caroline Flint Labour MP for Don Valley since 1997 Seventy-nine years on from 1918, I was among 101 Labour women MPs elected to parliament. Excited? Of course. But shocked to be only the 201st woman of all time. Knocking on doors in Don Valley, I’ve met women whose mothers attended suffragette marches. I owe a great debt to those women who faced violence, imprisonment and risk to life to secure my right to vote. Kirstene Hair Conservative MP for Angus since 2017 The most consequential vote I have ever cast was after a long and passionate campaign for Scotland to remain in the UK, in the 2014 independence referendum. The level of engagement was unprecedented. Sophie Walker Leader of the Women’s Equality party It was in 2016, when the Women’s Equality party first ran for election across the UK. To put a cross in the box beside our logo was incredibly moving and hopeful. This centenary is an opportunity to celebrate those who fought for our rights before us, and for us to make sure the next generation of women from all races, backgrounds and experiences feel enfranchised to use their vote. Naz Shah Labour MP for Bradford West since 2015 There’s been a lot of disenfranchisement and disillusionment in British politics, but the 2017 general election galvanised a spirit of involvement never seen before. It brought out the women’s vote, brought out the young people, and renewed energy in democracy. Liz Saville Roberts Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd since 2015 My most exciting voting experience was probably the referendum for Wales in 1999. On the night, it didn’t look like Wales was going to vote in favour of establishing its own assembly. I got up the next day cross, upset and stomping around the place, then turned on the radio and realised what had happened. I ran upstairs screaming: “We’ve done it, we’ve done it.” Tulip Siddiq Labour and Co-operative MP for Hampstead and Kilburn since 2015 My most consequential vote was the EU referendum. I took my newborn daughter with me to the polling station, and with 75% of my constituents, I voted to remain. Though I was on the losing side of the national poll, voting with my baby in tow was a pertinent reminder of the consequences the referendum may have for future generations of women. Danielle Rowley Labour MP for Midlothian since 2017 There was such a buzz around the 2017 general election. It was obviously really exciting for me because I was standing for the first time and it changed my life, but there was also a real change on the doorsteps and it was so exciting because more of my friends, and young people in general, were actually interested in politics. Could the voting system be improved? Fiona Millar Journalist and campaigner The voting system is pretty antiquated in a number of ways. I think it needs to be digitalised. We need to give votes to 16-year-olds, too. I also believe in proportional representation, and it’s frustrating that neither of the two main parties want to talk about that. Dame Margaret Hodge Labour MP for Barking since 1994 The first time I voted, in Orpington in 1966, it was a tactical vote. Even though I was a member of the Labour party and an activist by then, I voted Liberal because it was the only way to beat the Tories. So I have always been a supporter of electoral reform: you want a PR system which ensures that your vote counts. Shakira Martin NUS president The government of this country, the policy and the laws that we abide by derive their legitimacy from public participation in the democratic process. placency: so we need to constantly be challenging ourselves about how to engage the disengaged. The cross-party Representation of the People (Young People’s Enfranchisement) Bill due this May is a step in the right direction. NUS research showed that three quarters of 16 and 17 year olds would have voted in the EU referendum had they been given the chance. Now is the time to secure Votes at 16 once and for all. Virginia Bottomley Conservative peer. MP for South West Surrey 1984-2005 No voting system is perfect, but first-past-the-post has kept Ukip and the National Front out of parliament. It also prioritises the one-to-one relationship constituents have with the person more people want to win than anyone else. That may make me sound like a dinosaur, but it’s what I believe in. Beeban Kidron Film director and crossbench peer Sixteen-year-olds should get the vote. People argue that they’ll do as their parents say or that they won’t vote. My experience of the young is that they are independent-minded and have multiple influences. Starting early is habit-forming. Ann Clwyd Labour MP for Cynon Valley since 1984 I’d like to see voting made compulsory. I’ve fought in a lot of elections, and I always find it particularly annoying when people say: “I’m not going to vote, politicians are all the same.” You remind them that they have a responsibility, that people struggled to get the vote, particularly women. Jacqui Smith Labour MP for Redditch 1997-2010, the first female home secretary 2007-2009 I used to get irritated when people – particularly women – told me they weren’t going to vote. But then I discovered that plenty of people weren’t going because they weren’t quite sure of the process. They didn’t know where they needed to go or what they needed to do – and worried that someone was going to ask them a load of questions that they didn’t want to answer. Sometimes it’s about taking people through that process and giving them a bit of confidence to do it. Helene Hayman Labour peer. MP for Welwyn and Hatfield 1974-1979, Lord Speaker 2006-2011 I’m having a crisis of conscience over voting. All my life, I have believed in first-past-the-post. I am now wondering if this stifles the creation of new parties. I think the reason people didn’t want to vote in the last election was that they didn’t feel there was a party that was representing them, that they could trust or be inspired by. That’s a big failure. Marsha de Cordova Labour MP for Battersea since 2017, shadow minister for disabled people I support votes at 16. I’ve also always been a supporter of PR, but whatever voting system we have it is crucial that it is accessible to everyone. As a disabled voter I know we still have a long way to go in terms of making voting accessible to those with disabilities and long-term conditions. We need to continually be trying to remove the barriers to voting. Layla Moran Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since 2017 When you’ve got really safe seats, some MPs do less work than others. If you had a system where every seat was slightly unsafe, then MPs would have to reach out to a range of people to save their job, and that’s not a bad thing. Anna Soubry Conservative MP for Broxtowe since 2010 There’s something incredibly powerful about the act of walking to the polling station and casting your vote, which is why I’m wary of making it more digital. As someone who’s been at many a count, there’s also something very powerful about seeing all those pieces of paper piled up. It shows you that it is real human beings taking part. Which group needs most encouragement to vote? Molly Meacher Chair of the East London NHS Foundation Trust 2007-2012, crossbench peer It’s often said young people need the most encouragement to vote, but I would say it’s people with very tough lives, who find it difficult to see that trailing out to vote is important when there are other hardships to deal with. Improvements in living standards would help them become more engaged. I think real deprivation and poverty are unhelpful to democracy. Nicky Morgan Conservative MP for Loughborough What the Brexit referendum has done is motivate whole new swathes of young people to vote – it showed that voting really can change results. Yasmin Qureshi Shadow minister for justice, Labour MP for Bolton South East since 2010 I’d like to get more of the traditional working class voting – people whose families worked in mills and heavy industry and lost their jobs, the second or third generation unemployed. I work hard at that because I know you can make a difference. You can change things. Dame Caroline Spelman Conservative MP for Meriden since 1997 I am shocked by the number of times I knock on doors to be greeted by a female voter who says she cannot be bothered, or cannot see the point of voting. I go into my short history of the suffragette movement and many have no idea about the movement or know who Emmeline Pankhurst was. This leads me to the view that we need to teach politics to everyone in school. Emma Dent Coad Labour MP for Kensington since 2017 It may seem strange but I was influenced to get politically involved by nuns at school: Sister Philomena, our history teacher, and Mother Bunbury at Sacred Heart school, Hammersmith. She was a liberal and highly intelligent woman who told us: “Read everything, go to everything, and make up your own mind.” I’ve always followed her advice. Let’s give 16-year-olds the vote! Gloria De Piero Labour MP for Ashfield since 2010 The challenge now is getting young working-class people to vote. They are the most likely to tell me that voting doesn’t make a difference and that they don’t understand it anyway. Any politician who thinks that this isn’t partly our fault needs a big wake-up call. Laura Pidcock Labour MP for North West Durham since 2017 I still meet women who don’t have the confidence to vote, so we have to tell them democracy is not just about voting. Every time I bring people to the House of Commons we go to the broom cupboard where Emily Davison hid herself. Women’s struggles shouldn’t be peripheral. Ruth Deech Crossbench peer, lawyer, bioethicist and academic I’ve been to meetings with young people where they say that they don’t bother voting because it doesn’t make a difference. I get very angry, because when I think of how women died and struggled to get the vote, to casually dismiss it as being of no importance undermines our equality and shows no respect for history and citizenship. I think the Brexit vote, and the fact that it was relatively close, may bring home to young people how important it is to vote. Lucy Powell Labour and Co-operative MP for Manchester Central since 2012 We should get the vote for 16-year-olds. At 16 you can get a job, pay tax and get married. It’s ridiculous, really. Get people in the habit of voting young and they’ll vote for life. Kezia Dugdale Leader of the Scottish Labour Party 2015-2017 I was late to voting at 23. I didn’t think I could make any difference, and this is still an issue with young people. Look at the EU referendum. It’s clear that people at that age are in favour of freedom of movement and being part of a global community. If more of them had voted, we’d have had a different result. MPs more representative of different people would help people engage more. I feel a responsibility as a young, female, gay MP to show voters that people like them are being represented in politics. Jess Phillips Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley since 2015 We should let 16-year-olds vote. During the 1997 election I was 16 and I campaigned till my feet bled and was gutted that I couldn’t vote. I remember feeling how unjust it was. I love voting. I’d do it every day. Anneliese Dodds Labour MP for Oxford East since 2017 I don’t think there’s a silver bullet to change voter apathy, but the vote at 16 would bring the democratic process into schools, get kids talking about it the playground. Are you encouraged by how women’s rights have progressed since 1918? Nicola Sturgeon First minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party The 100th anniversary of women gaining the vote is one to celebrate, but it is also an occasion to look forward – both to see what more needs to be done to improve democratic participation, and to ensure the cause of gender equality more widely is won, not just in this country but around the globe. As someone who has been involved in politics all of my adult life, I have always been a voter, but for too many people the simple act of voting remains remote. The reasons for non-participation in elections are many, but all too often it is those who are most marginalised in society – and who ironically stand to gain the most – who choose not to exercise their democratic rights. It is incumbent on all of us who hold public office to try and change that. Sayeeda Warsi Conservative peer. Co-chair of the party 2010-2012 and the first female Muslim to attend Cabinet What happened a century ago gave women the opportunity to have a say, but we’re still fighting for women to be heard – they’re two completely different things. We have women in positions of authority, but are they policy-makers or do they simply become instruments of policy? I don’t want women just to have a seat around the table, I want them to also have a voice around the table. Preet Gill Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston since 2017 It’s taken 100 years to elect a Sikh woman to parliament, which says a lot about representation in British politics today and how much more there is to do. Andrea Leadsom Conservative MP for South Northamptonshire, leader of the House of Commons Women are doing well – we have a female PM, a female first minister of Scotland, a female home secretary, we’re about to have our first female Black Rod, we have female members of the Lords and of the Commons, a female head of the Met and a female president of the supreme court. But we could be doing more. It’s an improving situation but there’s still a good way to go. Ann Taylor Labour peer. MP for Dewsbury 1987-2005, first female leader of the House of Commons Having women to vote for in politics is very important, but we have to make sure these role models aren’t presented like superwomen. We’ve got to get across that ordinary women can do this. Mary Creagh Labour MP for Wakefield since 2005 In my first parliamentary election, on 5 May 2005, I became only the 271st woman ever elected to parliament. Our numbers still pale in comparison to our male colleagues. However the simple fact of our presence in parliament, a different way of speaking, working and doing business, has changed things for good. Jane Campbell Commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission 2006-08 Being a disabled woman, I know what discrimination feels like but I sometimes think I’m more disempowered as a woman than as a disabled person – which is quite interesting because some would expect it to be the other way round. Maria Eagle Labour MP for Garston and Halewood since 1997 One hundred years isn’t that long, is it? I’ve been in parliament now for more than 20 years, and when you think that it’s within a lifetime before then that women couldn’t even vote, I have to stop and marvel sometimes. Having the vote doesn’t solve all the problems women have, as we’ve seen recently across the world, but it is a fundamental stepping stone to equality and fairness and progress. Do we undervalue the vote in this country? Margaret Beckett Labour MP for Derby South since 1983 We undervalue the right to vote in this country and forget how much trouble women went through to secure it. In South Africa, after apartheid, people queued for hours to vote but here, a lot of people seem to regard it as an optional extra. Janet Fookes Conservative peer, previously MP for Merton and Morden (1970-1974) and Plymouth Drake (1974‑1997) When voting is so easy to do, it’s easy to undervalue it. You only have to look at the contrast when people got the vote in South Africa, they travelled for miles and queued for hours in the hot sun. It really meant a great deal. Margot James Conservative MP for Stourbridge since 2010, minister for digital, culture, media and sport When I’m campaigning for general elections, I do find that people take it seriously. It’s a shame that people don’t regard local elections in the same light. The turnouts are quite poor and it’s such a pity because local elections have a big effect on people’s lives. Amy Lamé Writer and performer, Mayor of London’s ‘night tsar’ The Millicent Fawcett statue going up in Trafalgar Square makes me incredibly proud. It annoys me when people say voting doesn’t matter. Look at her, and think of what she fought for. Theresa Villiers Conservative MP for Chipping Barnet since 2005 I think many more people are engaged in politics now than was the case 10 or 15 years ago, and people are very decisive, too. Whereas in the past you would meet a lot of people on the doorstep who weren’t quite sure which way they were going to vote, or whether they would vote or not, I’ve found that people are now quite focused and clear on how they’ll vote. Caroline Dinenage Conservative MP for Gosport since 2010 In Britain, voting has become commonplace, ordinary, we take it for granted. As we approach the centenary of giving women the (partial) right to vote it is a good time to educate a new generation of women and girls on the story of this fundamental right. When I was the minister for women and equalities in 2015 I was shocked to learn that some countries, such as Switzerland and Portugal, only granted full voting rights during my lifetime. Emma Nicholson Conservative / Lib Dem MP for Torridge and West Devon 1987-1997 The last election shows that people in this country do respect their right to vote. And the AV [Alternative Vote] referendum in 2011 demonstrated that first-past-the-post was the voting system people wanted. We have a queen, but the electorate is king. Voting really matters, and so does the system around it. Amber Rudd Home secretary, minister for women and equalities I find it almost unthinkable that just a century ago women in this country were treated as second-class citizens unfit to choose the politicians who represent us all. A generation of brave women fought to overturn that injustice and I have always been thrilled to cast my vote – in both my local polling station and late-night lobby divisions – to exercise this hard-won democratic right. Victoria Atkins Minister for women When my grandmother was born, her mother and grandmother could not vote, let alone stand for parliament. In 1921, my constituency voted for the second-ever female MP [Liberal Margaret Wintringham] and, 94 years later, I was the 428th woman to be elected to parliament. I am immensely grateful to those who paved the way.

It’s also about memory, history and what’s ahead. It’s the story of our heritage, and it’s also the blueprint for our future.” Espinosa is championing the food of her homeland, Colombia: a nation, she says, that has kept its culinary wealth buried in its larder for far too long. “There’s almost an embarrassment in my country about our food,” she says. “But that’s so wrong. We have immense riches to share. We’re about 20 years behind Mexico in terms of the international impact of our cuisine, but we have so much to offer.” Even more importantly, she believes, food has much to give the country as it climbs its way out of an era dominated by civil war and drugs violence. Not only can its cuisine put Colombia on the map for something positive, but food production can provide its people with alternative livelihoods to cocaine production. Leo, Espinosa’s eponymous restaurant in Bogotá, was voted best restaurant in Colombia in 2016, and she has just won the Basque Culinary World Prize, worth £89,000, for her commitment to using gastronomy to drive ecology and social change. When we meet in San Sebastián in northern Spain, where she’s come to receive the award, the first thing she does is offer me a piece of chocolate. “I eat dark Colombian chocolate every day. It’s the key to keeping perfect, apparently.” At 55, full of Latino passion and larger than life gestures, she is packed with energy and youthfulness. Cooking was a second career for her, after she chanced upon its potential as a single parent trying to make her daughter Laura’s teatimes more interesting; and she has the proselytising zeal of someone who feels she is still on the initial stretches of a long road. So the crucial question is, what does Colombia have to tempt the world’s tastebuds? Mexico put mole and tacos on the table; Peru introduced us to ceviche; Argentina shared its dulce de leche. What will the newest Latin American kid bring to the kitchen block? The answer is surprising: one of Colombia’s signature flourishes, apparently, is a species of creature Espinosa describes as “The big ass ant.” Ants are a traditional delicacy in Colombia, she explains, and her favoured use of the big ass variety is as a crust on slices of tuna. Using leaves as wraps is another common feature of Colombian cuisine. There are more than 150 leaf species that are used to create tamale-like parcels. “That gives you an idea of how diverse a range of food there is in my country,” says Espinosa. Among the dishes she serves in her restaurant is fish cooked in coconut, wrapped in plantain and dribbled with conch sauce. “My idea was to take traditional dishes and introduce them to a wider public, without losing the essence of what they were originally about.” Espinosa’s childhood was imbibed with the tastes and sights and smells of meals being prepared, and she was introduced early to the bonding and transformative possibilities of food. The second of six children (“three of us had black hair and three had red, and I was one of the redheads”), she spent much of her girlhood at the finca owned by her maternal grandparents in northern Colombia. They were wealthy, and their homestead was the focus for not only the family, but the wider community – and food was at its centre. “I didn’t have to read Gabriel García Márquez,” she explains, “because I was already living in one of his novels. I was raised in a world of magical realism. His books are full of images from my childhood. At 5am the gates would open and a woman would arrive with a basket full of empanadas – that was breakfast, with thin beef and onion and tomatoes on top. For lunch there would be soup, coastal cheese, corn wrapped in plantain leaves. The fire for cooking was burning from 6am to 9pm; and everyone gathered round, not just the family but villagers and people who worked on my grandparents’ land. It was the area originally inhabited by the Zenú people, who date back to way before the Spanish era. We were a community, and food and its preparation was right there in the middle of us.” After school, Espinosa wanted to study art, but her family said no. “They said I could do art on the side, but economics was a more ‘proper’ subject, and that was what I should study.” At university she fell in love, married at 21 and had Laura, now 33. For a moment, she says, she teetered on the brink of a conventional life, but only briefly. “I realised very quickly that I was never going to be a traditional wife. My husband wanted more children. He wanted a traditional family, a traditional home. And I realised there was something out there waiting for me, something quite different from that.” When Laura was one year old, Espinosa divorced her husband. Five years later, when her daughter was old enough to leave with her parents, she moved to Bogotá, determined to make her mark. “I wanted to eat up the world,” she says. “I was hungry for it.” She found work as a publicist, gaining experience that would later prove useful. “But I started to realise that my future was in art; so while I worked as a publicist by day, by night I went to art school.” With Laura now living with her, Espinosa started to cook for the two of them at home. “And I really enjoyed it. It was so creative, and that was what I most liked about it. I realised that cooking was really a manifestation of my art. Friends who came to my house to eat with us said, ‘You’ve got a talent here, you should use it…’” She quit her job and opened her first restaurant. “But it was difficult, much harder than I’d realised,” she says. In art there is freedom, but cookery brought discipline as well as creativity.” What started as a tough ask became a crisis, and she was forced to close the restaurant. “It was a dark moment. I’d just split up from a partner, I was looking for purpose in my life, and I ended up 5mm from the bottom. I didn’t quite feel the bottom beneath my feet, but I did come very close.” But the truth, says Espinosa, is that she revels in the potential of drama in any area of her life. “I love it when life brings emotion and sensation. I adore being on a roller coaster. It took me a long time to grow up, and it wasn’t easy to get to the place where I wanted to be. I made a lot of mistakes, but you have to make mistakes in order to arrive at what’s right.” She opened Leo a decade ago, in 2007. “It was a success from the start. By then I knew absolutely that I wanted to be a chef, and I no longer expected the process to be easy. Once you make the decision to do what you really want to do with your life, you have to accept some discomfort. Many people don’t have the balls to do what they feel they were born to do. But I’m a rebel and I believe in rebels. We were born with the possibility of opening new windows, and I knew this was my moment to do that.” Putting her economics and publicity skills to good use to run and promote the business, she also embarked on what has become the signature element of her cooking – the quest to find traditional dishes and ingredients, and to give them a modern twist. “I started travelling around Colombia, and I realised the true gastronomy of my country,” she says. “There’s such a rich culture of cooking but many Colombians don’t connect with it. Too many communities have been isolated and have lost their pride in the food they cook, and I want to help change that.” In particular, she says, Colombia can show the world a way of integrating many cultural traditions into its cuisine. The country’s heritage includes indigenous Amerindian communities, Spaniards from the conquest and Africans who were brought in as slaves by the Europeans – and all these influences have left their mark in the culinary traditions. Today, diners at her restaurant can taste the fruits of her research. Among the ingredients she serves are crocodile and a large type of rodent that she says is preserved by smoking in the mountains. She serves pirarucu, which at 3m long is one of the biggest fish in the world, enjoys flavouring her food with an aromatic spice called “fish eye”, and uses coquindo, a seed considered sacred by the Indians. But the role of any successful chef, says Espinosa, goes far beyond her or his restaurant. “At my grandparents’ house it was not only the food that inspired me, it was the way the community was one. My country is coming out of a difficult time, and food production can be part of the change.” Providing new markets for fruit and vegetables means helping communities switch from cocaine to “post-conflict crops”. Pineapples, which Espinosa describes as “honey gold”, have been an important part of that story. There are difficulties, she concedes, in transporting traditional ingredients from some parts of the country to Bogotá, but she isn’t afraid of challenges. FunLeo, the shorthand name for the Leo Espinosa Foundation, works to further these ambitions, and is run by Espinosa’s daughter Laura, who is also a trained sommelier. In Latin America, as in most other parts of the world, top flight gastronomy remains male-heavy. “It’s definitely still a man’s world,” says Espinosa. “But the truth is that women are best in the kitchen. They tend to be more dedicated, more patient. And in ordinary homes the world over, women still tend to do the cooking. Which is why I think female chefs are so important. We stand for all the women who are quietly making meals. It’s crucial for all of them that we are noticed.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/23/mary-lee-berners-lee-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:47:33Z","webTitle":"Mary Lee Berners-Lee obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/23/mary-lee-berners-lee-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/23/mary-lee-berners-lee-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mary Lee Berners-Lee obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The computer scientist Mary Lee Berners-Lee, who has died aged 93, was on the programming team for the computer that in 1951 became the first in the world to be sold commercially: the Ferranti Mark I. She led a successful campaign at Ferranti for equal pay for male and female programmers, almost two decades before the Equal Pay Act came into force. As a young mother in the mid-1950s she set up on her own as a home-based software consultant, making her one of the world’s first freelance programmers. Modest about her own pioneering achievements, she is on record (in an interview with computer historian Janet Abbate) as saying that her biggest contribution was to be “the grandmother of the web”. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee (now Sir Tim), the eldest of her four children, proposed a system to access and exchange documents across the internet, and soon afterwards built the first web server, website and browser. Tim recalled that his mother had a strong sense of the potential of computers right from the start. “It was obvious to us growing up how incredibly exciting it was,” he said, “not just that you had a new device, but the sense that what you could do was limited only by your imagination.” Mary Lee Woods was born in Hall Green, Birmingham, the daughter of two teachers, Bertie and his wife, Ida (nee Burrows). They strongly encouraged their daughter to pursue a university education and a career. Her only brother served in the RAF and was killed during the second world war. At Yardley grammar school she excelled in mathematics, and obtained a parish scholarship to study mathematics at the University of Birmingham. Her wartime degree, begun in 1942, was interrupted by two years’ working at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern. When she graduated in 1947, she wrote to the director of the Commonwealth Observatory near Canberra, Australia – Richard Woolley, who subsequently returned to the UK as Astronomer Royal – and he gave her a job classifying stars by their spectral characteristics. She loved Australia, but found the work tedious. In 1951 she returned to the UK and successfully answered an advertisement in the journal Nature for mathematicians to train as computer programmers at the electrical engineering firm, Ferranti, in Manchester. The Ferranti Mark I was the commercial version of the Manchester Mark 1, one of the world’s first stored program computers, which had gone into operation at the University of Manchester in 1949. As one of a small cohort of young men and women working in the “Tin Hut” at Ferranti’s Moston works, Berners-Lee was trained to write programs following a manual written by Alan Turing. His modified teleprinter code turned letters and symbols on a keyboard into patterns of five hole-positions on punched paper tape that the computer could read directly. Her early work included writing a diagnostic program that could locate program errors. She also wrote programs to solve up to 40 simultaneous equations, a service greatly in demand in aeronautics, and which tested the limits of the notoriously unreliable machine. Though later in life she became equally adept at using high-level languages such as Fortran, she loved the precision of writing programs in machine code. Not long after she joined Ferranti, the women were furious to discover they were paid less than men recruited at the same time. Berners-Lee was deputed to make the case to management for equal pay. She won immediate rises for the women, and acceptance of the principle of equal pay. Conway Berners-Lee joined Ferranti in 1953, and they were married the following year, both then working at the London office. After the birth of her first child in 1955, Mary Lee turned to what she called “cottage industry” programming, writing programs at home to track weather balloons for the Air Ministry and to solve problems of “bus-bunching” for London Transport, among others. When her children were older she worked as a maths teacher before returning to programming with a project management consultancy. She retired in 1987. Her husband had remained with ICL, the British computer company formed from the merger of Ferranti with several other companies, until his own retirement in 1986. She is survived by Conway, her children Tim, Peter, Helen and Michael, seven grandchildren and three step-grandchildren. • Mary Lee Berners-Lee, computer scientist, born 12 March 1924; died 29 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/23/key-republican-democrat-battles-unresolved-despite-shutdown-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T21:44:33Z","webTitle":"Key Republican-Democratic battles unresolved despite shutdown deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/23/key-republican-democrat-battles-unresolved-despite-shutdown-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/23/key-republican-democrat-battles-unresolved-despite-shutdown-deal","fields":{"headline":"Key Republican-Democratic battles unresolved despite shutdown deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three days after debate over federal spending and immigration policy shut down the federal government, key battles between Democrats and Republicans remained unresolved on Tuesday. Donald Trump signed a short-term spending measure late on Monday, after Senate Democrats agreed on legislation to fund the government for three weeks, in exchange for a commitment to vote on ensuring protection for Dreamers, young undocumented migrants who were brought to the US as children. The compromise, which ended the shutdown and returned hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work after they were furloughed on Monday, comes at a time of profound political polarization in Washington, when trust across the aisle is in short supply. Liberal groups and progressive lawmakers were furious after a majority of Senate Democrats voted to end the shutdown on Monday, trusting that the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would indeed allow a vote on immigration next month. McConnell on Tuesday reiterated that it was his “intention” to allow debate on immigration legislation that would protect Dreamers. The offer, he said, was conditional on the government remaining open, a tactical move to ward off another shutdown in three weeks. “Because common sense and bipartisanship won out yesterday, we have a fresh start today,” McConnell said in a floor speech on Tuesday. “I challenge everyone to make the most of it. The American people are watching.” Asked what he would say to Dreamers who were fearful the majority leader won’t keep his promise, McConnell told reporters: “I intend to keep my word.” Even if the Senate does act, however, there is no guarantee the House Republican leadership will follow. But the deal was enough to win support from 33 Senate Democrats, who joined 48 Republicans to reopen the government on Monday night. Sixteen progressive Democrats voted against the measure, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, who said it would be “foolhardy” to trust McConnell. On Tuesday morning, the president tweeted: “Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. “The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, parried criticism on Tuesday, insisting that the Democratic leadership was “pleased” by the outcome of what was an audacious gambit to force Republicans’ hand on immigration. He told reporters that Democrats were “a lot better off today when it comes to the cause of Dreamers than we were four or five days ago”. “Leader McConnell made a promise not just to Democrats but to Republicans as well. We expect him to keep his word to the body,” Schumer said, adding later that the motto was “trust but verify”. Republicans and Democrats are no closer to resolving the issues that triggered the shutdown. They have no consensus on a budget and have yet to settle on an immigration compromise that could pass both chambers and win support from a White House in which immigration hardliners have the president’s ear. Trump praised one of those hardliners, his chief of staff, on Tuesday, tweeting: “Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!” Left uncertain is the status of the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants, after Trump rescinded Daca in September and gave Congress a six-month grace period to resolve the issue legislatively. But the path to a bipartisan immigration solution that satisfies Democrats’ desire for Dreamer protections, Republicans’ requirement for increased border security and Trump’s demand for a wall seemed as distant as ever on Tuesday. An inchoate effort to restart negotiations was under way in the Senate without clear direction or leadership. Several senators on Tuesday said the current state of negotiations was unmoored from an earlier bipartisan effort that paired increased border security and tighter controls on immigration with a Dream Act, legislation that would offer a conditional path to citizenship for certain undocumented people. “There is not even an agreement on a starting point,” said Richard Durbin, the No 2 Senate Democrat, who has been at the center of negotiations over Dreamers. “But I will tell you, there is only one bipartisan bill that has been brought before the Senate. That should be the starting point.” But Trump rejected the plan drafted by the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Durbin, of Illinois. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, on Tuesday called the plan “unacceptable” and said the legislation should be “declared dead on arrival” because it failed to meet the administration’s demands on border security. Flake said negotiators had abandoned that legislation as talks resumed to find a compromise solution on immigration. “This is a new effort entirely,” he told reporters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Schumer has rescinded his offer to allow funding for the construction on a border wall, which he had extended to Trump in a last-ditch effort to stave off a shutdown. Since the White House rejected that offer, Schumer said he had taken the wall offer “off the table”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/24/hostelworld-reveals-best-budget-hostel-stays-2018-hoscars","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T13:40:46Z","webTitle":"How accommodating!

The light and airy hostel has a modern design and is walking distance from some of the city’s main attractions, such as the Ningxia night market. In the UK, the YHA in Liverpool was named best hostel in England, and praised for its location next to Albert Docks. The winner in Scotland was Castle Rock Hostel, a “palatial” property with an easygoing backpacker vibe next to Edinburgh Castle. In Wales, the award went to the River House, Cardiff, a family-run hostel with a breakfast that’s “second to none”, while in Ireland the Galway City Hostel took the top spot as the perfect base from which to explore the region.

McQueen bought the Pope 61ci Model L bike, dating back to 1914, after a long search across America with his close friend and stunt driver Bud Ekins. After years in private hands, the V-twin bike – which has classic blue bodywork, white tyres and red markings – is being sold by Bonhams at the eighth annual Las Vegas motorcycle auction on Thursday. Bidding is expected to start at £86,000. Ben Walker, the global head of motorcycles at the auction house, said: “We are privileged to be offering this important motorcycle for sale. It has an impeccable provenance and is presented in beautiful condition. “Machines that were formerly the property of the ‘King of Cool’ are keenly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts.” The bike was created by the Pope Manufacturing Company, founded by Colonel Albert Augustus Pope (1843-1909), and had a powerful 1,000cc engine, allowing it to reach speeds of over 70mph. It was a trailblazer as it used technology that had not been used before on a production road-going motorcycle in the US. After McQueen’s death in 1980, the bike was sold privately rather than at auction like most of his other automobiles. Walker said: “This is a very rare bike indeed. We have only offered two examples of this model in the last 10 years, so that gives you an idea of just how uncommon this bike is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/will-women-ever-get-paid-same-as-the-men-sport-world","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T09:00:46Z","webTitle":"'I was number one.

And they wanted me to wear a crop top': cleaning up UK sport","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sport is going through a profound existential crisis. There have been allegations of sexism in the cycling and football world; there is rampant inequality (in November it was revealed that the combined pay of women footballers in the top seven football leagues in the world equals that of Brazilian forward Neymar’s). Racism persists: in 2016, England footballer Eniola Aluko made a complaint that the national team’s coach Mark Sampson had told her to make sure her Nigerian family did not bring ebola to Wembley. Today, a group of athletes determined to change sport for the better – former javelin thrower Goldie Sayers, badminton player and silver medallist Gail Emms, Paralympic wheelchair racer Anne Wafula Strike, and Lewes FC footballers Jonté Smith and Faye Baker – meet at Lee Valley Athletics Centre in London to discuss the way forward (click on ‘i’ on bottom right of photo). Last August, Emms, who won silver at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, attracted headlines when she wrote a blog in which she admitted she had suffered depression since quitting sport; she said she was not prepared for life and at the age of 40 felt unemployable. She is now campaigning about mental health issues, and believes coaches rarely exercise their duty of care to athletes. “People have finally started questioning whether we are pushing people too far, to go to the extremes of losing their morals and their health.” Sayers agrees: she thinks they should use their experiences to encourage the next generation to study and develop passions outside sport. “I would only coach someone now if they were studying or working, because I think being a full-time athlete is probably the worst thing you can do for your career.” The problem is, Emms says, it was not in the interest of her coaches to do that. “Their funding was on the line if I didn’t get a medal. They did not want me to think about another career.” In her sporting prime, Emms says, she was pressured into being a “Badminton Barbie”. “My sponsor turned up and said, ‘We’ve got some new kit for you. I laid it out and it looked like an eight-year-old girl’s clothes. They said, ‘We thought you could wear a crop top and some hot pants.’ And I went, ‘I’m not a 400m athlete – I lunge. And this is not good for lunging. I don’t want to wear this. Can’t I just wear a normal T-shirt?’ And they said, ‘But all the cameras are on you.’ Then this guy said, ‘I don’t suppose you could have a couple of sunbeds because cellulite shows up on TV lighting.’ My jaw just... broke.” Emms says many athletes end up with body dysmorphia. “I used to be constantly told I was fat. I got to the point where I said, if you go anywhere near me with those calipers [to measure fat] again I’m going to shove them where the sun don’t shine. I was .5% over their limit. I was number one in the world. That’s the only time I ever spoke out.” “Are you an athlete or a model?” Wafula Strike asks, appalled. “As a woman in sport you’re very aware that if you play the game you will get more media coverage,” Emms says. “When you do see female athletes in the newspapers, they are the prettier ones.” “And if you are blond you get more work,” says Wafula Strike. “Yes!” says Emms. “Look at Sharapova, and her sponsorship money.” Wafula Strike laughs. “I’ll go for plastic surgery. Then dye my hair. Then get myself a new nose.” She says that there are still so many prejudices about how disabled athletes are supposed to look. “When you’re disabled you’re not supposed to look good. You meet people who say ‘Oh God, you’re pretty, and you’re in a wheelchair.’” Emms bursts out laughing. “It’s true,” Wafula Strike says. “People don’t understand you can have a disability and still be clever and put on lipstick. We have to keep fighting these prejudices.” Wafula Strike grew up in Kenya and contracted polio when she was two, paralysing her from the chest down. She came to the UK in 2000 and became a member of Team GB in 2006. As she tells her story, everybody listens in shocked silence. Wafula Strike raced in the same category as the then Paralympian record medallist Tanni Grey-Thompson. She quickly established herself as the main rival to Grey-Thompson, who was made a dame in 2005 and a baroness in 2010 for her contribution to Paralympic sport. At the 2006 Paralympic World Championships, Wafula Strike’s coach Ian Thompson (who also coached his wife Grey-Thompson), told officials he believed Wafula Strike had too much body movement for the category she was racing in. She was subsequently moved into a more able-bodied category, even though her medical records went missing before the test. “When my reclassification happened, everybody expected that I would quit the following day. But I said no, get me races in my new class. The following day I was on the start line with tears in my eyes. I wanted to prove a point, that it’s not all about medals or fame or money.” But the reclassification destroyed her career. Emms is almost in tears. “OK you have broken my heart, it’s official,” she says. In written evidence to a parliamentary select committee last November, Peter Eriksson, a former head coach at UK Athletics’ Paralympic programme, said that Ian Thompson had played an “unethical role” in the reclassification of Wafula Strike, adding that the reclassification “would give his personal athlete [Grey-Thompson] less competition”. Grey-Thompson has stressed that neither she nor her husband had any part in the reclassification, and that she had “no personal or vested” interest. Emms raises the subject of drugs cheats in badminton. “People take drugs for recovery. It doesn’t necessarily make you play badminton better. But it makes you faster on the court, stronger, and it makes you recover better for the next game. You don’t see people for a year, then they’re back bigger and stronger, with a deeper voice, and you’re thinking, ‘Mmm, wonder what you’ve been doing.’” Sayers is going to have a huge party when she finally receives her Olympic bronze medal, she says. “I got a call over 18 months ago, saying that a Russian athlete who had finished ahead of me in Beijing in 2008 had failed a doping test. Ten years is a long time, but I do feel grateful that testing has taken place.” Sayers, 35, and now retired from athletics, always suspected her rivals were cheating. As soon as she received the news, she knew exactly who it was: Russian javelin thrower Mariya Abakumova. “What was it that sent alarm bells ringing?” asks Emms. “Google her,” Sayers says. They look at a “before” picture, in which Abakumova looks strong but normal, and an “after” picture where she looks like the Incredible Hulk. “Oh. My. God!” Emms screams. “I remember waiting in a dinner queue in the hotel, and hearing two blokes behind me. And I turned around and it was two tiny blond 400m runners. A lot of them have acne and deep voices at 30,” Sayers says. She paid a heavy price for finishing fourth at Beijing, in terms of sponsorship, advertising, status and her sense of self. “When you’re given a medal and you stand on a rostrum, that makes a huge difference to your confidence. Because I was always a few centimetres off, I thought, ‘What else do I need to do?’ Then you push even harder. It wasn’t a coincidence that I then had a whole spate of injuries.” When she retired last year, Sayers said she was angry and disenchanted. But times have moved on. “I refuse to be bitter about it, because otherwise you’d never get over it.” “Goldie, I admire you for not being bitter,” says Wafula Strike. “If I were you I would be furious. My class was changed with no proper grounds, with no medical evidence. I wasn’t a happy person.” Centre-forward Smith and goalkeeper Baker have been listening attentively. They play for Lewes FC, a semi-professional football team that is the first in the country to pay its male and female teams equally. I ask them if they have suffered any discrimination. Well, says Smith, diffidently, there was one episode. “I got an offer to play in Vietnam when I was 20, 21 for a ridiculous amount of money – £15,000 a month after tax. I left after four days. The very first day I went to warm up with the rest of the team, and I was told I had to warm up over there with two other African players.” “Oh my goodness!” Emms says. “It gets worse,” Smith says. “After the game, I pick up my food and sit down with them and they say no, you have to sit over there with the African players. I wouldn’t have stayed for anything.” This happened two years ago. Now he is paid around £200 a week for Lewes FC. Both he and Baker are proud of the club’s commitment to equality. “A lot of people still feel it’s a man’s sport,” says Baker, who is also a lawyer. “It’s just nice to be at a club where you’re on an equal playing field, and for the men’s team not to have their nose out of joint about it.” She accepts that it’s easier to pay equally when the wages are low. “Look at a club like Man City. Will the women ever get paid the same as their male players? And if the men go all the way through the leagues, will our equality stick?” Collectively, these athletes are doing their bit to make sport more honest. Emms is hoping to help prepare athletes for life after sport, Sayers will continue to campaign for clean sport, and Wafula Strike now sits on the UK Athletics Board. She does not believe what happened to her would occur today: “Last year was an eye-opener.” Smith says you can already see the impact of Lewes FC’s equal pay initiative, announced last July. “There are now more young girls coming in to train. And that’s how you start.” • Commenting on this piece?

As three market sellers speculate about his bad fortune, one mentions “the curse”. We are then taken back to the 18th century and the eponymous Kintu. His name echoes the creation myth in which Kintu is the first person on Earth, but in Makumbi’s hands he is just a man: a powerful governor burdened with more wives than he would like, on a journey to pay homage to the new king. Tragedy strikes and Kintu’s son dies by Kintu’s own hand, an act that haunts his family down the generations. The winner of the 2014 Commonwealth short story prize, Makumbi has here written a multi-generational epic that is equal parts imagination and research. The details of the 18th-century royal Buganda court are finely drawn, and full of detail and intrigue. In Kintu’s time, the curse manifests itself as a mental breakdown experienced as a consequence of his son’s death; the concept of inherited chemical imbalances may have been unknown to the 18th century, but is familiar when it comes up again in relation to Miisi, one of Kintu’s descendants, living in the early 21st century. The beauty of the book is that it gives a snapshot of different periods of Uganda’s history through characters who are dynamic and engaging, with interesting personal stories of their own. Kintu has been hailed as the “great Ugandan novel”, and deservedly so. While Makumbi documents the Ugandan story, she also subverts Ugandans’ understanding of who they are as a people, questioning the popular conceptions of gender, religion and mental illness. And she looks at patriarchy not through the consequences it may have for women, but from the male perspective. (All but one of the six sections are told from a man’s point of view.) The result is a book that – like Makumbi’s subversion of the Kintu myth – examines the burdens of patriarchy on African men without blaming women. There are some surprising historical omissions. Makumbi mostly avoids describing both the colonial period, which so often seems the obligation of the historical African novel, and Idi Amin’s reign, which seems the obligation of the Ugandan novel. Kintu is better for not retreading this worn ground. Published in Kenya four years ago, it had trouble finding a British publisher, and the lack of that familiar historical territory may have been a factor; but as word of mouth spread, it became hard to ignore. So yes, Kintu is an important book. It is also a very good one. Makumbi’s sentences are densely packed and lyrical. Here, from early on, is a succinct summary of a childhood: “His father’s head-wife’s tyranny had led to the formation of cliques among the children in order to protect themselves. Kintu, an only child whose mother had died, had neither clique nor mother to protect him.” The characters are varied, from the governor Kintu to richly drawn minor characters, such as the cheeky 21st-century mortuary attendant. Sly humour is peppered among the stories of unwanted wives and overprotective fathers and religion run amok. As Makumbi wryly observes of one couple: “Their house had no ceiling because in the 50s, when Kanani had built it, Jesus was coming.” This is a complex profile of a family and a country – both of its nation building and the urban and pastoral variations within its borders. Makumbi took 10 years to write it, and one can see the time and care in the deceptively casual manner in which she drops information here and there, laying traps for characters 50 years before they are sprung. With a novel that is inventive in scope, masterful in execution, she does for Ugandan literature what Chinua Achebe did for Nigerian writing. • Kintu is published by Oneworld.

Tillerson’s comments came a day after reports of a fresh chemical weapons attack in the rebel enclave of East Ghouta, which injured more than 20 people, most of them children. Speaking at a conference in Paris on Tuesday aimed at stepping up international pressure on perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks, Tillerson condemned Russia for “shielding” its Syrian ally against punishment for its actions. His remarks came after the US announced last week that its forces will remain in Syria indefinitely, infuriating Moscow. They are also likely to raise tensions ahead of fresh rounds of talks in Vienna and Russia over the next fortnight aiming to find a political solution for the seven-year civil war. “Only yesterday more than 20 civilians, most of them children, were victims of an apparent chlorine gas attack,” Tillerson said of the incident, which left victims struggling to breathe. He added that such attacks “raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad may be continuing to use chemical weapons against his own people”. Damascus has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons, with the United Nations among those blaming government forces for an April 2017 sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun which left more than 80 people dead. Tillerson said Russia was in violation of a 2013 agreement it made with the US on the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and is helping the Syrian government to breach the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans their use. The Paris conference of diplomats from 29 countries had been convened to push for sanctions and criminal charges against the perpetrators of chemical attacks in Syria and other countries. Russia twice used its UN veto in November to prevent an extension of an international expert inquiry into chemical attacks in Syria. Russia denies shielding Syria at the UN, claiming its investigations into chemical weapons attacks in Syria had not produced conclusive evidence and were biased. “Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons, since Russia became involved in Syria,” Tillerson told reporters. “There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the US as a framework guarantor. At a bare minimum, Russia must stop vetoing, or at the very least abstain, from future security council votes on this issue,” he added. Between 2012 and 2017, there were more than 130 reported chemical attacks in Syria, with the majority attributed to the Assad regime. UN inspections have found the Syrian regime culpable in two specific cases, although it was suspected of being responsible for many more. The Islamic State group has also been accused of using mustard gas in Syria and Iraq. Nikki Haley, the US envoy to the UN, said Russia’s actions had “sent a dangerous message to the world – one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable, but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable”. On Tuesday, France also announced it was sanctioning 25 people and companies over their links to Syria’s chemical weapons programme, promising an end to impunity over their use. The list included businesses based in Beirut, Damascus and Paris, and they will now face asset freezes. Tuesday’s Paris summit was largely convened by President Emmanuel Macron in the face of a repeated Russian use of its veto at the UN security council to reject the findings of independent UN inquiries into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Diplomats, mainly from Europe and the Middle East, committed to sharing information and compiling a consolidated list of individuals or entities implicated in the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The west has repeatedly said the use of chemical weapons is a red line that cannot be crossed, but has been haphazard its response to such breaches. “Faced by the recent banalisation of the proliferation and use of these odious arms, it is necessary to act,” the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, told the conference. “On this we will be judged by history.” Andrew Lapsley, an official representing the UK Foreign Office, said it was vital that “a 100-year taboo on the use of chemical weapons was not lost”. The French initiative sets out few plans for how those identified in aiding the use of chemical weapons will be prosecuted. Last summer Carla del Ponte, the veteran war crimes prosecutor, quit the UN Commission of Inquiry into Syria, saying she had no confidence that war crimes in Syria would ever be prosecuted. She was replaced by an Egyptian human rights lawyer, Hanny Megally. Last year, the joint mission created by the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found the Syrian regime responsible for the sarin gas attack against Khan Sheikhun village in April 2017, which led to a US Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrian air base that destroyed a fifth of the Syrian air force. The OPCW estimated that the regime did not fully dismantle its chemical weapons stockpiles, despite commitments made in 2013. Russia had stepped in to oversee the destruction after the US and UK held back from airstrikes to punish alleged use of chemical weapons. In a statement last Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said the Syrian government had no motive in using such weapons since it was anyway winning the war. Moscow, backed by Iran and Turkey, has organised talks in the Russian city of Sochi next week aimed at finding a political resolution to the war. That effort is running parallel to talks overseen by the UN, with the latest round due in Vienna on Thursday and Friday. The talks have so far failed to make progress in ending a war that has left more than 340,000 people dead. Tillerson said that “Russia’s failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution of the overall crisis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/24/video-games-industry-metoo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"The video games industry isn’t yet ready for its #MeToo moment | Keza MacDonald","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/video-games-industry-metoo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/video-games-industry-metoo","fields":{"headline":"The video games industry isn’t yet ready for its #MeToo moment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A couple of weeks after the Weinstein revelations, the emails started coming. Some weren’t even personalised. “Hello, prominent woman in the video games industry. I am a reporter trying to unmask sexual predators. Is this something you would be willing to talk about? If not, do you know anyone else who will?” Women working in video game development and media, especially those who are outspoken about gender equality in the games industry’s notoriously unbalanced workforce – which, according to the most recent Independent Game Developers Association survey, is 79% male – have been getting these missives for months. There is nothing inherently wrong with a journalist trying to dig up leads. It’s what we do. But on this topic, at this time, it is extremely misguided. Women do not want to be pressed to share their trauma. And if women in the video games industry do decide to speak out, they will do so on their own terms, not at the insistence of the press. The video games industry has not yet had its #MeToo moment. There have been rumblings: last year IGN, the biggest video games and entertainment site, dismissed one employee and, more recently, its editor-in-chief , after a former member of staff alleged harassment and the company’s editorial workforce demanded a change in its working culture. Another games media outlet, Vox Media’s Polygon, fired a video producer after it came to light that he’d been sending sleazy messages to women in the games industry for years. On the development side, studio heads at French outfit Quantic Dream denied accusations from employees that management had fostered a toxic and sexist working environment. But there has been no mass movement of women coming forward with their stories of workplace harassment – much to the frustration, it would seem, of reporters working in the space, whose fishing activity has only intensified. There are extremely good reasons for this. It is not, funnily enough, because there is no workplace harassment in the video games industry. It’s because women don’t want to publicly relive painful things that have happened to them. It’s because any woman who goes public with allegations of this variety opens herself up to further harassment, victim-blaming, and unpleasant professional ramifications. It’s because the consequences of bad reporting on this subject, exemplified by the fallout from Babe.net’s stomach-churning story about Aziz Ansari, are huge. Even when sources are anonymised, there are so few women in the games industry that it would hardly be impossible for trolls to discover their identities and wreak retaliatory havoc. There is enormous risk and sacrifice involved in coming forward – on top of whatever emotional damage the original abuse itself might have wrought. There’s also the fact that, actually, women in the games industry have been talking about sexist working culture for a very long time. The #1reasonwhy movement back in 2012 is one of many, many examples of moments where women from all over the games industry have shared their experiences of discrimination, and their reasons for persisting nonetheless. Though it is encouraging that people are finally starting to listen, it is more than a little galling that they are only doing so now. It would have been helpful for people to listen during Gamergate, a 2014 harassment campaign that almost exclusively targeted women working in video games under the smokescreen of “ethics in video games journalism”, and whose effects are still very much felt. A dispiriting proportion of the games press, which should have stood up for women without hesitation, chose to either ignore it until it became unavoidable or engage in prevaricating instead. Is it any wonder that women do not trust reporters with their stories now? Why does it feel like the games industry is only interested in what women have to say when it’s about their trauma? The New York Times investigation into Harvey Weinstein represented over a year of work and trust-building. You don’t just pull this kind of reporting out of a hat. Women in the games industry, meanwhile, are being approached as potential leads rather than as people who might have been through something horrible. The sudden impatience for there to be a reckoning is at odds with the hesitancy that the games press has generally displayed when talking about the long-running – and hardly secret – problems with sexism in the industry. Anyone looking for further evidence of that culture would do well to start by listening to men, rather than hassling women for names of bad actors.

The group, which delivered goods to 90,000 grocery and convenience stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and the Costcutter chain, called in administrators in November, resulting in nearly 3,000 redundancies. At the time of its collapse, the company owed £453m to suppliers, £66m to tobacco companies Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco and £187m to banks led by Barclays, according to an update from administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report reveals that Palmer &amp; Harvey faced “cashflow pressures” in the early part of last year after losses more than doubled to £63.8m in the 53 weeks to 8 April, from £28.5m the year before. PwC added that P&amp;H had planned to restate accounts for prior years after a review found omissions and misstatements. These included incorrect recognition of supplier income from a particular supplier, incorrect accounting for royalty payments to customers and incorrect accounting for stock valuation for one particular category of stock. The latest revelation comes after the Guardian revealed that P&amp;H directors, former directors and other shareholders had received more than £70m in cash from the grocery wholesaler over the past nine years despite ongoing losses. The company also paid out more than £80m in bank interest charges from 2008 when it was taken over in a deal – a £345m management buyout largely funded by debt. Frank Field MP, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, is investigating events at P&amp;H and preparing a report for parliament after it emerged that the company’s pension deficit had ballooned to as much as £80m while shareholders continued to take dividends. As part of his investigation, Field wrote to former P&amp;H chairman Chris Etherington, who received a £5.9m loan to buy shares in the company from an employee benefit trust in 2006 and was entitled, along with his wife, to about £2.5m in dividends from 2009. Etherington told Field that he repaid £2.5m of the loan. The former executive also said he had acted to reduce payments to shareholders and reduce the pension deficit while he was in charge of P&amp;H before standing down in 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/23/white-supremacist-planned-machete-attack-on-lgbt-event-court-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T17:46:37Z","webTitle":"'White supremacist' planned machete attack on LGBT event, court hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/white-supremacist-planned-machete-attack-on-lgbt-event-court-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/23/white-supremacist-planned-machete-attack-on-lgbt-event-court-hears","fields":{"headline":"'White supremacist' planned machete attack on LGBT event, court hears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A machete attack on a LGBT pride event was thwarted after the alleged attacker told people about his plan on Facebook, a court has heard. Ethan Stables, 20, had assembled a machete, knives, an axe, an air rifle and a ball bearing gun in preparation for an attack on the New Empire pub in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria on 23 June last year, prosecutors told Leeds crown court on Tuesday. Stables was foiled after he told members of a Facebook group about his plot to attack the LGBT pride event last summer and a member phoned the police and posted a warning on Twitter. The defendant was arrested close to the pub on the evening of the event on a final reconnaissance visit, planning to return later that night to carry out the attack, the jury heard. Jonathan Sandiford, the prosecutor, said Stables was a “white supremacist and nazi – a supporter of Adolf Hitler, if you will” and “had a deep-seated hatred of black, Jewish, Muslim and especially gay people”. He added: “Between 2016 and his arrest in 2017, he was planning and preparing to commit acts of terrorism directed towards members of these groups but, primarily, directed towards people who were lesbian or gay.” The prosecutor told the jury of seven men and five women how Stables became enraged when he heard about the event at the New Empire pub. Stables spent seven months researching firearms and explosives, and had begun to acquire material to build an improvised explosive device, the jury heard. “His purpose in these acts of preparation was to launch a murderous attack on members of these communities. In particular, the prosecution suggest, people who were gay,” the prosector said. Patrick Upward QC, who is defending Stables, told the jury that his client was not a white supremacist, but more a “white fantasist”. Upward agreed the material outlined by the prosecution was an “awful, disgusting, vile series of posts”, but said the defendant had a long history of dealing with Asperger’s syndrome, had a favourite uncle who is openly gay and a black best friend.

I’ve always thought how lucky I was to get pregnant so easily, and how heartbreaking it is for people who can’t. I liked the idea of being a surrogate, but my husband wasn’t keen. By 2012, we had divorced, and I’d taken care of my parents and older brother, who sadly passed away. I’d turned 50 and thought, if I’m going to do this, it needs to be now. The organisation Surrogacy UK said they had never had a surrogate of my age, and that I needed to find a clinic that would work with me as a gestational surrogate. I had gone through the menopause, so the embryo would be implanted in my womb (as opposed to artificially inseminating my own eggs). I emailed 42 clinics and almost all said I was over their age limit. But one clinic, 15 miles from my home in Birmingham, said yes. I went with my daughter to a social event to meet other future surrogates and people searching for one. I got chatting to a man called Gary, who introduced his partner, Andy, and as we all sat together, something clicked: we had the same sense of humour. We grew closer, and by Christmas I knew they were the couple I wanted to help. When Gary got the official call on 31 December 2012, he phoned me in floods of tears. He was overjoyed. Over the next three months we drew up an agreement about decisions throughout the pregnancy, birth and afterwards. The boys both wanted me involved in their family’s life, so their child would know how they came into the world, and I felt the same. They needed to find an egg donor, but the waiting list at my clinic was 12 months. I was staggered when a friend from work phoned me out of the blue and said, “I’ll be your egg donor.” She was 29, had two children and just wanted to help. She went through two rounds of egg collection, which gave us three good-quality embryos, and three days later one of them was transferred to my womb. Unfortunately, it failed, and the boys were devastated. We had a break for a few months, before implanting both remaining embryos to give us a better chance of success. Six days later, I had heartburn, just as I’d had more than three decades earlier, and I knew. Under the pretence of giving Gary an early birthday present, I invited the boys over and gave him a box wrapped up with a ribbon. He opened it, took out the positive pregnancy test and cried his eyes out. At the six-week scan, all three of us heard the words, “We’ve got a really strong heartbeat there. And another really strong heartbeat there.” It was a good job I was lying down, because it was a bit of a shock, but a wonderful one: I was carrying twins. I understood immediately that the twins would never be mine, that I was just looking after them, as if they were my nieces or nephews. I used to stroke my stomach, not bonding with them because they were my children, but because they were the children of my best friends. At the 12-week scan, when my name was called and the three of us stood up, we were told, “Oh no, this is just for the parents.” I said, “OK, that’s fine, I’ll wait here. You go in, boys.” Eventually we all went in, but after that we switched hospitals, and I was booked in for a caesarean section. I went into spontaneous labour one month earlier, on 19 March 2014, 33 weeks and five days into my pregnancy. My daughter and Gary were in the room with me when Marnie was born at 1.40pm, weighing 3lb 12oz (1.7kg), and Dexter at 1.41pm, weighing 4lb 4oz (1.9kg). They were taken to the special care baby unit and stayed in hospital for three weeks. I stayed for six days, then came home and expressed milk for them. When the babies were ready to be held, Gary and Andy insisted the nurse hand each twin to me first, so I would be the one to give them to their parents. The best part of the whole experience for me was seeing their faces, knowing these babies were theirs – something they never thought would happen. Now the twins are nearly four and we see each other every week. I love watching them play with my grandchildren. When Marnie says, “We came out of your tummy, didn’t we, Auntie Sue?” I feel an overwhelming sense of love and pride. • As told to Moya Sarner Do you have an experience to share?

The Competition &amp; Markets Authority formal no to 21st Century Fox’s full takeover of Sky was a qualified rejection. The takeover body proceeded to set out a list of possible remedies that may lead to a yes when the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, gets the final say. Rupert Murdoch will view the CMA’s fudge as a decent result. He’s a deal-maker, remember. A haggle over the future funding and independence of Sky News, which is now the central focus, could be viewed as a light diversion from his greater project of selling the bulk of Fox to Disney. Most of Miliband’s hopes rested on the CMA declaring that the Murdoch clan, on account of the biased dross produced by Fox News in the US, shouldn’t be allowed to control 100% of Sky. But the CMA decided Fox could be trusted to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Instead, the CMA’s objection was on grounds of media plurality. In other words, the Murdochs would control too much of the UK media and could have too much political influence. Fine, but the plurality concerns were entirely concentrated on Sky News. If Fox can fix that aspect, the deal – in theory – is on again. One of CMA’s suggested remedies – forcing a sale of Sky News – is probably a non-starter. It’s hard to find committed owners of a consistently loss-making news operation, and there’s no point looking to stock market investors. Then the CMA suggests Sky News could be spun off with a fat endowment. That’s better if the promise is 10 years’ worth of money, as Murdoch pledged back in 2011. The third idea is to give Sky News an independent editorial board, plus five years of guaranteed money, while allowing the operation to stay within Sky. The third structure is probably the best since it is possible that a Disney-owned Sky could be a good and rich long-term owner. But, to cover all possibilities, the upfront promises from the Murdochs must be bigger, bolder and watertight. The editorial board must be immensely stronger than the flimsy construction erected by Rupert Murdoch at the Times and Sunday Times in the 1980s. The version described to Ofcom in an earlier round of the current saga didn’t fit the bill: it gave the Murdochs too much influence over appointments. On the money front, Fox offered five years’ worth of funding to Ofcom. It should be told 10 years, even if that means £250m or so, and all undertakings should be binding on the Mickey Mouse folks. Amid this whirlwind of deals, an independent Sky News is worth saving. EasyJet eyes pleasing data Johan Lundgren, the new chief executive at easyJet, didn’t have to do much on his first stock market outing other than agree that, a few weeks into the job, everything is going swimmingly. Rivals, including Air Berlin, Monarch and Alitalia, have gone bankrupt, which has helped to clear some of the over-capacity in the European short-haul market. Ticket prices are rising. The 6.6% increase in revenue per seat covered a low-season quarter but was the strongest figure easyJet has achieved in ages. Will he change anything? The big idea is to analyse billions of pieces of data. Does Coke sell better than Pepsi on the onboard trolley, and is Fever-Tree the tonic water of choice for easyJet customers? Yes and yes, as it happens, but those revelations don’t sound like gamechangers. But perhaps there are serious gains to be harvested if crawling over data in detail means fewer delays and cancellations. That would be a competitive advantage. Wisely, Lundgren didn’t put a figure on the productivity savings, but he won’t be the last incoming boss to decide he needs a chief data officer. The artificial intelligence revolution is happening. What price success, Mr Musk? Are we meant to take Elon Musk’s potential $55.8bn (£40bn) bonus at Tesla seriously? The numbers, including the targets the electric car company would have to achieve to hit the jackpot, are so off-the-scale that the “compensation” package reads like an elaborate joke. Is it a satire on how much US chief executives who aren’t planning to colonise Mars can make these days? Or perhaps the big number is designed to draw attention from the fact that, even at the low end of the target range, Musk would collect a few billion. Either way, it’s probably time to revisit his assertion that he’s not driven by money or remotely interested in dynastic wealth. Not even a little bit?

Sarah Isgur Flores confirmed to the Guardian that the meeting took place. The New York Times first reported the meeting on Tuesday morning. It was also reported on Tuesday that the special counsel is seeking to interview Donald Trump in relation to the president’s decision to fire former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey. The Washington Post reported that Trump’s lawyers are negotiating the terms of an interview with the special counsel, with the president’s legal team preferring that he answer some questions in person and others in a written statement. John Dowd, an attorney for Trump, declined to comment. Mueller’s reported focus on the firings of Flynn and Comey is the latest indication that the special counsel’s team is zeroing in on potential obstruction of justice issues. Earlier this month, Mueller reportedly called back a key witness in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin. Trump’s elder son, Donald Trump Jr, accepted the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton and informed of an effort by Moscow to aid his father’s campaign. Comey was also reportedly interviewed by the special counsel’s office. That interview reportedly took place last year and pertained to a series of memos Comey wrote, while he was FBI director, about his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, raising concerns that he tried to obstruct the FBI investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russians. Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said the White House was going to be “fully cooperative with special counsel and continue to do that throughout the process”. But she declined to answer questions about specific interviews. The special counsel’s office is investigating a Kremlin campaign to meddle in the 2016 election, including the hacking of Democratic party members’ emails and their release to the public. Led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, the team is also investigating interactions between members of Trump’s campaign and Russians potentially involved in those efforts. The meeting between Mueller and Sessions lasted several hours and took place last week, marking the first time the special counsel’s office has interviewed a sitting member of Trump’s cabinet. Sessions has long been a flashpoint in the Russia investigation. He announced in March 2017 that he would recuse himself from any role in it after it was revealed that he had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the 2016 campaign. The former Alabama senator endorsed Trump in February 2016 and was a key surrogate during the campaign. The attorney general’s decision to recuse himself angered Trump, who has since repeatedly criticized Sessions. In a July 2017 interview with the Times, Trump called his attorney general “very weak” and said his decision was “very unfair to the president”. Before Sessions announced he would not be involved in investigations “related in any way to the campaign for president of the United States”, Trump had dispatched the White House counsel, Don McGahn, to lobby Sessions against this decision. The president has also drawn scrutiny for pressing Comey to drop his investigation into Flynn, according to testimony the former FBI director gave to Congress last year. Trump denied Comey’s claim, but after firing him told NBC he did so because, “I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” Flynn resigned last February after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. After Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, Trump suggested in a tweet that was the reason behind his firing, contradicting the White House’s earlier claims that the decision was made in relation to Pence. Comey also testified that Trump had privately demanded loyalty from him, and that he had only promised “honesty”. Sessions was part of discussions around Comey’s firing, but because of his recusal the decision of a special counsel fell to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Muller. Mueller’s investigation has so far led to charges against Flynn, for lying to the FBI, and against Trump’s former campaign chairman and one of his aides, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates respectively, on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. Another former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and admitted to early knowledge that the Russian government possessed hacked Democratic emails. Mueller is also due to interview Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. This article was corrected on 23 January to clarify that Robert Mueller has yet to interview Steve Bannon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/28/simone-lia-on-veganuary","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on veganuary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/28/simone-lia-on-veganuary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/jan/28/simone-lia-on-veganuary","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on veganuary","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/25/best-places-to-visit-florida-historic-sights-beaches-readers-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T06:30:08Z","webTitle":"The best places in Florida away from the crowds: readers’ tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/25/best-places-to-visit-florida-historic-sights-beaches-readers-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/25/best-places-to-visit-florida-historic-sights-beaches-readers-tips","fields":{"headline":"The best places in Florida away from the crowds: readers’ tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Winning tip: Cult park near Cape Coral Near the small town of Estero, about 12 miles from Cape Coral, is beautiful Koreshan state park, which up until the early 1960s was the last home of a 19th-century cult, the Koreshan Unity. They believed the Earth was hollow, set up a community here in 1894, called New Jerusalem and produced their own newspaper. They also were the first to provide the surrounding community with electricity. The last follower of the cult, a woman who had fled Nazi persecution in Germany called Hedwig Michel, ceded the grounds to Florida in 1961. The park is beautifully maintained and staffed by knowledgeable volunteers. Visitors can walk around the landscaped site and see many of the buildings used by the community.

Consequently, the place pretty much shuts down at 8pm – but that allows for peaceful walks in starlight on deserted beaches. One of the reasons for the lack of development is conservation; turtles head to the beaches at night and all external lights are banned to avoid disorientation. I stayed at Turtle Beach Inn (doubles from $210 B&amp;B), a family-owned guesthouse with access to the beach. A short drive takes you to St Joseph Peninsula, a 15-mile spit, and state park, where the sand is white and the water emerald.

Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, held a meeting with about two dozen lawmakers in her office. Senators who wanted to speak, she told reporters, were only allowed to do so if they were holding a special stick. Collins would then take the stick from one senator and give it to the next who wanted to speak. “As you can imagine, with that many senators in a room, they all want to talk at once,” Collins told reporters on Monday. “I know that shocks you.” The stick was described by the New York Times as “a Masai tribal talking stick”, a gift to Collins, a centrist Republican, from Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota. “Sometimes people passed it person to person but generally I tried to control the stick,” Collins said. The bipartisan group involved was credited with helping end the shutdown, after discussing potential compromises and raising them with Senate leadership. Talking sticks have been an effective tool for indigenous cultures in Africa and North America for centuries. The senators, though, struggled to adapt to such a simple process. According to Politico, a glass elephant on a shelf in Collins’ office was chipped after Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, “forcefully tossed” the stick to Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, after Warner interrupted him. Shortly after that, the senators switched from the stick to a rubber ball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-tennis-semi-final-elise-mertens","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T15:27:53Z","webTitle":"Caroline Wozniacki sets up Australian Open semi-final with Elise Mertens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-tennis-semi-final-elise-mertens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/caroline-wozniacki-australian-open-tennis-semi-final-elise-mertens","fields":{"headline":"Caroline Wozniacki sets up Australian Open semi-final with Elise Mertens","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Caroline Wozniacki’s career is as hard to read as the unconventional game of Hsieh Su-wei, and the Dane’s seeming return to consistency lurched sideways then back on track as she stumbled into the semi-finals of the Australian Open for the first time since 2011. It was easy to forget, watching the first set of her quarter-final against Spain’s world No 39, Carla Suárez Navarro, that, in the second round the previous Wednesday, Wozniacki, the No 2 seed, had to win six straight games and save two match points after going 1-5 down in the third set against the world No 119 from Croatia, Jana Fett. That is an insane swing of fortune and form for a former world No 1 who last year beat three No 1 players and had the biggest win of her career in the WTA Finals in Singapore, lifting her career prize money past $25m when she beat Venus Williams. She always seems on the verge of ruling her sport, yet, at 27, she is yet to win a slam. So, in part, a scoreline of 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-2 is wholly in keeping with her career, flickering on and off like lights on a Christmas tree. Wozniacki’s opponent in the last four will be Elise Mertens, the Belgian ranked 37 in the world who had too much for the world No 4, Elina Svitolina, in the daytime match, winning 6-4, 6-4 in an hour and a quarter. It looked like another authentic upset but Svitolina revealed she had brought a hip injury into the tournament – the injury du jour in the game. It struck Jo Konta down in Brisbane, which is where Svitolina first felt discomfort. “It was getting worse and then was up and down,” she said. “I always had heavy tape under the shorts. Sometimes it was fine, but today she played a good level, so I had to push myself. She didn’t give me opportunities. All credit to her, because she played really good tennis.” Mertens was taking the win whatever way it arrived. “It’s amazing,” she said. “Not expected, especially today. Really tough match. But I was in the zone. I played really well.” She reckoned it was the biggest win of her career, adding: “She’s a great mover. She can do great things, defence but also offensive.” Wozniacki was full of praise, saying of Mertens: “She’s had an amazing start to the year, I think she’s undefeated. It’s going to be tough one but I’m excited for it.” While it might be regarded as a surprise if she could pull off back-to-back wins against Svitolina and Wozniacki, this tournament has been riddled with shocks from day one. On this side of the draw alone, six seeds fell in the first round, four in the second, two in the third, two in the fourth and Svitolina in the quarters. In the other half, seeds also tumbled throughout the first week: 11 in all, making a total of 26 from the starting line-up of 32. Angelique Kerber was the only slam champ standing after the fourth round. That is serious carnage. So, predictions are tough to make. Can Mertens beat Wozniacki? Probably not but not many people thought Venus Williams, Sloane Stephens and CoCo Vandeweghe would be off the slate after day one. It has been far from dull."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/23/inside-the-26-january-edition","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T15:29:18Z","webTitle":"Inside the 26 January edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/23/inside-the-26-january-edition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/23/inside-the-26-january-edition","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 26 January edition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whatever the lessons of the Arab spring uprisings of 2011, and the measures of hope, disillusionment and despair that followed, it is hard to argue that life has improved greatly for most people affected by the region’s changes. Tunisia, which many saw as the best bet for successful democratic reform, has seen reality bite, with old institutions quietly consolidating power and extremists exploiting disillusioned young people. Seven years on, a sharp rise in living costs has seen Tunisians return to the streets in large numbers. For the Guardian Weekly cover story this week, Emma Graham-Harrison asks whether this latest anger could translate into a second wave of Arab spring uprisings, and how that might affect the wider region. Last weekend was the first anniversary of Donald Trump’s US presidency, and to mark the occasion David Smith looks back at the 12 weirdest moments of an utterly bizarre year in Washington.

In Sport we ask whether the Tottenham striker Harry Kane has got what it takes to become the world’s best, while Richard Williams looks back admiringly at the life of Cyrille Regis, a trailblazer for black British footballers who died last week aged just 59. On the back page, the writer Ruby Hamad expresses her hope that New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s pregnancy can change the conversation about women combining childcare and career.

They leave the vehicle, looking for all the world like two regular workman on a cold winter’s day … ” Hang on. This is Andrew Graham-Dixon, the art historian, right? Why has he gone all The Cook Report on us? Because he is telling the story of a crime, “the most shocking art crime of the 21st century” no less. And he is thoroughly relishing it, by the looks of things. Guess what, those two were not just regular workmen on a cold winter’s day. They put on ski masks, put their ladder up against the Van Gogh Museum and smashed their way in, setting off alarms all over the place. But, before the police arrived, they got away, a couple of Van Goghs tucked under their arms. No sunflowers or selfies – early, lesser-known works, but significant and worth tens of millions all the same. The whole operation took 3 min 40 sec; the men disappeared into the city with their ill-gotten gains. When AG-D is talking about VG – the delicacy and responsiveness of the work, the darkness and tragic struggle of the man – he goes back to being an art historian. It is as if he is switching from speaking in one of those crime fonts that look as if they have been bashed out on Raymond Chandler’s typewriter, to something more cultured and elegant, like the new Guardian headline font, perhaps? They are equally gripping, just in a different way. It’s especially lovely when he takes a postcard of one of the stolen works, View of the Sea at Scheveningen, down to where it was painted in 1882. When he holds it up, it’s exactly the same, Scheveningen in 1882 and Scheveningen today – the sea, the sky, the colours, the light. All that has changed is that the 19th-century fishing boat has been replaced by 21st-century kitesurfers. Yes, even the wind is the same, now blowing Graham-Dixon’s hair all over the place; back then, it blew the sand into Van Gogh’s first ever oil paint, as AG-D will later witness for himself … if the painting turns up, that is. Oops, spoiler alert, too late. Back on with the gumshoes. It seems the robbers sold on the paintings for just £100,000, which they spent on watches and trips to Disneyland Paris (not very cultured, these art thieves), before getting caught. They left their hats, full of DNA, at the museum. But the paintings were now in the hands of someone known as Pinocchio, whoever the hell he was. Sounds Italian, though, so that is where we head next; it gives Graham-Dixon the opportunity to show off his Italian. And to go all Chandler again. Under normal circumstances, he stays clear of Naples’s dark side. “But these aren’t normal circumstances,” he says, menacingly. The soundtrack changes, too – from Italian opera to Italian hip-hop, a sure sign we are talking about notorious Neopolitan crime syndicate the Camorra, in whose hands the pictures ended up. Next, he goes to see a prosecutor, takes a ride in the back of a police car and visits a poor slum that was on the frontline of the drug war. “The Camorra’s main activities include drug trafficking, the illegal dumping of toxic waste, money laundering, extortion, prostitution, murder and the occasional dealings in stolen art,” he says. Yeah, but shush and keep your head down, no one wants to see you get whacked on camera. It’s brilliant. A fascinating look at how stolen art is used as a black-market currency – canvas banknotes, basically – and how it can be used as a crook’s ultimate bargaining chip to reduce a sentence. The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt, and by Carel Fabritius, doesn’t get a mention, but it flits in and out of the narrative. This one has a happy ending. Well, Graham-Dixon remains thankfully unwhacked, for starters. Pinocchio – a Camorra leader called Raffaele Imperiale, it turns out – wasn’t brought to justice, but he confessed from his fugitive home in Dubai. And the paintings were found, hidden under the floor of Pinocchio’s father’s kitchen. They were intact, apart from one torn-off corner of View of the Sea at Scheveningen.

Hospitals in the Thames Valley managed to fill just five of the 1,957 vacancies for nurses that they advertised between April and June – a success rate of 0.25% – according to the latest official NHS vacancy statistics. NHS Digital’s quarterly update detailing vacancy rates for a range of health professionals also showed that the number of unfilled advertised nursing and midwifery posts in England reached 34,260 in the three months to September – the highest level since records began. The Royal College of Nursing voiced its alarm at how the unprecedented number of such vacancies had revealed “an NHS desperately short of nurses”. Hospitals in London are also finding it almost impossible to recruit new nurses, according to NHS Digital’s new figures. For example, NHS care providers in north-west London advertised on NHS Jobs to recruit 2,545 nurses and midwives in April, May and June but only managed to get 42 new faces – 1.65% of those they were seeking. Similarly, the NHS in north, central and east London could only hire 75 of the 2,243 nurses and midwives they wanted – a fill rate of only 3.3%. Across England as a whole, only one in seven of all empty nursing posts were filled. “These [today’s] figures pull back the curtain to reveal an NHS desperately short of nurses. The government can no longer deny the staffing crisis,” said Janet Davies, the RCN’s chief executive and general secretary. “The next generation of British nurses has been deterred by the current whirlwind tearing through the NHS – record pressure, lack of funding and poor pay for staff. It has never been busier but is shedding experienced nurses quicker than it can find new ones. Earlier cuts to training places are exacerbating the problem just as long-serving staff feel demoralised and pushed to leave nursing,” she added. The high cost of living in the Thames Valley and the capital, especially housing, as well as disillusion with NHS pay having been held down for the past seven years and bursaries for student nurses being scrapped, are thought to be key factors in the worrying trend. The Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading – the main hospital used by many of the prime minister’s constituents – has been struggling to recruit enough nurses in recent years. The number of nursing vacancies has jumped by 2,626 (8.3%) over the past year from 31,634 to 34,260, according to NHS Digital’s analysis of posts advertised on NHS Jobs, the health service’s main recruitment website. However NHS Digital stressed that trusts can also employ nurses using other means. The figures confirm other recent evidence that the health service is now seeing more nurses leave than join for the first time in its history. Last week the NHS’s statistical arm disclosed that one in 10 of all nurses now quits each year. Statistics it released then showed that during 2016-17, just under 33,500 nurses left the service – 3,000 more than joined and 20% higher than the number who quit in 2012-13. Hospitals in Surrey – where health and social care secretary Jeremy Hunt is an MP – and Kent and Sussex are also failing to recruit enough nurses and midwives. Between April and June, NHS bodies managed to recruit just 303 of the 3,225 nurses and midwives they needed – a success rate of 9.4%. The West Midlands had the highest success rate (42.4%) with such staff, closely followed by the north-east (39.4%) and Yorkshire and the Humber (27.4%). The overall number of vacancies for all types of staff – including doctors, scientific, therapists, administrative and clerical personnel – which hospitals across England advertised to fill in July to September hit 87,964. That was also the highest number since NHS Digital began collecting vacancy data in April 2105 and publishing it quarterly. The figures show that NHS bodies were also short of 10,498 doctors and dentists in that quarter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/23/late-night-hosts-on-shutdown-america-gets-caught-in-the-stairwell-by-the-landlord","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T16:11:50Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on shutdown: 'America gets caught in the stairwell by the landlord'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/23/late-night-hosts-on-shutdown-america-gets-caught-in-the-stairwell-by-the-landlord","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/23/late-night-hosts-on-shutdown-america-gets-caught-in-the-stairwell-by-the-landlord","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on shutdown: 'America gets caught in the stairwell by the landlord'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Monday night discussed the end of the three-day government shutdown after Democrats and Republicans agreed to fund the government for three weeks. Stephen Colbert “As of this taping, America has a government,” began Colbert. “Here’s what happened: this afternoon, after intense closed-door negotiations, Republicans and Democrats reached a deal to reopen the government. “We don’t have to think about that again until February 8th,” the host said, noting the date until which the continuing resolution will last. “Today, in exchange for voting for the short-term funding, Democrats got six years of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which everybody, including the Republicans wanted, and they got an agreement by Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on Daca by February 8th.” “Senate minority leader and man-whose-cheeks-are-farsighted Chuck Schumer is very confident that’s going to happen,” Colbert explained, showing footage of Schumer saying he expected the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate. “Why would you expect that? Mitch McConnell’s proved he will lie to anyone about anything,” Colbert replied, noting unfulfilled promises McConnell made to senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake in exchange for their vote on the tax bill. “The leverage that Schumer thinks he got? Schumer thinks that voters will all remember Mitch McConnell maed this promise 17 days from now,” Colbert said. “Can you remember what happened 17 days ago? I can’t. I’m guessing in two days we’re all going to forget the name Stormy Daniels. That was the hurricane that spanked the Gulf coast?” Trevor Noah Noah also addressed the shutdown, which forced Trump to cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago. Noah explained that Democrats wanted a continuing resolution that included a provision to protect Dreamers, while Republicans wanted enhanced border security measures. “After a night of failed negotiations, lawmakers left the Capitol unsatisfied like it was a salad night at Paula Deen’s house,” the host joked, before noting that Trump was unable to attend a party at his Palm Beach gold club celebrating the first anniversary of his inauguration. “Donald Trump wasn’t the only one that the shutdown affected. There were real Americans faced with real consequences,” Noah added, poking fun at lawmakers who reportedly complained that the congressional gym was short on towels. “You laugh, but it’s not funny to people in Congress. Without towels, everyone at the gym has to see Bernie Sanders naked,” Noah said. “So whether it’s because of Bernie’s naked ass or the threats of voter backlash, Democrats and Republicans reached a deal this afternoon to end the shutdown. The deal was: Republicans would promise to hold a vote on immigration, and in exchange, Democrats would agree to keep the government open for three more weeks.” Showing self-congratulatory speeches given after the vote by senators Susan Collins and Jim Clyburn, Noah concluded: “American lawmakers are priceless. They want credit for fixing the thing that they broke. And not like, really fixing it. Like, barely fixing it. Because the government is only going to be funded for three weeks. America gets caught in the stairway by the landlord, like, ‘Oh hey, I’m going to get you man. Don’t cash that till Friday.’” Jimmy Kimmel Kimmel talked about this past weekend’s women’s marches. “It was not a good weekend for Donald Trump,” he said. “Millions of protesters, mostly women, marched in cities all across the country on the one-year anniversary of his presidency. There were more than 200,000 protesters in New York, more than 300,000 in Chicago, and 600,000 here in LA.” “Donald Trump got more women to exercise than Michelle Obama ever did,” Kimmel joked. “And with all these protesters marching in all these cities, the president delivered, during the marches, perhaps his most breathtaking tweet of all time.” Kimmel then read the tweet aloud, which said: “Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!” “He’s really bad at reading women,” the host quipped. “Only Donald Trump can find a way to make a protest that’s about him even more about him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/20/forget-product-placement-advertisers-buy-storylines-tv-blackish","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T16:00:02Z","webTitle":"Forget product placement: now advertisers can buy storylines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/20/forget-product-placement-advertisers-buy-storylines-tv-blackish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/20/forget-product-placement-advertisers-buy-storylines-tv-blackish","fields":{"headline":"Forget product placement: now advertisers can buy storylines","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Advertiser-funded programming is an important source of money for broadcasters, but could advertiser-funded dialogue be the next step? Last week saw a groundbreaking attempt to blend advertising and editorial in an episode of the hit US sitcom Black-ish, which involved consumer goods firm Procter &amp; Gamble paying for a plotline. In the episode, broadcast on ABC, characters discussed P&amp;G’s award-winning ad campaign, “The Talk”, which features African American parents talking about racism to their children. The show’s storyline involved character Dre Johnson – the father of the family, who is himself black and an ad executive – developing an advertising campaign that focuses on P&amp;G’s film. While we are in a new golden age of television, it has been less memorable for advertisers, who have found the digital audiences provided by Google and Facebook more alluring. Global spending on ad slots will grow 1.1% this year to $188.7bn (£136bn), according to media buyer ZenithOptimedia, while digital spending is expected to rise more than 10% to $224.7bn. This has forced broadcasters to find new ways of bringing in money and set up deals like the Black-ish episode with P&amp;G. The explosion of catch-up and on-demand services such as Netflix, the rise in the recording of shows and the skipping of ads, and a decline in viewing on traditional TV sets by younger viewers has led advertisers to look beyond the 30-second commercial break. P&amp;G’s jump to a starring role in a show is nirvana for brands targeting the kind of viewers who are increasingly switched off by TV ads. Advertisers are now frequently heavily involved in all aspects of a TV show, from providing funding and doing product-placement deals to having products digitally inserted into scenes using special effects. Viewers of Channel 4’s hit celebrity winter sports show The Jump, Sheridan Smith’s turn in ITV drama Cilla, Channel 5’s The Yorkshire Vet, or Air Ambulance ER on Sky might be unaware that they made it to the small screen in part because of co-financing from an arm of WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group. Advertisers looking for even more control are becoming involved in creating shows that will appeal to viewers and show off their brand. The deal for Channel 4’s Eat The Week with Iceland, which shows attempts by time-starved families to cook together, included the frozen-food chain having naming rights for the show. “Iceland was fully integrated,” says Liam Mullins, managing partner at media agency the7stars, which struck the deal. “We even chose the freezer.” Three years ago, UKTV, which owns 10 TV channels including Dave and Gold, revealed that a quarter of its original commissions were part-funded by advertisers. Kate Norum, senior commercial partnerships manager at the company, says the proportion is now much lower, at about five shows per year, but that it remains an important part of the business. “Nearly every brand is looking to move into content creation but a lot of what they do is sitting unwatched on digital platforms,” she says. “If we can bring top-up funding to the table, then every penny goes into the production of the show. We will only do things that we think are editorially relevant: we wouldn’t want viewers thinking they were being bashed around the head with a commercial partnership.” One example is a tie-up with Ancestry.co.uk to make The Secrets in My Family, a show that dug into a family’s history each week, fronted by The One Show’s co-host Alex Jones. The genealogy company was consulted on elements including the talent, the title, the contributors and their stories, but ultimate editorial control was held by UKTV. Advertisers can also pay to have products featured in shows, which must carry a “P” logo to indicate the presence of paid-for placements – something that has been allowed in the UK only since 2011. The problem with the modest £30m-a-year product-placement business is that sometimes brands don’t realise what they are getting themselves into. For every success like Superdrug’s tie-up with ITV2’s Love Island, which saw bottles of suntan lotion located strategically throughout the set of the runaway hit show, there is the cautionary tale of Big Brother. In 2012, Henkel, which owns brands including haircare label Schwarzkopf, spent £2m on a Big Brother deal, but the Channel 5 reality show became embroiled in an abuse and racism scandal between housemates. The deal, which included the housemates and presenter Emma Willis dyeing their hair the brand’s distinctive red colour, did not go as intended for Henkel, as more than 1,200 viewers complained to the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Some advertisers are now looking to Hollywood-style effects to make sure they get the perfect placement. London-based Mirriad places virtual advertising inventory into finished TV programmes – for example, inserting a billboard advert for insurer Prudential into an episode of the hit US comedy Modern Family. “It is all about putting in images that were never there,” says Mark Popkiewicz, chief executive of Mirriad. “In today’s world, where audiences are ignoring traditional ads more and more, or blocking them, it is critical for an advertiser to be able to benefit from great content in a natural way.” However, these innovations – from dialogue to superimposed ads – carry a health warning. Advertisers need to tread carefully as modern audiences have an increasingly low tolerance for commercial exploitation, and blurring the line between advertising and content can run the risk of a viewer backlash. The makers of The Great British Bake Off banned potentially extremely lucrative product placement deals when it moved from ad-free BBC to Channel 4, in order to protect the integrity of the UK’s most popular TV show. “It is a careful balance,” says Richard McKerrow, co-founder of Bake Off maker Love Productions. “While obviously we have scrutinised commercial opportunities, you have to be careful to protect the creative integrity and authenticity of a show. It is vital that viewers trust what they are seeing.” If the example set by the Black-ish episode takes off, it could also be question of whether viewers trust what they are hearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/phil-neville-confirmed-new-coach-of-england-women-team-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T20:42:00Z","webTitle":"England women's coach Phil Neville deletes tweets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/phil-neville-confirmed-new-coach-of-england-women-team-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/phil-neville-confirmed-new-coach-of-england-women-team-football","fields":{"headline":"England women's coach Phil Neville deletes tweets","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Phil Neville says he feels “honoured” to have been given the job of coaching the England women’s team but his appointment immediately became embroiled in controversy after highly dubious tweets Neville appears to have sent a few years ago began to circulate, with one making light of domestic violence. The message, which was posted via Neville’s long-standing Twitter handle @fizzer18 on 1 July 2011, reads: “Relax I’m back chilled – just battered the wife!!! Feel better now!” Another from the same account, and which was sent on 3 December 2012, reads: “U women of [sic] always wanted equality until it comes to paying the bills #hypocrites”. Neville deleted his Twitter account on Tuesday evening and has yet to confirm or deny he sent the tweets. In the 41-year-old’s defence, it is possible he deleted the account before setting up a new one to reflect his new role, for which he has signed a three-year deal. “I’m honoured to be given the chance to lead England,” said the former Manchester United and Everton player. “This squad’s on the verge of something special and I believe I can lead them to the next level.” Neville was confirmed as Mark Sampson’s successor shortly after arriving in La Manga in southern Spain on Tuesday where the squad, captained by Steph Houghton, are attending a winter training camp. “There’s no greater honour than representing your country and it will be a privilege to do it again,” he added. “I can’t wait to get down to work with an elite group of players at the top of their game.” Neville’s appointment is controversial for other reasons. While he holds the pro-licence qualification and has previously served as a coach under both David Moyes at Manchester United and his brother, Gary, at Valencia, as well as with the men’s England Under-21 team, he has never been a manager in his own right. Moreover he has no experience in the women’s game and did not apply for the job when it was advertised after Sampson’s dismissal on grounds of unacceptable behaviour with a player in a previous job. Since Sampson’s sacking in September the squad has been under the caretaker charge of Mo Marley. Another pro-licence holder, she decided she did not want the senior role long-term and will return to her previous post leading England’s development teams. By last month, the FA had compiled a three-person shortlist but, ultimately, none of the trio wanted the top job. While John Herdman, the favourite, moved from coaching Canada women to that country’s men, Nick Cushing remained at Manchester City and Laura Harvey, the former Arsenal and Seattle Reign coach, accepted a new post with Utah Royals. Under Sampson England reached the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup and the 2017 European Championship, as his team rose to No 3 and No 1 in the respective world and European rankings. Neville’s challenge is to lead the Lionesses to glory at next year’s World Cup in France. His first task will be to win the hearts and minds of a squad bruised by Sampson’s departure. The Welshman was found to have made two racially discriminatory comments to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence but most of England’s players remained extremely supportive of him. Baroness Sue Campbell, the FA director of women’s football, said: “We will build a brilliant team around Phil. His enthusiasm, passion and desire for the role impressed us all. Once he emerged as a candidate we knew we had the right person. We knew we needed a winner with innovative ideas who will fit in well with the dynamic setup we have at St George’s Park.” Neville will be thrown in at the deep end when England fly to the United States for the prestigious She Believes Cup in March, where they will face France, Germany and the US. After that comes a World Cup qualifier against Wales in Southampton in April. More immediately his appointment has provoked a mixed reaction. Katie Chapman, the former Chelsea and England midfielder, said: “Surely there must be coaches out there who’ve had experience in the women’s game, and of actually being a manager?” Rachel Brown-Finnis, a former England goalkeeper, disagreed. “He would inspire me,” she said. “He’s a great fit. This is a someone who has worked under Sir Alex Ferguson and has a winning mentality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jan/22/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/22/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/22/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. First, a lesson on mutability from reverendbow: I’ve just finished a yellowed paperback of The First Circle by Solzhenitsyn that I found in a second hand bookshop in Isleworth. As I read it, the sections I had just finished fell apart. In my imagination, the book had been stuck in the shop for decades waiting to be read and when it was picked out and fulfilled its destiny it expired in my hands. I know actually it was just a result of old paper, cheap glue and unexpected movement but it’s nice to dream. Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Full of real characters, struggle and pain but also moments of lightness and levity. It was only pointed out to me once I’d finished that I was reading the shortened version and the original version was translated fairly recently. Oh well. Next, a lesson in being open to literary experiences from HousmansEngland, who has enjoyed Jon McGregor’s Reservoir 13: I’d seen all the hype about this novel, of course, but decided it wasn’t for me. I changed my mind at the weekend, and gave it a go. I’m so glad I did! ... This is a closely-observed story of an entire village, an entire way of life. The story covers a decade of village life, showing the characters, and the countryside in which they live, going through their daily lives, showing how they change, how the years change them, and how they respond to the environment and each other. I found this a genuinely amazing book. The cool, distant narration has a power that draws the reader in, making you want to know what happens next. This is the first time in a long while that I was genuinely sorry to have finished reading a novel. And a few words on perseverance from Misstash16: I’m about halfway through John Crowley’s Little, Big. I started off being confused, then reached a place where I felt like I had a firm grasp on what was going on, and now I’m utterly lost again. So, I’ll just keep going I think. Elsewhere, dylan37 has enjoyed The Herald Tribune: The First Hundred Years by Charles Robertson: It’s a romping tale of fin de siècle rich playboys, sailing yachts across the Atlantic, two World Wars, American ex-pats in 1930s Paris drinking, screwing and writing, and changes to newspaper publishing and attitudes of (and to) the press. It’s a window on a lost world, like stepping past the palm fronds into one of those old world, gold and red cafés they still have in Paris. And Indrek Hargla’s Apothecary Melchior and the Ghost Of Rataskaevu Street has entertained safereturndoubtful: It is set in Tallinn in 1419 and is actually the second in a series (the first one was tremendous also). The murders take second stage to the wonderful backdrop of the city and the cast of characters. Crime is rare, which is no surprise with the pillories, torture of suspects and a variety of styles of public executions, and the taverns are well frequented. Melchior is in the role of sleuth, and often extends his questioning to his favourite pub, which happens in this story to be inside the Nunnery and apparently, has many fine ales. Hargla is by far the most famous current Estonian author. He also writes other fiction which is popular, but at present it is just these two books that have been translated. There are another four Melchior books which I hope will follow. I’m usually not one for series, but this is great fun. Finally, paulburns recommend’s Angela Carter’s superb final novel, Wise Children: Read Angela Carter’s Wise Children. A rambunctious epic of two theatrical families spanning the British music hall, Edwardian Shakespeare, the 1920s, 1930s Hollywood, WW2 and post war Britain. A shout of joy out to the world. Interesting links about books and reading The Millions 2018 book preview is here. A fine collection of Mickey Spillane pulp fiction covers. “You write whenever you’re not doing your real, proper job.” Ashleigh Young on (not) earning a living as a writer. HBO are making a version of Fahrenheit 451. Oh dear. If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

Staging the strange world of Macbeth","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Macbeth is full of things that must be seen to be believed. Consider the witches who “look not like th’inhabitants o’th’earth” and conjure magical, masque-like apparitions from bubbling cauldrons. There are other visions, too: the dead Banquo’s gory reappearance at dinner, glimpsed only by the man who commissioned his murder, and Lady Macbeth’s sleepwalk, when she is tormented by blood stains only she can see. The Elizabethan astrologer and healer Simon Forman, who caught Macbeth at the Globe a few years after it was written and reflected on it in his diary, was struck by “3 women feiries or Nimphes” and the moment when Macbeth stood “to drink a Carouse … [and] the ghost of Banco came and sate down in his cheier behind him”. Few visual moments are as strange as the scene at the beginning of act two, in which Macbeth sees a dagger floating in the air, apparently leading him to Duncan’s bedchamber. This hallucination provokes one of Shakespeare’s most famous speeches: “Is this a dagger which I see before me?” The scene is pivotal. It marks the moment where the conscience-stricken Macbeth has finally decided to murder his king. It also connects with perhaps the play’s biggest theme, the irresistible march of fate, in which the hero initiates all manner of horrors almost without intending to. But the weapon is puzzling, not only to Macbeth. Is it, as he says bemusedly, “a dagger of the mind, a false creation” or are we meant to think it is physically present, pointing the way to a murder that will be all too real? Is it, as critics have argued, a symbol of Macbeth’s faltering conscience or a demonic vision? Even more confusing is that there are technically two daggers in the scene – the imaginary one and the hero’s real one, which he pulls out on the lines “in form as palpable / As this which I now draw”, trying to test the apparition against reality. For this strangest of plays, the paradox is fitting: its best-known prop is almost certainly invisible. No fewer than three new British productions of the play open in the next few weeks – Adele Thomas’s staging at Bristol Tobacco Factory, Rufus Norris’s at the National Theatre, with Rory Kinnear in the lead; and the RSC’s version starring Christopher Eccleston. There’s also a dance-theatre adaptation by Mark Bruce at Wilton’s Music Hall in east London. The dagger scene is one of the Scottish play’s trickiest challenges. How will they all tackle it? In his diaries, Forman doesn’t offer much guidance – he fails to mention the scene. This might be a clue to how it was done during Shakespeare’s lifetime – with a powerful dose of imagination. Technical resources at the Globe were limited and scenery all but non-existent – beds or the odd chair might have been pulled on stage when appropriate, as well as small props such as candlesticks to denote night, because open-air performances generally took place in the afternoon. For the dagger scene, the likelihood is that Richard Burbage, Shakespeare’s first Macbeth, simply gazed into the middle distance and clawed at fresh air. After Oliver Cromwell’s ban on theatre was ended by the restoration of Charles II in 1660, many Shakespeare works were brought back into the repertoire. Macbeth was among them – but suffered the indignity of being turned into a musical, “alter’d” by the playwright William Davenant with music by Matthew Locke, plus what were advertised as flying witches (most likely accomplished with hi-tech stage machinery). There are few clear records of how the dagger scene was done, but in some productions a real weapon was apparently dangled on stage on a string, whisked out of sight as Macbeth lunged. The actor-manager David Garrick made a point of offering the play “as written by Shakespeare” when he began to perform Macbeth from 1744 onwards. A volatile stage presence, Garrick specialised in startling changes of emotion, and his dagger scene seems to have been a particular tour de force. The novelist Tobias Smollett described how the actor looked down, lost in brooding thought, before abruptly glancing up at “a dagger which he pretends to see above his head, as if the pavement was a looking glass that represented it by reflection”. One newspaper grumbled that it all took a “tedious length of time”, but the consensus was that Garrick did infinitely better than his hammy predecessor James Quin, who looked like he was trying to catch a fly rather than a murder weapon. Later Macbeths showed off some barnstorming acting. In the Victorian era, actor-manager Samuel Phelps strained every sinew “until the brainsick, bewildered imagination made [the invisible dagger] real”.The statuesque American star Edwin Forrest apparently rubbed his eyes in disbelief at the vision before him, before shrieking “in a frenzy of horror” when he described how “gouts of blood” were starting to stain the handle as well as the blade. The redoubtable Henry Irving’s Macbeth, upon realising the dagger wasn’t real, “stared and stared until his eyes seemed to be starting from his head, his face hardened, as if terror were turning him to stone”. Actors continue to find fresh possibilities in this most hackneyed piece of stage business. According to Kenneth Tynan, Laurence Olivier – who played Macbeth opposite his then wife, Vivien Leigh, in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1955 – offered a world-weary soldier’s response: “Far from recoiling … he greeted the air-drawn dagger with sad familiarity as a fixture in the crooked furniture of his brain.” At the same venue in 1967, Paul Scofield simply glanced towards two intersecting white lights, which made a cross- or dagger-like shape on stage. In the words of director Peter Hall, the moment portrayed “the tension between the imagining and the summoning up determination to do the murder”. Others have used sudden lighting changes or ominous music to hint that something unearthly is afoot, even if the dagger itself remains invisible. Most stage directors have been wary of distracting from the text – or their leading actors’ attempts to portray Macbeth’s distracted wits – but film-makers have been more imaginative. Roman Polanski’s 1971 film, starring Jon Finch, offered a hovering special-effects dagger that gleams green like something out of Game of Thrones. Michael Fassbender’s attempt in 2015, directed by Justin Kurzel, featured a scene in which the hero was handed a bloody knife by a mysterious teenage boy, possibly the ghost of his dead child. Performing the speech for the Guardian’s Shakespeare Solos series, Daniel Mays reached for fresh air before pulling out a kitchen knife. Some of the role’s finest interpreters have let Shakespeare’s words cast their own spell. A 1978 TV recording of Ian McKellen’s fevered, wild-eyed Thane, based on his RSC interpretation for Trevor Nunn two years earlier, offers a masterclass in suspenseful horror, the hero hoarsely whispering “I have thee not, and yet I see thee still” as if incanting a charm. Essaying the scene in 2007 (filmed two years later, again for TV), Patrick Stewart takes a different approach, yet it is every bit as chilling. “Come, let me clutch thee”, he coos, caressing an invisible dagger, before sighing “thou marshall’st me the way that I was going” with a shiver of surprised delight. It is as if this Macbeth is being led not on to murder, but something infinitely more seductive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/19/italians-asked-report-fake-news-police-run-up-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:56:15Z","webTitle":"Italians asked to report fake news to police in run-up to election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/italians-asked-report-fake-news-police-run-up-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/19/italians-asked-report-fake-news-police-run-up-election","fields":{"headline":"Italians asked to report fake news to police in run-up to election","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Italian government has launched an online service aimed at cracking down on fake news, which experts say has become an increasingly worrying phenomenon in the country. People can report what they think might be fake news via a “red button” system on the website of Italy’s postal police, the division that tackles online crime. A team has been set up to analyse the alerts and, using specialist software, identify the source of the news and establish whether the information was authentic or not. The move comes as Italy prepares for general elections on 4 March and in the wake of concerns from senior politicians that fake news could sway public opinion. The interior minister, Marco Minniti, said the initiative was not intended to interfere with the campaign. “It’s an entirely transparent and legitimate public service tool aimed at protecting citizens from clamorous and flagrantly unfounded news,” he said. “There is not even the slightest intention to enter the political debate.” Franco Gabrielli, the national police head, said the authorities were not creating a “big brother” but using mechanisms already in place to provide “a better, more professional and transparent” service. Michelangelo Coltelli, the founder of Butac, a website exposing cases of fake news, said the phenomenon was a big problem for Italy, with bogus reports appearing daily in newspapers, mostly as a result of journalists’ failure to check sources. “I don’t think [this initiative] is the best way to fight it,” he said. “We don’t know how exactly the police will verify what is fake and what is not. They said they will not interfere with politics, but most of the fake news, at least the stories we are worried about, are political. “What we need is for newspapers to be checking their sources – this would be a first step, as a lot of fake news appears in newspapers, not just on social networks.” The move comes almost a year after thousands of Italians signed a petition, led by Laura Boldrini, the president of the chamber of deputies, against fake news. Boldrini has been a persistent victim of online abuse and bogus news reports. Most recently, a story circulated rapidly online about a 22-year-old nephew of Boldrini’s, called Luca, being hired to work in a government office for €8,000 (£7,065) a month. Both the story and the relative were entirely made up. Concerns over fake news in Italy first mounted ahead of the former prime minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum on constitutional reform in December 2016. Some Renzi supporters claimed his opponents were behind a network of news sites that influenced the outcome of the vote, which led to Renzi’s resignation. In November, Renzi, who hopes to reclaim his old job in the elections, called on social networks including Facebook to help the country “have a clean electoral campaign”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/19/could-a-channel-bridge-be-bold-and-beautiful","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:52:02Z","webTitle":"Could a Channel bridge be as bold and beautiful as these marvels?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/19/could-a-channel-bridge-be-bold-and-beautiful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/19/could-a-channel-bridge-be-bold-and-beautiful","fields":{"headline":"Could a Channel bridge be as bold and beautiful as these marvels?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The clown king of novelty infrastructure fantasies has once again stolen the limelight with his preposterous plan for a 22-mile bridge across the Channel. As spending priorities go, Boris Johnson’s idea is madness. Most places outside the south-east UK languish with medieval infrastructure – and there’s also the fact that it’s the busiest shipping lane in the world. But none of this matters. In a world where Johnson got as far as flushing £37m of public money into the Thames on another fantasy project, the Garden Bridge, a great Channel crossing could easily be conjured into being. No doubt his go-to designer for overpriced public baubles, Thomas Heatherwick, has already rustled up a design. Could we be in line for another copper-clad fungal confection, sprouting up from the waters with a sprinkle of fairy dust and a streamlined procurement process. Perhaps it will be an ingenious contraption designed to roll back on itself to form a climbable sculpture of Joanna Lumley’s hair. Or might the lord of self-initiated mega-projects, Norman Foster, already be working on a scheme? He has form in coming up with seductive infrastructural visions for Johnson, having produced a compelling plan for “Boris Island”, a futuristic airport in the Thames Estuary connected by high-speed rail links and depicted in a permanent Blade Runner glow. That said, Foster’s Millau viaduct in France (designed, in a model of cross-Channel collaboration, with Frenchman Michel Virlogeux) is one of the most elegant long-span structures in the world, a piece of minimalist brilliance that hangs in the valley like a diaphanous spider’s web, giving you the feeling of floating in the clouds. Foster would no doubt concoct something equally refined to span la Manche – perhaps with a thrilling added wobble, like the one his Millennium Bridge had. Another likely candidate to bring a touch of ageing celebrity sparkle would be the world-renowned (and self-appointed) iconic bridge tsar, Santiago Calatrava. “I tell you, I have been involved in something like 50 projects in very different cities,” he said at a lecture in Dubai in 2016, presenting identikit white whalebone structures – and struggling to remember which cities some of them were in. For all the lazy stylistic repetition, however, it was hard not to be wowed by his spectacular proposal for Doha Bay. A series of bridges and tunnels that dip and dive out of the water like some writhing sea monster bearing down on the Qatari capital, such a creation could provide a template for getting around all those pesky boats in the Channel. It might take the entire EU annual budget to pay his fees, though. But for Johnson’s vanity projects, funding is never an obstacle. Having offered Emirates Airlines a permanent place on the London tube map in exchange for their part-funding of the empty cable car link across the Thames, surely he could wangle a similarly great deal for the Boris Bridge? Perhaps his chum Lakshmi Mittal could step in to donate some steel, as he did for the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower in the Olympic Park, another cunning wheeze that resulted in a structure that has cost the taxpayer up to £10,000 a week to maintain. Or might he look east? Boris’s address book is brimming with Chinese billionaires, including Xu Weiping, to whom he sold east London’s Royal Docks for £1bn, amid claims of a cosy relationship. China has, after all, become the world leader in long-span structures. Seven of the 10 longest bridges in the world are now in the country, from the 102-mile Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge in Jiangsu, to the stunning series of cable-stayed bridges and tunnels that will finally connect Hong Kong with Zhuhai and Macau later this year. And if the money runs out, it could always be turned into the world’s longest whiff-whaff table."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/20/italy-election-pd-follow-macron-pro-eu-playbook-sandro-gozi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Italy election: governing party to follow Macron's pro-EU playbook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/20/italy-election-pd-follow-macron-pro-eu-playbook-sandro-gozi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/20/italy-election-pd-follow-macron-pro-eu-playbook-sandro-gozi","fields":{"headline":"Italy election: governing party to follow Macron's pro-EU playbook","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The pro-European, anti-populist campaign of Emmanuel Macron will be the inspiration for Italy’s governing centre-left PD party’s pitch to voters in the upcoming general election, Sandro Gozi, Italy’s minister for Europe, has said. Gozi, a friend of Macron and close ally of the PD leader, Matteo Renzi, told the Guardian at the campaign launch in Milan on Friday: “The election is an Italian choice, but Europe will be issue number one in this general election, and its result affects everyone in Europe”. PD, riven by factions, is trailing the Five Star Movement (M5S) in the polls, and most people believe the 4 March vote is likely to produce a centre-right government, potentially including the former premier Silvio Berlusconi and the Northern League. Gozi said the party had “put things back on track” in the last year. “But continued progress will depend on the election. It is the last battle between pro-European open society versus anti European nationalistic closed society.” Gozi, who is fluent in French and English and was educated at the Sorbonne and LSE, sees himself as part of the “Erasmus generation”, a group of younger leaders who see the European Union not just as a bulwark against nationalist wars, but as a multiplier of sovereignty. He has also been at the centre of the argument that a stronger Europe can halt populism, rather than feed the alienation on which it thrives. “This has become the real new political cleavage in politics. It is now so obvious,” he said. “Are you confident that Italy can be a key actor in a new Europe capable of taking back control on immigration, security and achieving growth through reshaping the eurozone? Or do you believe the answer lies within our national borders?” He said his party faced three challenges in the election campaign: “To show that political solutions to the worries that are at the centre of Italian concerns – migration, security and growth – can only be solved in a European context. “To show there is a radical alternative to the anti-European Le Pen forces represented [in Italy] by Matteo Salvini’s Northern League and to Silvio Berlusconi who pretends to be an ally of the European People’s Party, but wants an alliance with Salvini. “Finally, throughout we have to show the courage and the audacity of Macron.” Gozi said that if PD is returned to power Italy can play a central role in pushing for the more integrated democratic eurozone promoted by Macron and Germany’s Social Democrats. He also wants the European parliamentary seats vacated by exiting British MEPs to be elected on a trans-European, rather than national basis, an idea that now has the support of France and Germany. He said his party has to make a deeper argument that institutional reforms. “Populism has been about a fear of loss of control either due to migration or terrorism. I am very sensitive to this issue, but these fears have been provoked by transnational phenomenon, so populists often give the wrong answer to the right question. The easiest, but worst, answer is to say ‘let us go back and simply control our national borders’.” Gozi acknowledged that the right’s progress in Italy has been fuelled by fears about migration, mainly from Libya, but said his country was left alone by the rest of Europe to fight for Europe’s dignity. “Italy’s immigration issue has not been the presence of Europe but the absence of Europe. There was a tragedy of European proportion and our European partners turned their back on this”. Europe, he said, had finally produced a balanced package by funding the Libyan coastguard, securing more humane detention centres, and aiding economic growth in Africa. “Even now there are countries that take all the burden of refugees – Sweden, Greece, Germany and Italy – and there are other countries – Poland and Hungary – that refuse to take a single refugee. That is unacceptable. You cannot be pro-European when you receive huge EU funds, and then nationalistic when you are asked to take 100 refugees. “So in future there must be a simple rule: no European funds to those European countries that violate their obligations of solidarity at a moment of crisis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/sunderland-hull-middlesbrough-championship-struggle-after-relegation","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T12:33:13Z","webTitle":"Sunderland, Hull and Middlesbrough struggle to adapt to life after relegation | Louise Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/sunderland-hull-middlesbrough-championship-struggle-after-relegation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/sunderland-hull-middlesbrough-championship-struggle-after-relegation","fields":{"headline":"Sunderland, Hull and Middlesbrough struggle to adapt to life after relegation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Middlesbrough’s owner, Steve Gibson, predicted his team were set to “smash the Championship,” and Hull City’s new manager Leonid Slutsky spoke of celebrating promotion by “singing, rapping and dancing”. Three hours’ drive up the road at Sunderland, Slutsky’s freshly-installed Sunderland counterpart, Simon Grayson, revealed his ambitions to manage “this great club” in the Premier League. Fast forward a little over half a season, and despite each being in receipt of £47m worth of parachute payments this term alone, the trio of sides relegated from the top tier last May have all changed manager. Although Tony Pulis, who replaced the sacked Garry Monk at Boro on Boxing Day, still harbours play-off ambitions, his new side currently sit a modest ninth. So much for a summer transfer market spending spree approaching £50m. Meanwhile Hull, now under Nigel Adkins’s charge, are 20th, four places above bottom-placed Sunderland, now managed by Chris Coleman. The pair meet at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. “This division is improving all the time,” says Ian Holloway whose QPR side entertain Boro on Saturday. “All the coaching and the coaches are improving. All the managers know how to stop you and your team; everyone’s got access to the same data, the same analytical tools.” Throw in the reality that, in terms of ability, there is very little between the majority of Championship players and it is easy to appreciate that, of the three sides relegated at the end of the 2015-16 campaign only Newcastle United – “coached by Rafael Benítez, the most illustrious coach to have managed at this level,” reflects Holloway – made an immediate return to the Premier League. Yet the problems endured by Norwich City and the currently resurgent Aston Villa had very different root causes to those besetting Boro, Hull and Sunderland. Boro’s have, broadly, been philosophical. Essentially, Monk’s attempt to rip up his predecessor Aitor Karanka’s ultra cautious, extremely defensive blueprint and replace it with a much more expansive approach backfired. Monk persistently talked of the difficulties of getting the balance right between attack and defence. “Change doesn’t happen overnight,” he said, the day before his dismissal. “It’s taken a bit longer than I’d hoped but the players I inherited had one system drilled into them every day for three years; it’s not easy to change the style.” Similarly radical change – albeit primarily of personnel – helped ruin things for the first Russian to manage in England. Previously in charge of CSKA Moscow and Russia, Slutsky arrived in East Yorkshire all smiles but departed a sullen figure dubbed a “broken man” by club insiders. Between June and 1 September he had overseen the departure of 16 members of Marco Silva’s old squad and signed 11 players for a collective £16m. The departees included key midfielder Sam Clucas, who joined Swansea for £15m, Harry Maguire, a talented defender who moved to Leicester for £17m and left-back Andy Robertson, an £8m Liverpool capture. Of the 28 players that started a Premier League fixture for Hull last season, only 11 remain on Humberside. Despite spending a decade in the Premier League, Sunderland had made so many transfer market mistakes and fallen into such deep debt that Grayson was only able to invest £1.25m on 10 new faces while offloading 15 senior professionals. Moreover he was left with some disaffected individuals, most notably centre half Lamine Koné and £13.6m record signing Didier Ndong. That pair are not the only ones who no longer want to be on Wearside. “When you take over a football club and you don’t have such good characters then it ain’t half hard,” said Holloway following QPR’s 1-1 draw at Sunderland in October. “It might be that the not good characters are on far too much money, aren’t your signings and aren’t happy at the club. I’m not saying Sunderland have those problems but without stability it’s very difficult.” Coleman, installed in November, has since spoken of the club requiring “a thorough cleansing” – and the perils of tackling a relegation “dogfight” with “kittens”. He is desperate to re-home Jack Rodwell, his unwanted £70,000-a-week midfielder, but unsurprisingly there are no takers. Boro possess some fine players, the £50,000-a-week defender Ben Gibson and the £15m striker Britt Assombalonga among them, but the psychological impact of relegation should not be underestimated. “I’ve been part of a relegated side [at Southampton] and there is a hangover, it can be difficult,” says the former Sunderland defender Danny Higginbotham. “Confidence dips. When a team gets relegated, it’s because they’ve lost a lot of games; it takes time to get that belief and resilience back. “Often, scoring the first goal is vital. When Boro have scored first they’ve tended to win but, after conceding first, confidence can be sapped. “Boro bought a lot of players last summer but there’s plenty in the dressing room who were there last season, and it’s not easy to recover and go again. Mentally, some players take time to get back to the level they need to be at.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/19/stalingrad-author-anthony-beevor-speaks-out-over-ukraine-book-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:10:46Z","webTitle":"Stalingrad author Antony Beevor speaks out over Ukraine book ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/19/stalingrad-author-anthony-beevor-speaks-out-over-ukraine-book-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/19/stalingrad-author-anthony-beevor-speaks-out-over-ukraine-book-ban","fields":{"headline":"Stalingrad author Antony Beevor speaks out over Ukraine book ban","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leading British historian Antony Beevor has described a Ukrainian ban on his award-winning book Stalingrad as “utterly outrageous”. The bestselling history, winner of the 1999 Samuel Johnson prize, tells of the battle for the Russian city during the second world war. A Russian translation was one of 25 titles included on a banned list issued by Ukrainian authorities last week, alongside books by authors including Boris Akunin and Boris Sokolov. In 2016, Ukraine passed a law that banned books imported from Russia if they contained “anti-Ukrainian” content, with an “expert council” assessing titles for such content. It is almost four years since Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, during which time around 10,000 people have died, and more than 1.7m have been displaced. Serhiy Oliyinyk, head of the Ukrainian Committee for State TV and Radio Broadcasting’s licensing and distribution control department, told Radio Free Europe (RFE) that the ban was imposed because of a passage that details how 90 Jewish children were shot by Ukrainian militia “to save the feelings of the Sonderkommando”, the work units made up of the Nazis’ death camp prisoners. “It’s a provocation,” he told RFE. “When we checked the sources he used, we found out he used reports of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs. It was enough to discuss the issue at expert council and we are happy they supported us.” But Beevor said the source was not an internal Soviet document, but a book by the anti-Nazi German officer Helmuth Groscurth. The book is noted as a source in Stalingrad, and the quotes attributed to Groscurth are sourced to it. Beevor also pointed to a harrowing but corroborating description of the incident in the the 1988 collection of firsthand recollections The Good Old Days: The Holocaust As Seen By Its Perpetrators and Bystanders. “It’s utterly outrageous. They have no reason for doing it. It’s quite clear both in the Russian edition and English edition what the source was and where it came from – this rather brave and religious officer [Groscurth] who protested strongly, despite threats he would be reported to Himmler … about this massacre of the children. There’s no way the Soviets would even have known about it,” said Beevor. Beevor has written to the British embassy in Kiev about the ban, which he intends to protest. In the letter, Beevor says Oliyinyk’s “statement implying that I repeated anti-Ukrainian propaganda from Russian sources is totally untrue” and explains how he sourced the incident from the account in Groscurth’s Tagebücher eines Abwehroffiziers, published in Stuttgart in 1970. “Groscurth was so shocked by what he had discovered that he wrote to his wife: ‘We cannot and should not be allowed to win this war’,” writes Beevor. “I am demanding an immediate apology from Oliyinyk and a reversal of the decision to impound the book by the ‘expert council’.” Halya Coynash from the Kharkiv Human Rights Group described the ban as baffling. On the group’s website, she wrote: “One might suspect the reports were fake news aimed at discrediting Ukraine had the announcement not been posted on the committee’s official website.” Ukrainian translator Steve Komarnyckyj said that the Russian translation of the book showed “significant differences” to Beevor’s English. “The original English text refers to ‘two police battalions’ having participated in the massacre at Babi Yar but the translation refers to ‘two battalions of Ukrainian nationalists’,” he said, noting a second instance where a reference to Ukrainian militia was to changed to “nationalists”. “The publisher needs to revise the translation so that these words are rendered into Russian more precisely, and a thorough proofreading of the translation against the original is required. The possibly mistaken impression could be created that the text was manipulated with political intent. The publisher may wish to explain how these variations arose or attempt to justify them in order to dispel any possible misunderstanding.” Beevor said the ban is “pretty depressing from point of view of Ukraine itself – they want to show themselves as being so much more democratic than Russians to the north and then they’re doing this”. But he said that the topic was “very close to the bone” for the Ukrainians. “Of course, during the second world war, many Ukrainians who suffered desperately during the famines … were thoroughly anti-Soviet and that’s why so many of them welcomed the Germans when they arrived and even volunteered to serve with the Germans. That’s still desperately embarrassing for Ukrainian nationalism today. So this is one reason obviously why they are so sensitive and raw-nerved about the whole thing,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/why-womens-refuges-cant-afford-more-cuts-life-death","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T17:53:48Z","webTitle":"‘​I’d have gone back to him’: why women’s refuges can’t afford more cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/why-womens-refuges-cant-afford-more-cuts-life-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/22/why-womens-refuges-cant-afford-more-cuts-life-death","fields":{"headline":"‘​I’d have gone back to him’: why women’s refuges can’t afford more cuts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fifteen years ago, when Lynn fled her abusive partner with her six-month-old baby, she was housed in a homeless shelter because there was no space at a women’s refuge. When she arrived, staff asked her where her possessions were, allotted her a single knife, fork and spoon and begrudgingly dragged a dirty cot out of the garage. The cot was crawling with spiders and riddled with their eggs. Crying, Lynn taped bin bags over the infested mattress to lay her child down. But she was lucky. Ten days later, a space at a women’s refuge became available. The first question she asked on arrival was: “I don’t suppose you’ve got any sanitary towels?” Lynn’s partner was well-off, but he had complete control over her finances and she had left with nothing. Refuge staff provided her with essential items. They helped her apply for benefits. They found her a GP and arranged for a health visitor to see her baby. When she had to leave the security of the refuge to attend a solicitor’s appointment, somebody went with her. In the 11 weeks she waited for her benefits to start, they loaned her cash for supplies for her baby and fetched her surplus food from a local supermarket. “They took it all: the tears; the temper tantrums; the ins and outs of our lives – we downloaded on to them every day,” she says. “It goes way beyond just the accommodation. It’s the support that actually makes most of the difference.” What would Lynn have done if a refuge place hadn’t become available? She doesn’t hesitate: “I’d have gone back.” Today, Lynn’s story might have been different. Jen recently fled her partner after he raped and abused her, but there was no refuge space available for her, despite the fact she was at high risk and had two young children. When she applied to the council, “they gave me a form and said they wouldn’t consider us homeless unless we could prove it”, she says. But it hadn’t been safe to salvage anything when she had left. “My children didn’t even have shoes on their feet. We were literally running for our lives.” Without identity documents or bank statements, she was left in limbo. Eventually, with the help of an independent domestic violence adviser from Women’s Aid and a crime reference number from the police, a different council placed Jen and her children in a mixed-sex hostel. She describes the place as “squalid, horrific and traumatising”. There were rats and mice. The front door had no lock and was open 24 hours a day. More often than not, there was only cold water. And, perhaps worst of all, there “seemed no vetting process of who it was appropriate to house with who. So there were lots of men walking around with tags and obvious alcohol or substance abuse issues.” Given the prevalence of domestic violence, Jen was painfully aware that it was highly likely she might be living with men who had themselves been perpetrators. “We were intimidated and threatened,” she says. “It’s incredibly traumatising and absolutely impossible to recover in that situation. I frequently thought that I would be better off returning to my abuser, because at least that abuse was predictable. At least I’d be able to cook for my children and wash their clothes. At least they would have beds.” Summoning extraordinary strength, Jen started a campaign to expose the horrendous conditions in the mixed hostel. As a result, she was placed in a women’s hostel, where living standards were considerably better, but no specialist support was available. Dependent on food banks, still recovering from physical and mental trauma, and with no access to money, she repeatedly reapplied to a refuge, but there were simply no spaces available. Eventually, she was awarded a small one-bedroom flat out of the borough, away from her support network and what services she had managed to access. The single bedroom was just big enough for a bunk bed for her children, so she slept on the sofa, in a room so damp that she had to paint the walls six times to cover the mould. After the ceiling collapsed and the council refused to take responsibility for the state of the flat, Jen found herself sofa surfing once more, her children in tow. “I don’t feel like any of those places housed us,” she says. “I feel like I’ve been homeless for more than two years. It puts me at enormous risk of being exploited by someone else, because I’m desperate to get stability for myself or my children.” Jen’s experience is a window into the crisis facing the women’s sector. The government has made a great fanfare of its upcoming domestic abuse bill, which will provide much-needed progress on ratification of the Istanbul convention, a groundbreaking legal framework for ending violence against women and girls. The bill promises to extend prosecution of crimes committed overseas, with extraterritorial jurisdiction to bring to justice men who carry out crimes such as domestic abuse, forced marriage and so-called “honour” killings abroad. But separate government proposals have recently emerged that would remove the funding for short-term supported housing from the welfare system, which could have a devastating impact. It would mean women fleeing abusive partners will not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit, which makes up 53% of funding for refuges. Women’s Aid has warned that if the proposed changes go ahead, four in 10 refuges will have to close their doors for good. Chief executive Katie Ghose says: “The aims of this welcome legislation risk being completely undermined by the proposals around refuge funding. [Over the past few decades] funding has been squeezed and has become more short-term, patchy and variable. It’s less of a postcode lottery and now an actual lottery when it comes to the support on hand for survivors. It’s a huge burden for these life-saving services to be scrabbling around for pennies when they want to be spending every minute of their time with survivors and children, helping them to move on and rebuild their lives.” According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, local authorities across England have cut their spending on domestic violence refuges by nearly a quarter since 2010. As the government devolves responsibility for funding to local authorities, women’s refuges providing specialist care, in particular those catering for BAME women and survivors with complex needs, find themselves at risk of closure, competing for funding against cheaper, generic providers such as housing associations. According to Women’s Aid, 17% of specialist women’s refuges were forced to close between 2010 and 2014. Yet the difference in the support provided to survivors is enormous, as Lynn and Jen discovered. Accommodating varied and complicated needs is essential in the struggle against domestic violence. As Mirela Sula recently reported in this paper, “migrant women, women of colour and women with low incomes are often at higher risk of domestic abuse”, yet they are often less likely to seek or receive support. Meanwhile, domestic violence is particularly likely to start or worsen during pregnancy, with one-fifth of women in the charity Refuge’s services either pregnant or having recently given birth. So the specialist support refuges provide is not an optional add-on but an absolute necessity. Clare Phillipson, the director of Wearside Women in Need Women’s Aid refuge in Sunderland, describes a desperate fight for survival. Her team has already had to close one refuge and axe a drop-in and outreach service, despite demand for their services increasing exponentially. If the proposed funding changes go ahead, she says it would obliterate 90% of the services they provide. “People die if they don’t get safety and support. They are murdered. Others are seriously harmed and hurt. People commit suicide, children are left traumatised for life. You’re juggling all that and trying desperately to prioritise, while at the same time wondering whether you’ll have a service in a month’s time. Is that cheque going to come in? Will that funding come through?” On Tuesday, Women’s Aid will hand a petition to 10 Downing Street calling on the government to urgently reconsider its proposed funding changes. The decision is literally a matter of life and death. “The murder of women; the abuse of women; the terrorising of children: it’s so entrenched in the fabric of our culture that it’s not seen as exceptional,” Phillipson says. “And women who are experiencing it are blamed. Refuges are seen as disposable and not vital services. Tell that to the woman at 2am who has run from her house in her pyjamas with her children and knows that they’ll die if she doesn’t get them to safety. You tell her that refuges don’t matter.” The names of the women have been changed to protect their anonymity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/20/amazon-worker-warehouse","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T06:30:44Z","webTitle":"The Amazon worker: paid £18,000 a year to shift 250 items an hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/20/amazon-worker-warehouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/20/amazon-worker-warehouse","fields":{"headline":"The Amazon worker: paid £18,000 a year to shift 250 items an hour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If I’ve learned anything from doing this job, it’s that money can’t replace time. I work four nights a week in an Amazon warehouse near my home in Southend-on-Sea. It’s quite a cold place to work and, apart from two half-hour meal breaks, I’m on my feet for 10 and a half hours. I scan the items the trucks bring in from distributors and place them into the right cart for the robots to take to the correct place in the warehouse. I have to put away each item in 15 seconds or less, and get through 250 in an hour, or I’ll be given a warning by a manager. Stepping away from my station to, say, get a drink of water can have a big impact on my performance. During my half-hour breaks I rush downstairs to have something to eat. It’s stressful – and it definitely affects my health, standing up for hours on end. I worry I may pass out if I don’t rest during my meal breaks. I’ve lost a lot of weight since I started. I live with my parents, and pay them £50 a week for rent and food. I also spend £50 a week travelling to work. Apart from that, I don’t spend much on anything. That means two-thirds of the money I take home every month – about £1,000 – just sits in my bank account. It’s weird, but it’s like money’s become almost meaningless. Before I took this job, I used to spend money doing things with friends, but now I work such anti-social hours, it’s difficult to meet up. I feel like I’ve lost who I was. I end up spending most of my time off trying to sleep. The shifts I have to work never change, so I don’t like to reset my sleeping pattern when I’m not working. During the week I get so focused on work, it’s hard to switch off. I’ll lie in bed for hours, trying to drift off. Sometimes, I only get four hours’ sleep between shifts. My hobbies are painting Japanese Gundam models and playing computer games online, so occasionally I’ll spend about £50 on a new model kit or a new video game. But I haven’t wanted, recently, to do those things. Plus, seeing all the different items people buy from Amazon actually puts me off buying stuff. After you’ve handled something 200 times, somehow you no longer want it. When Jamie Oliver brings a new bestseller out, I curse him. Because I’m asleep when my parents get home from work and vice versa, I don’t get to see them much during the week. I’ve never been a social butterfly but recently there have been moments when, suddenly, I need more interaction with other people. The only time I speak to a human being at work is when a manager comes to check my progress or when a problem solver comes to fix something. My main interaction is with the robots. I applied for the job through the jobcentre. I’ve thought about quitting, but I can’t leave of my own accord. If I did, I’d be sanctioned by the jobcentre and lose my entitlement for benefits and support for six months. I don’t have much choice but to carry on working there. Unless I can find a new job, I’m locked into place.

I’m afraid not","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Are doomed bridge ideas cheaper by the dozen? The question arises after infrastructure dilettante Boris Johnson called for a second bazillion-pound bridge, this time stretching between reality and the sunlit uplands of Brexit. Forgive me – between and the UK and France, which may well amount to the same thing. Or, as Boris puts it: “Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections.” Don’t set too much store by that “our”. The thing to remember about Boris Johnson, with apologies to Simon and Garfunkel, is that he’s not on your side when things get rough. He’s not even on your side when things are great, unless your side happens to be the thing that’s best for him. The only circumstance in which Boris might lay him down over troubled water would be if he fancied a bunk-up with the water. Perfectly possible: he likes troubled things. Mostly, though, the foreign secretary imagines headline ideas to be a substitute for actual ideas, and is drawn to flashy projects that in popular parlance might come to bear his name: Boris Bridge, Boris Bikes, Boris Island … Alas, Boris is such a terminal ironist that even things he really means sound like wordplay – clever metaphors that only the plodding would take literally. Do keep up, is his chief rhetorical message to the left behind. Plenty of Donald Trump supporters claim the wall was always a metaphor; plenty of Boris supporters will suspect this bridge is one too. After all, Johnson is a chap who would much rather Send A Message than process a cargo. The latter is for boring little people whose parochial concerns are embodied in the highly restrained tweet of the Dover MP. “Boris is right – we must invest in infrastructure,” this ran. “Let’s start by dualling the A2 to Dover, building the Lower Thames Crossing, and lorry parks on the M20.” Boris’s Widened A2? Boris’s Lorry Park? Pretty sure none of those have the ring he desires. If Boris talked to any ordinary Conservatives out in the heartlands and all the places that voted for his Brexit, he might be shocked to discover that their chief reaction to stories like this is to wonder why there could be money for such a thing but not for the NHS. The Tories are entering a stage of their journey in government that has proved an endgame before: every voter is rubbing up against the realities of an underfunded NHS, or is close to someone who is. Thus every single thing the government even notionally talks about spending even notional money on that isn’t the NHS had better offer some immediately clear benefit. The £350m red bus was such an appealing message for a reason. Ultimately, though, the bridge should remind us how feverishly Boris Johnson is still searching for the thing that is going to define him as great. When oh when, he wonders, is he going to finally transform into Winston Churchill? If you haven’t read his Churchill book, it is hugely recommended as a psychiatric document – for all the horrifying and hilarious things it unwittingly reveals about its author. I can never believe his therapist let him publish it. By the end, it’s quite clear that you have not read Churchill’s story so much as Boris’s attempt to get you to see anything he might have done, or might ever do, as Churchillian. All politicians are self-interested gamblers with events, Johnson explains, and Churchill “put his shirt on a horse called anti-Nazism … his bet came off in spectacular fashion”. Mmmm. It probably helps to imagine Churchill spending a Sunday morning writing two columns – the first advocating resisting Hitler, the second making the case for supporting totalitarian conquest of Europe and the elimination of Jews. Inevitably, then, the major unresolved dilemma of the work is Johnson’s search for his own war. He obviously takes comfort in the slightness of Churchill’s prewar speeches: “Where was the feeling, where was the truth, where was the authenticity?” The reader is constantly sledgehammered by the intimation that just because someone is known for bandying around Latin zingers and bellowing things like “We sell French knickers to the French, sparkling wine to the Italians!”, it doesn’t mean he isn’t going to step up and into history at Britain’s moment of destiny. The terrible irony for Boris Johnson, of course, is that the moment of national destiny is already here. And it is a project that really does deserve to bear his name. Boris’s Brexit is upon us – we are living through the phoney war, and the real business will be unleashed soon enough. Cometh the hour, cometh … oh dear. Cometh a well-briefed report in the Sun this week, in which friends of Johnson said he would “rather stay in” the EU than accept a soft Brexit. What can you say? Other than: “Friends of Winston Churchill said if he couldn’t have No 10, then no one could.” • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/19/smart-meters-first-generation-hinder-switching-rolled-out","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:29:45Z","webTitle":"1m more smart meters which hinder switching could be rolled out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/19/smart-meters-first-generation-hinder-switching-rolled-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/19/smart-meters-first-generation-hinder-switching-rolled-out","fields":{"headline":"1m more smart meters which hinder switching could be rolled out","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 1m extra first generation smart meters will be fitted in homes because the government has extended a deadline for their installation, despite the devices being criticised because they can “go dumb” when customers switch energy suppliers. Ministers set a target of the end of 2020 for every home to be offered one of the meters, which automate readings and display real-time energy use in pounds and pence. So far 8.6m first generation, or SMETS1, meters have been installed. This year is meant to herald the first big push to roll out more advanced SMETS2 meters, which do not have the interoperability problems of the older ones. But in a private letter to energy companies on Thursday, the government said systems designed to handle the newer meters were not ready, and so it was moving back a cutoff date for the older model by three months. The reputation of smart metering could be harmed if problems with the meters were not ironed out, an energy official warned. The extension moves the deadline from July to October and will lead to hundreds of thousands of people receiving the older devices, which can lose their ability to send readings after consumers switch supplier. Smart meters were installed at an average rate of 363,000 per month for the first nine months of 2017, suggesting at least 1.08m extra will be installed as a result of the extension. The actual figure is likely to be higher as the installation rate is accelerating. Bulb, the energy supplier, projects up to 1.7m SMETS1 will be fitted because of the rule change. The older meters’ interoperability problems are expected, but not guaranteed, to be fixed by October. The government announced in December that in some circumstances energy suppliers could be permitted to install the first generation meters for a further six months, meaning they could still be going into homes until spring 2019. Hayden Wood, the co-founder of Bulb, which will use only SMETS2 models, said: “It’s disappointing that ministers are letting energy companies continue to install inferior, first generation smart meters for another three months.” Neither the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, nor Smart Energy GB, the body set up to promote smart meters, have been able to tell the Guardian how many SMETS2 meters have been installed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/19/sam-simmonds-england-exeter-chiefs-interview-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"Sam Simmonds: ‘England?

I didn’t imagine it even a couple of years ago’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"By his own admission Sam Simmonds does not much enjoy big cities. In his home town of Teignmouth the nearest thing to rush-hour chaos is a bit of traffic on the bridge across the estuary to picturesque Shaldon. The last time he ventured into central London with his Exeter team-mate Henry Slade things did not go well: “We took the tube but we didn’t have a clue where we were going. We got off a couple of times and jumped back on what we thought was the right train, only to discover it wasn’t. I guess I like the simpleness of Devon.” Even on a chilly January midweek afternoon this is a man far more at ease on his windswept local beach than he will ever be in Europe’s bustling capitals. His Exeter team-mate Jack Yeandle still remembers driving a scrawny ginger-haired academy kid up to Sandy Park for training and failing to extract a single word from him. “Stone-cold silence, bless him,” recalls the Chiefs captain. “Nerves I think it was. There was a lot less timber on his frame as well. Eddie Jones wants him to put muscle on top of muscle now but there was only skin and bones then.” No one, least of all Yeandle, imagined the skinny youth from a small coastal town would be England’s starting No 8 within five years. Barely a year ago he was still playing for the Cornish Pirates and had yet to make his Premiership debut. Now he is a capped England international, a dynamic low-slung presence in line to fill Billy Vunipola’s massive boots against Italy in a fortnight’s time. Not since Teignmouth’s other favourite sons, the rock band Muse, returned for a special homecoming gig has there been such intense local pride. The near-vertical ascent of the 23-year-old, whose brother Joe also plays for Chiefs, also reveals a couple of other things. Firstly there is plenty of rugby talent lurking out in the more distant corners of England. Secondly it shows how far determination, hard work, good club coaching and a bit of luck can take you. The teenager who joined Exeter was 90kg and still occasionally playing in the centre. Before his side’s pivotal Champions’ Cup pool game in Glasgow, the back-rower now tips the scales at 16 stone which he believes is his ideal playing weight. It will still not silence Eddie Jones’s familiar refrain – “What are you weighing?” – when Simmonds reports to England’s pre-Six Nations training camp in Portugal. Vunipola is around four stone heavier and leaves an extra large hole. Hence Jones’s recurring foodie conversations. “He wants me to get bigger, doesn’t he? Before I went away to England my knowledge of nutrition wasn’t great. I was eating the right stuff but I wasn’t eating enough of it. On a normal day I’d have breakfast but wouldn’t eat again until lunch. I’d come in, train and find I’d lost a bit of weight. Now I’m having snacks in between.” At least not-so-big Sam knows dinner will be fresh. His rugby-loving father David and uncle Rob are in the crab and lobster fishing business and when the pots are full their families tend to benefit. “Whenever I go to my dad’s he’s always got crab, lobster, almost any type of shellfish going. It’s a bonus, isn’t it?” His mother Nicola works as a hairdresser but the days of her cutting his hair – “I’ve given her the boot” – have now gone. So, too, have the days of rugged lower league rugby on loan at Brixham, Plymouth Albion and the Pirates against big, tough men with a taste for pint-sized flankers. “You do play some older heads who have dropped down a league or two. I remember my first year playing for Plymouth. I was 18 or 19, pretty fresh and we were up against some big boys.” His rare pace enabled him to survive and a long-term knee injury also gave him the extra motivation to lift sufficient tin in the gym to earn promotion at Chiefs. Subsequent events have been startling: the winning try in last year’s memorable play-off semi-final win over Saracens, a Premiership champions’ medal and, now, England recognition. “I didn’t imagine it happening even a couple of years ago,” says Simmonds. “I’ve spoken to boys who have said ‘I always knew I was going to play international rugby’. To be honest my focus was just to push through and play Premiership rugby.” Now, in terms of Premiership defenders beaten this season, he is the league’s top-ranked forward. Which is why his club director of rugby, Rob Baxter, believes England should play to Simmonds’ strengths. “The number on his back and where he packs down in the scrum is almost irrelevant. It’s about what freedom and role he’s given. If he’s going to be the guy they want to get on the ball plenty of times he’s going to have a lot of effect. If they want him to get off scrums and be first to arrive at rucks and tackles – well, he’s very effective at that but you’re not going to see much of his natural ball-carrying ability.” As Glasgow will discover on Saturday, Simmons is also not too bothered who he is facing. He felt like a fish out of water initially with England – “it was quite daunting” – but that phase has passed. “The more I’ve played you realise it doesn’t matter who you come up against. It’s about how you perform as an individual and as a team. You see that with Exeter. You could be playing a team of superstars but if we get everything right – physically, tactically, emotionally – I feel we can beat anyone.” That just happens to be the same mindset England want to develop. Baxter also suspects a good game against Italy – “If you start the tournament well in a winning side it gets pretty hard to change that squad” – will cement Simmonds’ position for the whole Six Nations. Devon may forever be Simmonds’ natural habitat but now is the moment to dazzle the city boys. “It’s never good for anyone to get injured but it does open up opportunities for me and others. As a kid I remember watching England singing the national anthem. It’s pretty surreal to be there doing it yourself.” As long as he avoids travelling by tube he should be fine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/19/downs-syndrome-test-condition-disappear-c-of-e-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:28:36Z","webTitle":"Down's syndrome test could see condition disappear, C of E warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/19/downs-syndrome-test-condition-disappear-c-of-e-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/19/downs-syndrome-test-condition-disappear-c-of-e-warns","fields":{"headline":"Down's syndrome test could see condition disappear, C of E warns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A new advanced test for Down’s syndrome to be offered to pregnant women this year raises the prospect of people with the condition disappearing from UK society as terminations are expected to rise, the Church of England has warned. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), a safer form of screening, is to be rolled out by the NHS this year. It will be offered to about 10,000 women a year who are considered to have a higher likelihood of giving birth to a baby with Down’s syndrome or two less common genetic conditions, Edwards’ and Patau’s syndromes. The church welcomes the technological advances in prenatal screening, but warns that NIPT is likely to lead to more terminations. It points to countries such as Iceland and Denmark, which have almost universal screening and close to 100% abortion rates of foetuses with Down’s syndrome. “There is a real possibility that people with Down’s syndrome will in effect disappear from their populations,” the church says in a report, Valuing People with Down’s Syndrome (pdf). A BBC documentary, A World Without Down’s Syndrome? made in 2016 by the actor Sally Phillips, whose son Olly has the condition, argued against the introduction of NIPT. But others have said women who decide on termination should not be made to feel guilty. NIPT involves a blood test with no risk of miscarriage, unlike amniocentesis, the most common current invasive procedure, which has a 1% risk of ending the pregnancy. Test results have shown NIPT to be 99% accurate. About 750 babies are born with Down’s syndrome in England and Wales each year, and a total of about 40,000 people have Down’s syndrome in the UK, or 0.06% of the population. People with Down’s syndrome now experience greater social inclusion, and many lead independent or semi-independent lives, the church says. Life expectancy is about 60, compared with nine in 1929, and 25 in 1970. “Great strides have been made in recent decades to redress historic neglect,” says the C of E. It also points to a rise in abortions: in 2010, 482 pregnancies with a foetus with Down’s syndrome were terminated, a figure that rose to 706 in 2016 despite an overall decrease in abortions, said Brendan McCarthy, the C of E’s adviser on medical ethics. The church opposes abortion on principle, but recognises there are circumstances in which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative. “The C of E is not in the business of telling women what to do,” said McCarthy. “We wouldn’t want to give the impression that anyone given a diagnosis of foetal disability is not facing very difficult decisions, involving deep thought, turmoil and agony. We just want to make sure that whatever choice is arrived at, it’s a free and fully informed choice.” The church wants to ensure that health professionals do not present a diagnosis of Down’s syndrome as bad news or initiate discussions about possible termination. It wants information reflecting the improving realities and potential for people with Down’s syndrome, and about support available, to be given to prospective parents. A motion to be debated at the C of E’s General Synod next month calls on the government and professional bodies to ensure that “parents who have been told that their unborn child has Down’s syndrome will be given comprehensive, unbiased information”. The church is also raising concerns about commercial firms offering NIPT without the counselling offered by the NHS. Some advertise NIPT testing kits online. “We need to look at the regulation of NIPT,” said McCarthy. “It’s difficult to say [to people with Down’s syndrome] that we will continue to value you if people like you are going to disappear. While it’s always a woman’s choice what to do, we hope that with full information significant numbers of women will continue with their pregnancy and that will allow society to celebrate people with Down’s syndrome.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/20/britain-foodie-nation-angela-hartnett-european-cuisine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Yes, we love ready meals – but Britain is still a foodie nation | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/20/britain-foodie-nation-angela-hartnett-european-cuisine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/20/britain-foodie-nation-angela-hartnett-european-cuisine","fields":{"headline":"Yes, we love ready meals – but Britain is still a foodie nation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There can surely never have been a time in Britain when food was more various, more savoured, more discussed, more enthused over or condemned, more written about, more watched on television. Never before – even when classical statues made of sugar were the centrepieces of Renaissance feasts, or bad acting was rewarded with rotten cabbages – has it provided so much entertainment as well as sustenance. Who, seated forlornly before a stale fruit scone in an ABC tearoom in the 1950s, could have imagined London’s present status as the eating-out capital of the world? Which of us could have imagined that a cake-making competition would be watched by a quarter of the British population in 2016? In a nation that since the early Victorian period has been ritually mocked for its poor food, developments such as these suggest a transformation in our attitudes to cooking and eating, sometimes to the point of sickening reverence. But is it no more than froth? Here to spoil our self-satisfaction is the chef and restaurateur Angela Hartnett, who on Sunday’s edition of Desert Islands Discs contested the idea that Britain was a “foodie nation” that has a “food culture”. “I genuinely don’t think we do,” she said. “I don’t think we’re like the Italians or the Spanish … our food culture is about money. People who have money can afford good food in this country.” She told her interviewer, Kirsty Young, that it was wrong to patronise people on low incomes by telling them they had to have organic chicken, and mentioned her Italian grandmother, who taught her how to make and stuff pasta, and inspired her interest in cooking. Hartnett’s words made a story in the newspapers, and yet – like sentences in many unrehearsed and unguarded interviews – their precise meaning wasn’t too clear. Many, perhaps most, of us have expressed similar feelings at one time or other. For example, that it’s wrong as well as useless for do-gooders to tell the poor what to eat (the case was vigorously made by Orwell in the 1930s). Or that food in Britain divides, in Kirsty Young’s phrase, into “two tiers” – and that eating well, to judge from the publicity that attaches to chefs and their restaurants, really does come down to money (an idea that has done the Michelin-starred Hartnett, who cooked at the Connaught Hotel in Mayfair before opening her own restaurants, no harm). Or, finally, that other European societies are naturally, almost mystically, connected to their food in a way that the British can never be (see Hartnett’s granny). The last carries an implication: that food in these countries is better understood because, generation after generation, people have learned to cook locally grown produce at their mother’s knee. This idea of permanence and continuity, however, is often false. Was Hartnett’s grandmother cooking the same food, in the same way, as her own grandmother had done? Possibly not. “What is known today as Italian food is a recent creation … and bears little resemblance to the abstemious and even inadequate diet endured by much of the population in the 19th and 20th centuries,” writes Carol Helstosky in Garlic &amp; Oil, her revealing account of food and politics in Italy. That country’s rocky terrain and uneven soil meant wheat was hard to grow; its price made white bread a sign of gentility and wealth. Peasants and industrial workers subsisted on rough bread and polenta made from rye, chestnut and cornflour, usually garnished with some combination of oil, peppers, onions, garlic, sardines and anchovies. Pasta, cheese and fresh vegetables were less common. Wine was watered, meat confined to the most special occasions. Only when the state intervened, in the first world war, to subsidise cheap wheat imports did this diet begin to change. Hartnett’s granny and my mother (born 1907) were probably around the same age, and witnesses therefore to a similar widening in food choice over their lifetimes. By 1960, our household menu must have seemed cornucopian to a woman raised in a Fife mining village 50 years before. A random list of the food set before my adolescent self includes lentil soup, beef mince, steak baked between plates, haddock fried in breadcrumbs, liver and onions, potted meat, black pudding, brassicas, boiled root vegetables, chips, toasted cheese and salads. Out of tins came spaghetti, beans, salmon, sardines, Spam, corned beef, peas, mandarin oranges and peaches. From the oven were brought forth lemon meringue pies, steak pies, potato pies, shepherd’s pies, apple crumbles, fruit slices (awarded prizes by the Scottish Women’s Rural Institute) and, on Sundays, jam sponge. In the larder little jars, almost fit for a doll’s house, held meat paste. A working-class Italian of the same generation would surely have marvelled at such an eclectic menu, so rich in sugar and animal fat, and apparently so loosely tethered to the simpler meals of my mother’s Scottish ancestors, with their stress on oatmeal, herring and cheese. But how were we to know, as we forked up our baked beans on toast, that this disconnect went all the way back to the enclosure acts, which by turning peasants into landless workers began to wipe out England’s rural cuisine? Then the industrial revolution got going, country people moved to squalid towns, and the memories and skills of traditional cooking further shrank. Britain embraced the new and the bland: canning, packaging and freezing, and a fear of any flavour that was judged too strong. By the time Victoria died, these and other factors had combined, in the words of the food historian Colin Spencer, “to wreak their havoc upon the British kitchen, without the British people being quite aware of what had happened”. This amnesiac tendency still survives – arguably the convenience foods of the past few decades have only increased it – which is presumably why Hartnett can say that Britain has no meaningful culture of food. Certainly, the story in Italy is different. Italy was poorer, and by the time it grew richer, in the 1950s, it had developed a defensive pride in its cooking that kept other cuisines and Anglo-American temptation at bay. But to make a binary division of British attitudes to food, the Connaught on the one hand and the microwave (and the food bank) on the other, is far too crude. Multitudes of people, many of them not especially prosperous, pay much more attention to food than ever before. You can see it in the restaurant districts of Glasgow and Manchester as well as London, and in home-cooked food everywhere. It may be essentially middle class, but then so is the theatre, the literary novel and the audience for Desert Island Discs. And should we decide that Britain has no culture of literature because too few people read books? • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/letters-nhs-is-suffering-because-it-has-become-a-political-football","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"The NHS is suffering because it has become a political football | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/letters-nhs-is-suffering-because-it-has-become-a-political-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/letters-nhs-is-suffering-because-it-has-become-a-political-football","fields":{"headline":"Letters: the NHS is suffering because it has become a political football","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"While I would not wish to disagree with the thrust of your major article on the National Health Service (“Voices from the frontline”, Review), we are not going to make serious inroads if we don’t ask the right questions. I would suggest the question is not: “How do we better manage health?”, but :“How do we better manage Britain?” We all know that our society needs more doctors, hospital beds and money. We know that the tremendous input from science and technology is a huge expense. Yet we don’t have sufficient doctors, beds or money. The spending on health in Britain is lower than other comparable countries. We have said this for years, but the answer has always been – as to Boxer in Animal Farm – “work harder”. Everything in Britain is seen through the prism of tribal ideology, which leads only to adversarial politics. The left fights for its cause for a few years and then the right takes over, but the problem is never satisfactorily addressed because all the effort and much of the resources are governed by the ideological standpoint of those in power. We need to move from the competitive model of politics to a more collaborative, negotiating style. Andrew Lacey Mold Flintshire Dr Richard Banks takes you to task for repeating “the misleading statement that the NHS was ranked top in the Commonwealth survey of 11 healthcare systems” (The big issue). I assume that he refers to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, a private US foundation, and nothing to do with the British Commonwealth. Dr Banks fails to mention that the report covers five measures of the efficacy of the 11 healthcare systems. The NHS came top in two, third in another two and next to last (as Dr Banks observes) in one. Oh, and the UK came top overall. The measure in which the UK came next to last was healthcare outcomes. The US came last. One might argue that the systems are at the opposite ends of some spectrum, with the UK’s a modestly funded monolithic state organised system and the US’s a privately delivered system costing, as a percentage of per capita GDP, about twice as much. It is hard to see what causes them to perform so badly on this measure. But it seems unlikely to be how they are organised, given their disparate natures. I have no brief to defend Mrs May. I note that this is the second time since the last war that the NHS has been in such a poor state and on both occasions the Conservatives were in government. But self-serving and misleading arguments about the NHS will not help us get to a better place. Dr Roger Oliver Eastbourne It is still vital to learn about what lies beneath the soil It is simply impossible to appreciate the British landscape without understanding its underlying soils (“If we want to shape a landscape that’s fit for all, we must stop romanticising it”, Comment). Ever since hominids first arrived here, they have had an impact, even with simple flint tools. The agricultural improvers of the early 19th century readily tapped the knowledge obtained after William Smith published his 1815 geological map, complete with a concise memoir full of detailed insights about our landscape. Often, when I have been mapping, it is tiny changes in vegetation that have provided me with clues as to the location of geological boundaries. Instead of continuing this long tradition, the British Geological Survey ended the routine production of a highly impressive series of 1:50,000 geological maps and brief explanations for the general public and academics alike. This is one of the worst false economies of modern times. During the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, such staff provided their field knowledge, on a 24-hour rota, to help find safe locations for burial pits and pyres, and essential university student field trips had to be held abroad. David Nowell New Barnet, Hertfordshire Addressing loneliness I was extremely delighted to come across the news regarding the appointment of a minister for loneliness by Theresa May’s government, as it is the first time such a portfolio has been created. Although loneliness is not an ailment, per se, it could lead to one. Loneliness causes “feelings” to get accumulated and if one does not give vent to such pent-up feelings through interaction with others, it will lead to dangerous situations. Diversion of the mind is needed and this can be achieved only through mingling with others. Loneliness haunts not only the elders, but the younger ones, too. As this is the first of its kind, the world will be watching with eagerness how the minister discharges her responsibility. One cannot but commend the government for preparing the ground to tackle loneliness. VS Jayaraman Chennai, India Vive la différence? Non “One should always listen to the French difference.” Really? Agnès Poirier (“ ‘Triumphant and free women’ who started a debate we needed to have? Or hostages to a culture of misogyny? An insider’s guide to French feminism”, In Focus) tries her best to defuse the international row over what has come to be known for short as the Deneuve letter, but lines such as: “The letter’s authors did not do themselves any favours by writing of men’s ‘right to pester’ women” are not a good look if you want to persuade people to your point of view. The Deneuve school of French feminism, with its emphasis on the liberation of women’s sexuality, is a cry for women to have the same right to sexual pleasure as men. Nothing wrong with that, you might think. And there are plenty of clubs and other venues to accommodate any and every taste, if that is the sort of thing you like. However, do not forget that the philosophical justification of libertinism is also a French invention and that for the last two centuries it has been used to justify forms of sexual behaviour, nearly always by powerful men, which many, if not most, people find abhorrent. The opposite of libertinism is not puritanism. It is a culture that encourages kind, loving, joyous and, above all, consensual sexual relationships. Perhaps we could call it consensualism? I don’t hear too much about this coming out of the French feminist movement. Janet Stevens Lézardrieux France Let’s vote again about Brexit Thank you, Andrew Rawnsley (“How and why Britain might be asked to vote again on Brexit”, Comment). Surely the rational argument for a second referendum lies within Westminster. Is there a single politician who would disagree with the statement: “I am in politics to do the best for the country and to improve the lot of the British people”? Yet when it came to the referendum, MPs of all parties were divided. None of us, public and politicians alike, had any idea what the deal would be until it had been agreed with the EU. It is therefore perfectly rational that once we all know what the deal is and whether, overall, it will to be to our advantage, it should be put to the country. As a taxpayer, I would be happy for the government to spend the money required for a second referendum.

Not just for the topicality of his subject matter – the scale and reach of global capitalism, the thrust of 21st-century commerce and the fragility of the planet – but for his grand-scale, digitally driven reinvention of the very notion of the photographic image. In his epic panoramas, from the frenzied activity on the Chicago stock exchange to the painterly stillness of the Rhine, nothing is as it initially appears. Often what you are seeing is a digitally created composite image: several photographs seamlessly knitted together. It is photography but not as we know it. Indeed, if you look closely at certain images – May Day IV, for example, his depiction of a vast German rave – you can pick out the same person appearing more than once. In the vast Ocean 11, satellite images are used in the creation of an overhead shot of an area so enormous it defies “normal” photography. Gursky’s digitally enhanced, almost godlike vision is the main reason he so disturbs traditionalists. But the issues of authenticity that concerned many of his contemporaries as they made the move from analogue to digital seem never to have entered his mind. In the refurbished Hayward – where not much has changed in terms of the gallery space except that everything looks brighter and less brutalist – Gursky is a perfect fit. Before one encounters the almost overwhelming magnitude and hyperreal detail of his signature works, there are several more traditional landscapes from his formative years as a graduate of the Düsseldorf School. In Gursky’s deftly revealing studies of Germans engaged in leisure pursuits (walking, swimming, skiing), the tiny human figures populate the often vast landscapes as if arranged by his hand. His compositional skill is evident throughout the exhibition, giving the pictures a choreographed aspect that becomes more grandstanding as his creativity is fired by digital technology. There are several surprises, not all of them to do with size and startling detail. Like all great artists, Gursky possesses an implicit understanding of scale. His image of a Madonna concert, an event as big as the May Day rave, is printed much smaller than the latter so that one has to lean in close to pick out the tiny figure of the singer on stage. The detail of Madonna’s arena concert is still somehow palpable even when pared down. It is as if he is making a point: size matters at both ends of the scale, the epic and the intimate. More mischievous still is Kodak, his oddly unreal take on an office block belonging to the photographic company, whose colour film so defined our way of seeing in the pre-digital age. Through Gursky’s eyes, it looks like one of those intriguingly blank models that his compatriot Thomas Demand constructs and photographs. Elsewhere, an iPhone pic – titled Utah and taken from a moving vehicle – is blown up so the imperfections show in brush-stroke streaks and blurs. It is nevertheless an image of tonal, almost painterly, beauty that harks back to an older tradition of mid-20th-century American road photographs. But it is the monumental signature works that will attract the crowds to the Hayward. They are all here, and nothing quite prepares you for encountering them together in a single show. Rhein II, which sold for a record $4.3m in 2011, is even more tonally beautiful and emptily eerie in the flesh. Intriguingly, the caption reads “Remastered”, which suggests even more manipulation: in the creation of the original, buildings and humans were removed, thus making it an image of somewhere that does not really exist. Echoing this is the image that hangs alongside it: El Ejido depicts a landscape blighted by litter and acres of industrial plastic covering crops. Made in 2017, it suggests a more overt engagement with contemporary global capitalism and its effects. The extraordinary Amazon (2016) offers a glimpse of the algorithm-generated overload that defines any given day in a single warehouse owned by the company, while simultaneously making you wonder how, in defiance of this seeming chaos, they manage to deliver anything to your door within 24 hours. The stock exchange images, meanwhile, remain breathtaking in their scale and scope, full of telling details such as the discarded printouts littering the floor beneath the traders’ feet. This is a deftly curated show full of echoes and resonances. An image of the Tour de France winding though a French mountainside hangs opposite an ariel image of a Formula One track snaking though the desert in Bahrain. The Aletsch Glacier (1990) resembles a gloomy landscape by Caspar David Friedrich, albeit without any brooding humans, while the minimalist facade of a Toys R Us building abutting a similarly blank Toyota warehouse harks back to the detached gaze of Lewis Baltz and the New Topographics movement that documented the creeping corporatism of American suburbia in the 1970s. For all his iconoclasm, Gursky continually reminds us that he belongs to a postwar tradition of detached looking that began with his teachers the Bechers in Düsseldorf and continued with the likes of Baltz, Robert Adams and Stephen Shore in the early 1970s. But from his evocations of global capitalism to his satellite composites of melting icecaps, he employs digital technology to both challenge the notion of the photograph and do what great photography has always done: show us the world we live in anew. • At the Hayward Gallery, London, 25 January to 22 April.

And this is as true for things like antidepressants as it is for insulin or antibiotics. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome is a real problem. It doesn’t effect everyone equally, but that’s always been the case with antidepressants. The effects can be really profound and debilitating though, including a spike in anxiety, alarming “brain zaps”, and more. For better or worse, if you’ve been taking antidepressants for a number of weeks, your brain has slowly adapted to the new chemical levels and balance that they have brought about. A sudden cessation will rapidly alter this again, potentially causing all manner of problems, and possibly cause the underlying issue (ie depression) they’re supposed to be treating to return with a vengeance. This is why the specific dose and schedule of antidepressants is very carefully considered. If you do genuinely want to come off your antidepressants, please speak to your GP or medical expert, work out a system for gradual reduction and cessation and make plans and preparations for what could happen, as it could leave you unable to function normally. If you’re going to do it, please do it carefully, and thoroughly. Please, do not just abandon your medication. Why tell you this? Well, it suddenly seems necessary, due to Johann Hari and his efforts to promote his new book about the “real” causes and treatments of depression. I have already been one of the people to take issue with his claims, and I still stand by this. Hari may genuinely believe all that he says and honestly feel that he’s doing good, important work. Sadly, I and many others can’t help but find his arguments and conclusions highly questionable and potentially harmful when it comes to the attitudes people have towards medication for psychiatric illness, and mental health in general. Mental health, and all the associated ailments, is far from a simple subject with easily observed causes and effects. The intangible, often hugely subjective, nature of mental health problems is one of the reasons why the “medical model” approach to treating them is so often criticised; the patient is more than just a passive recipient of treatments and therapies, like someone with an infection being told which antibiotics to take and obeying without question. When it comes to maladies of the mind – things that affect mood, cognition, motivation, perception etc – logically, the individual has to play a larger role in dealing with them. The affected person is the only ones with any real access to the issues after all. Hence many people champion a more “psychodynamic” approach to psychiatry, where patients have a much larger contribution to make. Looked at this way, Hari’s conclusions about his own depression and how it should be dealt with are as valid as anyone’s, probably more so. So what’s the problem? The problem is that Hari’s arguments aren’t limited to himself. The very nature of a psychodynamic approach means any workable solution found is less likely to apply to anyone else, as it’s something that incorporates the subjective nature of the person’s problems. By contrast, Hari’s arguments have received blanket media coverage, a disconcerting advertising campaign, and countless high-profile endorsements. Basically, his arguments are being shared far and wide to huge audiences, with the endorsement of many respected individuals and publications. Why is this bad? Well, I received this message to my personal website, which perfectly illustrates the worst fears of myself and others. Please, do not just abandon your medication. This is just one example of someone who ended up doubting the recommended therapy for their genuine issues in light of Hari’s arguments. Thankfully, this person had the wherewithal and inclination to double check what was claimed, but some brief digging online suggests there are others considering/deciding to ditch their psychiatric medication because of Hari’s claims. In fairness, there’s no indication that Hari actually states at any point that anybody else should stop their medication, so that accusation cannot and should not be levelled at him. But his attitude towards antidepressants could hardly be described as fair and balanced. The closest he comes to a defence of them seems to be the observation that “some credible scientists argue that they give some temporarily relief to a minority of users”. A highly questionable conclusion, which really depends on flexible definitions of “credible”, “temporary” and “minority”. So while Hari may not specifically state that anyone should give up their medications, he does seem to constantly question and throw doubt on the use and validity of antidepressants (and those who endorse them) for a target audience that’s, by definition, highly prone to negative thinking and pessimism. It’s not far fetched to envisage this leading to some seriously unhelpful outcomes. Please, do not just abandon your medication. That’s the only real point of this article. Even if you agree with everything Hari says , please; if you’re on antidepressants and have been for a while, don’t cut off your medication all at once. Take it slow, get help and advice, do it gradually and carefully. It’s not like ripping off a bandage or plaster, one sharp shock and it’s all over. It’s more like slamming your brakes on while in the fast lane of the motorway: it may be safe in other scenarios, but you’re currently in a situation where that’s extremely hazardous. And it may even be the case that, while they don’t make you feel noticeably better, the antidepressants are allowing you to function sufficiently to pursue other approaches. They may not be as helpful as you’d hope, but they could be a vital component of a suite of approaches that eventually proves helpful. There are many good and valid reasons to stop taking antidepressants, and many of the concerns raised by Hari’s writing, like the societal over-reliance on medication and the unethical behaviour and practices of pharmaceutical companies, are indeed important concerns that should be more publicised. But, regardless of the hows and whys of the current situations, we’re talking about a psychoactive drug here. Even if you honestly don’t believe they have any benefit, the fact that they have any side effects at all shows they’re clearly doing something to you. They have an effect, whatever it may be, and that effect is something your body and brain will have adapted to over time; the system was disrupted at first, but has since got used to it. If you suddenly remove an element it’s got used to, your system is going to be disrupted again, and that’s highly unlikely to be something that’s good for you. It could even prove fatal. So, if for that reason alone, please, do not just abandon your medication. Dean Burnett addresses the mechanisms and stigma of depression in his own, admittedly far less successful book, The Idiot Brain is available now, in the UK and US and elsewhere. If you are affected by depression or suicidal thoughts, there are places you can turn to. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

I concluded that the book’s author, Johann Hari, and his critic, Dean Burnett, were entitled to their differing views, and that the Guardian and Observer editorial standards had been met. Due to the sensitivity of the issue involved - namely, the causes and treatment of mental illness - I also concluded that it was appropriate to emphasise for readers that the author and his critic have both expressed the view that people taking anti-depressants should not stop taking their medication abruptly or without seeking professional advice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/19/paddington-2-becomes-best-reviewed-film-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T16:30:20Z","webTitle":"Paddington 2 becomes best reviewed film ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/19/paddington-2-becomes-best-reviewed-film-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/19/paddington-2-becomes-best-reviewed-film-ever","fields":{"headline":"Paddington 2 becomes best reviewed film ever","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the lineup of the most critically acclaimed films, Citizen Kane and The Godfather have been bested by a bear from “darkest” Peru.

The comedy – which is directed by the British film-maker Paul King and stars Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins and Hugh Bonneville, – has received 164 consecutive positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes classifies reviews of a film as either “fresh” or “rotten” and awards a percentage rating based on its aggregate score. The website had previously declared another film, Greta Gerwig’s comedy-drama Lady Bird, to be the best reviewed ever after it overtook a record long held by Toy Story 2. But Lady Bird later received a negative review, breaking its positive streak and losing its “best reviewed” crown. Paddington 2, which was released in UK cinemas in November, has also proved popular with audiences. To date, the film has earned £41m at the British box office and more than £101m worldwide. However, Paddington 2 has some way to go before it outdoes its predecessor film, which earned more than £190m globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/comparing-unlike-with-unlike-matt-hancokc-has-truly-found-his-niche","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:04:05Z","webTitle":"Comparing unlike with unlike – it’s Whitehall’s secret new parlour game  | Victoria Coren Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/comparing-unlike-with-unlike-matt-hancokc-has-truly-found-his-niche","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/comparing-unlike-with-unlike-matt-hancokc-has-truly-found-his-niche","fields":{"headline":"Comparing unlike with unlike – it’s Whitehall’s secret new parlour game","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Well done Peston On Sunday, last week, for having three interview guests and triggering major news stories with each of them. That’s an amazing hit rate. First guest Jeremy Corbyn hit the headlines for suggesting that the UK doesn’t really have a special relationship with America. Third guest Miriam Margolyes said “fuck” live on air. And the middle guest, shiny new culture secretary Matt Hancock, said that editors at the BBC should not be paid more than ambassadors. It is to the programme’s credit that this was widely reported despite Mr Hancock having said it several times before. (“BBC foreign editors can earn more than Her Majesty’s ambassadors in the same jurisdiction!” he told the House of Commons, in horror, earlier this month). But I suppose most newspapers are happy to repeat criticism of the BBC, seeing it as a state-subsidised rival. There’s something I like about Matt Hancock. I’m concerned about the power his new job gives him over the review into fixed-odds betting terminals; as Newmarket’s MP, he’ll be lobbied hard by people who have reason to protect the link between sicko gambling machines and betting shop numbers, rather than look for a better way to fund the industry (and do please remember that, when the FOBT review gets kicked into touch), but I have a feeling I’d like him if I met him. He has a twinkle in his eye. We’re interested in similar things. He’s won a horse race and uploaded a video of himself opening a bottle of champagne while a man shouts, “Matt, you jammy bugger!” in the background. He’s sort of hilarious, and my instinct says that’s only partly by mistake. He should probably beware being too cynical about the abilities required for television, having once missed a live ITV interview because he overslept. “I got 2 tv studio at 6:41 this am so missed 6:40 slot”, he tweeted. “You’ve got to be on time for work or there r consequences.” He was minister for skills and enterprise at the time. As minister for energy, he got into terrible trouble when he hired a private jet to fly back from a climate conference. If only that controversy could have been predicted! Nevertheless, Theresa May spotted the cabinet potential – he doesn’t seem to have groped anyone. And now, as secretary of state for culture, media and sport, Hancock is keen to get everyone wondering whether senior BBC journalists are more or less valuable than our current raft of politicians. Hmm. He’s also developed this curious preoccupation with the relative worth of foreign editors and ambassadors. I’m not going to defend big BBC salaries. I’d simply be accused of self-interest, given that I sometimes work for the BBC and am hoping to become a man. I won’t even point out the irony of Matt Hancock explaining his failure to understand big BBC salaries to Robert Peston, a broadcaster who was poached by commercial television. Besides, I genuinely don’t know whether ambassadors deserve more or less than BBC foreign editors. As the world disintegrates out of its current shape, I should imagine they are both incredibly important! I wouldn’t want to do without either! Why do we have to compare them? It doesn’t illuminate anything! It just makes my brain hurt! But Matt Hancock says we have to decide. “Who should we be paying the most to?” he asked the ITV audience, firmly, on Sunday. “Is it the BBC editor or is it the ambassador?” Do you think this unanswerable question is part of a secret parlour game? A bet with his Newmarket friends? A sort of baffling mental Twister? I’m going to send in my guess on a postcard, in case there’s a prize. As soon as someone wins, Mr Hancock can move on to his next set of questions… Victoria Beckham: glasses or leopards? Last week, we read about Victoria Beckham’s 2018 eyewear range and, in other news, about a pet leopard that escaped in Cornwall. But which is more valuable? Well, you can’t catch glasses in a fox trap. On the other hand, you couldn’t attach a leopard to the face of a model with a BMI of -50 and then photograph it. That does appear to be possible with VB eyewear (the advertising of which represented another wonderful step forward in Mrs Beckham’s get-back-to-work scheme for the spindly.) Therefore it would be a travesty if the leopard cost more than the glasses. The Bayeux tapestry or c-sections? An actor from Call The Midwife revealed last week that she chose to have a caesarean section because she is “not good with pain”. Well done that honest woman, who is clearly braver than she thinks. Emergency caesarians have saved millions of lives, both of mothers and children. But does that make them better or worse than the Bayeux tapestry? Only the wealthy can afford to choose a private c-section. Then again, nobody can afford the Bayeux tapestry. Is that fair? After all, they’re both just a bit of sewing. Gunpowder or Ukip leaders? Grisly TV drama Gunpowder, now available on DVD, featured scenes of such gory torture and execution that some viewers reported vomiting as they watched. But people in Ukip are always having to take down old Facebook photos of themselves doing Nazi salutes, apologise for going to parties in SS uniform, or pretend to break up with women who have tweeted racist abuse. Both are gruesomely entertaining. On Amazon, you can get the complete Gunpowder for £6.39. You can probably now get Henry Bolton for about £4.30. But is that the right way round?

Manufacturers were unable to make things cheaply, reliably or efficiently enough against the headwind of a high-value currency, forcing many to give up. An economy that boasted 20% of its income coming from manufacturing in the 1980s found it was the source of barely 10% at the beginning of this decade. Surges in GDP growth in the 70 years since the war can be attributed (and this short list makes the point crudely) to periods when there were cheap raw materials and energy costs; or a growing population; or foreign ownership and management of key industries; or the offloading of vast amounts of state and mutually owned assets; or cheap borrowing. Without these in operation to improve the UK’s performance, a lower exchange rate became inevitable. Some Brexit campaigners made a cheaper currency their explicit aim, arguing that while Britain’s wealth and standing in the world would be diminished in the short term, the breathing space given to manufacturers would allow them to sell abroad at cheaper prices, then use the funds to invest and gain the efficiencies needed to cope with a return to a higher exchange rate sometime in the next decade. There is a good deal of logic to the argument, but it rests, like so many revolutionary aims, on the many and competing forces in the economy doing exactly what its proponents want them to. For instance, manufacturers, with a few honourable exceptions, have refused to invest more than the bare minimum for decades, even when the exchange rate has helped them. There are windfall profits to be made when currencies fall: but these windfalls have been trousered by shareholders, not invested. Banks, too, are a roadblock to growth and principally need to wean themselves off the property drug. This is why the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, argues strongly for regional banks to bypass the existing high street lenders. Again, this appears like a new-world solution to an age-old problem. What could be more farsighted and lead to more diversity than supporting a new breed of financial lender with a remit to find successful entrepreneurs? But the risks are huge – not just of lending to people with dud business plans, but also of creating an institution that is stuck in the mire of British hope-for-the-best management from the moment it is launched. Without a revolution in the way companies and public sector institutions are managed, there is little hope of a self-induced revival. That is why the car industry is now foreign owned and run. Brexit is also said to be the answer to Britain getting a pay rise. With fewer immigrants, the argument goes, the labour market will tighten and before too long workers will find themselves in the happy position of bidding up their wages. Not so fast. When so much growth over the past six years of recovery has been in the low-paid services sector, it is more likely that those businesses, confronted by angry staff, will close rather than pay up. They provide a discretionary service with a price ceiling: charge more and the customer will choose to do something else. That goes for hotels and coffee bars. They could all suffer hugely. So whether the solution to a more balanced and faster-growing economy is providing existing institutions with an incentive (a lower pound to exporters) or bypassing institutions, such as today’s commercial banks, there is little guarantee the GDP dial will move. Power to the workers from lower immigration doesn’t make a difference if all it means is that the jobs they are doing disappear. Brexit is only something – even if you accept the premise of socialism in one country or free-market bonanza – that works on paper. Which is a distinct problem when so much of what the UK has relied on for growth is running dry. There are not many state assets left to flog. Raw materials and energy costs are rising, while the foreign ownership and management of key industries could decline as Brexit cuts off easy access to the world’s largest free-trade bloc. This week, GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2017 will show the economy trundling along in the run-up to Christmas. If modest growth is all that is required, it can be achieved as long as borrowing remains cheap. Without cheap borrowing, predictions of the economy’s decline will become real."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/19/trump-russia-inquiry-is-told-nigel-farage-may-have-given-julian-assange-data","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T18:03:26Z","webTitle":"Trump-Russia inquiry is told Nigel Farage may have given Julian Assange data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/19/trump-russia-inquiry-is-told-nigel-farage-may-have-given-julian-assange-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/19/trump-russia-inquiry-is-told-nigel-farage-may-have-given-julian-assange-data","fields":{"headline":"Trump-Russia inquiry is told Nigel Farage may have given Julian Assange data","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nigel Farage may have given Julian Assange a thumb drive of data and was possibly a more frequent visitor than was publicly known to the Ecuadorian embassy where the WikiLeaks founder lives, according to testimony given to US congressional inquiry into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to the Kremlin. Glenn Simpson, a private investigator whose company compiled the controversial dossier alleging a conspiracy between Trump campaign officials and Russian agents, told the House intelligence committee that he was told by an unnamed source that the former Ukip leader had given data to Assange, but had no proof of the exchange. “I’ve been told and have not confirmed that Nigel Farage had additional trips to the Ecuadoran [sic] Embassy than the one that’s been in the papers and that he provided data to Julian Assange,” Simpson told the committee, according to a transcript released on Thursday. Asked what kind of data Farage was alleged to have passed to the WikiLeaks founder, Simpson replied: “A thumb drive.” Simpson told the committee – which is privy to classified US intelligence – that it would be possible to confirm how often Farage had visited Assange through a routine inquiry. His remarks were made in a private interview by the committee, which peppered Simpson with questions about Russian money laundering and the possibility that Donald Trump could be compromised. A spokesman for Farage told the Guardian last year that Farage had only met with Assange in March 2017 and not on any other occasion. The Trump administration has vigorously denied all claims that it may have colluded with Russian agents. Assange made no public comment, but the WikiLeaks Twitter account said: “The question was about what kind of data. Game of Thrones or emails? 2016 or 2017? Simpson answers with a diversion.” Assange has denied working as an agent of Russia and Farage has ridiculed suggestions that the Kremlin influenced either the US election or Britain’s 2016 vote to exit the European Union. Farage’s relationship with Assange is of key interest because US intelligence and law enforcement officials see the WikiLeaks founder as a conduit for the Russian government. Assange’s move to publish emails that were hacked from the Democratic party in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election is seen as part of the Kremlin’s campaign to try to influence the outcome of the election in Trump’s favour. Multiple US inquiries are now examining whether the Trump campaign or other officials had a hand in the Kremlin’s alleged interference. An ongoing criminal investigation into the matter has already resulted in four indictments, including of three former campaign officials. It is known that Farage visited the WikiLeaks founder in March 2017 but Farage has previously insisted that he went to the Ecuadorian embassy for journalistic purposes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/22/monday-best-tv-silent-witness-how-mad-was-king-george","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:20:42Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Silent Witness; How Mad Was King George?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/22/monday-best-tv-silent-witness-how-mad-was-king-george","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/22/monday-best-tv-silent-witness-how-mad-was-king-george","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Silent Witness; How Mad Was King George?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Silent Witness 9pm, BBC One The UK police join forces, awkwardly, with the US embassy in this episode of the enduring forensic pathology drama, as a diplomat heading home finds himself targeted and then murdered by a biker.

Officers fired teargas as scuffles broke out at the Fleury-Mérogis prison, south of Paris, where guards are protesting after a series of attacks on staff. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has promised to draw up a national prisons plan to address concerns by the end of February. The attacks that sparked the guards’ protest have highlighted security problems and radicalisation inside often overcrowded French prisons. In the latest outbreak of violence, two guards were attacked by four inmates at the Borgo jail in Corsica. The guards were taken to hospital in a serious condition and the four inmates were arrested after gendarmes moved in to secure the prison, a penitentiary official said. Outside the entrance to Fleury-Mérogis jail, which has more than 4,300 inmates, about 150 striking guards built a barricade of burning tyres and wooden pallets to prevent their colleagues from getting to work A unit of CRS riot police broke through the picket line, firing teargas to disperse the demonstrators and allowing other staff to enter the prison while striking guards were held behind a barrier. “The CRS charged and fired teargas at us but we tried to resist,” a 28-year-old guard who gave his name as Sacha told AFP. On Thursday, about 120 prisoners refused to return to their cells after their midday walk in the yard. They were brought back in with the help of specially trained intervention teams, France’s prison administration service said. Six prisoners who are thought to have led the protest were sent to the punishment block, a prison officers’ union source said. Despite talks to resolve the protests and pledges by Macron to outline plans for an overhaul of French prisons, the unions decided to continue the industrial action. The strike began on 11 January after a German convict, a former top al-Qaida militant, attacked three guards with scissors and a razor blade at a high-security prison in northern France. On Thursday, guards at more than 123 facilities were “mobilised”, the UFAP-UNSA and the CGT unions said. Figures provided by the prisons’ administration said 87 of the country’s 188 detention facilities had been affected by the strike action. In a statement this week, Force Ouvrière, one of the unions involved in the strike, said two-thirds of France’s prisons had been hit by industrial action.

As thousands marched across the United States and Europe, the Women’s March in Sydney saw around 1,000 people gather in Hyde Park. It was attended by a diverse range of women and some men, with younger women dominating the crowd. The international protests in 2017 were sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president, but since then other grassroots campaigns such as the #MeToo movement have broadened the concerns by exposing systemic harassment and discrimination against women. Instead of marching on the American consulate, as originally intended, the organisers in Sydney asked the crowd to join hands to ring Hyde Park in a show of solidarity. One of the speakers, the founder of On Purpose Hub, Karen James, told the crowd that 2017 had been a watershed year in campaigning for systemic change. But she said consistent action was needed to change entrenched attitudes: “We need to be unbroken all the time. We need to show up and take action all the time.” Founder of the Sydney march, Kate Taylor, said joining hands was a symbol of solidarity and determination to keep forcing change. “2017 was our generation’s floodgate moment. We refused to keep quiet. 2018 will be the year where we say we have weathered the backlash and emerged unbroken to say: we want a safer world.” The Greens NSW MP Mehreen Faruqi, who was in of the crowd, said: “Women bear most of the brunt of racism, discrimination and inequality and it’s time to fight back and do it in solidarity.” The Greens senator Lee Rhiannon described the atmosphere of the Sydney march under warm blue skies as “delightful”. “Women are very upbeat and very inspired especially by what’s going on at marches in New York and Texas,” she said. Some people had travelled to Sydney to take part. The Illawarra Knitting Nanna’s against Greed – Cherry Hardaker, Anne Dillon and Annie Marlow – said they were now turning their attention to Adani, coalmining and Donald Trump after winning their battle against coal-seam gas. Marches in Melbourne and Brisbane also attracted hundreds of supporters. Those in Melbourne marched from Alexandra Gardens and formed a human chain across the banks of the Yarra. “I think last year was that watershed moment of President Trump’s election,” Melbourne organiser Melissa Goffin said. “This is mainstream, this is everyone. It’s a new era of feminism.” Hundreds also took part in Brisbane’s CBD carrying signs and chanting. The Women’s March organisation started in Washington in response to Donald Trump’s presidential win. The group sought to turn protests into political action by encouraging women to run for office and exercise their right to vote and influence elections. Tens of thousands turned out to March on Saturday in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities across the US and the world. Many women wore pink knit “pussy hats”, an enduring symbol of the Women’s March and the so-called “resistance” to Trump.

The Sydney Morning Herald revealed that a new 13-page document had quietly replaced the old 100-page biodiversity conservation strategy just before Christmas on the Department of Environment’s website. Entitled Australia’s Strategy for Nature 2018-2030, the paper outlines three goals and 12 objectives but contains no measurable targets and scant detail of actions that will be taken by state and federal governments to achieve the objectives. The Humane Society International’s Australian head of programs, Evan Quartermain, said rather than addressing the failure to meet previous targets, the Turnbull government had “served up simplistic and unmeasurable dod points that ... fall short of the international commitments to conserve biodiversity that we have made at the United Nations.” The Australian Conservation Foundation’s policy analyst James Trezise described it as a “wafer-thin plan ... which reads like a year-10 school assignment.” The goals in the plan include “connect all Australians with nature” and “care for nature in all its diversity”. The objectives underpinning those goals are just as broad and include statements like “maximise the number of species secured in nature,” but no details as to how this objective might be achieved. This contrasts with the 100-page document released in 2010 to tackle the threats to Australia’s biodiversity. It included a detailed action plan to both boost awareness of the threats to endangered species and to tackle threats which included farming and fishing practices, pollution and climate change. For example, it included a target of involving more Indigenous communities in managing the natural environment and set a target of a 25% increase in employment as a measurable goal. Australia has one of the highest levels of extinction of species and is among the top 10 countries for species that are endangered or threatened. Australia has lost more mammal and plant species over the past 200 years than any other country, but it also has one of the highest number of mammal species. Of the 273 Australian endemic land mammal species, there have been 29 extinctions, which equates to 11%. Some 909 species are categorised as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable on the Red List, an international list that has been running since 1964. In 2015 the federal government launched a threatened species strategy to much fanfare and promised to make it a priority. The year one report card showed that 21 of the 26 objectives in that report were achieved. The targets were far more defined and included tackling feral cats and fox-baiting programs. But critics say more needs to be done about land clearing leading to a loss of habitat, which has accelerated under state governments in Queensland, Western Australia and likely in NSW due to more relaxed laws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/22/spot-scammers-home-office-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T15:21:29Z","webTitle":"Think you can spot scammers?

Just 9% of Britons really can","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An official campaign to protect consumers against financial fraud has been launched after a survey showed that only 9% of people were able to correctly identify scam texts and emails in an online test. Monday marks the start of Take Five to Stop Fraud Week, which is backed by the Home Office and financial institutions, and aims to combat one of Britain’s fastest-growing crimes. According to the government, fraud is now “the most prevalent crime in this country”, with 3.3m cases in the 12 months to June 2017. One of the problems, according to the campaign, is that many consumers think they are “too smart to be scammed” and are therefore leaving themselves vulnerable. Banking trade body UK Finance said £366m was lost to financial fraud – which includes email deception and phone-based scams as well as online fraud – in the first six months of 2017. A further £101m was lost by victims of so-called “authorised push payment” scams – also known as email intercept fraud. This is where people are tricked into transferring money into a fraudster’s bank account, typically as a result of criminals hacking into emails sent between individuals and the tradespeople they are employing. The Take Five campaign carried out research showing that four in five people (80%) claimed they could confidently identify a fraudulent approach. However, when it invited people to answer a series of questions designed to see if they could correctly separate the scam texts and emails from genuine messages, only 9% – 5,942 – out of 63,000 who completed the quiz answered all eight questions correctly. “The results contradict the public’s perceptions of their savviness to spot a scam,” said a spokeswoman for the campaign, which is inviting people to test their own fraud and scam knowledge by taking the “Too Smart To Be Scammed?” quiz. The campaign has issued three pieces of advice: • A genuine bank or organisation will never contact you out of the blue to ask for your pin or full password, or to request that you move money to another account. • Never automatically click on a link in an unexpected email or text. • If you are approached with a request for personal information, don’t provide it. Instead, contact the company directly using a known email or phone number. In August 2017 the UK’s fraud prevention service, Cifas, said identity theft was “reaching epidemic levels” in the UK. This crime typically involves criminals pretending to be an individual in order to steal their money, buy items or take out financial products in their name, and during the first six months of 2017 there were a record 89,000 cases. The Guardian has featured a number of cases of people falling victim to bank transfer scams. Campaign events include a “roadshow” that is due to visit a number of shopping centres, including Lakeside in Essex today, Merry Hill in Birmingham on Tuesday, the Trafford Centre in Manchester on Wednesday, and Braehead in Glasgow on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/21/real-madrid-v-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T17:07:42Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid 7-1 Deportivo la Coruña: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/21/real-madrid-v-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/21/real-madrid-v-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid 7-1 Deportivo la Coruña: La Liga – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thanks for coming! There was a late flurry of goals and typing there. Can Real Betis v Barcelona live up to that? Probably not, but you can still join me later for it. Well, the worries were quickly forgotten after Depor took a shock lead. Bale and Modric were superb for Real and Ronaldo had some good moments but certainly did not look at his best. Also...Zidane might have a decision to make over whether Sergio Ramos comes back into the team to replace Nacho who scored two and looked confident at the back. It was all going so well for Depor until Real Madrid scored seven. Zidane’s side were on top throughout and their attacking talent showed what it is made of, which is good news going forward. Bale and Ronaldo were in fine form and Benzema made a difference once he’d replaced Mayoral. 90+1 min: There’s three minutes to be added on. Anyway...Ronaldo made the doctor give him his phone so he could witness the catastrophic nick that he suffered in getting his second. What a time to be alive. GOAL! A Kroos corner is flicked over to Nacho waiting at the back post where he turns on the ball in the area and fires a shot across Ruben for his second of the game. THE CRISIS IS OVER! 88 min: Carvajal tries to get in on the act and he latches onto a pass over the top and volleys it at goal, only for Ruben to palm it away. 86 min: Ronaldo has just wandered off as there is no point him being on in these circumstances. GOAL! Vazquez gets space on the right and clips one for Ronaldo to perform a fine diving header for his second. On the downside, he got a big kick in the face and he is now quite bloody, which is unfortunate. It was very brave from Ronaldo and he took the kick with good humour. A second for Ronaldo! NO GOAL! Ronaldo taps in a Bale cross but the assistant referee sticks his flag up immediately, much to the annoyance of the Portuguese. Vazquez is now on for Bale who is denied the opportunity of a hat-trick. Not a bad footballer... GOAL! Ronaldo can stop his sulking now after Real worked the ball out wide for Casemiro to find one of many players in the box but it is Ronaldo who gets on the end of it to tap in the fifth from a yard. He almost celebrated. Ronaldo finally gets a goal. 75 min: Marcelo gets the better of Juanfran once again but his cross is straight to Ruben who gets up with a grimace. Modric is heading off and Kovacic is on. 72 min: Ronaldo still does not have a goal to his name after taking down a cross from Marcelo but instead of volleying into the back of the net, he drags it wide with his left foot from eight yards. Not exactly clinical. Better than Ronaldo... 69 min: Depor should have one back after Navas palmed the ball into the path of Andone who whacks the ball over from a few yards while the goalkeeper was still on the ground. The Romanian beats Navas moments later but Nacho comes in to clear the ball off the line. GOAL! Real counter on Depor as Bale takes the ball down the right, lays it off to Ronaldo who does a lovely, subtle flick into the path of Modric who calmly curls in the fourth from 20 yards. What a team goal! 67 min: Varane and Andone clash as the Frenchman intercepts a pass, resulting in a free-kick to the Frenchman. 66 min: Ruben is being treated for a thigh injury. Will we get to see Pantilimon? I do hope so. 65 min: The BBC are playing together for the first time in the league this season and it almost results in a goal as Benzema plays in Ronaldo but his curling shot goes a couple of yards wide. 64 min: Benzema returns! And Mayoral is off after not really doing anything. Poor lad. 63 min: Bale does a few stepovers before lifting a cross to the back post for Mayoral to head into an empty net but he nods it wide instead. 62 min: Andone gets the other side of the Real defence but they chase him down forcing him to pull the ball back for a midfielder and the moves break down. GOAL! Ruben’s save counts for nothing as Kroos puts the ball on Bale’s head after the Welshman finds space in the box from the corner in order to calmly head the ball beyond the goalkeeper. A great header from Bale. 58 min: Kroos chips a cross to Casemiro flying in at the back post but his header from three yards is expertly save by Ruben. Why did you do it Ronnie? 56 min: Ronaldo chases a through ball but he’s offside, so shows his frustrations by kicking the ball away. Grow up, mate. 53 min: Real Madrid are starting off where they finished the last half as Ronaldo leads the attack, lays the ball off to a marauding Marcelo but his cross is just too quick for Mayoral who dives in but cannot make contact. Celso Borges heads off for Depor and Colak comes on. 52 min: Modric and Mayoral link up on the edge of the area but the Spaniard falls over before getting the ball back. Bale then crossed for the Croatian who fires his shot just wide. 50 min: Kroos sends a wonderful ball out to Carvajal who takes it down wonderfully in the area and pulls it back for Ronaldo but Schar gets in their quickly, forcing the Real man to push him in the back. 48 min: Mosquera is wandering off after his long pass knacks his hamstring. He would never have been able to play for Wimbledon. Edu is on. 47 min: Depor’s plan might be to go more direct in this half for Andone to chase and to turn Varane. It might not work, but it looks moire effective than slowly passing the ball around. Peep peep! Here we go again! Cristiano Ronaldo gives everyone a high five in the tunnel as he just bloody loves Real Madrid. Red card Ramos is not for Sid... If anyone is giving Depor a chance of coming back into this, please email in so I can debate if I know anything anymore. The official view from Spain... Real Madrid are obviously IN CRISIS but they have looked good today - they have passed the ball well from back to front and have made enough chances to win three or four games. The goal conceded was avoidable but it’s all been Real Madrid for the rest of the half and Depor do not look like they will be able to change things much in the second. GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! Apart from the 15 seconds it took for Depor to complete the move which resulted in their opener, it really has been all Real who have been dominant. They should be out of sight considering how much of the ball they have seen and the chances they have made. Nacho took his goal well and Bale’s strike was sublime, now they just need to get the job done. 45 min: Lucas tries to go around Nacho but gets nowhere down the right flank. I can’t see anyone backing Depor to get back into this game. GOAL! It had been coming ever since the equaliser. After Ronaldo had gone down under pressure from Luisinho, everyone seemed to forget that the ball was at Bale’s feet, who cut in onto his left and curled one into the top corner form 15 yards. It was a stunning strike from the Welshman. What a strike from Bale! 41 min: Depor have enjoyed some possession here but it never looks like it will lead to a chance. Real Madrid get the ball back and try to break up the other end but Bale failed to find Ronaldo with a pass and the move breaks down. 38 min: It’s all kicking off now after Casemiro is fouled by Andone after the Romanian lunged in on the Brazilian. The striker was very much booked for his illegal activities. 35 min: Kroos lifts the ball to Bale who tries to head it back to Mayoral who is just beaten to the ball by Schar, who is having a great game for Depor. 34 min: Carvajal dinks a cross from the right which lands on the head of Modric who can only nod the ball straight at Ruben. Depor really need to move up the pitch. GOAL! Real Madrid take a quick corner, resulting in Marcelo pulling the ball back into the box for Nacho, who has a bucket load of space from where to side-foot into the bottom corner. And there is the equaliser. 30 min: Marcelo slips through the Depor defence and smashes a low shot at the front post, which Ruben flicks onto the post and the ball kindly ends up in the goalkeeper’s arms. The equaliser is coming... 28 min: Almost an equaliser for Real after Marcelo lifted one to the back post for Ronaldo who directed a powerful header at goal but Ruben performs heroics to tip the ball away and Schar gets to the rebound to send it behind before Mayoral can tap into an empty net. 26 min: Now Depor are going to somehow challenge themselves to get even deeper. It almost costs them as Bale sticks one up to the back post where Marcelo is waiting to volley the ball back across goal but wide. It’s all gone! GOAL! It was all very easy for Depor as Andone flicked on a throw-in down the flank for Lucas to chase, the Arsenal loanee took the ball into the box and sent it across for Adrian to tap it home from a matter of yards. The Bernabeu is now silent. A shock opener for the visitors! 21 min: The referee has pulled back play after Andone lads badly when challenging for an header with Casemiro but he seems to be OK now. 19 min: Mayoral is not getting into the game as he would have liked but neither are Ronaldo and Bale, so he should not worry too much until the inevitable substitutions are made. 17 min: All gone a little quiet at the Bernabeu as Depor break with Andone chasing a long pass down the pitch but Casemiro tracks the Romanian and dispossesses him just in time. 15 min: At the back for Depor is Steve Aldo One who must be enjoying his debut against the might of Real Madrid. He has some English in his name, can Southgate claim him? 13 min: Kroos swings in a free-kick from the left but Schar beats everyone in the air and the ball eventually heads out for a corner. 12 min: Real Madrid are happy to start deep and create sweeping moves forward which they have done on a number of occasions so far without finding that killer final ball. Lots of cross have been cleared or collected by Ruben. 10 min: Turns out Marcelo went down holding his face as the breeze coming from Andone jogging past the Brazilian was like a brick to the face. The poor lad. 8 min: Depor enjoy sojourn up the pitch when Andone gets into the box but his cross is blocked and Real manage to scramble it away. It could be at a cost as Marcelo has hobbled away from the situation. 6 min: The next former Spurs man to find space and put in a cross is Modric who sends in a low ball to Mayoral whose first-time shot forces Ruben into a decent save down to his right. 4 min: Bale and Ronaldo combine as the Welshman does some jiggery pokery on the right to throw off a couple of defenders before swinging in a cross to Ronaldo who heads it well over. 3 min: Real Madrid have barely relinquished possession in the opening few moments here. Could be a long old game for Depor who are playing a very deep 4-5-1. 1 min: Depor do their best to concede in the first few seconds as Schar sends a short backpass to Ruben who just manages to clear before Real get to the ball. Peep peep! We’re off after some singing in the stands, so it must be a football match. A new record coming our way? Real Madrid are currently 19 points behind Barcelona which must really hurt. It cannot be sustainable for Zidane, so they really need the win today in order to make it less embarrassing. Now Depor have some hope... Oh...if you want to send your views on the football or your Sunday roast details, then feel free to on the email address and Twitter handle provided above. The snow is falling across London but it looks like a delightfully crisp day for football in the Spanish capital, which can only be good news for all of us hiding from the cold. Depor can boast Arsenal loanee Lucas Perez in their ranks. The Spaniard has scored five times in 18 games this season but not in any of his last seven outings. Will today be the day he stops the rot? Probably not. Real Madrid are warming up in a relaxing manner... As it is a week of denying stuff in Madrid, Zidane has also distanced himself from Neymar, which is not much of a surprise. “I won’t speak about players who aren’t mine. The whole footballing world likes Neymar, he’s a great player,” Zidane said. Zinedine Zidane, after winning five trophies in a year, has now been forced to say he will not walk away from Real Madrid. But why would anyone? “I don’t think about negative things, only positive,” Zidane said at his pre-match press conference. “We will find positive things. I’m never going to throw in the towel. I’m going to continue fighting as I’ve always shown and I’m not going to quit ever. “ Ronaldo and Bale start but Benzema is left on the bench, so the BBC are not back together yet. Borja Mayoral gets a chance to stake his claim for a starting place in the long-term but it does not look like he will ever be a permanent first choice at the Bernabeu. To add to the general bad news at Real Madrid, it looks like Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is set to turn down the chance to join the European champions in order to stay at the San Mames, much to Zinedine Zidane’s chagrin. Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Marcelo, Kroos, Casemiro, Modric, Bale, Ronaldo, Mayoral. Subs: Casilla, Benzema, Theo Hernandez, Lucas Vazquez, Asensio, Isco, Kovacic. Deportivo: Ruben, Juanfran, Schar, One, Luisinho, Guilherme, Celso Borges, Mosquera, Adrian, Lucas, Andone. Subs: Pantilimon, Navarro, Colak, Carles Gil, Bakkali, Borja Valle, Edu Exposito. Buenos dias! Real Madrid are in fifth place in the league, which is pretty embarrassing for the all-conquering giants. Zinedine Zidane’s position is under question and Cristiano Ronaldo is doing his annual batting of the eyelids towards anyone will listen but at the same time ignore that he is nowhere near his best. They have not won any of their last three league games and face a tough test in the Champions League soon against Paris Saint-Germain. It is not all doom and gloom for Real as Depor are coming to town and they are even worse. They currently sit in 18th place and will face a long second half of the season trying to stay up. The arrival of right-back Eneko Boveda will not do much to inspire fans but at least they are looking to improve. No new signings for Real are in the offing but Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo are all available for once. Surely they cannot lose to Depor..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/21/turkey-starts-ground-incursion-into-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T11:20:52Z","webTitle":"Turkey starts ground incursion into Kurdish-controlled Afrin in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/turkey-starts-ground-incursion-into-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/21/turkey-starts-ground-incursion-into-kurdish-controlled-afrin-in-syria","fields":{"headline":"Turkey starts ground incursion into Kurdish-controlled Afrin in Syria","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Turkey said it had begun a ground incursion into the Kurdish enclave in Syria known as Afrin a day after intense aerial bombardment that signalled the opening of hostilities in a new phase of Ankara’s involvement in the war across the border. The launch of the ground campaign by the Turkish military on Sunday, alongside Syrian rebel factions under Ankara’s tutelage, came on the second day of a military offensive called “Operation Olive Branch” by the Turkish government, with dozens of airstrikes hitting more than 150 targets in the Kurdish-dominated district from late on Saturday afternoon. Kurdish militias shelled the Turkish province of Kilis across the border in response. One person was killed and 32 wounded after a missile from Syria struck the Turkish bordertown of Reyhanli. A spokesman for the Kurdish militias that control the Afrin enclave said they had blocked the Turkish army-led initial attempt at a ground incursion on Sunday morning. “The Turkish army and its Syrian agent factions have not entered one inch of Afrin district inside Syria,” the spokesman claimed. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, vowed on Sunday that the campaign would be over in a “short time” and warned Kurdish political activists in Turkey against staging protests. “This is a national struggle,” he told a rally in Bursa. “We will crush anyone who opposes our national struggle.” Turkey said it was launching the Afrin campaign to clear out the People’s Protection Units (YPG) and its political arm, the Democratic Union party (PYD), from the district. Ankara regards them as part of the Syrian wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a designated terror group that has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. Ankara has been angered by the YPG’s expansion in northern Syria and its alliance with the anti-Islamic State US-led coalition, which has backed and later armed the group as it spearheaded offensives against Isis in the region. The Afrin offensive came after a US announcement that it would train an army to patrol Syria’s borders that would include the YPG as a key component, which Turkey said was a national security threat. Turkish officials on Sunday insisted the operation in Afrin was aimed at clearing out the Kurdish militias ruling the enclave, which they insisted had repeatedly harassed and targeted Turkish positions near the border. Bekir Bozdag, the deputy prime minister and government spokesman, said in a briefing with reporters the campaign was “not against the Kurds” and that Ankara would defeat the YPG there and restore democratic institutions and infrastructure. He repeated earlier claims that the local population had suffered oppression under the Kurdish militias and would welcome Turkey’s intervention and the Ankara-backed rebels participating in the campaign. “People there are asking Turkey to cleanse the region and save them as well,” he said. There are an estimated 600,000 civilians in Afrin, and Turkey says there may be up to 10,000 YPG fighters. Turkey intervened in the war in Syria in August 2016 to limit Kurdish expansion west of the Euphrates river and to drive Isis, which controlled key border towns, from the area as well. The Afrin offensive was launched after Ankara apparently obtained Russia’s blessing, dispatching its chief of intelligence and the army’s chief of staff to Moscow in recent days. It takes place against a backdrop of deep-seated tensions with Washington and continuing military losses for the Turkey-backed opposition in Syria, where Bashar al-Assad has inched closer to a military victory in the seven-year conflict, and peace talks brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran have gone nowhere. The move has provoked fierce debate within Syria’s opposition, which has enjoyed broad Turkish backing for years. Some see it as a diversion from a campaign by the Syrian government against Idlib, the last province under rebel control, describing the Syrian rebel factions taking part in the offensive as mercenaries to Turkey’s will. Others see the offensive as a necessary measure against the YPG, which they accuse of attempting to carve out a statelet in northern Syria, displacing local Arabs and which they believe to be secretly in league with the Assad regime. Turkish officials have pledged to pursue a campaign with limited civilian casualties, but said they believed the Kurdish militias would use human shields to protect key installations. “The Turkish army wants through these military operations to inspire fear among civilians to force them from their lands and lay the ground for occupying the city,” the YPG branch in Afrin said in a statement, adding that it held both Ankara and Moscow accountable for the “massacres that will be committed in Afrin”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/22/jane-eyre-review-octagon-theatre-bolton","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T23:00:33Z","webTitle":"Jane Eyre review – gripping, good-hearted and full of gothic terror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/22/jane-eyre-review-octagon-theatre-bolton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/22/jane-eyre-review-octagon-theatre-bolton","fields":{"headline":"Jane Eyre review – gripping, good-hearted and full of gothic terror","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first thing that anyone who read Charlotte Brontë’s proto-feminist romance at a formative age will tell you about the story is the red room. There’s something about this baroque bedroom where the infant Jane is sent as punishment that haunts the imagination. Its mahogany pillars, red damask curtains and crimson bedding make her solitary confinement all the more cruel. In truth, the room occupies only half a dozen pages of the 1847 novel, much as it is just one incident among many in the Octagon’s lively adaptation. Yet its gothic terror seems to bubble up from the depths of Amanda Stoodley’s skeletal set. Not only do Chris Davey’s lights flare through the grating beneath the feet of the young Jane (a ferocious Emma Catterall the day I saw it), but the later scenes involving the deranged Bertha Mason (Leah Walker cackling in the gantry above our heads) have the same hellish hue. Red is also the colour of Bertha’s dress. It’s as if the road to emancipation needs Jane not only to find emotional, intellectual and financial independence, but also to escape the nightmare realm of primitive terrors. In this way, Jane Eyre is a tale that looks forward to #MeToo resistance even as it looks back to an age of superstition. In the title role of Elizabeth Newman’s pared-back production, Jessica Baglow captures the plain-speaking pragmatism of a woman with little on her side but righteous determination. In her prim turquoise frock and pinned-back hair, she wins us over not with flattery or frivolity but integrity and intelligence. It’s a moot point, though, whether Michael Peavoy, as her would-be lover Rochester, tips too far to the morose side of taciturn; one minute he seems attractively moody, the next plain surly. You end up willing him and Jane to get together even while doubting the wisdom of the match. The adaptation by Janys Chambers and Lorna French skips through the novel with a light and lucid touch, gaining in wry humour and pace what it loses in emotional intensity. Unburdened by heavy scenery, the cast take on a brisk catalogue of supporting roles – some a better fit than others – helping to maintain a seamless flow from scene to scene to create a gripping and good-hearted production. At the Octagon, Bolton, until 10 February.

The two-metre tall painting is a show-stopper in its own right, depicting the terrified virgin martyr St Margaret escaping from the mouth of Satan in the shape of a dragon. But its extraordinary provenance adds another layer to its story. Its sale comes as the Royal Academy of Arts prepares to open what is expected to be one of the blockbuster art shows of the year, with works from Charles I’s collection reunited for the first time in 400 years. The RA show will include about 150 works by artists including Holbein, Van Dyck, Rubens and Mantegna, many of them sold by Oliver Cromwell’s government after Charles I’s execution in 1649 and which are now stars of collections around the world. Cromwell’s government wanted to both raise money for the state and pay off Charles’s debts as quickly as possible, selling an estimated 1,500 paintings and 500 sculptures. One person owed money – £903 for various palace repairs – was John Embry, the royal plumber. A deal was offered whereby the state would give him £403 in cash and the rest could be made up with pictures. He chose 24, including the Titian, then called Margrett Afraid of a Monster, and valued at £100. Alexander Bell, co-chair of old master paintings at Sotheby’s, said that valuation was less than some of the other Titians Charles prized so much, “but more than the vast majority of works in the enormous and storied collection, including the now-world-famous Salvator Mundi by Leonardo Da Vinci at £30.” Charles I’s collection was one of the most stupendous on the planet and he particularly valued his Titians, hanging them at his palace at Whitehall. Saint Margaret hung in the same room as remarkable paintings such as the Allocution of the Marquis del Vasto to his Troops, now in the Prado collection; the Entombment of Christ, now in the Louvre; and Woman in a Fur, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The painting tells the story of Margaret of Antioch, a virgin martyr who refused to marry the prefect of Antioch and was tortured and imprisoned as a result. The legend goes that Satan appeared to her in the form of a dragon and devoured her. FShe managed to escape by using a cross to irritate the monster’s insides. Scholars believe it was painted in the mid-1560s, one of two versions on the same subject signed by Titian. The prime version is in the Prado in Madrid and scholars believe this second version would have been painted alongside it with greater assistance from his studio. Nothing is known of what Embry did with the painting, although the assumption is that he chose it in the hope of selling it on. He later became Cromwell’s surveyor general and had awkward questions to answer when the monarchy was restored. He gave the new king, Charles II, some of the paintings, but not the Titian. After Embry, the painting has been recorded in the collection of an early 18th-century Hampshire MP, Richard Norton – an eccentric known as “Mad Dick”; and the aristocratic Harcourt family of Oxfordshire. It was sold at auction in 1948, for 500 guineas, and subsequently sold by a Swiss dealer in 1959 to the forebear of the present owner. While the painting will not be in the RA show, it will be part of an online reconstruction of the collection of Charles I at Whitehall Palace. It will also be on view at Sotheby’s New York from 26 January ahead of its sale there on 1 February. It carries an estimate of $2m-3m (£1.5m-£2m). The RA show opens to the public on Saturday and will include Titians that hung alongside Saint Margaret during Charles I’s lifetime, including Supper at Emmaus, a painting often overlooked by visitors to the Louvre because it hangs in the same room as the Mona Lisa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/21/china-vows-action-after-us-warship-sails-near-south-china-sea-island","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T02:24:25Z","webTitle":"China vows action after US warship sails near South China Sea island","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/china-vows-action-after-us-warship-sails-near-south-china-sea-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/21/china-vows-action-after-us-warship-sails-near-south-china-sea-island","fields":{"headline":"China vows action after US warship sails near South China Sea island","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"China has vowed to take “necessary measures” to protect its sovereignty after a US navy destroyer sailed near a disputed shoal claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea this week. China’s foreign ministry said the missile destroyer USS Hopper came within 12 nautical miles – an internationally recognised territorial limit – of Huangyan Island, which is also known as Scarborough Shoal and subject to a rival claim by the Philippines. Two US officials confirmed it. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the patrol was in line with international law and was an “innocent passage”, in which a warship effectively recognises a territorial sea by crossing it quickly, without stopping. The US military says it carries out “freedom of navigation” operations throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations. The Pentagon did not directly comment on the latest patrol but said such operations were routine. “All operations are conducted in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the USS Hopper violated China’s sovereignty and security interests, and threatened the safety of Chinese vessels and personnel. Lu said the Chinese navy ordered the vessel to withdraw after determining its identity. The incident was the latest US naval operation challenging extensive Chinese claims in the South China Sea. The United States has criticised China for constructing islands and military installations in the sea, saying they could be used to restrict free movement in a critical global trade route. Lu said China “firmly opposes” efforts to use freedom of navigation as an excuse to hurt its sovereignty and urged the United States to “correct its mistakes”. China’s defence ministry said the repeated dispatch of US warships to the region was “undermining regional peace and stability” and hurting bilateral relations. Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Pentagon appeared determined to keep up regular freedom of navigation patrols in the sea, with one every six weeks or so, in spite of Chinese objections. “The last made public was in October, but we should expect that there was at least one other in the interim,” he said. “The only time word is getting out these days is if Beijing makes an issue of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/20/theresa-may-i-will-fine-greedy-bosses","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May: I will fine greedy bosses who betray their workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/theresa-may-i-will-fine-greedy-bosses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/20/theresa-may-i-will-fine-greedy-bosses","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May: I will fine greedy bosses who betray their workers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Irresponsible company bosses who “line their own pockets” while failing to protect workers’ pension schemes are to be hit with huge fines, under plans to be announced by Theresa May’s government within weeks. Writing in the Observer after a week which saw the collapse of Carillion, the construction and outsourcing giant, with a deficit in its pension scheme of up to £900m, the prime minister says her government will act urgently to stamp out “abuse”. A total of 28,000 members of Carillion’s 13 pension schemes are facing a cut to their retirement funds. Other measures being considered for inclusion in a white paper in March would give regulators new powers to block or place conditions on takeovers that are deemed to put pension schemes at risk. The regulator will also be given the power to request information about how companies run schemes. Resurrecting a commitment with which she launched her premiership – to govern “not for a privileged few, but for every one of us” – May says that while governments should not get involved in day-to-day management of businesses, the state should act now “in favour of ordinary working people”. While the measures will be welcomed by millions of workers, May’s move to intervene directly in the financial affairs of companies is likely to antagonise Tory backers in the City. Referring to company bosses who put their own financial interests, and those of shareholders, above their workers, May says “tough new rules” will be introduced to tackle the behaviour of “executives who try to line their own pockets by putting their workers’ pensions at risk – an unacceptable abuse that we will end”. It is understood that the pensions regulator will be given specific powers to issue punitive fines on company directors in cases of clear wrongdoing. Criticising a business culture which too often prioritises immediate financial rewards over long-term stability, she adds: “Too often we’ve seen top executives reaping big bonuses for recklessly putting short-term profit ahead of long-term success. Our best businesses know that is not a responsible way to run a business and those who do so will be forced to explain themselves.” Among radical potential measures that have been discussed in Whitehall are plans that would leave individual executives personally liable for hefty financial punishments if their companies’ pension schemes collapse. One proposal is for regulators to be empowered to claw back executives’ bonuses after a company and its pension system go to the wall. The all-party work and pensions committee has recommended a system of “mega fines” on executives who crash their companies and their pension schemes. The committee chair, the Labour MP Frank Field, says such fines would act as a “nuclear deterrent” against abuse and negligent approaches to pensions. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at the pensions company Royal London, said: “The last Conservative manifesto floated ideas of tackling firms who put executive pay and dividends ahead of the pension fund, and the Carillion scandal has given that new urgency. “The prime minister will want to see bonuses clawed back from executives who steer a company onto the rocks, and will want new powers to block takeovers that could threaten the pension scheme. The government could also make sure that ‘recovery plans’ to tackle pension scheme deficits are tougher, putting the pension fund further up the queue relative to dividends and bonuses. “The Treasury and the business department will be hostile to these sorts of ideas and will not want regulators interfering in the business decisions of corporate Britain. Despite the idealistic rhetoric, I would expect any actual action to be some years away and reserved only for the most extreme cases.” May’s pledge comes as she faces renewed criticism from some Tory MPs for a lack of willingness to back radical policies. Nick Boles, a former minister, warned last week of a timidity at the heart of her administration. Field said: “The prime minister said when she first entered Downing Street that she would be on the side of hardworking British people and those who were the underdogs. “The reforms suggested by the committee – including mega-fines on individuals who crash their companies and pension funds – gives her an opportunity to get on the front foot with this agenda.” Parliamentary inquiries are already being set up into how the funding shortfall in Carillion’s pension scheme widened before the business’s spectacular collapse. Its deficit rose from £317m in 2015 to £587m by the end of 2016. The final figure is believed to be high as £900m. With its pension problems mounting, Carillion controversially changed the rules in 2016 to prevent any clawing back of executives’ bonuses should the business eventually collapse. The government has come under pressure to limit the damage to pension funds from reckless employers since the collapse in 2016 of BHS, the retailer that went into administration with a large black hole in its final salary retirement scheme – and despite paying hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends to its owner Sir Philip Green’s wife, Tina.A consultation green paper last year signalled that ministers planned to get tough with employers who failed to tackle large deficits in their pension funds. Employers’ lobby groups have argued that increased powers for the pensions regulator would give it undue influence in the running of companies already struggling to juggle the competing demands of shareholders, employees and the need to invest in new equipment. They have pushed back against proposals to allow the regulator to block executive bonuses and dividend payments, arguing that they are intrusive and draconian limits on private enterprises. A pensions expert, John Ralfe, said the regulator was unlikely to want extra powers that could lead it into protracted disputes with companies about the level of payouts to shareholders and directors. He said the government should move from a “DIY regulation that judges each scheme on an individual basis” to a blanket rule that forces all final salary pension schemes to measure their liabilities in the same way and reduce deficits over the same time. Currently, the regulator agrees a separate plan with each employer to determine how long it needs to close its pension deficit. This can range from five to 20 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/20/british-top-art-galleries-investigate-sexual-misconduct","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T21:03:45Z","webTitle":"Top British art galleries investigate sexual misconduct","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/20/british-top-art-galleries-investigate-sexual-misconduct","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/20/british-top-art-galleries-investigate-sexual-misconduct","fields":{"headline":"Top British art galleries investigate sexual misconduct","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At least 10 investigations into sexual misconduct have taken place at Britain’s largest galleries and museums over the past four years. The inquiries included two at the V&amp;A, in 2011-12 and 2015-16, which were accompanied by police investigations. They led to the dismissal of two staff members after one verdict of sexual misconduct and another of “stalking and gender violence”. The UK art world has come under the spotlight following allegations, published in the Observer last Sunday, against the powerful British dealer and philanthropist Anthony d’Offay. The gallerist, who gave a £125m art collection to the nation, denies three women’s allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour dating from 1997 to 2004. In answer to a freedom of information request, the Tate, which manages the d’Offay collection, said it had received no formal allegations of sexual harassment or other forms of sexual misconduct over the past four years. Its catering division did receive three formal complaints, one in 2015 and two in 2017, all from female workers about male colleagues. The Science Museum awarded two members of staff payments in relation to cases, while two staff left as a result of the investigations. The National Gallery has received three allegations, resulting in the departure of three of its staff. The National History Museum referred to one incident, but withheld details. Royal Museums Greenwich said it had carried out a disciplinary investigation in 2015-16, resulting in one dismissal. The British Museum, National Museums Scotland, and the Imperial War Museum said they had received no such allegations in that period. Sarah McCrory, the director of Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art and a signatory to a recent letter denouncing sexual harassment and abuses of power in the art world, said: “These are the well-funded institutions with dedicated HR departments, as opposed to the huge number of smaller organisations, commercial galleries and other art spaces that have no system to support staff if issues arise. The art world is still a difficult place to have open and frank conversations about workplace bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and other types of inappropriate behaviour, andPeople in positions of power need to do more to support their artists and employees.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/20/un-de-sceaux-ascot-willie-mullins-the-new-one-haydock-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T17:44:14Z","webTitle":"Willie Mullins’ Un De Sceaux proves an ‘iron horse’ with Ascot hat-trick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/20/un-de-sceaux-ascot-willie-mullins-the-new-one-haydock-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/20/un-de-sceaux-ascot-willie-mullins-the-new-one-haydock-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Willie Mullins’ Un De Sceaux proves an ‘iron horse’ with Ascot hat-trick","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Un De Sceaux was hailed by his connections as “an iron horse” after slogging to victory in Ascot’s Clarence House Chase, becoming the first to win the race three times. The same label could also be applied with at least as much justice to The New One, who achieved a fourth consecutive win in the day’s other major race, Haydock’s Champion Hurdle Trial. Known as a front-runner, Un De Sceaux was in the unusual position of being 10 lengths off the paceon Saturday, thanks to a swashbuckling speed set by the 16-1 shot Speredek. A progressive handicapper who had won five of his last six, Speredek stayed so far in front for so long that his Betfair odds dropped to 9-2 before a couple of tired-looking jumps up the side of the course. Those allowed his rivals to close up behind him, none moving with more obvious purpose than Un De Sceaux, who led over the second-last. That was the point at which victory became almost certain, as the novice Brain Power stepped into the fence and fell. Speredek was able to hold on to second place, finishing a respectful seven lengths behind the winner. “To do that three years running on two different tracks on what looked very tacky ground is great,” said the winning trainer, Willie Mullins, alluding to the Clarence House being staged at Cheltenham last year. “It looks like he’s racing a lot more relaxed nowadays, which means we can ride him differently. “We thought there might be a couple of front-runners today, so Paul [Townend] said he was happy enough to let them go if they wanted to, and sure enough there was a front-runner in there and it suited us. He’s an iron horse and takes his training very seriously every morning.” Townend also applied the “iron horse” tag to Un De Sceaux, adding: “He gallops through that ground better than any horse I’ve ever ridden.” Brain Power reportedly made a noise before he came down and may now be considered for a wind operation. His claims for the Arkle Trophy now have an unpromising look, his jumping having let him down twice in a row, and he was pushed out to 16-1 from 12-1 for the Cheltenham Festival race. The New One briefly looked in trouble at Haydock when, after leading from the outset, he was passed on the run-in by the strong-travelling Ch’Tibello. But the 10-year-old, now a veteran of 36 races, put his head down and battled dourly, hitting the line with far more momentum than his rival and scoring by half a length. Sam Twiston-Davies, enjoying his 18th success aboard The New One, said he would have to consider naming his house after the horse, his share of the prize money having covered the mortgage. Sam’s father, Nigel, who trains the winner, rejoiced in seeing off a significant rival: “They try and play cat and mouse – ‘Oh, we’ll stalk him, we’ll overtake him’ – no, they can’t. He’s much too tough.” For all his many wins, The New One has been a source of discord between the two Twiston-Davieses over the years, as to his appropriate Festival target. While Sam has favoured a tilt at the three-mile Stayers Hurdle, Nigel has always ended up running him in the Champion Hurdle, in which his pace has been repeatedly found wanting. This time, both are pointing towards the longer race and Nigel conceded he would have gone that way last year, had the Champion not begun to look more like the softer option. Asked whether The New One would see out the extra distance in March, the trainer said: “We’re not going to try beforehand, we’ll just go there and see. If he does stay, he’ll be able to sit there and he’s got that turn of foot that probably none of the stayers have got.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/illiberal-world-order-we-need-new-ways-to-defend-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"In an illiberal world order, we need new ways to defend human rights | Alexander Betts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/illiberal-world-order-we-need-new-ways-to-defend-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/illiberal-world-order-we-need-new-ways-to-defend-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"In an illiberal world order, we need new ways to defend human rights","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, recently announced he would not be seeking a second term in office. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication... lessening the independence and integrity of my voice,” he explained. His vivid words implied that human rights advocacy has become untenable and this statement of resignation – from a highly respected and effective voice – is a tragic indictment of the current state of play. Consider, for a start, the Trump administration’s record, including attempts to ban Muslim travel and exclude transgender people from the military, and how it highlights a UN system now deprived of an important historical champion. What’s more, faced with rising populist nationalism, European states have largely failed to fill the void and the continent’s treatment of refugees has seriously damaged its moral authority. Deprived, then, of its traditional liberal democratic allies, the UN system appears increasingly toothless. It effectively operates as a peer network and without strong government leadership, it struggles to bring about change. Instead, for the “west”, arms exports to Saudi Arabia, migration deals with Turkey and trade deals with China have been prioritised over speaking out on human rights. And the consequences of silence and complicity have been manifest – from slaughter and starvation in Yemen to forced repatriation of the Rohingya, impunity in Syria and extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. However, the mood of resignation is premature and wrongheaded. It is time to fight for human rights – but equally time to reimagine how they are achieved in a changing world. And this requires leadership from within and beyond the UN system. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which heralded a historical period during which a swath of treaties were agreed. These treaties are among the great achievements of the 20th century and must be maintained. But alone they are insufficient to ensure compliance and implementation. Reminding governments that they are breaking the laws they signed up to is no longer working. The temptation for UN agencies is to try to see out the current impasse and hope for a return of the bygone era. The problem with this strategy, however, is that the current geopolitical climate may not be a blip but instead result from fundamental changes. The rise of “multi-polarity” – where power is widely dispersed among nations – may indefinitely deprive the human rights system its “enforcer of last resort”. Meanwhile, populist nationalism could be a long-term feature of the political landscape. Sustaining a viable human rights system in the new world order will require adaptation and innovation. First, non-traditional players can play a significant role. Last week, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, suggested that the story of 2017 was one of quietly effective resistance. These scattered successes were the result of political mobilisation by small groups of states, filling the void left by others and often working with civil society. For example, the Netherlands led a coalition at the human rights council to investigate Saudi-backed atrocities in Yemen. Iceland led the council to condemn Rodrigo Duterte’s backing for summary executions in the Philippines’ war on drugs. Second, “constructive engagement” offers hope. Reporting violations and resorting to legal channels, including courts, to assert human rights law can influence state behaviour, but it doesn’t always. In areas such as alternatives to detention for asylum seekers and police reform, working with states to identify “good practices” that better reconcile national interests with human rights can bring more success. Third: transnational action. If traditional intergovernmental mechanisms are failing, let’s find ways to bypass them. States are not the only route to progress. Press investigations, businesses managing their global supply chain, charities tackling modern slavery and environmental standards all have implications for human rights. They respond to consumers and shareholders rather than voters and their choices can influence elite political preferences, even in authoritarian regimes. In 1961, an article published in the Observer led to the creation of Amnesty International. More recently, the transnational media investigation into slavery in the Thai prawn processing market led to major global retailers being exposed, passing pressure on to their Thai suppliers, which were forced to commit to reform. Thai law changed, arrests were made. Serious questions remain about slavery within the industry, but progress has been made. And yet business is still not a central focus of the human rights system. There are also new technologies available to empower transnational civil society. Though the extent of tech influence can be debated, the Arab spring revealed the rapidity with which the internet can now mobilise action. And yet there has been too little systematic reflection on how this can change the business model of the human rights system. How, for instance, can a digital world offer greater protection from reprisals and lend voice to human rights defenders? To be effective, human rights defenders need to be technologically ahead of repressive regimes. And this requires a system with technological capacity. Promoting human rights in a multipolar world of rising nationalism will not be easy. But the core principles developed over the past 70 years are needed now at least as much as at any time in that period. The system requires innovation, not resignation. It needs us all to work together to overcome collective indifference. The reinvigoration of human rights must entail a commitment to justice and inalienable rights at every level of society. But it also requires strategic, entrepreneurial and creative thinking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/20/rory-mcilroy-prime-position-abu-dhabi-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T13:32:39Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy puts himself in prime position for victory on return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/20/rory-mcilroy-prime-position-abu-dhabi-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/20/rory-mcilroy-prime-position-abu-dhabi-championship","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy puts himself in prime position for victory on return","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Rory McIlroy need not have bothered expressing a belief of being “rejuvenated and refocused”. Demonstration of that has been delivered in Abu Dhabi, with McIlroy’s round-by-round improvement. From the earlier position of the 28-year-old’s fitness and attitude being questioned, it would now be a disappointment if McIlroy does not mark this return to competitive action with victory. He will begin the fourth round one shot from the lead – held jointly by Thomas Pieters and Ross Fisher – after backing up the promise of a 69 and a 66 with a 65. Fisher, who also signed for a third-round 65, has Pieters for company at 17 under par. McIlroy is quite right to point to the long game, of setting standards on this comeback he hopes will resonate for the remainder of his career. Still, there is little doubt plenty of people have eyes fixed on the potentially seismic story of a first victory after 16 injury-disrupted months. “It was another great round and another really good confidence builder,” McIlroy said. “Not just for this week but for the rest of the season. Winning would mean a lot. I’ve had a lot of close calls here, about six top-threes or something like that. “I’ve never won my first start back out. It’s felt like a while since I’ve won and just to give myself these chances; I gave myself a chance at the end of the year [in the British Masters] at Close House and wasn’t able to do it. Paul Dunne played too well for me. I’m excited to get back on the horse. “I felt really comfortable, really relaxed. I haven’t been looking at leaderboards too much. Just been trying to play my game and it’s going pretty well so far, so I’ll try to do the same thing.” The third round witnessed vintage McIlroy, not just in terms of scoring but creativity. One of the game's natural artists had worried in recent times he was becoming one dimensional, with that fear sufficient for the four-times major champion to mix up his practice regime. The result is already obvious, with McIlroy displaying the range of shots that set him apart from so many others. “I hit a little eight iron into 14, which was probably a nine-iron yardage,” McIlroy said. “I just didn’t feel comfortable with it so I just sawed off a little eight iron. I’m really comfortable with those shots. Those are shots I worked on a lot over the last three months.” A McIlroy run without a dropped shot reached hole 51 before trouble ensued. He found the greenside bunker at the 15th, from where there was precious little green to work. McIlroy took two to get out of the trap, rendering his four – as completed from the fringe of the green – a decent effort. On the 17th, McIlroy chipped in for a birdie to offset the earlier and minor damage. Dustin Johnson’s 68 means he is not out of the equation at minus 12. Matthew Fitzpatrick, who is alongside Tommy Fleetwood at 15 under, blasted himself firmly into the mix with a 63.

The accusations from the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), Jeremy Newmark, came as party sources told the Observer that a group of members, including activists and councillors, was preparing legal action against the party for failing to act on complaints about antisemitic incidents, some of which date back more than six months. Newmark said the delays in dealing with many cases raised serious questions about whether the party had learnt lessons after an inquiry last year by Labour peer and former head of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti. Newmark said: “We remain seriously concerned about what is now a vast backlog of cases involving alleged antisemitism that appear to be stuck in the system, in some cases for over a year. That is not a good indicator of the party having embraced Shami Chakrabarti’s imperative to adopt a gold standard in dealing with antisemitism. “We will be closely monitoring the outcomes of a number of high-profile cases due to be determined by the national constitutional committee over the weeks ahead. These include former Momentum vice-chair Jackie Walker and [activist] Marc Wadsworth [who are to contest the accusations]. “The second investigation into Ken Livingstone appears to be stuck in limbo, which is incredibly worrying given that Jeremy Corbyn personally assured me that the former mayor of London would be held to account for the renewed offence that he caused after his previous NCC hearing. It is imperative that this is addressed in advance of the forthcoming local elections [in May].” Several Labour MPs and senior officials have also expressed private concerns that – despite promises by the leadership to show “zero tolerance” in cases where antisemitism had been alleged – the party had been slow to investigate. In some cases where complaints had been found to have had substance, the party had recommended surprisingly lenient punishment. Confidential documents leaked to the Observer, which were presented to members of the national executive committee last week, showed that in one case an activist who had defended his use of the word “Yids” had been found by a party inquiry to have fallen short of acceptable standards. The leaked Labour party report said he had demonstrated signs of “a deeply prejudiced view of Jewish people’s concerns about antisemitism, as well as unacceptable views about terminology that is appropriate to use to describe Jewish people”. Despite this, the leaked papers, detailing the results of the party’s internal report into the case, did not recommend either that the party member be expelled or that his case be referred to the higher investigative body, the NCC, which deals with the most serious complaints. Instead they recommended that he receive an official warning from the NEC and that he undertake “training” about antisemitism from the JLM. One Labour MP said that if the party had been serious, the party member should have been immediately expelled. In the end, however, he was referred to the NCC. The MP added that the leaked documents “show the party is showing tolerance, not zero tolerance towards antisemitism, even in cases where it has found complaints that have substance”. Last April, Livingstone avoided expulsion from the party after an NCC disciplinary panel ruled he should be suspended for another year for bringing the party into disrepute over comments about antisemitism, Hitler and Zionism. He was censured after having suggested that Hitler at one point supported Zionism, and for defending the Labour MP Naz Shah over an antisemitic Facebook post for which she subsequently apologised. Livingstone’s defiant reaction to the suspension caused further outrage among Labour MPs, many of whom were already dismayed at what they saw as a far too lenient ruling. Corbyn said that the former mayor’s comments after the ruling would be the subject of further investigations by the NEC after representations from party members. Labour MPs and other sources in the party believe that the investigation and any further decisions about Livingstone, whose two-year suspension from the party ends in April, have been delayed until after May’s local elections to avoid the dispute damaging the party’s chances – something members of the JLM say would be entirely unacceptable if true. The Labour party refused to comment, confirming merely that Livingstone was suspended."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/20/sinn-fein-to-be-led-by-a-woman-mary-lou-mcdonald-for-the-first-time-in-its-modern-history","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T12:28:39Z","webTitle":"Sinn Féin to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/20/sinn-fein-to-be-led-by-a-woman-mary-lou-mcdonald-for-the-first-time-in-its-modern-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/20/sinn-fein-to-be-led-by-a-woman-mary-lou-mcdonald-for-the-first-time-in-its-modern-history","fields":{"headline":"Sinn Féin to be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sinn Féin will be led by a woman for the first time in its modern history, with the party’s Mary Lou McDonald the only candidate to replace Gerry Adams. The Dublin TD (MP) will be unopposed when Sinn Féin delegates elect a new president at a special conference, Ard Fheis, in February. McDonald was confirmed on Saturday as the only party member to come forward to succeed Adams, who is resigning from the post he has held since 1983. The Trinity College Dublin graduate will also become the first Sinn Féin leader in modern times with no direct association with the IRA or its armed campaign during the Northern Ireland Troubles. Adams welcomed McDonald to a meeting of the party’s ruling body – the Ard Comhairle – on Saturday, saying: “Please welcome the president-elect of our party, Mary Lou McDonald.” He then spoke about a fresh round of political negotiations starting on Wednesday aimed at restoring power sharing in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionists will be the key parties. “We have to challenge ourselves and our support base. We also have to challenge unionism,” Adams said, justifying Sinn Féin’s participation in the talks. “Whether the upcoming talks succeed or not in the short term, there is no merit in Sinn Féin disengaging from the conversations and dialogue with unionists and others that is necessary – in whatever format is appropriate in the time ahead.” McDonald’s rise to power in Sinn Féin may make it easier for other parties in the Irish Republic to enter a coalition with a party which for decades had to justify the IRA’s violent campaign. Her main focus will be on the next general election in the Republic, which could come as early as spring. She has been a TD for Dublin Central in the Dail since 2011 and previously served as an MEP for the Irish capital. In the 1990s McDonald was briefly a member of the larger opposition party in the Republic, Fianna Fáil. However, Ed Moloney, a leading authority on Irish republicanism and author of The Secret History of the IRA, doubted that either Adams or the military organisation would loosen its influence on Sinn Féin. Moloney said: “I do not believe the IRA has gone away nor the influence of its leaders, eg Adams et al, nor have I come across any evidence that the famous IRA dictum – that SF should be under army control at all levels – has been reversed or ditched. The IRA’s failure to say anything to the contrary publicly leads one to suspect that is deliberate.” This article was amended on 21 January 2018 to correct the year of McDonald’s election as a TD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/we-have-all-visited-land-of-idiocy-ben-bradley-still-lives-there","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:03:06Z","webTitle":"We’ve all visited the land of idiocy – but Ben Bradley still lives there | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/we-have-all-visited-land-of-idiocy-ben-bradley-still-lives-there","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/we-have-all-visited-land-of-idiocy-ben-bradley-still-lives-there","fields":{"headline":"We’ve all visited the land of idiocy – but Ben Bradley still lives there","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Digital footprints really can be a bind. One minute, you’re a YouTube sensation being paid thousands to appear on a reality TV show; the next, you’re in the tabloids for saying something racist, sexist or a bit of both when you were 14. In some ways, it’s fitting that Ben Bradley, the Conservatives’ vice-chair for youth, should have experienced what is a particularly adolescent kind of disgrace. Last week, Buzzfeed News unearthed some of his old blogposts, in which a 22-year-old Bradley had written that vasectomies could be one way to stop unemployed people, or “a vast sea of unemployed wasters”, as he put it, having too many kids. It’s almost an exact rerun of what happened to Labour’s Jared O’Mara last year, when offensive posts he had made to a music forum in 2004 were unearthed. Naturally Bradley – Al Murray, if he’d become an estate agent instead of a pub landlord – has apologised. “My time in politics has allowed me to mature and I now realise that this language is not appropriate,” he said. It’s not so much a rejection of the sentiment, then, as the language and it’s such an “I’m sorry if you were upset” move that I’m surprised the Tories aren’t making him sleep in the spare room. The occasionally viral LBC radio host James O’Brien defended Bradley on air, suggesting that everyone should be allowed to make mistakes in their early 20s and that if we don’t forgive youthful indiscretions, we’ll be left with a strange breed of politicians who are suspiciously thick-skinned and impervious to criticism. Most people are idiots in their early 20s. I was an idiot in my early 20s. My time as an adult has allowed me to mature and I now realise that the following beliefs are no longer appropriate: that coats on a night out are a southern affectation, that the Klaxons deserved to win the Mercury prize over Amy Winehouse and that wine is a suitable mixer for spirits. But surely there has to be a cut-off point and surely, for 28-year-old Bradley, 22 is pushing it. I don’t mean to show off here, but even in my idiotic youth, I didn’t think that sterilisation was a way of preventing poor people from breeding, nor did I think police brutality was a fair response to the 2011 riots. I just thought frosted tips were a reasonable addition to any head of hair and for that I apologise wholeheartedly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/20/juliet-naked-review-rose-byrne-superb-nick-hornby-sundance","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T13:00:52Z","webTitle":"Juliet, Naked review – superb Rose Byrne can't stop Hornby tale falling flat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/20/juliet-naked-review-rose-byrne-superb-nick-hornby-sundance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/20/juliet-naked-review-rose-byrne-superb-nick-hornby-sundance","fields":{"headline":"Juliet, Naked review – superb Rose Byrne can't stop Hornby tale falling flat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It takes a lot of effort to take a film which stars Rose Byrne and still make it mediocre, but, by God, director Jesse Peretz is up to the challenge. Based on a far-fetched novel by Nick Hornby, Juliet, Naked concerns a woman approaching middle age in an English seaside town becoming slowly aware that she’s stuck in a horrible rut. Her long-term boyfriend Duncan (Chris O’Dowd) teaches television studies at a local college (and his glossary handouts for The Wire are, admittedly, hilarious), but his primary joy in life is analyzing the work of a forgotten 1990s indie rock star named Tucker Crowe. Crowe (Ethan Hawke) released one beloved album, called Juliet, then vanished midway through a gig. Duncan and a handful of Crowe enthusiasts analyze his lyrics and trade theories of his whereabouts on a website. It’s not a hobby, it’s infatuation. Annie (Byrne) doesn’t much care for Crowe, and she certainly is annoyed at Duncan’s obsession. When Duncan gets an advance pressing of unreleased stripped-down demos of Crowe’s classic album (the Juliet, Naked of the title) Duncan is moved to tears. But Annie just hears half-baked versions of songs she’s sick to death of. She leaves a snarky comment on Duncan’s blog saying just as much, and that leads to an email from the long-missing Tucker Crowe himself. The two begin a correspondence. I’m gonna skip over a great deal to the bit to where Crowe ends up singing a Kinks song in the silly 1960s-themed town festival, the boozy mayor falsely introducing him as a Grammy-award winning artist. It’s reaching for that whimsical small British village vibe in movies that so frequently wins over this Yank’s heart. But I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen something fall so flat. There’s also an awkward scene in which all of Crowe’s children (there are various mothers) collect at the foot of his hospital bed so all can bicker. Again, this is meant to show off an array of lovably “real” characters venting their frustration, but it’s all so very rote. What’s more, most of these characters aren’t heard from again, so none of this drama pays off. Hawke is believable as the rocker and deadbeat dad, but maybe that’s just a holdover from the vastly superior Boyhood. When he slips into the wounded romantic role, it’s reminiscent of Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy. Being reminded of other, better films hardly does this one a service. O’Dowd is funny, but his character is such a putz that it’s impossible to have any sympathy for him. He’s not so much a continuation of the typical music-obsessed Nick Hornby character but a cartoon version of one. At center, though, there’s Byrne, and good luck not falling for her charms. Annie’s frustration with Duncan, and bonding with Crowe’s young son, all hinge on such finely observed little moments. She doesn’t have loud, demonstrative scenes of hysteria: she is an intelligent, witty and well put-together woman seizing an opportunity and leaving as little destruction in her wake as possible. (To this movie’s great credit, it ends happily but not sappy.) It’s unfortunate that Byrne’s offering such a tremendous performance in a film that is, to put it as bluntly as possible, so very dumb. I pride myself with an ability to suspend disbelief, but to do so with this story would need a crane. There are still laughs, and anything starring Byrne deserves attention, but this will ultimately end up with other demo-tape collections in the curiosity bin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/20/government-shutdown-donald-trump-democrats-republicans-womens-march","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T23:34:18Z","webTitle":"US government shutdown: anniversary of Trump inauguration marred by chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/20/government-shutdown-donald-trump-democrats-republicans-womens-march","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/20/government-shutdown-donald-trump-democrats-republicans-womens-march","fields":{"headline":"US government shutdown: anniversary of Trump inauguration marred by chaos","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s first anniversary in office was marked by the turbulence and division that have defined his presidency, with a government shutdown and protests in cities across the country. Up to 800,000 federal workers were told to stay home after the White House and Congress failed to strike a compromise on a government spending bill. Workers deemed essential and armed forces personnel were asked to stay at work. If the shutdown continues, they will probably go unpaid. Armed services personnel abroad got their first taste of the cuts when they were told they would not be able to watch Sunday’s NFL playoff games, because the armed forces broadcasting network had shut down. With crisis talks under way, Trump cancelled a trip to his Florida retreat at Mar-a-Lago, where he had hoped to celebrate his year in office at a gala dinner. Instead, as protesters marked their own anniversary of major anti-Trump demonstrations outside the White House and in other major cities, the president stayed in Washington, firing off angry tweets. Trump sought to blame Democrats for the shutdown, claiming they were putting immigrants before other Americans. Democrats blamed Trump, for walking away from a compromise over the future of young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers. They pointed out that the shutdown, the first since October 2013, was the first when one party controlled all three branches of government. At a press conference, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, alluded to a tweet Trump wrote in May 2017, saying a shutdown would be good for the country. “Happy anniversary Mr President, your wish came true,” Pelosi said. “You won the shutdown. The shutdown is all yours.” Addressing the House, the Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, said: “Senate Democrats refuse to fund the government unless we agree to their demands on something entirely unrelated. They want a deal on immigration. And then they’ll think about reopening the government.” Saturday’s talks were focused on passing a stopgap spending measure. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said Trump was being updated and had been in touch with Republican leaders. At a White House briefing, the director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, signalled a concession when he said Trump would sign a resolution to keep the government funded for three weeks. The spending bill rejected by the Senate late Friday night would have kept the government open for four. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), Obama-era legislation that allowed approximately 700,000 Dreamers to stay in the country, is set to expire on 5 March after being rescinded by Trump. Democrats have refused to support any spending bill that does not restore such protection. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said in a statement he believed a continuing resolution “through 8 February” and a commitment to “seek resolution on immigration, disaster relief, military and government funding, Chip [children’s health insurance], and other healthcare related issues” would pass the upper chamber. But Short said Senate Democrats were “basically conducting a two-year-old temper tantrum in front of the American people” and said: “We will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of tax-paying Americans, including hundreds of thousands of our troops in uniform and border agents protecting our country, are held hostage by Senate Democrats.” The White House budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, accused the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of lying about his Friday meeting with Trump. Trump and Schumer shared a cheeseburger lunch at the White House. The president reportedly agreed to more time for a deal on Dreamers in return for more defence spending, funding for a border wall and tougher enforcement of immigration law. But the deal frayed and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and an immigration hardliner, called Schumer to kill the talks. On Saturday, Schumer said dealing with President Trump was “like negotiating with Jello”, later adding that this was “because he can’t stick to the terms”. Schumer’s No 2 in the Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said a bipartisan group of senators had been on the verge of an agreement late on Friday, only for Ryan to inform his counterparts in the Senate that House Republicans would not agree to it. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, insisted in an email the speaker and McConnell had been “in communication and full agreement throughout”. The Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey said Republicans had ceded their negotiating position to a bloc of hardline House conservatives. “I was not elected to genuflect to the Freedom Caucus,” Casey said, before walking to the floor to vote down the funding measure that passed the House on Thursday. By Saturday morning, it appeared the White House had calculated that the Democrats had made themselves vulnerable to blame. In a CNN poll, 31% blamed Democrats for the shutdown, 26% blamed Republicans and 21% held Trump responsible. Although there is broad support for protecting Dreamers, a majority thought it was more important to avoid a shutdown. On Capitol Hill, there was some optimism. Emerging from a bipartisan meeting of around 20 senators, Graham said progress had made with McConnell agreeing to only a three-week funding bill and promising the Senate would address key issues. However, citing his colleague Lamar Alexander, Graham said “shutting down the government as a negotiating tool is what chemical warfare is to war”. Others who did not attended that meeting felt cautiously hopeful. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, said there was “certainly a real possibility [of a deal] if there’s good faith on both sides”. In his view, Friday night saw “the first real serious negotiations about this [spending bill] which only happened because of the vote result”. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, said Democrats “may have wanted to bring out their Trump posters for a couple of days, show their extreme elements of the party that they were with them”. Trump’s presidential campaign released a new ad – which claimed Democrats were “complicit in all murders by illegal immigrants”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/21/democracy-is-more-fragile-than-many-of-us-realised-but-do-not-believe-that-it-is-doomed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T00:05:06Z","webTitle":"Democracy is more fragile than many of us realised, but don’t believe that it is doomed | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/democracy-is-more-fragile-than-many-of-us-realised-but-do-not-believe-that-it-is-doomed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/democracy-is-more-fragile-than-many-of-us-realised-but-do-not-believe-that-it-is-doomed","fields":{"headline":"Democracy is more fragile than many of us realised, but don’t believe that it is doomed","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nothing ages so badly as visions of the future. When the fall of the Berlin Wall was followed by the implosion of the Soviet Union, Francis Fukuyama celebrated by publishing his bestseller, The End of History and the Last Man. The book argued that, with the demise of its main ideological competitor, the world would belong to liberal democracy. He has been much mocked since for failing to foresee that democracy would face the emergence of fresh threats and the resurgence of old foes in new guises in the shape of nationalism, religious extremism, autocratic capitalism, unaccountable tech titans, cyber warfare and even, in the case of North Korea, legacy Stalinism. But fair’s fair. For a while at least, his thesis was true. The end of the Cold War accelerated what is sometimes referred to as “the third wave” of democratisation in the late 20th century. The peoples of eastern Europe were liberated to choose their own governments. African presidents-for-life were sent into retirement. Much of Latin America, once a grisly tableau of coups, insurgencies, juntas and death squads, embraced the tenets of democracy. India was no longer a shining exception to autocracy in developing Asia, as more of the world’s most populous continent followed the democratic path. By the turn of the century, more than 100 countries could be reasonably classified as democracies, albeit often flawed ones. A hundred years before, you could barely find 10 democracies on the world map. If your definition of democracy includes, as really it ought to, women having the vote, then there was New Zealand by 1900 and some bits of Australia and that was it. Democracy won the 20th century. The hubristic mistake was to think that this trend was so powerful that it could not be reversed. The size of that error is illustrated by the latest report from Freedom House, a non-partisan thinktank that conducts an annual audit of global freedom. The fundamentals of democracy, particularly regular and honest elections, a free media, the rule of law and the rights of minorities, are under attack around the world. Last year was the 12th consecutive one in which the number of countries becoming more free were outnumbered by those becoming less so. The report’s authors conclude that “democracy is in crisis”. Does the evidence justify this alarming assessment? Some autocratic brutes have been given the boot, among them Robert Mugabe, whose removal at least gives the possibility of a better future for Zimbabwe. Many countries remain robustly democratic. Britons may feel a squeak of patriotic pride that Freedom House awards a high 94 points to our country. You have to be Scandinavian to achieve the maximum 100. It is hard, though, to disagree that the big picture is a negative one. From Venezuela to the Philippines, more countries have become less free. And many of those countries that remain democracies are becoming more dysfunctional. The charnel house that is Syria is a daily reminder that the hopes associated with the Arab spring have crumbled into the dust. Tunisia, democracy’s lonely outpost in the Arab world, is now very troubled. Closer to home, there is the slide into autocratic rule in Turkey and creeping authoritarianism in Poland and Hungary, countries that had been presumed to be permanent gains for liberal democracy. The danger here is not so much the old spectre of tanks on the streets. The dismantling of freedom begins with attacks on what some call “the soft guard rails” of democracy: unfettered media, an independent judiciary, a basic level of respect for political opponents. Freedom is not devoured in one gulp, but in a series of bite-size chunks. Political scientists are conducting a lively argument about how worried we should be and what has caused this global retreat, but I think we can pick out some clear drivers of what has gone wrong. Start with the democratic victors of the Cold War. Their cohesion and confidence are being corroded by economic pressures, social inequalities, rebellions against the consequences of globalisation and a resurgence of nationalism and regionalism. Populists of left and right have exploited voter anger to gain support and parliamentary seats across Europe. The result is that they have got into power in some places and in others made it harder for mainstream parties to form viable coalitions, as in the Netherlands and Germany. This wave has not yet broken. Ahead of Italy’s elections in March, populists of left and right lead the polls and have cornered two thirds of the electorate. Populists have profited at the ballot box by telling voters that democracy is a sham or a scam rigged in favour of outsiders or an elite or both. The populist prescriptions are nearly always snake oil, but their diagnosis has resonance with many voters because the economic discontents are real. It is no coincidence, as the old Marxists liked to say, that western democracy has come under so much stress since the Great Crash of 2008 and the protracted squeeze on living standards that has followed it. In western countries that previously promoted liberal values, there is what Human Rights Watch calls a “frontal assault on the values of inclusivity, tolerance and respect”. America is mesmerised by Trump. Britain is obsessed with Brexit. Germany struggles to put together a government. All have become fractiously inward looking. This has bloody consequences for the rest of the world, by helping to allow mass atrocities in Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen to continue with near impunity. The United States has shrunk from its traditional role as exemplar of democracy and global champion of it. America was always extremely imperfect in this role, but its postwar leaders at least paid lip service to the idea that the shining city on the hill should be a beacon of liberty. The Oval Office is occupied by a president who has spent his first year in office trashing democratic norms at home while expressing no sense of responsibility to be an advocate for universal human rights. He has triggered a plunge in international respect for American leadership to a record low. The United States has often in the past been an enabler of undemocratic regimes, but never before has it had a president who expresses so much open admiration for authoritarians in the Kremlin and elsewhere, and so much undisguised contempt for his country’s traditional allies among the other democracies. Division and disarray among democracies has encouraged the pursuit of an aggressively anti-freedom agenda by the major autocracies, China and Russia. During the optimism of the third wave, it was presumed that democracy had a world-winning formula. The more prosperous countries became, the more they would want to be free; the more free they were, the more prosperous they would become. The belief that a richer China ought to become a more liberal China is not shared by President Xi Jinping. He is intensifying repression at home and promoting the Chinese model of autocratic capitalism as a superior recipe for stability and prosperity. It was Xi’s recent boast that China is “blazing a trail” for developing countries to emulate. China’s autocrats blaze while the democracies fiddle. A s is their way, political scientists have seen a disturbing phenomenon and given it geeky labels. Some call it “democratic deconsolidation”. Others go for “democratic recession”. I prefer “recession”, because at least that description implies a seed of hope that this trend does not have to be permanent. Recessions can and usually do come to an end. Reading the recent flurry of reports about the endangerment of liberty around the world, you could be driven to the despairing conclusion that democracy is dying. That fatalism would be as large an error as the assumption that democracy would be everywhere and permanently triumphant. Democracy has a lot going for it, not least that it is a better form of government than any other type that the human race has yet managed to design. Millions of South Koreans are not trying to flee to the north. There was something both bizarre and fantastic about watching the White House physician take questions from reporters about the most intimate details of the president’s health on live and global television. They don’t do that in dictatorships. Democracy is not doomed. The lesson of the past decade is the subtler one that democracy is more fragile, vulnerable and contingent than many liberals have often complacently supposed. The arc of history is not irreversibly bent in favour of freedom. The case for it has to be renewed and reinvigorated for each generation. The biggest mistake we make about democracy is to take it for granted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/21/is-a-new-arab-spring-under-way-tunisia-riots","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Anger that drove the Arab spring is flaring again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/is-a-new-arab-spring-under-way-tunisia-riots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/21/is-a-new-arab-spring-under-way-tunisia-riots","fields":{"headline":"Anger that drove the Arab spring is flaring again","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When the people of Balta wanted to protest, they had to leave town. “This place is so small that blocking the road is like sitting in your own hall – no one notices,” said Wathik Balti, a 19-year-old student. So in December, they headed to the nearest motorway, where dozens of them blocked an important junction for hours and called on the government to do something about the lack of jobs, the chronic corruption and the faltering public services that blight the picturesque village. But while Balta is out of the way, it turned out to be ahead of its time. A couple of weeks later similar protests sprang up in bigger towns and cities across the country, occasionally turning violent. One person was killed, and hundreds were arrested. The spark for all of this was a new law which will push up prices of basics including food and fuel. But behind it were the years of frustration over government failings and betrayals, particularly on promises to find jobs for hundreds of thousands of young people. Seven years after the revolution that toppled dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and unleashed the Arab spring, Tunisians were back on the streets demanding change, and the authorities were responding with a heavy hand. The one success story left from 2011, the democracy that had been built up as other countries across the region slid into war or back into dictatorship, now seemed to be faltering. And once more it was the jobless, dispossessed young who were at the heart of the turmoil. There are many reasons to worry about Tunisia’s future, from the huge numbers of unemployed, the struggling economy, rising inflation and sinking currency, to the corruption and the extremist attacks that have damaged its vital tourist industry. But there were also reasons to be hopeful, and one of the most unexpected was the country’s slowly ageing population, said demographer Richard Cincotta of the Stimson Centre, a global affairs thinktank. “The link between liberal democracy and [a country’s] age structure – the balance between young and old – is political demography’s most tested relationship,” Cincotta said. Years of studying this link had prompted him to predict in 2008, three years before Ben Ali’s fall, that a North African nation would become a stable democracy in little over a decade, with Tunisia the most likely candidate. The policies of Ben Ali and his predecessor Habib Bourguiba encouraged women into education and work, helping to push down the number of children in most families. As a result, the Tunisian population is slowly getting older, with an average age of nearly 30. It is no coincidence that this matches the point at which countries including Portugal, Taiwan and Chile made their shifts into democracy, and makes Cincotta cautiously optimistic that Tunisia’s new constitution will survive even the latest unrest. “No one can be certain of Tunisia’s future as a democracy. However, political demographers are betting that [a collapse of the democratic system] won’t happen, or that if it does backslide, Tunisia’s government will soon restore its democratic institutions,” Cincotta said. “As age structure matures, countries tend to encounter fewer years of civil conflict. Demonstrations may occur. Governments may be unpopular. However, civil war is statistically uncommon in countries that experience a median age over 26 years.” For other Arab spring countries, where the population is younger, the years ahead look less hopeful. The “youth bulge” of Egyptians, Syrians and Yemenis in their teens and early 20s was a key factor in the popular uprisings that shook the region. Frustrated by the prospect of stunted futures under autocratic governments apparently more interested in preserving power than creating jobs, they took to the streets. But the youthfulness of these countries – Yemen has an average age under 20, while Syria and Egypt’s are only slightly higher – suggested stability would be more elusive when their autocratic leaders were toppled. Two slipped into war and Egypt re-established a dictatorship. Both Syria and Yemen still have very young populations, suggesting that even if they can untangle their bitter wars, there could be years of instability ahead. And even Egypt, which once looked to be ageing towards greater hopes of stability, has seen an increase in births that may herald another destabilising youth bulge. None of these trends necessarily set a country’s destiny in stone. Tunisia’s neighbour and one of its government’s greatest worries is Libya, transformed by civil war into a prolific exporter of jihadis and instability across its long desert border. It has an older population than other countries caught up in the Arab spring: the average age was only just under 26 in 2010, according to UN data. But it has still slid into one of the most brutal conflicts in the region after Muammar Gaddafi was toppled. Nor does stability always mean democracy; there are countries like China where a single-party system or charismatic autocrat has held on to power as the population has aged and now appears to benefit from having fewer frustrated or idealistic young people to seek change. Perhaps the greatest risk to Tunisia, as it seeks to hold on to its democratic gains, is the crippling youth unemployment that sparked the revolution but remains unresolved. Any solution it finds may turn it into a beacon not just of political stability but economic hope. Possibly because of western interest in the spread of democracy and political freedoms, much of the reporting seven years ago focused on Tunisia’s change of government. But the revolution had three slogans – freedom, work and dignity – each equally important to the people who launched it. Many feel they have been given only one of three. There are now so many unemployed graduates that they have created their own unconventional union to lobby for their rights. Official statistics are somewhat less bleak, but the graduates’ leader, Salem Ayari, estimates that about 900,000 Tunisians are looking for work, nearly half of them graduates. This is almost twice the number looking for posts in 2011. “It was the economic system that pushed us into a revolution, and afterwards the politicians who are responsible for the system didn’t take care to reform it,” Ayari said. He hopes the demonstrations will push the leaders, many of them veterans of Ben Ali’s administration, to focus harder on economic and political reforms. The country’s economy has faltered as its democracy has blossomed politically, with many in the middle classes feeling more squeezed economically than they were under Ben Ali. Corruption and red tape hinder those who want to set up their own businesses, and the education system is out of step with the economy, churning out graduates prepared for jobs in the public sector, when companies want science graduates and vocational training. Even many young Tunisians with government jobs live in a strange kind of limbo. About 80,000 were given temporary posts in the wake of the 2011 revolution, as new governments tried to keep their promises to the crowds that swept them to power. Years later they are still in positions with minimal salary and no security. Pay at best rises to the equivalent of £90 a month, with no holiday or sick leave and constant fear of dismissal. Kawther, a 41-year-old librarian and mother to a four-month-old, spent the last months of her pregnancy swathed in the largest dresses she could buy in a desperate bid to disguise her swelling stomach, because she couldn’t afford to lose her job but had no right to maternity leave. It felt like a charade, but she is glad her bosses chose to play along rather than report her. She took two weeks of unpaid leave, and then, in pain and missing her baby, was back behind her desk. “I still don’t feel fully recovered,” she says. “But we had no choice.” And even so she considers herself lucky. There are many more with no jobs at all, many clustered in towns like Balta, where locals say only one in 10 young people has found work, even though most finished secondary education and many have university degrees. Now they have little to do beyond sitting around in coffee shops and making business plans that are almost impossible to fund. They used to play football on the middle school’s pitch, until the headmaster locked the gates, saying it was only for students. The village should be doing better than it is. It has an unusual reputation for churning out top-class athletes, including a women’s national pole-vaulting champion and top taekwondo fighters. In another country it might have attracted sports investment. And tourists might be tempted by one of the oldest olive trees in the country, set on a hill below well-known Roman ruins, or rolling vistas of green hills and olive groves. But a planned guesthouse sits half-built; and a proposal to put a few facilities for tourists at the ruins has not been acted upon. Those who are still at school leave at 6am on the bus for a nearby town; and although they usually have only four hours of lessons a day there is no library or study room, so they have to spend the rest of the day drifting around town until the evening bus leaves at 6pm. “Every day I wonder why I am doing this. It’s not worth it, especially when I see all the unemployed graduates sitting around with nothing to do,” says Balti, the 19-year-old student who joined the protests, and dreams of becoming a journalist. If someone can scrape together cash for a drink, they sit in coffee shops, but the spare time leaves the students frustrated, and vulnerable to the extremists who have flourished in Tunisia’s crisis. More foreign fighters left to fight in Syria from Tunisia than from any other nation, and domestically the group has undermined the economy with deadly attacks on tourists. Dozens were killed by gunmen in the capital’s famous Bardo museum in March 2015, and three months later another attacker armed with an assault rifle mowed down 38 holidaymakers, including 30 Britons, at a beach resort. “You have free time, it’s easy to get attracted by those people,” said activist Jamaleddine Balti, who like many in the town takes his name from his home and is not related to the student. “We have one boy who died in Syria, and two who are in jail.” There are also increasing numbers of young people who are not drawn to extremism but still desperate to leave, who join the dangerous exodus across the Mediterranean to Europe. “There are cases of suicide, and many people are dying because they want to cross the sea illegally,” says Koussay Ben Fredj, a 22-year-old who is spokesman for the grassroots organisation loosely coordinating January’s protests. Called “Fesh Nestannew?”, or “What Are We Waiting For?” it is mobilising young people who fear their revolution was betrayed. They point to the political record of president Beji Caid Essebsi, who was speaker of parliament under Ben Ali, and the attacks and sweeping arrests in this month’s protests. “The political mentality is the same as before 2011,” said Fredj, who was accused on national television of ties to a man jailed for corruption, an allegation he says was politically motivated. “We will not tolerate that, we will not go back to dictatorship. The opposition failed because it is weak in parliament, and people have no trust in parties. They trust youth, teenagers who look like them.” The movement is calling for a crackdown on corruption, more investment for young people who want to start businesses, and tax reform, so that companies and the ultra-rich pay more, rather than ordinary Tunisians. The agenda is finding support across the political spectrum. Naoufel Jammali, an MP and former employment minister, would also like to see a crackdown on tax evasion and an end to corruption, but fears the government – even though it includes his own moderate Islamist Ennahdha party – lacks the courage needed for change. “We are suffering here from a lack of political courage and a lack of expertise in communication,” he said. “We know that to reform the country we have to take hard decisions for a huge number of Tunisians, but we must explain this to the people.” His cabinet role was in the transitional government, and he created many of the temporary government posts that have been a lifeline and a frustration for more than half a decade. He admits that they are problematic, but says the country was too fragile then for the change it needs now. The law which sparked the latest protests, which the government says it designed to meet International Monetary Fund standards of reform so it could get a much-needed loan, does little to address the fundamental blocks on growth. The consequences of that, not only for Tunisia, are demonstrated by the fate of surrounding nations. A rise in violent extremism, desperate young people attempting the dangerous illegal trip to Europe, chaos and crushed dreams. The west should do more to help, if only from self-interest. “If you weaken the middle class you weaken democracy,” Jammali warned. “We face deep economic problems here, and countries in Europe and elsewhere, our friends in the free world, must have the deep conviction that the investment in newborn democracy is very important not only for Tunisian people but for the whole world and the region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/20/eleven-killed-and-46-injured-in-bus-crash-in-north-western-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T13:50:18Z","webTitle":"Eleven killed and 46 injured in bus crash in north-western Turkey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/20/eleven-killed-and-46-injured-in-bus-crash-in-north-western-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/20/eleven-killed-and-46-injured-in-bus-crash-in-north-western-turkey","fields":{"headline":"Eleven killed and 46 injured in bus crash in north-western Turkey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eleven people were killed and 46 injured when a bus taking families on a skiing trip crashed in north-western Turkey, local officials said.

After a trial in July that lasted just two days, Mohammed Ibrahim “Mo” Munshi was jailed for 11 years and fined $15m over a coal deal struck between Gobi Coal and Energy, of which he was chairman, and a company owned by Chuluunbataar Baz, a member of a prominent Mongolian family. Munshi is the latest in a string of foreign investors to find themselves slapped with arbitrary travel bans or jailed over business deals in resource-rich Mongolia, while local partners seek to seize assets or alter agreements. The tactic – of which foreign embassies in the country are aware – has been described as “Hotel Mongolia”, a take on the Eagles song Hotel California, from which “you can check out anytime you want, but you can never leave”. Munshi’s family say the 57-year-old’s health is failing and the prospect of 11 years in prison had devastated his family. “My dad’s quite a tough nut,” Munshi’s son Arif told the Guardian. “But this is starting to break him down, he’s becoming unravelled. “He was moved on Monday to the equivalent of a maximum-security jail ... we are worried about his safety, and he is fearful for his own safety. He is asking us to do anything we can to get him out. He is very much fearful for his life.” Munshi has varicose veins in his legs that doctors advise require immediate surgery. He is also unable to access medication to ameliorate the condition and so is at the risk of deep vein thrombosis and potentially fatal blood clots. Munshi is a dual UK and Australian citizen. A complaint lodged with the UN human rights council – of which both the UK and Australia are members – alleges there were gross irregularities during his trial. “There was no prima facie case presented against Munshi at his trial, and the prosecutor even obtained a summary of the prosecution case from Baz’s attorney during the trial and presented it as the prosecution case,” the complaint says. “Munshi was not given a fair trial in that his ability to address the criminal court and give evidence in his own defence was unreasonably limited.” The complaint also alleges Munshi has been subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: held in solitary confinement, physically harassed by guards, abused and spat on by other inmates, and allowed to shower only once every two weeks. The case is, according to the complaint, “the improper use of the Mongolian criminal justice system in an attempt by a well-connected Mongolian national to attempt to secure Gobi Coal and Energy assets located in Mongolia”. Munshi’s dispute arose after Baz’s company, Monnis International, invested $10m in Gobi Coal’s proposed mining projects in the south-west of the country. But when the global coal price collapsed in 2012, a proposed initial public offering was postponed, with the projects put on hold until global prices recovered. Other investors acceded to ride out the price dip, but Baz reportedly demanded his money back. Attempts at arbitration failed, and when Munshi visited Mongolia in 2015 he was hit with a travel ban and his passports were confiscated. The dispute dragged on until mid-2017, when Munshi was suddenly arrested, tried, convicted in a two-day trial and jailed. Gobi Coal’s licence over coal deposits was also suspended. In court documents from the trial Baz alleged he had been tricked into investing in the projects and defrauded of his investment. “Munshi committed the fraud, made others incur loss, received property of others by his or others’ company accounts, and changed financial statements.” The court documents state Munshi “made a living” – understood to mean he funded his personal lifestyle – with investors’ money. Munshi has denied the allegations. Through his lawyers, he told the court he had not made, or sought to make, any personal profit from any of the investments in the project, or used any investors money for personal expenses. More than 180 investors have remained invested in the Gobi projects. Munshi said the case was a business dispute and should be settled by international arbitration not by punitive use of the criminal justice system. “This is not a crime,” court documents, seen by the Guardian, say. “There is no physical evidence or written documents to support [Baz’s] claim of fraud, only his oral allegations. “During this period, I lost everything that belonged to me. I spent 15 years to establish my company and develop it. All this was lost.” The court documents state that Baz repeatedly offered to abandon the criminal prosecution in exchange for some of his investment being returned. Attempts by the Guardian to contact Baz have not been returned. The case has been complicated by a separate dispute involving Gobi Coal and another Baz family company. In March 2016, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ordered the Baz family to pay Gobi Coal $US11.5m over defaulted loans. Within weeks of the arbitration decision, stories began appearing in Mongolian newspapers accusing Munshi of fraud. He was arrested, tried, and convicted in a two-day trial in July last year, and has since been held in Detention Centre 461, the equivalent of a remand centre, in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar. His health has deteriorated, and his contact with family, legal representatives, and consular officials has been severely limited. A substantive appeal to an appellate court failed, a final appeal to a higher court will be heard in coming months. Last week Munshi was moved from Detention Centre 461 to a closed prison on the outskirts of the capital. His family has been told he can receive one short visit every 90 days, and one long visit every 120 days. Munshi’s Australian lawyer, Alisdair Putt, who filed the complaint with the Human Rights Council, said his client had been subjected to an unfair criminal proceeding in which almost no incriminating evidence was presented. “There must be serious concerns about the adequacy of that process in that it seems to have been motivated by a Mongolian investor attempting to gain an extortionate commercial outcome.” Putt said the commercial dispute should be arbitrated before an international committee, not put before a criminal court. Putt, a former investigator in the International Criminal Court prosecutor’s office, said the “Hotel Mongolia” phenomenon was a troubling development in the country, where travel bans and criminal charges were used to detain and pressure foreigners. Some reports say up to 50 foreign investors have been detained in the country using the tactic, which has been acknowledged by embassies. Forty workers employed on the Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert had their passports seized last week over alleged visa irregularities. Most have since been allowed to leave. Both the Australian and UK governments have highlighted the use of travel bans in Mongolia in travel advice, while the US state department has warned: “investors and local legal experts have grown to fear what they call the capricious and arbitrary use of travel bans by Mongolian officials, sometimes at the behest of private interests, as a means to coerce foreign investors to settle civil and criminal disputes.” Putt said: “It is a common tactic, and many people are affected by this. This shows the potential risk, there may be trumped-up criminal charges laid in efforts to win a commercial outcome.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/jan/23/economic-picture-leaves-coalition-in-solid-position-to-be-re-elected","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Economic ​picture ​leaves ​Coalition in solid position to be re-elected | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/23/economic-picture-leaves-coalition-in-solid-position-to-be-re-elected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/23/economic-picture-leaves-coalition-in-solid-position-to-be-re-elected","fields":{"headline":"Economic ​picture ​leaves ​Coalition in solid position to be re-elected","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After a terrible year for jobs in 2016, the employment sector rebounded in 2017 with one of the best years on record. Not only did the unemployment rate fall to a five-year low, employment grew by more in one year than it has for nearly a quarter of a century. And in more good news, after full-time employment actually went backwards in 2016, last year saw a record growth of full-time jobs. In his first press conference for the year, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, was not surprisingly in a chipper mood. In 2017, employment grew by 393,000 (in trend terms) – the biggest ever calendar year growth in a nominal sense (which given population growth doesn’t mean all that much). The 3.3% increase is the best since 1994. Best of all it was across genders: 2.7% more men were employed – the best growth since 2010 – while women’s employment exploded by 4% – the best since 1995: It is a growth that accords with a view I have held for some time, namely, that while the government might be lagging in the polls, the economic and, especially, employment picture very much suggests the Coalition is in a solid position to be re-elected. The strong employment growth was also observed across the nation – only Northern Territory saw a decline. Queensland and New South Wales led the way, with even Western Australia seeing solid growth after four very lean years: It all meant that while our unemployment rate remains well above that achieved during the peak of the mining boom, at 5.4%, it is as good now as it has been since the start of 2013: The issue bubbling under all the good news about employment has of course been underemployment. But even here, while it remains high, it has fallen from the record levels that were reached at the start of 2017: And such falls in underemployment are not surprising given last year was really about full-time employment. In 2017, full-time employment growth of 3.9% was the highest calendar year growth on record – stretching all the way back to 1967: It came about because full-time employment grew strongly for both men and women. Of the 321,000 new full-time employment positions, 161,000 were women and 160,000 were men. That’s unusual given there are around 2.2 million more men employed full-time. And it goes to the changing nature of our economy. For men, the big gain in work came in the construction industry. While that is not a shock given that industry is the largest employer of men in the nation, the 108,000 new positions created in 2017 for men in construction made up 61% of all new male employment. Of those jobs, a big chunk was in heavy and civil engineering construction – the benefit of the expansion of public infrastructure projects around the country. For women, the big driver of work was healthcare and social assistance – with an equal number for work in hospitals and childcare, and another sizeable number for aged care work. And while only 52% of women working in the healthcare industry work full-time, in 2017 nearly 90% of the newly employed women in that industry were employed full-time. It all adds up to prime aged workers (aged 25-64) being almost as likely to be working full-time now than ever before. Since the GFC, the hit to full-time work has mostly been felt by the youth – in 2008, over 36% of those aged 15-24 worked full-time, now it is just 26%: But while at the end of 2016, the percentage of those aged 25-64 working full-time had fallen to 55.9% (well below the mining boom peak of 57.4%), in the past year the surge of work has meant more people in that age bracket are employed full-time than any time in the past nine years: And while we are unlikely to ever again see the levels of male full-time employment that occurred during the mining boom, where nearly 76% of men aged 25-64 worked full-time (currently it is 73.4%), the increase in women working full-time shows no sign of slowing: At the end of last year, 41.3% of women aged 25-64 worked full-time, compared to 39% 10 years ago – the equivalent of an extra 145,000 women working full-time now than would have been had the level remained steady. And all of these good numbers also means that Tony Abbott’s prediction prior to the 2013 election of creating 1m jobs in five years looks set to come to fruition. Since September 2013, 949,000 extra people have been employed. Something would have to go seriously wrong in the next nine months for an extra 51,000 new positions not to be created. It’s all good news, and is a very good sign of the health of the economy. It also means the government will feel it has a strong case to make about its economic management as it shifts into pre-election mode. For the ALP, the focus will remain on underemployment and low wages growth. If those two should improve (a big if), expect the treasurer to become even more chipper in press conferences this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/nick-kyrgios-satisfies-australias-hunger-for-a-tennis-hero-for-now","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T18:00:27Z","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios satisfies Australia’s hunger for a tennis hero – for now | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/nick-kyrgios-satisfies-australias-hunger-for-a-tennis-hero-for-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/nick-kyrgios-satisfies-australias-hunger-for-a-tennis-hero-for-now","fields":{"headline":"Nick Kyrgios satisfies Australia’s hunger for a tennis hero – for now","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In his post-match press conference after going down to Grigor Dimitrov, Nick Kyrgios had it put to him that a writer had recently proclaimed that whatever you say about him, he is true to himself and has authenticity. Asked if the sentiment rang true, Kyrgios replied: “I don’t really care, to be honest. I just do my thing. I play the game the way I want it to be played … I don’t really idolise or follow anyone.” It’s true that Kyrgios has never courted the Australian public or media’s affection but over the course of the Australian Open, a strange thing has happened: most prior sins, it seems, have been forgiven, now that Kyrgios is, effectively, playing much better tennis. With it has perhaps come the uncomfortable glow of public admiration and attention, as well as the concept of “mature” Kyrgios version 2.0. By the end of his marathon loss to Dimitrov, the Australian reminded everyone that he was in no mood to conform: take me or leave me, and don’t over-analyse it. The Australian public, however, is seemingly desperate to get behind a new, or at least reborn, tennis hero. This was telling in the rockstar reception that greeted newcomer Alex De Minaur when he arrived for just his second Melbourne Park appearance. Like Kyrgios, De Minaur had thrilled home crowds with a breakout lead-up performance, this time at the Sydney International where he lost in four sets to Daniil Medvedev, complete with a rousing comeback in the last. De Minaur is firmly in the mould of an Australian battler; the kind that struggles for every point, lives for tennis and proclaims to be a “proud Aussie”. He is far easier to love, and has recognisable idols: namely, Lleyton Hewitt. Despite what Kyrgios might claim, he too has idols, and it was a more vulnerable Kyrgios that won over plenty of believers against Jo-Wilfred Tsonga on Rod Laver Arena on Friday night of week one. There we were told of a young Kyrgios lining up for Tsonga’s signature, with a new ball to sign for every day he watched him play, while that night we bore witness to his adoration for a contemporary idol in the film actor Will Smith. Kyrgios, who oozes cool, was even willing to admit on court post-match that he had just hoped that Smith would think he was “the coolest guy in the world”. Here was a different side to Kyrgios, even a charming Kyrgios, not untouchable at all, himself just a fan boy in another context. Perhaps most importantly for those watching on, he was playing some remarkable tennis, showing serious grit to recover from a 2-5 deficit in the fourth-set tiebreak to close out the match. Then, against Dimitrov, when his emotions at times had the better of him, he still found a way to hang in each point, as unorthodox as his approach was. Remarkably, by the end of the four-set match, he had won just one point less than the Bulgarian (156 points to 157). His service game improved markedly as the tournament progressed; in the fourth round he racked up 36 aces, with his fastest reading 218km, while second serves regularly clocked over 200kph. Compare this to fastest serves of 199kph against Viktor Troicki and 201kph against Tsonga. His percentage of first services in did dip, but twice he won 79% of those that made it in, reinforcing just what a weapon it is. His forehand is also becoming an inimitable force – on Sunday he hit 15 outright winners off it, although he also conceded 25 unforced errors off it as he threw caution to the wind when the match began to slip from his grasp. Although he still claims to enjoy the “freedom” of being without a coach, one can only wonder at what a bit of guidance could do for such boundless talent. Then again, Kyrgios doesn’t seem to take kindly to others setting boundaries for him, and whatever he does, he’s doing very well. In the end Kyrgios went down as the last Australian (man or woman) in the tournament, and it was enough for Australia to jump on board, for now. Rollercoaster ride the Kyrgios train may be, it was the best thing going for a nation that – as the tournament ticked over the half-way mark – sadly has not a single local left to pin its hopes on. Kyrgios’ game all but stood up to the rigours of his final test against the world No3, and he has all the tools required to go to the next level, if he can channel his focus and desire. Whether it helps him or not, Australia is, it seems, behind him for now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/2016-election-aec-not-transparent-on-risk-to-it-systems-audit-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:11:34Z","webTitle":"2016 election: AEC failed to account for all ballot papers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/2016-election-aec-not-transparent-on-risk-to-it-systems-audit-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/2016-election-aec-not-transparent-on-risk-to-it-systems-audit-finds","fields":{"headline":"2016 election: AEC failed to account for all ballot papers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian Electoral Commission was not transparent about the level of risk it accepted in its IT systems for the 2016 election, the audit office has found. A report from the Australian National Audit Office has found that although the AEC could rule out any large-scale vote tampering, it did not conduct a statistically valid audit to demonstrate the data integrity of the election and could not account for all the ballot papers. In March 2016 significant changes to electoral law introduced above-the-line preferences, prompting a decision to adopt a Senate vote-scanning system before the 2 July double dissolution election. Asked to assess the AEC’s performance, the audit office found it had “not demonstrably achieved value for money” in its transport and ICT supply contracts. To improve integrity a “late decision” was made for all voter preferences to be entered by a human operator in addition to being scanned. “The AEC does not know the number or nature of mismatches to determine if this was a cost-effective risk treatment,” the report said. The decision added between $6.6m and $8.6m to the cost. Due to time constraints the AEC waived the requirement on its ICT supplier to comply with government IT security frameworks including that it “must protect all AEC data when it is at rest”. “The level of IT security risk accepted by the AEC on behalf of the Australian government, and the extent of the non-compliance with the Australian government IT security frameworks, was not transparent,” the report said. “The wording used in some of the internal records and published materials would generate confidence in the security of the system whereas the underlying assessments indicated significant risk.” The report concluded the AEC relied on its risk strategies to ensure the integrity of ballot paper data but had “not undertaken a statistically valid audit to verify or demonstrate data integrity”. “The AEC accepted IT security risk above its usual tolerance. Insufficient attention was paid to ensuring the AEC could identify whether the system had been compromised.” The audit office said the AEC was “unaware that any ballot papers were not accounted for” but warned this was “a considerably lower level of assurance than its stated performance indicator of accounting for 100% of ballot papers”. The AEC set a tolerance for ballot paper discrepancies, such as a difference of 0.5% for Senate and House of Representative ballot papers at a polling place. The ANAO noted a “high number of discrepancies in the AEC’s final data”. It could not demonstrate that discrepancies outside the tolerance were systematically identified and resolved. With a total contract value of $8.7m for transporting ballot papers and $27.2m for the Senate scanning system, the audit office concluded the AEC had not given due consideration to cost. “Insufficient emphasis was given by the AEC to open and effective competition in its procurement processes as a means of demonstrably achieving value for money.” In response, the AEC said the Senate voting changes “were the most significant reforms to Australia’s electoral system in 30 years” and the 2016 election was “in many ways, [the] most complex in the nation’s history”. “In the extraordinarily short period of three months, and without prior warning, the AEC successfully developed and then implemented a robust, effective, technologically advanced” counting system for 15m Senate votes, it said. The AEC said it was confident the measures put in place for the 2016 election ensured the integrity of the Senate count. “The AEC is committed to work towards achieving a high level of compliance with the Australian government’s security framework. “Where extremely short immutable timeframes mean that full compliance with all aspects of the framework are not achievable ... the AEC will take a risk-based approach to identify, manage and accept/reject risks as appropriate.” The AEC said after the 2016 election it revised its procurement approach to logistics and would “deliver increased value for money”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/top-1-per-cent-of-australians-own-more-wealth-than-bottom-70-per-cent-combined","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T07:01:49Z","webTitle":"Top 1% of Australians own more wealth than bottom 70% combined","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/top-1-per-cent-of-australians-own-more-wealth-than-bottom-70-per-cent-combined","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/top-1-per-cent-of-australians-own-more-wealth-than-bottom-70-per-cent-combined","fields":{"headline":"Top 1% of Australians own more wealth than bottom 70% combined","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ranks of Australia’s billionaires have swollen since the global financial crisis, from 14 in 2008 to 33 in 2017, after eight more individuals became billionaires last year. Over the same period, the household wealth of average Australians grew by just 12%, with wage growth slowing to record lows, barely keeping up with the cost of living. Despite efforts by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, to portray Australia as a country in which income inequality is not worsening – contrary to the belief of International Monetary Fund officials – Oxfam Australia has released a new report revealing wealth inequality is still on the rise. The report comes as new data shows the wealth divide in Sydney is becoming increasingly pronounced, with doctors and lawyers clustering in neighbourhoods close to the central business district, and essential services workers such as police, nurses and teachers being forced to settle in outer suburbs where property is more affordable, as reported by Fairfax Media. The Oxfam Report, Growing Gulf Between Work and Wealth, has been released on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum, a gathering of the world’s political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland. The report, which relies on data from Credit Suisse, shows the level of wealth held by Australia’s richest 1% grew to 23% in 2017, up from 22% the year before, with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 70% of Australians combined. It shows wealth inequality in Australia has been on the rise over the past two decades, with the gulf between the amount of wealth held by the top 1% and the bottom 50% now the greatest at any time over this period. The wealth share held by the top 1% in Australia has been growing almost continuously over the past two decades, while the wealth share held by the poorest 50% of Australians has been falling almost continuously over the past two decades. The report also says income inequality has steadily climbed in Australia over time and, despite some fluctuations, is higher than at any time before the global financial crisis in 2008. Australia’s income inequality compares poorly with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest OECD data shows Australia’s Gini coefficient was 0.33 in 2014, ranking 22nd, behind the majority of the 35 OECD countries. The Gini index is the most widely used measure of inequality. It looks at the distribution of a nation’s income or wealth, where 0 represents complete equality and 100 total inequality. The report says last year saw the largest annual increase in the number of Australian billionaires and billionaire wealth since the start of the century – with an increase in total billionaire wealth of roughly $38bn. The increase in wealth was enough to pay for more than half of Australia’s federal public health spending in 2016-17. “Oxfam is committed to tackling poverty and inequality – but a broken economic system that is concentrating more wealth in the hands of the rich and powerful, while ordinary people struggle to scrape by, is fuelling an inequality crisis,” said Helen Szoke, Oxfam Australia’s chief executive. “Over the decade since the global financial crisis, the wealth of Australian billionaires has increased by almost 140% to a total of $115.4bn last year. Yet over the same time, the average wages of ordinary Australians have increased by just 36% and average household wealth grew by 12%. “The richest 1% of Australians continue to own more wealth than the bottom 70% of Australians combined. While everyday Australians are struggling more and more to get by, the wealthiest groups have grown richer and richer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
