For the first time in more than 40 years, the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the US isn’t electricity production but transport – cars, trucks, planes, trains and shipping. Emissions data has placed transport as the new king of climate-warming pollution at a time when the Trump administration is reviewing or tearing up regulations that would set tougher emissions standards for car and truck companies. Republicans in Congress are also pushing new fuel economy rules they say will lower costs for American drivers but could also weaken emissions standards. Opponents of the administration fret this agenda will imperil public health and hinder the effort to address climate change. “This Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t seem to have met an air regulation that it likes,” said Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and a former EPA assistant administrator. “I’ve not seen any evidence that this administration knows anything about the auto industry, they just seem to be against anything the Obama administration did. “Vehicle emissions are going up, so clearly not enough is being done on that front. The Trump administration is halting further progress at a critical point when we really need to get a grip on this problem.” The 1970 Clean Air Act, signed by Richard Nixon, set standards for a cocktail of different pollutants emitted from new vehicles. New cars and trucks, which account for more than 80% of transport emissions, now have to meet fuel efficiency standards and display this information to consumers. This approach has helped cleanse previously smog-laden American cities and tamp down greenhouse gas emissions. But in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation, up nearly 2% on the previous year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This increase means that transport has overtaken power generation as the most polluting sector in the country, and it’s likely to stay that way. Cheap gasoline prices have led to a recent uptick in vehicle emissions, despite the fuel standards, at the same time that coal is being rapidly displaced by an abundance of cheap natural gas and the steady rise of renewable energy, driving a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from the power grid. While coalminers have lost their jobs to technological advancement and environmental protesters have thrown their bodies in the path of oil pipelines, there has been far less to disrupt the basic emissions-emitting models of cars, trucks and planes. Americans are buying larger cars and taking more flights – domestic aviation emissions grew 10% between 2012 and 2016 – and face little opposition in doing so. “The change in power generation has been very impressive over the past 10 to 15 years,” said Brett Smith, assistant director of the Center for Automotive Research. “In the automotive sector, there isn’t the same push. There are certainly Americans concerned about global warming but people are driving bigger and bigger vehicles each year. It’s not a priority for them. The cost of fuel is pretty cheap and at the moment there isn’t a better option out there than the internal combustion engine.” Transport accounts for about a quarter of all US planet-warming emissions but also poses a direct health threat to about 45 million Americans who live, work or attend school within 300ft of roads that are shrouded in high air pollution levels. This pollution can stunt lung growth, trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate heart disease and cause developmental problems. The EPA estimates 17,000 schools across the US are located next to roads with heavy traffic, with children from low-income and minority groups disproportionately put at risk. California is the only state in the US to ban the construction of a school on the cheap land found beside major highways. US cities haven’t emulated the likes of London and Stockholm by charging drivers a congestion fee to coax them on to public transport, cycling or walking; nor does the US feature the comparatively high rates of fuel tax seen in Europe. France’s move to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 would be politically unthinkable in the States. But the air is much cleaner in American cities than it was in the 1970s, and a world away from the fug that now envelops Beijing and Delhi, in part due to vehicle emissions standards that have progressively been ratcheted up by the EPA. That trajectory has been cast in doubt by the Trump presidency. In March, the EPA scrapped a deal struck between Barack Obama’s administration and automakers that would require new cars to run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, by 2025. The White House said the new rules had been “shoved down the throats” of car makers, with the main industry lobby group pointing out that consumers overwhelmingly prioritize safety, driving performance and value for money over fuel efficiency. There are more than 70 car models on sale that achieve 40 miles per gallon and they account for just 1% of total new vehicle sales. Then, last month, the EPA cited “regulatory overreach” by the previous administration for its decision to waive clean truck standards that would have phased out “glider” vehicles that produce 55 times more diesel soot than new trucks. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said his predecessors had “attempted to bend the rule of law and expand the reach of the federal government in a way that threatened to put an entire industry of specialized truck manufacturers out of business”. These rollbacks from the executive branch have dovetailed with an effort by Republicans in the Senate and the House to revamp fuel efficiency rules by replacing state and federal requirements with a single standard. Environmental groups and previous administration officials fear this will lead to a further weakening of emissions standards. “America’s clean car standards have dramatically improved the fuel efficiency of vehicles, saving consumers billions of dollars and cutting pollution in the process,” said Carol Browner, a former administrator of the EPA. “Instead of rolling back commonsense, successful and popular clean cars standards, we should focus on innovation and technology that will continue the auto industry’s growth and the pollution reductions we’ve achieved since these standards were first established.” In the short term, this new approach risks a flashpoint between the federal government and California, which has a long-held waiver to enact vehicle pollution standards in excess of the national requirements. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, follow California’s standards, an alliance that covers more than 130 million residents and about a third of the US vehicle market. Nichols said she had been disturbed by signals coming from Pruitt and other EPA officials that she said show the federal government is looking to end California’s waiver. “We are very concerned because these standards are the bedrock of our whole climate change platform,” she said. “Scott Pruitt has made threatening noises about the Californian waiver, saying that we are trying to run the country. It feels like this is going to be the next shoe to drop. If it does, we will litigate and fight for our rights in the political arena with other states and consumer advocates.” With federal regulation set to be pared back, technological advances in electric and gas-powered cars, as well as consumer preferences, are likely to play an increasingly important role in whether vehicle emissions are forced back down. A flurry of recent optimistic studies have forecast that, by 2040, as much as 90% of all cars in the US will be electric. But the current conundrum is that petroleum-fueled vehicles are cheaper and seen as more reliable than their electric counterparts by most new buyers. Affordable gasoline is competing with electric recharging stations that are considered too sparse by many drivers to risk running out of puff, no matter the benefit to the environment. “It’s a challenging position for automotive companies because they are touting electric vehicles but ultimately they have to sell more cars,” said Smith. “Consumers in the US aren’t pushing for electric vehicles to the extent they are in Europe and unless we take a very different approach as a country, that doesn’t look like it will change soon. “You will need to see a major change in battery technology to make it viable. People are becoming more aware and concerned about global warming, but we aren’t there yet. And when you look at the vehicles being put out by the major car companies, you could argue it’s not an issue for them, either.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/fight-europe-antisemitism-attacks-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T19:50:43Z","webTitle":"To fight European antisemitism, we must first face up to it | Natalie Nougayrède","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/fight-europe-antisemitism-attacks-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/fight-europe-antisemitism-attacks-trump","fields":{"headline":"To fight European antisemitism, we must first face up to it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since Donald Trump made his Jerusalem announcement this month, a series of antisemitic attacks and other incidents have taken place in Europe. They have drawn condemnation from political leaders and received some, but not much, media attention. These events are a sign that antisemitism in Europe could be getting worse. The Holocaust is a defining legacy of European history. Europeans have a special responsibility to ensure Jews feel safe and free in our societies. There can be no justification for antisemitism. That may be stating the obvious, but these days it seems that the obvious needs to be stated. On 9 December in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second largest city, a group of masked men attempted to set fire to a synagogue. They threw molotov cocktails, forcing young people who had been holding a Hanukkah party to seek refuge in the basement. Days later, a second arson attack occurred at a Jewish cemetery in Malmö, where there were also reports of calls for an “intifada” and violent, antisemitic shouts at a demonstration. In Amsterdam, a man holding a Palestinian flag smashed the windows of a kosher restaurant. The incident, recorded on video, was described by the Organisation of Jewish Communities in the Netherlands as “no less than an act of terror”. In Gothenburg, three men were detained for “attempted criminal arson” after the synagogue attack. According to the antiracist activist magazine Expo, they were two Syrians and one Palestinian. All three had arrived in Sweden this year. The Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven declared there was “no place for antisemitism in our society”, while Angela Merkel commented that “no difference of opinion, including on the status of Jerusalem, can justify such acts”. Antisemitism has mutated in Europe. Different strains of it have now developed. The far-right antisemitism that led to the Holocaust is part of our history. Today it still lurks among Europe’s resurgent, nativist political movements, including in the UK. Muslims, too, have also bought into antisemitism. In 2013 Mehdi Hassan described the antisemitism among some British Muslims as “our dirty little secret”. Yet another form of antisemitism has hidden since the 1960s behind radical leftwing anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel. Neither Europe’s Muslims nor its radical left should be tarnished with antisemitism en masse, of course. Large majorities reject it. But if European democracy is to be protected, antisemitism needs to be exposed and combated much more actively. In my country, France, it took an attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris in 2015 for the scale and depth of antisemitic feeling among certain groups of radicalised youths to be grasped. The 2012 attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse – in which Mohammed Merah murdered three children, their teacher and others – had not been seen as the watershed it truly was. I was visiting Sweden when the recent attacks unfolded, and was struck that there was no spontaneous public show of solidarity with the Jewish community. Sure, widespread indignation and concern were present – but somewhat discreetly. Europe is not antisemitic. But we need to acknowledge that new versions of anti-Jewish sentiment exist. In Hungary, rabid antisemitic campaigns have flourished against George Soros, including posters harking back to an era we may have thought was long gone. But I’m told that some in the Hungarian Jewish community have become as worried about radical Islamist ideas as they are about extreme rightwing antisemitism, and are reluctant to call out the right as antisemitic for this reason. None of this is simple. There is a growing awareness of the problem at EU level. The European parliament passed its first resolution on “combating antisemitism” in June. The text refers to a “working definition” which points out that antisemitism must not be seen as limited to the targeting of Jews. It can target non-Jews, as was the case when cartoons of Emmanuel Macron, carrying echoes of the 1930s, referred to his prior work at the Rothschild bank. As for the far-left, anti-Zionist brand of antisemitism, EU-validated guidelines say: “Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish entity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” A red line is crossed when criticising Israel becomes a criticism of Jews. A legal definition of antisemitism helps the authorities collect data, which is currently patchy. The EU agency for fundamental rights has now announced a new survey investigating discrimination and hate crime against Jews living in the EU. Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem caused consternation in many parts of the world. But the events that followed in Europe should serve as a wake-up call. A diverse continent directly affected by events in the Middle East must address new realities. Acknowledging them is the first step. More efforts are needed in education, and more scrutiny on social media. Now is not the time for blinkers or awkward silence. • Natalie Nougayrède is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/18/a-bewildering-array-of-pluses-and-minuses-dogs-the-brexit-landscape","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T19:02:22Z","webTitle":"A bewildering array of pluses and minuses dogs the Brexit landscape | Dan Roberts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/18/a-bewildering-array-of-pluses-and-minuses-dogs-the-brexit-landscape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/18/a-bewildering-array-of-pluses-and-minuses-dogs-the-brexit-landscape","fields":{"headline":"Brexit models: From ‘Canada plus plus plus’ to ‘Norway minus’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As if leaving were not bewildering enough, discussion of the various templates for Britain’s future relationship with the EU has taken on the appearance of a maths equation of late. Brexit secretary Davis Davis says Britain should be aiming for the ambitiously named “Canada plus plus plus” model. Labour MPs who favour a softer strain of Brexit would prefer to see an alternative nicknamed “Norway minus”. Meanwhile over in Brussels, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, insists Brexit remains a zero-sum game where a single plus after Canada is the best that can be hoped for. His deputy, Sabine Weyand, calls this “Canada Dry”. So what does the blizzard of symbols add up to and how does it fit in with Theresa May’s equally baffling metaphor that we should ditch talk of hard and soft Brexit and opt for a “red, white and blue” or “bespoke” Brexit instead? The simplest way of thinking about all these options is as a continuum, with high access to the single market and low political freedom at one end and higher levels of political autonomy combined with lower access to the single market at the other. In this model, Norway is the best example of a country that is outside the EU, but only just. As a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) it achieves most of the economic benefits of single market membership, yet is required to adopt most of the EU rules as a result. This includes a requirement to allow freedom of movement, which is why those who favour its adoption by Britain like to speculate whether it can be watered down to Norway minus. Brexiteers prefer to come from the other direction. They take the EU’s recent free trade agreement with Canada, known as Ceta, as a starting point. It focuses on reducing tariffs for physical goods rather than dealing with the non-tariff barriers that matter to Britain’s services sector. But since UK regulations are already entirely aligned with the EU, optimists argue that it ought to be possible to add services and much else besides to reach Canada plus plus plus. With enough goodwill it could be far more than a basic free trade agreement and look like May’s specially crafted bunting. The catch is that Brussels is unwilling to add more than basic deals for aviation and fishing to Ceta. In their eyes this remains a binary choice, no matter how many qualifiers are added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/western-leaders-told-to-stop-stoking-the-flames-of-war-in-yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T00:01:12Z","webTitle":"Western leaders told to stop 'stoking the flames of war' in Yemen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/western-leaders-told-to-stop-stoking-the-flames-of-war-in-yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/19/western-leaders-told-to-stop-stoking-the-flames-of-war-in-yemen","fields":{"headline":"Western leaders told to stop 'stoking the flames of war' in Yemen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 350 high-profile figures including six Nobel peace prize laureates, former military generals, politicians, diplomats and celebrities have marked the 1,000th day of the Yemen civil war by calling on leaders of France, the US and the UK to stop “stoking the flames of war” and instead use their seats on the UN security council to act as peace brokers. The signatories to the statement, including Juliette Binoche, Charlotte Rampling and Peter Gabriel, as well as religious leaders and heads of most of the main UK aid agencies, claim Yemen is at a tipping point. Their statement to the leaders of the three western nations said: “If you don’t want the burden of the lives of thousands more Yemeni children on your hands, then the time to act is now. Yemen can’t wait any longer. “To prevent further catastrophe and famine, Yemen needs an immediate ceasefire; an end to all blockages on access for food, fuel and medical supplies; and investment in a new, inclusive peace process.” The appeal came after the UK international development secretary Penny Mordaunt vowed she would monitor fresh assurances given to her personally by leaders in Saudi Arabia that they will stop obstructing humanitarian and commercial aid being sent to the key western ports in Yemen, deepening an already critical humanitarian aid crisis. The Saudis claim the UN inspection regime is too lax, and aid has been diverted to support Houthi rebels fighting the UN-backed government, charges that were again rejected by aid agencies at the weekend. Mordaunt’s department said she had received assurances following meeting a meeting in Riyadh that aid into the key ports of Hodeidah and Saleef would swiftly increase due to the speeding up of clearances and closer cooperation between the UN’s verification team and the Saudi-led coalition. But this assurance has been given before and Mordaunt added she would be monitoring this undertaking. The issue is injecting a new tension into the normally close UK-Saudi relations. Yemen is gripped by a brutal civil war that has lasted 1,000 days as of Tuesday. There is a growing international outcry at Saudi methods used against the Houthi rebels in what has been seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Both sides have been accused of war crimes, corruption and brutality. Mordaunt had been in Djibouti to speak to aid workers about how international aid is failing to be distributed within Yemen, where she said she had heard harrowing reports of the scale of the crisis. She also discussed how the UN-overseen inspections team, in conjunction with the Saudis, was examining ships to ensure no weaponsdestined for Houthi rebels were being smuggled into the country via humanitarian or commercial aid shipments. The Saudis have been accused of strangling aid through bureaucratic delays. In the Commons last week the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had warned the Saudis against using starvation as a weapon of war, but there was little sign in the past week that his remarks had unsettled Riyadh into speeding the flow of aid. Mourdant did not directly accuse the Saudis of breaching humanitarian law, saying instead: “It is very clear that if you are using starvation as a weapon you are in breach of international humanitarian law. And what I have seen on my visit is that what is being held up is aid.” She added: “I very much understand the importance of our relationship with Saudi Arabia. But we do not help that relationship by not speaking about the facts of the matter.” Breaches of humanitarian law are the UK government threshold for deciding if ministers can grant export licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Mordaunt stressed wrongdoing was occurring on both sides in the Yemen civil war as she announced an extra £50m in UK aid. The war is now widely described as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster, and its resolution has been declared by Johnson as his number one priority. Following a missile attack on Riyadh airport that the US and Saudis claim was orchestrated by Iran, the Saudis three weeks ago imposed a blockade on most humanitarian and all commercial aid reaching the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/18/ashes-10-moments-that-decided-the-series","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T17:04:27Z","webTitle":"The Ashes: 10 moments, little and large, that decided the series | Rob Smyth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/18/ashes-10-moments-that-decided-the-series","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/18/ashes-10-moments-that-decided-the-series","fields":{"headline":"The Ashes: 10 moments, little and large, that decided the series","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Stokes’ night in Bristol The Ashes isn’t always about the actual cricket. The most significant moment of the epic 2005 series came during a game of touch rugby, when Glenn McGrath stood on a stray cricket ball and was injured on the morning of the second Test. In 2017, the England players’ apparently harmless decision to have a few beers in Bristol after an ODI victory over West Indies had unimaginable consequences. Ben Stokes may not have made much difference but we will never know for sure what happened in that parallel universe. 2) A single error at the Gabba James Vince looked to the Gabba born on the first day of the series, batting beautifully with Mark Stoneman to challenge all the spook stories about Australia’s pace attack. And then he went and spoiled it all by saying something stupid like ‘Yes!’ Vince’s decision to take a quick single backfired when he was run out for 83 by a brilliant throw from Nathan Lyon in the covers. With Joe Root falling soon after, England’s opening day was downgraded from almost perfect to merely promising. 3) Smith’s slender slice of luck Even the greatest innings include a hard-luck story or two from the fielding side. Usually it’s a dropped catch or a poor umpiring decision – but Steve Smith was in such control during his immense 141 not out during Australia’s first innings at the Gabba that England could only reflect on a couple of near misses in consecutive overs. First he edged Moeen Ali just short of slip and then mistimed a pull off Chris Woakes that instead landed safely and went for four. Smith was only in the 20s when they happened, with Australia already four down for under a hundred. After that, though, he barely played another false stroke. 4) Lack of ruthlessness There were times when England failed to recognise the moment, never mind seize it. The most important came either side of lunch on day three of the first Test. Australia were seven down, almost 100 behind, and Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad had both struck with the second new ball. Yet they were given only three and four overs respectively, allowing Australia to regroup against the back-up seamers. By the time Anderson and Broad returned, the No9 Pat Cummins was comfortable at the crease and Australia were on their way to a vital first-innings lead. 5) The wonky crease England’s second innings at Brisbane, when they were bowled out for 195, was when the series started to slip away. Only once were Australia under significant pressure, when Jonny Bairstow and Moeen were counterattacking breezily on the fourth afternoon. England were 155 for five, 126 ahead, when Moeen was given out stumped off Nathan Lyon – a Spandex-tight call based on a crease line that had not exactly been painted with loving precision. It sparked another collapse, and Australia ended up winning a tight match by 10 wickets. 6) Root’s Adelaide call The perspective of time should ensure that Root’s decision to bowl in Adelaide is not laughed about in the same breath as the infamous calls by Nasser Hussain in 2002-03 and Ricky Ponting in 2005. But it was an unnecessarily risky decision; the kind you make at 2-0 down, not 1-0 down. If it played to England’s strength, Anderson and Broad, it also played to their weaknesses, particularly an inability to cope with scoreboard pressure. And on a tour where perception has sometimes been more important than reality, it invited negativity as only bowling first can. 7) DRS doubts Not even technology’s word is final. There were plenty of doubts about the accuracy and application of DRS in the first three Tests, never more so than when Anderson trapped Shaun Marsh lbw on the second morning at Adelaide. Marsh’s review looked on the desperate side of optimistic. So when the Specsavers ball-tracker suggested the ball was bouncing over the stumps, many felt DRS should have gone to a different optician. Marsh was on 29 at the time; he went on to make a match-winning 126 not out. 8) Cummins times it just right Smith was having a public meltdown on the fourth evening at Adelaide, with Root and Dawid Malan inching England into the ascendancy. Australia desperately needed a wicket to change the mood of the match – and of their captain – going into the final day. In the last half-hour Cummins, an impact bowler who transcends statistics with the timing of his wickets, produced a furious delivery to bowl Malan and give Australia a slight advantage that they exploited ruthlessly on the fifth morning. 9) Smith ignores ego When the returning Mitchell Marsh bowled two poor overs on the second morning at Perth, Smith put the needs of the team above those of Marsh’s ego. England had scored 36 from the last four overs, so Smith took off Marsh and brought on Nathan Lyon to restore order. He dried up the runs so successfully that, instead of waiting for bad balls, Malan now had to manufacture scoring opportunities. In doing so he was caught brilliantly off a leading edge, sparking a wretched collapse from 368 for four to 403 all out. 10) Starc’s wonderball Mitchell Starc’s ball to Vince did not change the third Test, which by that stage was always going to be won by Australia. But it was the champagne moment of the series, one that will forever be used as visual shorthand for the 2017-18 Ashes. It was also emphatic confirmation that, though England had opportunities earlier in the series, they were now undertaking an exercise in futility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/19/chelsea-andreas-christensen-bournemouth-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T22:29:06Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte hails Andreas Christensen as Chelsea's 'best surprise'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/19/chelsea-andreas-christensen-bournemouth-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/19/chelsea-andreas-christensen-bournemouth-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte hails Andreas Christensen as Chelsea's 'best surprise'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has described Andreas Christensen’s impact as “the best surprise” of the season and earmarked the defender as a future Chelsea captain as he prepares to send out an experimental side in the Carabao Cup quarter-final at Stamford Bridge. Ethan Ampadu, the 17-year-old Wales international whose only Chelsea start came in the previous round, will partner Danny Drinkwater in midfield against Bournemouth , with Kenedy operating at left wing-back. Dujon Sterling, 18, a member of England under-19s’ successful European Championship campaign over the summer, and Callum Hudson-Odoi, 17, who helped the national side win the under-17s World Cup in October, are expected to be on the bench. The latter has yet to represent the first team. Conte was keen to stress the selections are based on merit – “I do not hand out stupid presents to people who don’t deserve them,” he said and pointed to Christensen’s contribution at the heart of the defence as an example of an academy graduate taking his chance. The 21-year-old, who spent the past two seasons on loan at Borussia Mönchengladbach, has started 11 Premier League games and stepped into the breach impressively with David Luiz off form and now hampered for the foreseeable future by a knee complaint. Christensen, who signed a five-year deal in 2015, is likely in the next few months to be rewarded with a new contract which better reflects the impact he has made. “Every time I have decided to give Christensen the opportunity to play, he has given an amazing performance and convinced me he has to play regularly,” Conte said. “Christensen is maybe the best surprise from the start of this season: for me, the club, his team-mates, the fans. It’s not simple to see this composure, this calmness in such a young player. Chelsea have found a player who can have the same career as some of the best defenders here. He has the right characteristics to play for this club for many years. I can predict a fantastic career. “The player is very happy to stay with us and play with this regularity. Maybe his expectation wasn’t so optimistic: to arrive in a team like Chelsea and play every game. But he has. For sure [he could be a future captain]. When you start like this playing in a great club, the future is yours.” Conte, who made his Serie A debut as a 16-year-old with Lecce, will rest the majority of his senior players, with Michy Batshuayi granted a rare start up front. The Belgian has been hampered by an ankle complaint recently, with the manager having made clear what the £32m forward has to do to play more often. “He has to show me he’s better than Álvaro Morata, or Eden Hazard,” Conte said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/nigerian-politician-dino-melaye-causes-stir-cameo-rap-video-kach","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T17:43:10Z","webTitle":"Nigerian politician Dino Melaye causes stir with cameo in rap video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/nigerian-politician-dino-melaye-causes-stir-cameo-rap-video-kach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/19/nigerian-politician-dino-melaye-causes-stir-cameo-rap-video-kach","fields":{"headline":"Nigerian politician Dino Melaye causes stir with cameo in rap video","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some politicians send Christmas cards of themselves posing as bacon sandwich-eating bikers. Some tell self-effacing jokes about their bald spots. But a Nigerian senator may have taken political self-deprecation to new heights after appearing in a music video featuring fast cars, dollar bills and his own name on repeat – either celebrating his ostentatious wealth or in a deeply ironic parody. With “LEGEND” written on his T-shirt, Dino Melaye, the senator for Kogi West, appears in the video for which he reportedly provided his house, cars and money. “Balling every day like Ronaldinho. Money spending no aristo. Dino, Dino, Dino Melaye,” sings the artist Kach, while talking on a phone that is actually a stack of cash, then lounging on a bed with gold chains around his neck and a woman massaging his shoulders, and finally throwing money out of a Rolls-Royce. At one point, Kach and friends sit at a dining table pretending to eat hundred dollar bills. Kach makes afro trap, a hip-hop genre pioneered by MHD, and is the son of Nigeria’s minister of state for petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu. At first, Sola Tayo, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London, was taken in. “I thought it was satire, very bold satire,” she said. “I thought wow, this is incredible, he’s gone to all the trouble of getting the most realistic Dino lookalike. If it’s not a glowing tribute to him, it’s a slick rebuke of him.” Satire is growing in popularity in Nigeria, which recently held its inaugural satire festival and launched a Daily Show-style TV programme, The Other News. Melaye is also the author of Antidotes for Corruption, a book that, according to its cover, tries to “infiltrate the Nigerian psyche and instruct them that this [corruption] is a menace that must be understood and tackled head on”. At the same time, he has said he will die before he stops supporting Bukola Saraki, Nigeria’s Senate president, who has spent most of his tenure fighting cases of corruption and failure to declare assets. It is unclear how Melaye made his money. “People like Dino are notorious for their extravagance – they’re not shy of showing off their wealth,” Tayo said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/25/electric-and-plug-in-hybrid-cars-3m-worldwide","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T13:29:29Z","webTitle":"Electric and plug-in hybrid cars whiz past 3m mark worldwide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/25/electric-and-plug-in-hybrid-cars-3m-worldwide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/25/electric-and-plug-in-hybrid-cars-3m-worldwide","fields":{"headline":"Electric and plug-in hybrid cars whiz past 3m mark worldwide","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The number of fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars on the world’s roads has passed the 3m mark, as manufacturers ramp up their plans for mass production of battery-powered vehicles. Industry watchers said the milestone was passed in November, with the growth rate indicating that electric car sales are now running at around 1m a year. The rapid growth is being driven by government incentives, manufacturers launching models for a wider mix of drivers and falling battery costs. EV-Volumes, a Sweden-based group that tracks the global electric car market, predicted sales will accelerate next year and bring the total number of battery-powered cars on the roads to around 5m by the end of 2018. Next year will see a raft of new models from big manufacturers, including a longer range version of the Nissan Leaf, the world’s best selling electric car, as well as larger models such as the Jaguar iPace. Despite production problems at electric car poster child Tesla, the US company’s flagship mass market Model 3 has been rolling out to customers in the United States. EV Volumes said that China, the world’s biggest market for electric cars, was in the “global driver seat” when it comes to growth. Beijing is encouraging drivers to buy electric with a suite of incentives, as it attempts to tackle its smog problems. China is also the first market targeted by Toyota for the 10 electric car models it plans to sell by the early 2020s. The world’s second biggest carmaker said this month that by around 2025 it would stop launching new petrol and diesel cars without a partially or fully electric version, in a pledge similar to ones made by Volvo and Jaguar earlier this year. The Japanese firm hopes the moves will see it sell a million electric cars a year by 2030. Industry watchers said the plan marked a shift in direction for Toyota, which led the take-up of hybrid cars with the launch of the Prius 20 years ago. “For the last decade they have been very much wedded to a hydrogen future,” said Ben Lane, director of Next Green Car. Toyota’s commitments on electric cars allow the company to hedge its bets, he said. “Until now they’ve not been committed to battery electric. This looks like they’re joining all the other mainstream manufacturers in the battery rollout.” VW, which overtook Toyota as the world’s biggest carmaker in January, is among rivals who have recently set electric car sales goals, also targeting 1m a year albeit by the earlier date of 2025. The number of models Toyota is planning is similar to rivals such as BMW, which aims to offer 12 by 2025. Toyota also said that it aimed to launch a new generation of batteries in the early 2020s that would enable electric cars to travel further, using solid-state technology that allows batteries to be cheaper, safer and offer more capacity. “Solid state batteries are significant because [they] take a lot less time to change, they are lighter and give more range,” said a Toyota UK spokesperson. This month BMW said it was also pursuing the use of solid-state batteries in electric cars, as it announced a partnership with US battery firm Solid Power. The German firm announced it had sold 100,000 electric cars in 2017, up 60% on last year. While electric car sales are growing fast, analysts noted that 1m is still a small fraction of the 80m cars sold worldwide each year. “Fears in the media about [oil] demand destruction from electric vehicles in the short term are misplaced,” said Chris Midgley, global head of analytics at energy pricing agency S&amp;P Global Platt. However, the growth rate indicated by EV Volume’s predictions is pushing the competition between global car makers into the arena of next-generation models."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/06/jon-mcgregor-my-writing-day","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Jon McGregor: ‘I have never been asked how I juggle writing and fatherhood’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/06/jon-mcgregor-my-writing-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/06/jon-mcgregor-my-writing-day","fields":{"headline":"Jon McGregor: ‘I have never been asked how I juggle writing and fatherhood’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I read an interview in the New Yorker recently with Mikaela Shiffrin, one of the world’s leading slalom skiers, in which she talked about how little time she actually spends on the slopes. After accounting for the hours spent travelling between training runs, kitting out, warming up and sitting on chairlifts, even the most dedicated skier will struggle to get more than seven minutes skiing out of a training day. Contrary to the famous Malcolm Gladwell assertion that success requires 10,000 hours of practice, Shiffrin considers it the height of dedication to be achieving 11 hours of skiing over the course of a year. In many ways, I like to think of myself as an Olympic medal-winning skier. Sometimes, when people ask how long it takes to write a novel, I wonder what they really want to hear. How long does it take to get to the bottom of the ski run? How much of that seven years was spent actually writing the actual text that went into the actual finished novel? In common with most people who work from home – and have more than one job, and have children in their lives – the mechanics of when and where I’m actually sitting at a desk doing work are complex and inconsistent. But even taking that into account, the work that actually happens at a desk is not always time spent actually writing. There are other things that happen. There are other sorts of time, besides the writing time. There is thinking time, reading time, research time and sketching out ideas time. There is working on the first page over and over again until you find the tone you’re looking for time. There is spending just five minutes catching up on email time. There is spending five minutes more on Twitter because, in a way, that is part of the research process time. There is writing time, somewhere in there. There is making the coffee and clearing away the coffee and thinking about lunch and making the lunch and clearing away the lunch time. There is stretching the legs time. There is going for a long walk because all the great writers always talk about walking time being the best thinking time, and then there is getting back from that walk and realising what the hell the time is now time. There’s looking back over what you’ve written so far and deciding it is all a load of awkwardly phrased bobbins time; there is wondering what kind of a way this is to make a living at all time. There is finding the tail-end of an idea that might just work and trying to get that down on the page before you run out of time time. There is answering emails that just can’t be put off any longer time. There is moving to another table and setting a timer and refusing to look up from the page until you’ve written for 40 minutes solid time. There is reading that back and crossing it out time. And then there is running out of the door and trying to get to the school gates at anything like a decent time time. (Fun fact: I have never been asked how I juggle writing and fatherhood. I’m not complaining; it’s nobody’s business, and nothing to do with writing. But I wonder what assumptions lie behind the question of juggling writing and motherhood coming up so regularly?) I rarely manage a whole unbroken day at the desk. And it can be frustrating, sometimes. Once or twice a year I manage to get away somewhere and live like a hermit for a week, eating and sleeping next to a desk and talking to no one and getting a lot of work done. Imagine if I could work like that all the time, I think, then. Think how productive I’d be! But if my life was always like that, I suspect I’d have very little to write about. Those seven minutes that Shiffrin spends on the training runs each day are the culmination of everything else she does: the time she spends thinking about her technique, working on her fitness, weight training. Even the time on the chairlift is time spent planning her next run, assessing the snow conditions, observing the weather. In this analogy, sharpening pencils and buying new notebooks is the same as weight training, thank you. I imagine, however, that sometimes Shiffrin dreams of setting off from the starting gate and discovering that the training run is 10 times as long as she was expecting, and that she can get an hour of unbroken skiing under her belt, and suddenly everything else falls away while she puts all her concentration into this thing she has spent her life trying to get better at doing, the powder crunching beneath her skis, the wind in her face, the passing trees a faint blur; and when she finally reaches the bottom – where the crowds would usually be, but today there is no one – she lifts the goggles from her face and turns to the electronic scoreboard to see how she got on. Not quite good enough. Not quite what she was trying to do. The chairlift awaits.

Look more carefully, however, and you find people living a very different life. Starting at the crack of dawn, Stephen Fowler, manager of the Dairy House hostel, is conducting a tour of the area’s “homeless haunts”. On the long drive taking in the market towns of Glastonbury, Shepton Mallet and Frome, he revisits the spots where outreach workers from his hostel have discovered people on previous tours. “People assume there’s no poverty in an area like this but there is,” says Fowler, who points out that it’s often hidden. “If you’re going to rough sleep around here, it’s [usually] in the hedge rather than the shop doorway.” Tucked away amid the watery rhines (drainage ditches) and woodlands, dozens of tents are counted during the tour – often adorned with poignant symbols of home. The area around one tent is decorated with bunting; another is pitched next to a bench with a sign saying “LOVE” on it. A lot of these places would be hard to spot to the untrained eye – which may go some way to explaining why rural homelessness is often overlooked in comparison to those rough sleeping on the streets of the UK’s towns and cities. But research by the IPPR thinktank shows a 42% rise in rough sleeping in England’s 91 predominantly rural local authorities between 2010, when there were 397 rough sleepers, and 2016, when there were 565. The Dairy House is the only direct access hostel in the area, meaning it will accept people who haven’t yet gone through the burdensome process of applying to the council for housing. Those accepted (up to a maximum of six at any time) live in a cottage set amid 1,000 acres of farmland, a tiny lake and a vegetable garden. Volunteers, staff and residents can often be found in the garden’s sun tunnel, laughing and eating fresh produce next to ripening pumpkins. John Gray, 50, has always lived in the countryside. As a manual labourer he never learned to use a computer, which made it hard when he first applied for benefits. Gray became homeless after suffering a mental breakdown; when he was released from the hospital, he had nowhere to go. “Without places like the Dairy House, there’s absolutely nowhere,” he says. “When I left [the hospital], they checked where I was going but didn’t follow up.” This shouldn’t have been the case, according to Jai Vick, Mendip district council’s housing services manager: “We have emergency accommodation for adults, who can stay with a host family, but it depends on whether the person is appropriate. We also have an emergency duty team who can place people in bed and breakfast,” she says. What about providing an emergency night shelter? “Geography is a massive issue,” Vick replies. “Where would you put it? We don’t have public transport in the same way here. Our closest train is seven miles out of town [Shepton Mallet]. We send our teams to people, to remove these sorts of barriers, but our specific rural context makes it harder.” Gray talks about the process of isolation that drove him to sleeping in laybys in his caravan, then in the nearby adventure park when he began sleeping rough. “I feel safer in less visible places,” he says. “I started off at the bandstand [in Wells]; I thought it looked safer, but there were a lot of people taking drugs there. I didn’t like it.” He explains that his mental health was a factor in wanting to be hidden away: “Sometimes, with such mental health issues, you don’t want to be around people. I even turned my own family away. They didn’t know I was mentally unwell.” Some of the barriers to Gray accessing help relate to this rural setting. Public transport is expensive: when Gray first signed up to receive universal credit once he got settled in at the Dairy House, he says he spent £67 on buses to his allocated JobCentre in Bath, because they couldn’t process his claim at one closer by. Advisers in the Citizens Advice Bureau in Shepton Mallet report sending people to court in taxis for fear they will end up unfairly prosecuted, with no train early enough to take them. The Department for Communities and Local Government does not recognise rural homelessness as a separate problem. A DCLG spokesman says: “Tackling homelessness is a complex issue with no single solution, but we’re determined to help the most vulnerable in society, whether they live in towns, cities or rural areas.” However, in rural areas, homelessness feels very different. Paddy Johnston was discovered by Dairy House staff on one of their early-morning scouting tours. He describes how he gradually found himself living rough in ever-more isolated places, fearing groups of men coming out of pubs drunk and rowdy. “You fear retribution for sleeping rough – people aren’t very nice,” he says. “If you go into the countryside, you’re sort of away from all that.” But there are elements that make countryside rough sleeping dangerous, too. Johnston mentions run-ins with unhappy farm owners after, unbeknown to him, he had pitched up on their private farmland. Whether in the countryside or a city, he says: “Generally, you’re in hiding.” Johnston grew up in care, and at 16 was placed with a foster family on “a massive country estate” in Worcestershire, where he was looked after by the maid. It wasn’t long before he decided to pack up and leave. “It was completely horrible. Any civility I had gained, I lost. I was left in the middle of nowhere. I literally didn’t know anyone there.” He became a baker before developing an alcohol problem, which he says was a way of coping with his abusive past. Since then, years of homelessness and unemployment have made it harder to get his life back on track. “In the earlier days it was easier because you could get a job. That’s not so easy nowadays.” With the help of the Dairy House, however, Johnston’s life has turned around: six weeks ago, he left the hostel to live in a nearby communal log cabin which, he says, “suits me down to the ground”. The scheme was set up to support people who have been rough sleepers, but aren’t quite ready to live in traditional bricks and mortar housing. Yet the general picture in Mendip appears bleak: workers at the local Citizens Advice Bureau report growing destitution in the region, including among people with jobs. “In the last six or so years, the level of destitution has massively gone up here,” says Sam Hook, one of the CAB advisers. “Never before did we see so many people who were starving. I’ve never given out so many food vouchers before.” ‘I used to have three homes’ Nicholas Shipton, 53, once owned three houses and had his own landscape gardening business, renting out one of his properties through the council to survivors of domestic violence. But when his wife left him, he says he went off the rails. He found an abandoned factory, sleeping on some car seats inside: “It had a roof but it was horrible. I used to hide there every day, then go out and steal things to eat.” Shipton points out that in the countryside there is less begging and visible homelessness, which might explain why people think it’s less of a problem. National initiatives such as No Second Night Out, which involves outreach teams finding rough sleepers based on referrals and scanning the streets, don’t cater to unearthing this type of homelessness. At Mendip council, Vick says: “We have tried our best to adhere to it, but it’s really different [in a rural setting]. We’re not a unitary authority, we are two tier. That means people can’t get to us, we have to go to them, which takes staff time. You spend longer building relationships with people. If you don’t have a car and you live in the woods, you are not going to walk to services; we will need to send someone. All these things require additional funding.” Shipton puts it quite simply: “It’s all very well making these policies, but they don’t suit everybody. We need to take everybody as an individual, and treat them as such.” He adds: “People see the countryside as picturesque: a holiday destination free from problems such as poverty and homelessness. But nearly everything’s owned by someone else who doesn’t live here.” He isn’t angry at individuals, though: “I used to have three homes. Why shouldn’t they, if they’ve worked hard?” A local estate agent, Ian Oldham, says he has seen a marked increase in the number of people purchasing properties solely to let them out through Airbnb. According to the 2011 census, 6% of houses in the Mendip area are second homes, and a large proportion of other homes are left empty. The transitory nature of this area, with young people leaving and older people moving to the countryside to retire after they have made their money, can mask the deeper inequality and poverty beneath. Conservative councillor Harvey Siggs, leader of Mendip district council, says a number of young people – including his own children – have had to leave to get well-paid jobs in the city, as Mendip is a low-wage economy. Siggs calls it a choice to stay in the countryside – to stick to a relaxed lifestyle over the busy bustle of the city. Others say they have no choice but to stay here. A recent report by the Social Mobility Commission identified nearby West Somerset as the most unequal region in England in terms of social mobility. Wells was one of the “trial areas” where universal credit was first rolled out about 18 months ago. Anecdotally, this seems to be causing problems: the local estate agent talks about rising numbers of landlords refusing to take universal credit claimants, while Citizens Advice says the majority of the calls it receives are from people on universal credit. But Siggs says he hasn’t heard about any problems with the programme. In Mendip at least, the burden of dealing with rural homelessness depends on a number of well-meaning individuals. The Dairy House hostel is run in collaboration with the Elim Connect Centre Church (where Fowler is an ordained minister), the district council, and the tenant farmers, Suzanne and Rob Addicott. Fowler says the hostel would never have been started up without community fundraising, and the dedication of a small number of people in the area wanting to address Mendip’s growing homelessness. Their effort is much appreciated by the people living at the hostel, but resident Nicholas Shipton believes the service should be provided by the state. “We should judge ourselves on how we look after our weak members,” he says. “If we’re not doing that, we’re not doing a good job on anything.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com Some names have been changed at the interviewees’ request"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/lib-dems-call-for-second-eu-referendum-in-december-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems call for second EU referendum in December 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/lib-dems-call-for-second-eu-referendum-in-december-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/lib-dems-call-for-second-eu-referendum-in-december-2018","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems call for second EU referendum in December 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain could have a second EU referendum as an early Christmas present in 2018, the Liberal Democrats have said, proposing a lengthy 12-week campaign starting in September to give the UK the option to accept a deal or stay in the EU. The party said holding a referendum on the final deal – which the government has repeatedly ruled out – in December was compatible with the tight timetable of EU withdrawal, falling within the article 50 timeframe of two years, which will end in March 2019. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said a referendum should be timed to coincide with EU states’ own votes on the final agreement. The party’s proposed timing for a referendum would mean a final deal needing to be agreed in time for campaigning to kick off in September, just nine months away. Critics have argued that a second referendum would be an incentive for European leaders to give the UK a poor exit deal. Theresa May said in the Commons on Monday that promising a referendum would “actually be betraying the British people”. Cable said there was growing public support for a referendum on the final deal, citing a recent poll by Survation that found 50% of respondents wanted a vote. “This potential timeline to a public vote shows Brexit is not a done deal. It can be stopped, but not without the approval of the British public,” he said. “It’s time the Conservatives – and the Labour leadership – listened.” The party proposes a timetable for a referendum beginning when the EU withdrawal bill is given royal assent in April 2018. It has proposed an amendment to the legislation, to be debated on Wednesday, which would give a final vote on the deal to the British public. The amendment is highly unlikely to pass. The party’s proposed timetable is: April 2018: government introduces a referendum on the deal bill. May 2018: referendum on the deal bill receives royal assent September 2018: a 12-week referendum campaign begins, with a vote scheduled for early December. September-December 2018: the European parliament votes on the final Brexit settlement, and the European Council approves the deal. December 2018: the referendum, and a parliamentary vote to adopt the result. If remain were to win, the government would formally withdraw from the article 50 process. Cable said his party would campaign to remain in the EU regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, as any deal agreed could not have better terms than full membership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/26/voter-id-trials-could-disenfranchise-older-people","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T08:00:43Z","webTitle":"Voter ID trials 'could disenfranchise older people'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/26/voter-id-trials-could-disenfranchise-older-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/26/voter-id-trials-could-disenfranchise-older-people","fields":{"headline":"Voter ID trials 'could disenfranchise older people'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Trials to make people show identification before they can vote could unfairly affect older people who are less likely to possess photo ID or have access to other documents, the Labour party and charities have warned. The proposal to counter voter fraud by making people show ID will be piloted in five parts of England for the local elections in May, ministers announced this year. Voters in Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford and Swindon will be asked to produce identification. In some areas people will be asked for photo ID such as a passport or driving licence, in others they will just have to show the polling card sent out to people’s homes. A Labour analysis of the test areas has shown that at least 10,000 people aged 65 or over, and possibly many more, in the five towns are unlikely to have approved photo ID. This is because older people are less likely to have a passport or driving licence. Data from the 2011 census shows that while 83% of adults overall have a passport, this falls to 70% of the over-65s and 46% for those aged 85 and over. For driving licences, the National Travel Survey shows that while 73% of those aged 17-plus hold one, this falls to 62% for those 70 or older, and to 50% for women of this age group. Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement, said the trial would “present a major challenge for many older people”. She said: “Polling stations are already inaccessible, particularly for those who are not independently mobile and individuals living in residential care. With a significant proportion of older people not carrying personal ID, this additional requirement presents yet another barrier to democratic engagement. “With less than six months to go until the local elections, the Cabinet Office needs to set out clear guidelines on how those without photo ID will be able to vote as soon as parliament returns so that no older voter is disenfranchised.” Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “Whilst electoral fraud is an issue that must be combatted, there is a risk that the introduction of voter ID cards will have a disproportionate impact on older voters. “We know that older people often face barriers when they are asked to prove their identity. They may not have a utility bill, particularly if they live in a care home or a relative looks after their bills, and are much less likely to have standard types of ID such as passports and driving licences. “Older people are also likely to face other hurdles, including barriers to accessing transport and limited mobility, which can make getting to a polling station much harder. “It’s important that any scheme put in place to address electoral fraud does not inadvertently disenfranchise certain groups, including older people.” The government will decide on its plans for voter ID after analysing the trials. In Northern Ireland, voters have had to show ID since 1985. Chris Skidmore, the minister for the constitution, said the government was working closely with the pilot local authorities and others to ensure eligible voters were not stopped, and that there were contingency plans in place in each area. He said: “Safeguarding our democracy so that every voter’s identity is protected and electoral fraud is eliminated is a key part of ensuring we can have confidence in our democracy, protecting some of the most vulnerable whose identity could be at risk of being stolen.” • This article was amended on 1 January 2018 to reflect the fact that Swindon had replaced Slough as a location for the voter ID trial."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/french-race-row-erupts-as-feminist-forced-off-advisory-body","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"French race row erupts as feminist forced off advisory body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/french-race-row-erupts-as-feminist-forced-off-advisory-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/french-race-row-erupts-as-feminist-forced-off-advisory-body","fields":{"headline":"French race row erupts as feminist forced off advisory body","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A bitter row over the difficulties of debating racism in France has erupted after a high-profile feminist and anti-racism campaigner was forced off a government advisory body, prompting the resignation of the director and most of its members. Journalist Rokhaya Diallo has repeatedly spoken out against what she calls institutional racism in France, notably police stop and search practices against non-white young men. Diallo, 39, was one of 30 people appointed last week to France’s national digital council, the CNNum, an independent commission of digital experts. The voluntary panel was to advise the centrist president Emmanuel Macron’s government on a new, more inclusive digital policy. The appointments were approved by the digital minister Mounir Mahjoubi – one of the few faces of ethnic diversity in government – as well as the prime minister. But the government then bowed to complaints about Diallo’s presence. Far-right commentators on social media attacked Diallo, then the mainstream rightwing party Les Républicains wrote an open letter to the government to complain that Diallo had in the past been outspoken on “institutional racism” in France and had supported feminist movements where black women had attended closed meetings to speak among themselves about racism and sexism. The party also slammed the appointment of the rapper, Axiom, criticising his lyrics. Some in the leftwing Socialists – as well as the former prime minister Manuel Valls, who now sits with Macron’s La République En Marche party in parliament — supported evicting Diallo. The government swiftly appeared to kick out Diallo, promising a reshuffle in order for the body to work more “calmly”. The French Human Rights League slammed the government’s “worrying” decision, saying: “In a democracy, the state must respect the pluralism of opinions to inform public action and enrich it.” Marie Ekeland, a French start-up entrepreneur and head of the digital advisory body, stood down on Tuesday, followed by scores of other members. Ekeland said the row showed “in France, we don’t want to hear dissonant voices. It shows to what point we don’t know how to calmly debate different points of view.” Diallo, whose work includes a recent documentary From Paris to Ferguson about a new generation of anti-racism activists, told the Guardian: “I think it shows there’s a great tension. Marie Ekeland, who appointed this committee, is ahead of the game and very optimistic about the capacity of the French to discuss and talk to each other. What you can see today is there are topics which are very hard to discuss in France, namely race issues.” She added: “There has been a wave of support for me by people including the French Human Rights League, who understand that for the health of democratic debate, all voices need to be heard. It shows there is a desire for democracy. There are generations now who understand that France today is also made up of people like me, that I’m part of France today, and whether you want to listen to me or not, you have to take that into account. It’s painful for some people but crucial for the future.” Diallo, who had been in Cairo addressing a United Nations meeting about online hate, said: “Abroad, there’s an understanding of what’s at stake France, but in France, people are putting their heads in the sand.” The row comes as Macron’s new government is on edge about debate around about any kind of institutional racism. The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, last month announced in parliament that he would sue a teachers union in the ethnically diverse Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris for using the term “institutional racism” while holding workshops on the education system. Diallo said she would continue to talk of institutional racism in France, citing the state citizens’ rights ombudsman who has warned against police racial profiling, saying young men perceived as Arab or black are 20 times more likely to have their identities checked. Last month, she invited the education minister to sue her for it, if he sees fit. “When I talked of institutional racism in France, I was hugely reproached for it,” Diallo said. “The fact is that Jean-Michel Blanquer, instead of concerning himself with the racism that is produced by the state, prefers to take legal action against an expression.. “What we should be doing is making sure the education system doesn’t reproduce racist mechanisms and guarantees all pupils and teachers racism-free access.” The foundation stone of the French Republic is that all citizens should be equal and free from distinctions of class, race or religion. It is illegal to classify people by ethnicity or to collect data or ask census questions on race or origins. But campaigners say this masks ongoing problems of racism and discrimination in society."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/19/facebook-social-media-cold-turkey-devices","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T16:04:28Z","webTitle":"When Facebook asks if social media is bad for us, it’s time to listen | Nigel Kendall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/19/facebook-social-media-cold-turkey-devices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/19/facebook-social-media-cold-turkey-devices","fields":{"headline":"When Facebook asks if social media is bad for us, it’s time to listen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Perhaps the back-room staff at Facebook have been gorging themselves on feelgood seasonal movies, or the ghost of Christmas future popped by. Something certainly seems to have prompted the glimmer of conscience that’s on display in a recent Facebook news post, entitled Hard Questions: Is Spending Time on Social Media Bad for Us? “In general,” write the post’s authors, David Ginsberg and Moira Burke, “when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information – reading but not interacting with people – they report feeling worse afterward.” As revelations go, it’s right up there with the fact that repeatedly punching yourself in the face can result in facial injuries, but what is significant is not what’s being said, but who is saying it. For Facebook to be openly writing about this on its own site is like McDonald’s, KFC and Domino’s forming an alliance to promote the role of green vegetables in a balanced diet. Unsurprisingly, the ultimate answer to Facebook’s headline question turns out to be, “Well, err, yes and no.” What is surprising is that the implied solution in this post is to become more, rather than less, involved in your Facebook community. In other words, the beatings will stop when morale improves. No matter how many shovels full of salt you take its conclusion with, Facebook’s willingness to address the question of its own influence reflects growing alarm about the power of social media, and about the online companies’ traditional approach to the content they host, which is not so much arm’s length as a bargepole away. This is also proving to be a rich seam for academics to mine. Dr Brian Primack of the University of Pittsburgh last year conducted a study among 1,787 young adults. “We were surprised with what we found,” he said. “We had expected a U-shaped curve, with a higher risk of depression being correlated with no social media use at all or excessive use. But instead what we found was a straight line. More social media use was associated with more depression in a linear fashion.” You might expect Primack to be manning the barricades and calling for a ban or more oversight. He’s not. “Social media, like many other technologies, represents a double-edged sword,” he said, “with many potential positive uses. Instead, we hope to help people use this medium for improving life and not inadvertently detracting from it.” In other words, moderation in all things. Human beings have always rushed to embrace new ideas, from farming to the internal combustion engine, without bothering to consider the possible consequences. Age, history and evolution do not necessarily confer wisdom on any of us, and when a new phenomenon such as the internet or social media comes along, we are all effectively children when learning to deal with it. So, why not acknowledge that fact and treat yourself as a child – more specifically as the child of someone who really does understand technology? Many of the world’s tech gurus, including Apple’s Jonathan Ive and the late Steve Jobs, strictly rationed the time their own children could spend on the machines they created in order to create a balance in their lives. It can be a struggle to maintain such balance. Several studies suggest that extended internet use can produce feelings of gratification akin to taking drugs or alcohol, and signs of addiction should perhaps be taken more seriously, particularly when the effects on mood and mental health can be so marked. Ultimately, though, any solution starts with the recognition of a problem. So here’s an experiment you might like to try. This year, as the turkey goes cold, go cold turkey. Strike an agreement with your friends on social media to put your phones or laptops to one side for a few days, then come back and compare notes. Will you reach for that phone like a smoker reaches for the packet? Or will you rediscover inner peace and feelings of goodwill to all? • Nigel Kendall is a freelance journalist and former senior content manager at Guardian Labs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/29/looking-back-new-year","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"Looking back: New Year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/29/looking-back-new-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/29/looking-back-new-year","fields":{"headline":"Looking back: New Year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1 January 1825 The Guardian’s editor offers “grateful and hearty thanks for the patronage with which it has been favoured” over the previous year.

A number of upcoming art exhibitions continue the protest, debate and argument around free speech, the environmental crisis, civil rights and feminism – and look back on a year that changed the game. The Brooklyn Museum opens an exhibition devoted to pioneers of feminist art in Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985 on 13 April, which explores the groundbreaking work of 120 artists from 15 countries. The politically charged artwork is used as a form of social critique, especially in the works of Brazilian performance artist Lygia Pape, Cuban film-maker Sara Gómez and Afro-Latina activist and artist Marta Moreno Vega, the founder of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute. How did women enter the workforce before their right to vote? After this year’s centennial of the women’s suffrage movement, In Her Words: Women’s Duty and Service in World War I opens on 2 February at the National Postal Museum in Washington, which shows how the military helped shape the women’s workforce in the early 1910s. This exhibition features four heroic women, including a nurse named Greta Wolf, by putting their personal artifacts and letters on view. Just as 2017 became an outspoken year of social criticism, on 20 January, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles opens Unspeakable, featuring the works of three artists defined as “social critics”. One piece is by text-based artist Barbara Kruger, who shows a video inspired by the cultural theorist Homi Bhabha, while Kara Walker shows a video inspired by the civil war and the life of a Virginia slave named Sally Hemings, believed to be the mother of six children with Thomas Jefferson. It has been a complicated year with Trump dropping climate change from the US national security strategy and on 19 May, an exhibition opens at the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, New York. Artists on Climate Change puts the work of a dozen artists on view who “speak to larger issues that affect regional, national, and global ecological health”, said John P Stern, the president of Storm King. The exhibition includes the works of David Brooks, who uses construction materials like roof shingles to draw attention to suburban sprawl, and Dear Climate, a group of activists who make and distribute posters to raise awareness around climate change. Another environmentally focused art show, Designed California, opens on 27 January at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. From old Apple prototypes to recycled design, it traces the history of socially conscious design in California from the 1960s to the 1980s. The show features the eco-friendly furniture of Charles and Ray Eames and brings back the Whole Earth Catalog, a counterculture publication that ran from 1968 to 1972. It has been 50 years since the civil rights movement and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, and one exhibition opening on 13 January at the Museum of the City of New York, called King in New York, shows photos that document his public protests, church sermons and speeches across the city. In one photo, King speaks about the American intervention in Vietnam in 1967, which was taken outside the UN headquarters. It also aims to show his lesser-known side, like his personal life, friendships and family. On the note of anniversaries, it has also been 50 years since the Vietnam War’s Tet Offensive, and on 26 January the exhibition The Marines and Tet: The Battle that Changed the Vietnam War will open at the Newseum in Washington. With 20 large-format photographs by award-winning Life magazine photographer John Olson, there are photos of the marines during Battle of Huê, alongside old cameras, audio interview clips with marines and objects, which can be handled by blind and low-vision visitors. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality, suggesting the internet will become a two-tier service – one for the rich, one for the poor. Two new exhibitions look at the power of mass surveillance, data collection and technology. Trevor Paglen: Sites Unseen opens on 21 June at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington with roughly 100 artworks that reveals fragments of the government’s secret operations. One new video will make its debut, one which uses facial recognition algorithms, called How to See Like a Machine. Over at International Center of Photography in New York City, British photographer Edmund Clark opens The Day Music Died, a 10-year survey exploring state secrecy. From Guantánamo Bay to Afghanistan and the CIA’s secret prison program, there are images of declassified documents, empty jail cafeterias and messy interrogation rooms. The artist aims to “reflect on how terror impacts us all by altering fundamental aspects of our society and culture”, writes the curator Erin Barnett. The show opens on 26 January. Street art goes indoors at The Hole in New York City, as one artist hacker named KATSUopens a solo show on 6 January. Memory Foam features the Brooklyn artist’s pioneering drone paintings, which are created autonomously by drones equipped with spray cans. He is also showing a series of portraits of criminals made with artificial intelligence software and other works which riff on the uncanny weirdness of Silicon Valley tech culture. In light of recent social justice activism across America, one icon of 20th-century art is being honored with a survey show, the late Chicago artist Leon Golub, a painter and Vietnam War protester. The Raw Nerve show opens on 6 February at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The artist was committed to social justice and on view are his portraits of Brazilian dictator Ernesto Geisel, interrogators, heads of state, mercenaries and victims of violence. And over at the Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, a new exhibition honors the unseen work of New York photographer, Leonard Fink. Out for the Camera opens on 24 January with hundreds of images that he shot in the 1970s and early 1980s in the West Village, from self-portraits in mirrors to gay bar culture and New York’s annual Pride marches. The American dream is at the core of a new, forthcoming exhibition opening at the Guggenheim museum in New York City, the first American survey of Vietnam-born Danish artist Danh Vo on 9 February, entitled Take My Breath Away. From American flags to everyday objects like washing machines and bar fridges, the sculptures on view reveal what the artist calls “the tiny diasporas of a person’s life”. The American military’s influence in south-east Asia is part of this exhibition, which also puts a critical lens towards the Statue of Liberty and the Kennedy era’s Camelot. The New Museum Triennial opens 13 February with a sprawling exhibition themed around Songs for Sabotage. Showcasing 30 artists from 19 countries, the work explores the boundaries of society’s power and structure, and on view are the cartoonish paintings of young Los Angeles artist Janiva Ellis, who documents life as an African American millennial, and the art collective Inhabitants, an online channel who upload video episodes by ever-changing themes and topics. As the co-curator Gary Carrion-Murayari says: “The exhibition amounts to a call for action, an active engagement, and an interference in political and social structures urgently requiring them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/20/uk-christmas-workers-earning-less-than-10-years-ago-tuc-report","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T06:01:07Z","webTitle":"UK's Christmas workers earning less than 10 years ago, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/20/uk-christmas-workers-earning-less-than-10-years-ago-tuc-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/20/uk-christmas-workers-earning-less-than-10-years-ago-tuc-report","fields":{"headline":"UK's Christmas workers earning less than 10 years ago, study shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many of those working on Christmas Day, including members of the clergy and the emergency services, will be paid less than a decade ago, with little sign that the earnings squeeze will fade in the new year, according to analysis. Real wages for the most-worked jobs on 25 December, barring kitchen staff, have fallen since 2007 due to rising inflation and meagre increases in pay, a TUC study has found. The unions’ umbrella group found doctors’ wages were more than £1,000 a month lower than a decade ago when taking account of inflation, while pay for prison and police officers had fallen by £400. Pay for security guards and nurses was also down by more than £100, while wages for Christmas Day workers in low-paid jobs – such as cleaners, carers, waiting staff and farm workers – had also fallen. The most important day of the year for the clergy, who orchestrate special church services across the country, comes as their pay has fallen by £300 in real terms over the last 10 years. Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, said: “While many of us are tucking in to the turkey, the UK’s Christmas workforce will be hard at work keeping vital services running. But their wages are worth even less than they were a decade ago.” The apparent lack of festive cheer for workers comes as analysis from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) points to continued pressure on pay in 2018. The industry body said it only a drop in inflation could lead to meaningful wage growth, despite fears that the UK could run out of enough people to fill jobs – which should act to drive up the bargaining power of workers to demand higher salaries. The latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics showed wages lagging behind inflation for an eighth month, when reporting a 2.3% annual rise in average weekly earnings in the three months to October. The UK’s jobless rate – at 4.3% – is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. The consumer price index measure of inflation rose to 3.1% last month amid the rising cost of importing food and fuel to Britain following the pound’s depreciation after the Brexit vote. Employers are growing increasingly concerned about the economy as ministers open negotiations with Brussels over Britain’s trading relationship with the EU. Not one of the 200 employers polled by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) believed economic conditions would be less challenging in 2018. Confidence among firms to recruit staff and to make investment decisions in the UK remains positive, but is falling, according to the REC. There are increasing concerns about a skills gap, illustrated by an increase in the number of vacancies to 798,000 in November – the highest level since comparable records began in 2001. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, said: “In 2017 we saw record-high employment but a big squeeze on household budgets. The next 12 months looks to be a case of more of the same.” Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/02/how-phantom-thread-undresses-our-ideas-about-toxic-masculinity","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T11:30:26Z","webTitle":"How Phantom Thread undresses our ideas about toxic masculinity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/02/how-phantom-thread-undresses-our-ideas-about-toxic-masculinity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/02/how-phantom-thread-undresses-our-ideas-about-toxic-masculinity","fields":{"headline":"How Phantom Thread undresses our ideas about toxic masculinity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“For the hungry boy,” scribbles a boarding-house waitress on a note of paper, before handing it back to her bewitched customer, after he orders an over-full English breakfast that could feed several men. So begins Paul Thomas Anderson’s glistening, magnificent Phantom Thread, and it’s a moment of rare, blithe sexiness in his oeuvre: a light little flirt-note – were the film set half a century later, it might be signed off with a smiley face – that sets in motion a far darker, more perverse and conflict-riven romance than most would expect from such breezy beginnings. The hungry boy is Reynolds Woodcock, a high-end couturier played by Daniel Day-Lewis with a perma-arch, stately air worthy of that splendid name. The waitress is Alma (Vicky Krieps), a soft-spoken Belgian immigrant with hidden steel in her nerves. Her note is not the last time the matter of his appetite will be brought up between them, though it won’t always be over breakfast, or over food at all. Throughout Phantom Thread, at the basest metaphorical level, man hungers and woman feeds; where the power lies in this dynamic is often hard to determine, though it’s hard to describe how it shifts without giving away the film’s exquisitely twisted secrets. Ravenous, even destructively toxic masculinity is hardly a new theme in Anderson’s oeuvre. Magnolia tackled it head-on via Tom Cruise’s performance as male-empowerment motivational speaker Frank TJ Mackey, a misogynist with a brittle alpha veneer and braying mantra of “respect the cock”. There Will Be Blood’s ruthless, loveless oil prospector Daniel Plainview craved possession of land and human souls in roughly equal measure; The Master gave us two spiritually poisoned men, each shaped and gnarled by dysfunctional relations with women, whose power struggle built into a crippled romance of egos. Phantom Thread isn’t as outwardly harsh as any of these films: ultimately a romantic comedy of a particularly perverse persuasion, it glides and whispers, folding its most disturbing psychological ideas into a strangely tender spirit of seduction. Anderson tracks the courtship of Reynolds and Alma as a delicate, push-pull affair, each partner severely reactive to the other’s acts of charity or cruelty. Yet the fundamental glitch in their relationship is established as early as the first date. In one of the film’s most startling, grotesquely comic jabs, Reynolds takes Alma back to his place and has her undress – not, to both her and the audience’s bemusement, to make love to her, but to clinically take her measurements for a gown, with the sudden, businesslike assistance of his Mrs Danvers-like sister Cyril (Lesley Manville). Reynolds wants a model and a muse before he wants a lover; he just can’t quite parse the difference. As such, the first half of Phantom Thread appears to pass along familiar lines: another story of a tortured male creative genius – yes, his gowns truly are gasp-worthy – taking out his art-fuelled frustrations and insecurities on a blameless female victim. It’s impeccably drawn, styled and performed, yet a nagging feeling sets in that we don’t particularly need to see a reiteration of that narrative in 2017, where the grim reality of powerful men (and male creators, in particular) abusing vulnerable women to advance their own work has been made all too plain in Hollywood and beyond. Phantom Thread may be set in 1950s London, but the gender politics it illustrates are, unhappily, still very much on-trend. But Alma – and Anderson – have a surprise in store for us, as she gradually begins to assert herself in ways that aren’t immediately perceptible, steering their relationship into obliquely sadomasochistic territory; hunger is sated in ways that could as well be pulled from Mrs Beeton’s Fifty Shades of Grey. It’s neither a story of subjugation nor one of empowerment: as the lovers figure out ways to play their weaknesses against each other, all traditional notions of one-way control are out the window. Phantom Thread might not play very well with the “Is [Insert Text] Feminist?” school of cultural analyst, though it does present an unorthodox system of balancing the scales. Anderson’s film would be ideally placed on a double bill with Darren Aronofsky’s recent, aggressively divisive and rather differently mesmerising Mother!, a far more chaotic study of a young woman put through the psychological wringer by the male creative ego. The two films are equally pointed in their characterisation of toxic men who cyclically consume women to feed and appease their internal insecurities – both even offer early glimpses of the outgoing muses about to be replaced. But if Aronofsky’s film is unambiguously pessimistic about the ill-fated outcome of such partnerships, Phantom Thread subtly opens up possibilities for taming the beast. In a fractious political year that has seen many a film, from Get Out to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, take on intensified topicality, Anderson’s guarded, gilded object has somehow been released into its optimum moment: a time when the manifold forms of male-female abuse that enable art are being placed under the microscope, and any solutions are up for discussion.

The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, announced last week that it would recognise pilots’ unions in a bid to head off strikes planned in the run-up to Christmas. The move marked a dramatic shift after decades of refusing to negotiate with unions and came after groups of pilots around Europe called strikes. Ryanair’s announcement that it will also recognise cabin crew unions comes after renewed focus on its treatment of lower-paid staff. Crew have been warned of disciplinary proceedings for missing sales targets on scratchcards, while staff on Italian bases were threatened with collective sanctions if any member joined a strike called last week. The Impact union, whose members include cabin crew, said it would be delighted to start talks in due course. A spokesman said the prospect of strike action in Ireland, originally called for Wednesday, had not gone away and that the mandate remained should Ryanair not properly meet requests for union representation. The airline was due to meet German and Portuguese pilot unions this week, as well as representatives of Ialpa, a branch of the Impact union in Ireland. A company spokesman said: “It will lead on in the new year to meetings with other EU pilot unions, and cabin crew unions in due course as well.” Pilots had complained of a toxic atmosphere at Ryanair, where many had long been indirectly employed through third parties, an arrangement that had seen some pursued by tax authorities. There had also been problems about rostering and anger over disparaging comments made by the airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary. According to a recording of a meeting obtained by the Irish Independent newspaper, Ryanair executives told pilots at Stansted last week that the airline had “grown too fast” and lost their trust, but was working hard to restore it. Peter Bellew, chief operations officer of Ryanair, told the pilots he knew their problems had not been addressed. “Everywhere I turned, I could see that people were asking for small things to be done and they just weren’t getting done,” he was quoted as saying. “Or, not only were they not getting done, they were getting told: ‘Piss off; I don’t want to know about this’.” The airline cancelled 20,000 flights this winter due to a shortage of pilots and a rostering error. O’Leary went as far as producing a power point presentation highlighting perceived financial problems at rival operators to prevent an exodus of pilots, to Norwegian in particular. Ryanair has offered substantial pay increases to retain staff. With a large fleet of planes on order, it plans to grow passenger numbers rapidly in the coming years. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/19/corrections-and-clarifcations","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T20:59:04Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/19/corrections-and-clarifcations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/19/corrections-and-clarifcations","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• We said that the authors of a new study of cervical cancer work at the Centers for Disease Control, Bethesda, Maryland, US.

Known simply as “la Maestra” (the Teacher), Gordillo was notorious for her extensive plastic surgery, her eye-popping wealth and her mastery of bare-knuckle politics. She was accused of embezzling nearly $2m from her union to finance luxury homes in San Diego and shopping sprees in the Neiman Marcus department store, and she was quickly imprisoned. At the time, Gordillo’s vertiginous fall from grace was held up as proof that the incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, was serious about pursuing corruption. It also conveniently cleared the way for education reforms that had been fiercely opposed by her union. Five years later, Gordillo has emerged on the public stage again – and this time she appears poised to assist none other than Peña Nieto, whose Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) trails in the polls for the July 2018 presidential elections. Gordillo, who has denied any wrongdoing, was released from prison last week and transferred to her penthouse in the capital’s posh Polanco district. That same day the PRI forged an electoral alliance with the New Alliance (Panal), a small party previously controlled by Gordillo and the National Education Workers Union (SNTE). The PRI presidential candidate, José Antonio Meade, said Gordillo’s release had “nothing to do with politics”, while the government said it was committed to pushing through the education reforms that would subject teachers to evaluations and crack down on corruption in the school system. But the timing of the release has raised suspicions in a country where politics and justice often push in opposite directions. Gordillo, 72, had been eligible for house arrest for two years, but until recently the attorney general’s office had fought to keep her in prison, even though she has not been convicted of any crimes. For many, the case encapsulates the Peña Nieto administration, which began with heady talk of structural reforms and renewal but has been mired by corruption allegations, economic despondency and spiralling crime. Peña Nieto is ineligible for re-election, and the landmark education reform has yet to be fully implemented. In contrast, the entrenched interests that the PRI had promised to sideline remain surprisingly resilient – and politically useful. “This is how the administration started: the arrest was trumpeted as a great blow against corruption,” tweeted Max Kaiser, director of anti-corruption research at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a thinktank. “This is how the administration ends. It was all a show, nothing but fanfare. There was no heavy hand. To the contrary, impunity was the hallmark of the administration.” Gordillo’s release has again highlighted the political heft of Mexico’s teachers, who often assume the role of authority figures in remote regions and exert a strong influence at election time. “When the polling stations are in public schools, it’s teachers who run them – and there is a premium: a few points in favour of [the party they are supporting],” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. Traditionally, Mexican teachers have supported the PRI, which ruled uninterrupted until 2000 and returned to power in 2012. After the country transitioned from one-party rule in 2000, the union hedged its bets, forming alliances with other parties and creating Panal to protect its interests. It remains unclear how much influence Gordillo retains over the teachers; Panal’s leadership says they have moved on without her. Some observers say Gordillo’s imprisonment was as much about realigning the SNTE with the PRI, which expelled her in the mid-2000s for striking deals with the then president, Vicente Fox, of the National Action party. “It was political promiscuity. The union got into bed with whatever party got into power,” said Ilán Semo, a historian at the Iberoamerican University. “They threw her in prison to make it clear that what she had done was no longer to be tolerated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/cyril-ramaphosa-vows-to-unite-anc-after-rise-to-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T17:13:04Z","webTitle":"Cyril Ramaphosa vows to unite ANC after rise to leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/cyril-ramaphosa-vows-to-unite-anc-after-rise-to-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/19/cyril-ramaphosa-vows-to-unite-anc-after-rise-to-leadership","fields":{"headline":"Cyril Ramaphosa vows to unite ANC after rise to leadership","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cyril Ramaphosa has sought to shore up his shaky mandate as the new president of the African National Congress (ANC), saying the party will emerge “united, renewed and confident” from the fractious conference that elected him leader. “The doomsayers said this conference was going to collapse … and we’ve proven for the millionth time in 105 years of existence that the ANC is able to rise even above its own strengths,” he said on Tuesday. Few doubt the scale of the task Ramaphosa faces. The ANC has been tarnished by repeated corruption scandals and its failure to deliver the improvements in quality of life that many hoped would follow the end of the racist, repressive apartheid regime 23 years ago. Though it still dominates the political landscape, the party’s popularity is fast declining. If, as seems highly probable, Ramaphosa is elected president of South Africa in polls scheduled for next year, he will need to invigorate a flagging economy, reassure investors, placate millions of increasingly impatient young people who care little for the potent history of Africa’s oldest liberation party, root out systemic corruption and unite a nation that remains profoundly segregated. His victory on Monday, by a margin of 179 votes out of 4,708 cast by delegates, was marred by the failure of key allies to win roles on the party’s decision-making body, but supporters believe Ramaphosa has the talent, charisma, and grit to succeed. “He has got what it takes. He knows about business … but he’s also a man of the people. He won’t take from the poor. Many things will change now,” said Ntapelo Nchabeng, 34, a teacher in a poor Soweto neighbourhood less than a mile from where Ramaphosa was born. Ramaphosa, the son of a police sergeant, was educated in Soweto schools. A brilliant student and deeply religious, he became the first in his family to go to university, where he hoped to qualify as a lawyer. “Cyril and his closest friends were committed Christians and their religious beliefs were the basis for their political beliefs,” said Anthony Butler, a professor of politics at Cape Town University and biographer of the new ANC leader. Ramaphosa was swept up in the Black Consciousness movement. Detained in 1974 by apartheid authorities and then in the crackdown that followed the Soweto uprising of 1976, he endured two terms of imprisonment that were “very painful psychologically”, Butler said. In 1982 Ramaphosa founded the National Union of Mineworkers, which went on to play a key role in the struggle against apartheid. This made him one of the most influential leaders in South Africa. With his rare mix of charm, intelligence and commitment, Ramaphosa rose rapidly through the ranks of the ANC and was chosen to head a team that negotiated with apartheid authorities. He was identified as a potential successor by Nelson Mandela, who became president of South Africa after free elections in 1994, but in time Ramaphosa became marginalised. Bitterly disappointed, he left politics, levering his unique combination of mining and political connections to build a business empire. This made him extremely rich but alienated some supporters. “Cyril is a multibillionaire and he got it from the very same people who oppressed us,” said Billy Tsotetsi, 62, a TV commentator. In 2012 Ramaphosa was caught up in the political fallout from the shooting of 34 striking miners by police – the so-called Marikana massacre. As a shareholder of the company at the centre of the dispute, he had called the protesters “criminals” and urged police to take action to end a standoff over pay and conditions. Later that year he was elected deputy president of the ANC, and in 2014 he was appointed deputy president of the country. Ramaphosa only recently distanced himself explicitly from the president, Jacob Zuma. Friends said the decisive moment came when Zuma fired a widely respected finance minister in March after revelations exposing the extent of corrupt patronage networks involving ANC officials. Many now expect Ramaphosa to move swiftly to force Zuma out of office and to fight graft. This may be tougher than anticipated. If Ramaphosa greeted the first results read out on Monday night with a broad grin, others prompted a grimace. Three of the six most powerful positions in the ANC, including that of deputy president, will be filled by controversial figures close to his defeated rival, Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma, and to Zuma himself. Admirers believe Ramaphosa will win this battle too, though not through his charm and diplomacy. “I think we are about to see another side of Cyril Ramaphosa than the quiet, respectful party loyalist we have seen since 2012. I have witnessed the steely, almost ruthless, side of Ramaphosa … Ramaphosa’s election was indeed a critical turning point for South Africa,” wrote Max Du Preez, a South African columnist. If Ramaphosa is worried about the battles to come, he did not show it on Tuesday afternoon. As he walked through the sprawling conference centre south-west of Johannesburg where delegates had gathered, he smiled, laughed and joked with vendors and ANC staff. “Things are going extremely well. It cannot go any better,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/30/katine-guardian-project-rural-uganda","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"'Now Katine is famous': how a Guardian project wrought change in rural Uganda | Liz Ford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/30/katine-guardian-project-rural-uganda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/30/katine-guardian-project-rural-uganda","fields":{"headline":"'Now Katine is famous': how a Guardian project wrought change in rural Uganda","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Joyce Abiro was among the first to join the Katine farmers’ cooperative in 2010. She’s since been able to take out loans to buy seeds and equipment, store what she produces in the community warehouse so that it keeps dry and clean, and sell her crops when the price is right. This has allowed the 52-year old, who lives in Ajobi village, to send her children to school, pay any medical bills, and build a more secure brick house for the family. “I can produce [crops] and have a place to sell them. The cooperative gives me a market for my produce,” says Abiro. “I was able to build that brick house,” she says, pointing to a structure in the centre of her compound, which she shares with her husband, mother-in law, and six of her 10 children. “Before, I was living in a mud hut.” The Katine Joint Farmers Cooperative Society was established to improve the quality and quantity of food produced in this rural sub-county of north-east Uganda. The cooperative also manages the 1,000-ton capacity produce store, a whitewashed brick building, officially opened in 2011, which sits beside the main road that cuts through Katine on its way north to Lira. The cooperative, and the produce store, are arguably the most successful examples of a development project launched 10 years ago with the support of Guardian and Observer readers, and Barclays. In 2007, the Guardian and Observer began raising money through its Christmas appeals for two NGOs – the African Medical and Research Foundation and Farm Africa – to fund a three-year project to improve the lives of the 27,000 people who lived in Katine. At the time, the sub-county had some of the worse health and living conditions in Uganda. Katine had also suffered an attack by Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army a few years earlier, and been plagued by cattle rustlers. The project, which was extended until 2013, led to the creation of village health teams, small microfinance programmes and farmers’ groups. Healthcare workers were trained, schools built and boreholes dug. The catalyst for long-term change, however, has been supporting farmers to produce better crops and, crucially, get them to market and sold at competitive prices. The cooperative now has 876 individual members and 71 groups on its books. In return for an annual fee, members are able to borrow and save money - the cooperative offers lower interest rates than banks - store excess produce and receive training and advice on growing crops. A small shop on the premises allows them to buy equipment without having to travel to Soroti town, about 30km away. Farmers also have the option to sell crops to the cooperative management team, which means they have a ready market and don’t get ripped off by middlemen. Managers sell in bulk when the price is right, creating more profit to plough back into the cooperative. Another fundraising effort by Guardian readers, in 2013, provided a £60,000 deposit fund at a local bank, ensuring the cooperative had additional funds to borrow against to build the business. Through Farm Africa, which has continued to support Katine farmers, the cooperative is now involved in the FoodTrade east and southern Africa programme. Last year, farmers involved in the scheme were among the winners of a contract to export green grams and groundnuts to Kenya. The cooperative has also applied to supply produce to the UN World Food Programme – unthinkable a decade ago. “Katine is now famous in the area,” says Mary Aleto, general manager of the cooperative since 2014. “Now the farmers are happy because services have been brought nearer to them. They are able to bring crops to us, to avoid middlemen, and market their produce. “Farmers’ standard of living is higher, people have taken loans to build houses … [they are] able to improve their produce now, able to increase productivity and get the right fertiliser. People are able to educate their children.” When drought hit the region last year and crops were invaded by armyworm, the cooperative provided a lifeline. “My family never went hungry,” says John Opio Eluru, who manages the cooperative shop. He had grown and stored crops so that, when difficult times came, he had “enough to meet [school] fees and [pay for] medical care and feed everyone at home, so we could manage the drought”. Life in Katine remains challenging and the cooperative’s success is only a small step. Poverty levels are still high. The largest medical facility, Tiriri health centre, remains understaffed and, while the operating theatre now has water, it is still without a regular electricity supply. The fridge at Ojom health centre, already fixed once, has developed another fault and can’t store vaccines. But having money in the community has created a buzz and optimism for the future. Abiro has put some of her profit from selling crops into her cooperative savings. Last year’s drought meant she had to uproot her cassava early to eat, but she says she had the resources to buy and sell other crops to make money. “Before the cooperative it was not fine, not like it is now,” she says. “After the cooperative came in we got knowledge about how to save money in groups. There was no market for our product, compared to now. We could take things up to [market in] Soroti but now the market is here.” And, she adds, if she gets sick she doesn’t need to worry about long queues or drug stockouts at the health centres. “I can afford to go for private treatment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/part-fun-suffer-the-people-hitting-great-outdoors-this-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"‘It's part of the fun to suffer’: hitting the great outdoors this Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/part-fun-suffer-the-people-hitting-great-outdoors-this-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/part-fun-suffer-the-people-hitting-great-outdoors-this-christmas","fields":{"headline":"‘It's part of the fun to suffer’: the people hitting the great outdoors this Christmas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The swimmers Normally, there’s only one way to get into 4C water: in a hurry. From Southampton to Sydney via St Petersburg, an in-and-out New Year’s Day dunk is a long-established custom; the image of hordes of swimmers charging en masse to meet the wintry waves a familiar one. But go down to the picturesque banks of the river Stour at Dedham in the early morning of 1 January 2018, and you will find an altogether more sedate, low-key gathering, as a small but committed group of swimmers pull on their wetsuits ahead of their annual New Year’s Day swim. “We get together our thickest wetties and hoods and gloves and boots,” says Stuart Hamilton, 53. “Every year when we first get in, everybody complains about the cold, but that’s part of the fun, to suffer a bit. And to overcome the suffering.” This will be the fifth year running that Hamilton, his wife Cathie, daughters Tiffany and Candy, son-in-law Danny and friend Kevin, brave the ice-cold currents of the Stour as they attempt to swim the 2.3km from Dedham Mill to Flatford Mill. The route, meandering along the Essex-Suffolk border, is one they know well: in the summer, Hamilton organises an annual Mill 2 Mill event on this same stretch of water, drawing up to 350 participants, all eager to enjoy a leisurely dip followed by a riverside picnic. The New Year’s Day swim, by contrast, though advertised to all comers on the Outdoor Swimming Society’s website, seldom draws more than a half-dozen hardy regulars. “Very rarely does anybody make the full distance, because it’s so cold,” says Hamilton, a barrel-chested gym owner from Colchester. “At the halfway point there’s a footbridge that crosses the water – that’s always a good target. If we can make it as far as there, we’re doing well.” Meanwhile, awaiting them on dry land are Thermos flasks full of warm, milky hot chocolate. “The water can be anything from 12C down to 2C. That is very cold. A normal swimming pool temperature is in the mid-20s. So I make sure I fill up those flasks.” While Hamilton and his family comprise the core of the group, it was his friend Kevin Sheath, a keen amateur triathlete and wild swimmer, who initiated the tradition. “Being out on the river is absolutely gorgeous,” says Sheath, 56, who swims in the river year-round. “This is Constable country. Our finish point, at Flatford Mill, is where his Hay Wain was. If you go in the summer, it’s like Clacton beach; there’s rowing boats, standup paddleboarders, kayakers, fishermen – the whole world and his uncle. But in the winter, you can have the river to yourself.” It’s this peace and tranquillity that keeps the swimmers coming back year after year, says Hamilton’s daughter, Tiffany Wood. “Christmas can be a bit indoorsy,” she says. “You can overcook yourself on it all, get cabin fever. As a family, none of us likes to go out partying or drinking; we socialise by going for a bike ride, or a swim. It’s great to get out into a real wild space where you can’t see any buildings or roads, where there are no Christmas lights or music. It wakes you up, makes you feel alive.” Find your nearest swim spot at outdoorswimmingsociety.com. Christmas swim caps in main picture are from Speedo. The fell runners If hauling yourself out of bed on the morning of 26 December feels like an uphill battle, spare a thought for Geoff Sproson. For the past 39 Boxing Days, bar none, he and brother John have organised the Devil’s Chair Dawdle or Dash, a steep three-mile round trip up and down the muddy tracks and rocky moorland of Shropshire’s Stiperstones national nature reserve. “Our first event in 1978 was purely a local affair,” says Sproson, 70, who took up the sport on his doctor’s advice, to help him recover from a footballing injury. “We had about 60 participants – mostly lads from the football club. We thought it would be a one-off.” They were wrong. Last year, the Dawdle or Dash drew 460 participants, with another 150 spectators lining the course and cheering on the walkers and runners. Numbers aside, not much has changed over the years. The start-finish line is today, as it has always been, at the Stiperstones Inn – the pub that has been in the Sproson family for half a century; Geoff’s daughter is the current landlady. At the halfway point, some 600ft above, sits the Devil’s Chair, the craggy quartzite outcrop that rises from the heather-strewn hills of the Stiperstones Range. It’s a tough course, and has seen its fair share of casualties. “You have to go up a very steep field, and then on top you pick your way through large stones and boulders for a good half-mile,” Sproson says. The event goes ahead, whatever the weather. “We have raced in sunshine and rain, over frozen ground, deep mud, thick snow, but never cancelled. Several people come back with grazes and cuts. And there was one year early on, when an aunt of mine broke her ankle and had to be carried off the top.” The rewards for braving the uneven terrain are much the same as they have ever been. “A gallant group of local ladies still provide sandwiches and soup to every runner and walker,” Sproson says. “And an intrepid band of supporters from the Shropshire Mining Club still encourage weary souls with a drop of the hard stuff at the summit. They’re getting on a bit, but they still take a couple of cases of whisky up.” There’s a core contingent of regulars who take part. “There are people who started doing the event as young boys or girls who are not only still doing it, but whose children are doing it, too,” Sproson says. One regular is Stiperstones-born Viv Jones, 73, who used to play football with Sproson, and now lives 25 minutes up the road, on the outskirts of Shrewsbury. “In 39 years, the only one I missed was last year,” Jones says. “I had a bit of a problem with my knee. I’ve got to have a new one some time, but at the moment it isn’t bothering me, so I’ll do it again this year, under the hour if I possibly can. I had two minutes to spare last time.” Jones is spurred on, in part, by fraternal rivalry. “My brother Neil hasn’t missed a year. He’s 63, so 10 years younger than me, and he always gets over the line first.” For local races, events and advice, go to fellrunner.org.uk The parkour crew This Christmas, up to 100 parkour enthusiasts will celebrate the festive season by running, vaulting, clambering and crawling their way around a purpose-built gym in Milton Keynes. “We wanted to celebrate not just parkour, but movement itself,” says Ruel DaCosta, 32, co-founder of Paramount Parkour Academy and host of the Christmas Jam, now a regular fixture in the calendars of parkour practitioners, or traceurs, nationwide. “We invited dancers, gymnasts, kickboxers, people from all walks of life who had one thing in common: making art with their bodies.” Thirty people showed up to their first Christmas Jam in 2013; this year they’re expecting more than three times that number. “Parkour is like dance, but over obstacles,” DaCosta says. “It’s an expression of movement, but over urban landscapes, turning a town into a playground.” He opened his gym, the UK’s first dedicated parkour training facility, to create an environment for traceurs of all levels to hone their skills in a safe environment. On jam night, the doors stay open to all comers until 3am, with high-energy music blaring out through a specially set-up sound system. While the gathered crowd play around on the gym’s elaborate scaffold rigs, ramps and foam pits, the DJs (DaCosta’s brother and nephew) will play a soundtrack of dancehall, drum’n’bass, bashment and reggae – though there won’t be any overtly Christmassy music. “There are people of different religions who come along, so we don’t force Christmas on them,” DaCosta says. “But the Christmas spirit is there, in the sense of meeting up with friends who you don’t see often.” The showstopper moment is always the “back-tuck circle”, DaCosta says. “It’s what Paramount’s jams are known for. Anyone who can do backflips joins in and we all do them in a Mexican wave style. At the last one, we must have had 70 people doing back tucks in two concentric circles.” It’s a highlight for Charlie Higgs, 23, an ambulance dispatcher who travels 25 miles from her home in Bicester to attend the jam. “When I go to training I’m like, ‘Right, I’ve got to get my back tuck so I can join in the circle at the next jam’,” Higgs says. As a keen gymnast and cheerleader, picking up new skills is part of the appeal. “The atmosphere is so friendly. I’ve had issues with my confidence in the past, but they’re all so good at pumping you up. Even the tiniest skill that you get, everyone is so proud of you.” Find a parkour community near you at parkour.uk. Thanks to River Island for the T-rex Christmas jumper. The paddleboarders Like Santa Claus himself, the all-red, felt-and-flannel get-up worn by this group of standup paddleboard (Sup) enthusiasts comes out just once a year. On the other 364 days, the floating Clauses are better known as Easyriders, a Sup club based on the Sandbanks side of Poole Harbour. They’ve been donning their festive finery every year since 2013, when a roving, paddleboarding Santa called Jay Manning first introduced them to the idea of the Santa Sup, a tradition now honoured by paddleboarding communities across the UK. “It’s usually the last Sunday before Christmas, and I look forward to it every year,” says full-time music teacher and part-time Santa Elaine Williams. “I remember the first time I saw it, it was such an amazing sight. You just wouldn’t expect a whole load of Santas to be paddleboarding off the Dorset coast.” Meeting at the club’s trailer in the harbour, the Santas paddle out to sea for up to two hours, weather dependent. With no set plan or destination, they might pootle along parallel to the shore, or venture out into the deep waters of the shipping channels. But either way, they have the harbour largely to themselves. “You don’t get other people out on the water; a lot of the yachts are taken in for the winter,” Williams says. “From the position you’re in, standing up on the board, you see so much more than you would from a kayak, or from walking along the shore. These views, and the peacefulness that you experience when paddleboarding, are the main attractions for me. With the right conditions, there’s no other sport like it.” While the Sups are fairly stable, and most of the Santas are experienced paddleboarders, with sea temperatures hovering around 10C, they all wear thick winter wetsuits under their fancy dress, in case of an untimely tumble. “The atmosphere is quite playful,” says Jeff Pangbourne, 67, who has been paddleboarding for eight years, and taken part in the Santa Sup for the past three. “I haven’t fallen in, but you can get pushed. A couple of years ago some people decided to push each other off, and then everyone else joined in. It got quite wet. But regardless, it always makes for a bit of a spectacle. We tend to do it quite close to the shore at Sandbanks, so if people are having a leisurely walk, they can see us all on the water. People will stop and get out of their cars to take photos. We wave at them and shout ‘Happy Christmas!’ There’s a lovely atmosphere.” Find local courses, clubs and events at bsupa.org.uk The ramblers On Boxing Day 1963, Jean Todd and her husband Don wrapped up in their winter coats and headed out for a long walk around Virginia Water Lake in Windsor Great Park. “We had a son of two and decided to walk around the lake with him in the pushchair,” Jean says. “My son’s 56 now. Since then, we’ve increased the size of the family, but we haven’t changed our Boxing Day walk.” They often shared their traditional circumnavigation of Virginia Water with an assortment of friends and visiting relatives. So when the call came out from a member of the East Berkshire Ramblers – a walking group which Jean and Don had recently joined – to organise a Boxing Day walk, the Todds offered up their ready-made route. “It was about 12 years ago. Our kids had more or less given up on the walks. They’ve grown up and married and they do their own thing now, though we do still spend Christmas together,” Jean says. “I said, ‘Look, we’re doing this family walk every Boxing Day, let’s turn it into a Ramblers walk.’” Since then, Jean and Don have been joined by around 30 people each year. This year will be the sixth that Frank Bush and his wife Mavis have accompanied the Todds on their four-and-a-half-mile ramble. “It’s the perfect way to blow the cobwebs away. And we get a chance to talk about what we’ve done over the last few days – not so much about presents at our age,” laughs Bush, 75, a retired police officer who is in awe of some of his fellow walkers’ energy and enthusiasm. “Some of the 80-year-pluses go up hills like they’re mountain goats. They’re amazingly fit.” Part of what makes the Boxing Day walk so accessible for all ages and abilities, however, is that the route is fairly flat, and provides ample opportunity to stop and take in the scenery. “It really is a lovely park,” Jean says. “When you think of a park, you think of flowerbeds and short grass, but the Great Park is just open land, a lot of it wild. It has everything: ponds, streams, woods. Near the end, we come to a waterfall. It’s very fast-flowing and beautiful.” “There’s a lovely atmosphere,” Jean says. “All the children have their new bikes and scooters. You bump into people and say hello, and then most of us go to the local pub. We thoroughly enjoy it. I’m just hoping the time doesn’t come when I can’t do it. We’ll keep going for a few more years yet.” • Find somewhere to walk this winter at ramblers.org.uk. Commenting on this piece?

Often, a stranger will approach her on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, and ask her if she is Heather Heyer’s mother. Then they ask for a hug. She’s fine with that, but she won’t accept charity. For a while, she and her husband couldn’t go to a restaurant without a well-wisher offering to pick up the bill. “Why am I getting a present because my daughter died?” she asks from the office of the fledgling Heather Heyer Foundation. “That doesn’t make sense to me. I’m uncomfortable with people trying to hero-worship Heather or me. We’re just normal people who happen to run our mouths. It’s just that other people are listening now – that’s the difference.” On 12 August, Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal with a passion for social justice, joined a protest against the far-right rally Unite the Right when a man called James Fields ploughed his car into the crowd she was in. Bro received a call from one of Heyer’s friends saying that her daughter had been hit. By the time Bro reached the hospital, Heyer was dead. Four days later, Bro’s eloquent speech at the memorial service went round the world: “They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her.” Bro knew there would be media attention, but had “no idea how crazy it was going to get”. Until then Bro, a 61-year-old retired teacher, considered herself “a half-hippy, half-secretary, farmer-girl wannabe”. Now she spends her time running the foundation, which funds scholarships for trainee paralegals and social workers, giving interviews and speaking at high schools about social justice. She thinks it’s what Heyer would have wanted, but it is also what Bro needs. “This is how I cope with my grief, by making something out of it. What am I supposed to do? Just sit at home and cry? I have things to do and they’re going to make a difference.” There are limits, though. One company asked to use Heyer’s name on a brochure “to stick it to the Trump supporters”. “That’s not our philosophy,” Bro says. “We’re seeing how to make things better, not how to start another fight.” After the president failed to condemn the neo-Nazis, saying that there were “very fine people on both sides”, Bro refused to take calls from the White House, but she won’t attack Trump. “My focus is not on changing the administration as much as changing people’s hearts,” she says. “I have to be careful because people want me to say bad things about the president. My son is in the army reserve and I don’t want a target on his back. I gave up one kid. I don’t want to give up two.” Bro likes to grieve in private and be strong in public. She doesn’t want to be pitied or protected. Hate mail from those in the far right doesn’t shake her. “If they send me an email, I want to read it. I don’t look away from the nasties.” She has had to take some precautions, though, like interring Heyer’s ashes in a secret location so that the grave doesn’t become a target for vandalism. She has also resisted offers of an official memorial, agreeing only to have part of the street where Heyer died renamed Heather Heyer Way. “And they’ll probably try to deface that,” she says sharply. Last week, Bro attended James Fields’ initial court hearing and plans to watch the trial. “I have to know,” she says. “That’s part of my closure. I make myself do the tough things. When we went into court, some of Heather’s friends were anxious about having to walk past the Nazi supporters and I said: ‘Put on your game face. A cold, blank stare is the best way to deal with a bully.’” Seeing Fields convicted, however, is not enough. “He didn’t show up and run his car into a crowd because he was bored,” Bro says. “He showed up for a cause.” She compares racism in the US to the wound she received from cancer surgery seven years ago. “To get that to heal, you have to keep it open and cleaned out because the infection will fester if you don’t. And I think that’s what has happened in our country. We didn’t take into account how deeply the infection ran. Now we have to keep the wound open enough to heal it.” Bro hates it when people say Heyer was in the wrong place at the wrong time. “That’s not true. She was in the right place at the right time and he made a bad choice and killed her.” She recently added childhood snapshots of Heyer to the foundation’s website, to remind people that her daughter was a person, not a symbol. “We miss her laugh a lot,” she says, her voice trembling. “She could keep you in stitches, but she had some very powerful lessons to teach as well. Who Heather was to us is not entirely the same as the public sees her now. If you make her into this saintly figure, then it becomes something unattainable by ordinary people. And I have said from the beginning that now is the time for action for everybody. Normal people have to stand up and be counted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/25/trump-putin-and-xi-a-year-of-tough-guy-leaders-and-foolish-brinkmanship","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T21:00:30Z","webTitle":"Trump, Putin and Xi: a year of tough-guy leaders and foolish brinkmanship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/trump-putin-and-xi-a-year-of-tough-guy-leaders-and-foolish-brinkmanship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/25/trump-putin-and-xi-a-year-of-tough-guy-leaders-and-foolish-brinkmanship","fields":{"headline":"Trump, Putin and Xi: a year of tough-guy leaders and foolish brinkmanship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was the year of the hard man – the tough-guy leader with a ruthless streak and a big ego. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin, a role model for the genre, strengthened his harsh grip on domestic politics while intensifying Russia’s cyber-digital “war of influence” with the west. In Beijing, China’s president, Xi Jinping, attained a kind of immortality when his unoriginal thoughts were enshrined in the Communist party constitution. In Washington, Donald Trump enacted a charlatan parody of the US presidency, blending power and ignorance to an alarming degree. The heavy mob attracted a cohort of emulators and imitators – “little big men” such as Kim Jong-un, the inexperienced, nuclear-armed North Korean dictator and Rodrigo Duterte, the homicidal president of the Philippines. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s choleric president, worked assiduously to dismantle his country’s secular democratic tradition, using a failed 2016 coup as a pretext. Saudi Arabia’s uncrowned leader and ostensible reformer, the youthful Prince Mohammad bin Salman, made a series of clumsy regional power plays. The corollary to the rise of the hard man was a sense of debilitating weakness among western democracies and of a crumbling postwar international strategic and legal order. The rising power of one-party China, spreading authoritarianism in general, and divisive, populist and nationalistic regressions within Europe highlighted the dilemma. The west’s difficulties were compounded by uncertainty over how to handle Trump and navigate a disorientating new era of weakening American global leadership. Nuclear threat North Korea emerged as 2017’s most dangerous international security problem. Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles in defiance of the UN and its neighbours is not a new phenomenon. What changed in 2017 was the juxtaposition, in opposing corners, of two volatile, foolish and inexperienced leaders: Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. Aware of Trump’s campaign threats to topple his regime, Kim – in power since the death of his father in 2011 – appeared determined to test the new American president’s mettle. A series of missile test launches, some close to Japan, was followed in September by a first underground test of a powerful hydrogen bomb. Since then North Korea has threatened another nuclear detonation – this time in the atmosphere over the Pacific, possibly near the US territory of Guam. Pyongyang now says it can strike any part of the US – something Washington had vowed to prevent. Trump’s response was contradictory from the start. He held out the prospect of talks with Pyongyang, and even a personal meeting with Kim, and criticised Japan and South Korea for not doing enough to defend themselves. At other times, he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He derided Kim as “little rocket man” and a “sick puppy” and scolded his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, for wasting time by pursuing diplomatic solutions. Not to be outdone, North Korea dubbed Trump an “ageing lunatic” and “senile dotard”. During an Asian tour in 2017, Trump pledged solidarity with South Korea and Japan, where Shinzō Abe, the hawkish prime minister, won reelection in October partly because of worries about North Korea. But the thrust of Trump’s approach – inducing China, North Korea’s only influential ally, to pressure Kim to disarm – brought mixed results. Beijing backed tougher UN sanctions but declined to cut vital oil supplies to Pyongyang. Xi remained reluctant to tackle Kim directly, fearing the instability the regime’s collapse would cause – and because China has no wish to see a reunified Korea allied to the US. The Korean crisis has the potential to reignite at any moment, as yet another provocative, long-range missile test in late November demonstrated. Trump ordered a buildup of naval and air power around the peninsula, and nuclear-capable US bombers “buzzed” North Korean defences. Such brinkmanship is extraordinarily dangerous, since it may convince Kim he is about to be attacked. South Korea’s training of special forces whose only purpose is to “decapitate” the Pyongyang regime will likely increase his paranoia. A momentary miscalculation by either side could bring calamity. Trump’s relationship with Xi, whom he invited to a get-to-know-you summit at his Florida estate in April and met again in Beijing in November, proved a one-sided affair. The US leader condemned China during his election campaign, terming it an “enemy” because of its supposedly unfair trade practices. But in Beijing, he praised Xi for outsmarting previous US administrations on trade. He seemed unduly impressed by Xi’s unchallenged domestic ascendancy, confirmed at a Communist party congress in October. Speaking at the congress, Xi hailed a “new era” of Chinese prosperity and global power. China, he said, would transform itself into a “mighty force” in the world. “It will be an era that sees China moving closer to centre stage and making greater contributions to mankind,” Xi said. The potentially negative implications of these “contributions” for postwar American strategic dominance of the Asia-Pacific region, and western influence and interests in Africa and Latin America, were painfully obvious. But apparently not to Trump. Prioritising a deal on North Korea, he gave Xi a free pass on trade and failed to challenge him, for example, on China’s illegal military expansionism in the South China Sea, its threats to Taiwan, its subjugation of Tibet, its yawning democratic deficit, or its dreadful human rights record. By withdrawing from the TransPacific Partnership, Trump gave the Chinese another opportunity to extend their reach. No wonder they like him in China. Yet Xi still denied him a breakthrough on North Korea. Xi was not the only leader to benefit from Trump’s naivety, fondness for authoritarianism, and easily exploited egotism. Putin appeared to convince Trump that Russia was a trustworthy partner in solving problems such as Syria – despite Moscow’s support for Bashar al-Assad’s proscribed regime in Damascus and its alleged involvement in chemical weapons attacks and other war crimes. Putin pushed for a lifting of sanctions imposed after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and still unresolved military intervention in Ukraine. To Europe’s dismay, Trump was sympathetic. He was persuaded not to go ahead – for now. Most astonishingly of all, perhaps, Trump contradicted the findings of his own intelligence agencies and accepted Putin’s assurances that Russia did not interfere in last year’s US presidential election to disadvantage his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Despite an accelerating special counsel federal investigation, numerous Congressional inquiries, and guilty pleas by former advisers, Trump continued to deny any Russian connection, denouncing claims as “fake news”. Trump’s business dealings with well-connected Russians, dating back to the 1990s, also came under scrutiny. This month, the reported agreement of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn to cooperate with prosecutors extended the scandal into the heart of the White House. If firm evidence is found of a conspiracy, coverup or obstruction of justice, Trump’s impeachment could follow. In terms of negative headlines, Trump’s first 11 months in office may have set some kind of record. His travel ban targeting citizens of Muslim countries was repeatedly struck down in the courts, though earlier this month the supreme court ruled it could be imposed while multiple challenges are resolved. His refusal to condemn violence by far-right nationalists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, brought protests, with critics labelling him a racist and a closet bigot. US national divisions were fuelled, in turn, by Trump’s splenetic denunciation of American football players who knelt before games to highlight disproportionate violence against black people. Issuing daily blasts via Twitter, Trump rarely missed an opportunity to start a row, raising America’s “culture wars” to a new level. This month he used Twitter to gratuitously insult a close ally, Theresa May. Yet despite the advantage of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump’s legislative agenda, notably healthcare, went nowhere – with the exception of a bill cutting taxes for corporations and the very rich. Having failed to build political coalitions, he relied on executive orders of dubious validity. The Trump White House saw high level resignations and sackings. Trump finished 2017 as possibly the most unpopular, least respected president ever. He also set another record: more time spent playing golf than any predecessor. European elections Europe survived a year of unusual political turmoil, but its problems are far from resolved. The year’s opening saw a rising populist tide generated by fears about immigration, economic pain, Euroscepticism, loss of identity and plain old xenophobia. But despite predictions to the contrary, the centre held – just – in national elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Commenting on the voters’ rejection of the far-right Islamophobe Geert Wilders, the Dutch prime minister declared: “The Netherlands said whoa!” Emmanuel Macron’s triumphal election as France’s president was nevertheless qualified by significant advances made by Marine Le Pen, the Front National leader, who came second with 34% support. If Macron fails to achieve the reforms he promised – and the year ended with his approval ratings slumping – then Le Pen could be well placed to supplant him next time. Likewise in Germany, Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats re-emerged as the biggest party in September. But they lost support to the far-right Alternative for Germany, while the centre-left Social Democrats were crushed. Merkel was still struggling to form a new coalition government at year’s end. Germany’s unprecedented postwar political turmoil added to the jitters affecting the EU. The UK obsessed over negotiating the terms of Brexit, for which it formally applied in March, setting a leaving date in 2019. Compounding the uncertainty, May’s Conservative government lost its parliamentary majority in an ill-conceived snap election in June. In Italy, a rightwing alliance overseen by Silvio Berlusconi, the disgraced former prime minister, looked poised for a comeback in 2018. In Spain, a declaration of independence by Catalonia’s separatist leadership was rejected by the unionist government of Mariano Rajoy. In eastern Europe, Euroscepticism was on the rise. Governments in Poland and Hungary battled the European commission over civil rights and media curbs. The Baltic states worried about security, and Nato deployed troops to border areas. For Europe as a whole, the intentions of Putin’s Russia appeared increasingly malign. Moscow was accused of using cyberattacks, misinformation, social media manipulation and other “active measures” to undermine and destabilise all the western democracies, not only the United States. In Britain, Theresa May claimed in a tough speech in November that Putin was “weaponising information”. “Russia, we know what you are doing,” she said. By year’s end there was pressure in Britain to investigate claims that Russian money, trolls and internet bots had influenced the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. In Russia itself, the regime intensified intimidation of independent opposition politicians and media in advance of Putin’s expected re-election bid in March 2018. Beset by internal turmoil, Europe paid less attention, and exercised reduced leverage, in crises along its periphery. Relations with Turkey deteriorated amid rows with Erdoğan over human rights. The flow of refugees and economic migrants from Syria and north Africa slowed, due in part to controversial EU-backed measures to contain migrants in camps in Libya. But there were predictions 2018 could bring another big surge. Europe was sidelined as Russia and Iran, bypassing the UN, joined forces to enforce a prospective settlement in Syria keeping Assad in power. Iran’s leading role in the war, expanding influence in Iraq and Lebanon, and support for Houthi rebels in Yemen produced little in the way of an effective response from the west. Trump further stirred the pot, and outraged the Palestinians, by recognising disputed and divided Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and announcing plans to relocate the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. He also made a typically bellicose speech at the UN, threatening to tear up the multinational 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. It was left to Saudi Arabia, led by Prince Salman, to take concrete steps to challenge Iran’s regional ambitions. But the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, notably a blockade of its ports, succeeded only in exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. A convoluted attempt in Lebanon to push back Hezbollah, Iran’s ally, backfired. And Saudi economic and diplomatic sanctions designed to force Qatar to renounce its ties with Iran had the opposite effect. Amid all this upheaval, an ill-timed bid by Iraq’s Kurds to create an independent state flopped badly. If anything in the Middle East is predictable, it is growing confrontation in 2018 between Iran and Trump, backed by Israel. Terror attacks Many pre-existing conflicts and problems persisted or worsened in 2017. Syria’s civil war dragged on remorselessly. Trump launched a one-off missile attack on a suspected chemical weapons store in April, but otherwise ignored the conflict. In Afghanistan, the impact of the insurgency measurably worsened. After 16 years of war, civilian casualties hit record highs, according to UN figures. There was a 43% increase in death and injuries attributable to US and Afghan airstrikes. The Taliban were blamed for two-thirds of the overall total. The Afghan figures reflected a wider trend. Under Trump, the American military has greatly increased its use of armed drones, particularly in Somalia, where they targeted the terror group al-Shabaab. The new tactics did not halt terror attacks. In Mogadishu, hundreds died in a particularly devastating truck bombing in October. In Egypt’s northern Sinai, more than 300 Sufi Muslim worshippers were killed by a group linked to Islamic State. Terrorists also struck countries involved in the international campaign against Isis. Horror came to London, Manchester, Barcelona, Paris, Ankara, Tehran and New York. As Isis was slowly dislodged from its strongholds in Raqqa and Mosul, concern increased that its adherents were regrouping in north Africa or returning to countries of origin in Europe and Asia. The year saw its share of humanitarian disasters, manmade or otherwise. War, famine and disease further devastated South Sudan, while Yemen suffered a similar, wholly avoidable fate. In Myanmar, an army-led campaign of ethnic cleansing displaced huge numbers of Rohingya Muslims, who fled to Bangladesh. The resulting suffering brought fierce criticism of Myanmar’s civilian leader, the Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi, by those with scant understanding of her limited powers in a country still dominated by generals. Destructive hurricanes linked to climate change ravaged the Caribbean and southern US, while heatwaves and wildfires hit Australia and California. An earthquake struck Mexico in September, killing 369 people. To the dismay of campaigners, a study showed that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere increased at record speeds. Meanwhile, Trump backed out of the 2016 Paris climate change agreement. Even so, many American states and cities vowed to adhere to the Paris targets, while the rest of the world unanimously decided to ignore the White House. In Europe, electric cars gained wider acceptance, battery storage technology advanced, and car manufacturers announced plans to phase out polluting petrol and diesel models. There were many other glimmers of hope and progress. In July, 122 countries voted at the UN to support a new treaty outlawing nuclear weapons – a symbolic yet powerful statement. In November, the international court in The Hague sentenced the former Serb general Ratko Mladić to life in prison for genocide during the Bosnian war – although, overall, it was a discouraging year for the rule of international law. Brazil and Colombia, recovering from enervating corruption scandals and a guerrilla insurgency respectively, planned restorative elections in 2018. The prospects for economically stricken Venezuela were less encouraging. A decision by the embattled socialist president, Nicolás Maduro, to install a political ally as head of the state oil company, PDVSA, encouraged speculation the country’s vital oil exports may fall, driving up world market prices in 2018. South Africa saw growing anger at the kleptocracy and corruption associated with the ANC presidency of Jacob Zuma. And in Zimbabwe, the ageing despot Robert Mugabe was peacefully removed from power, sending a chill down the spines of stubborn autocrats in Uganda and elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/26/match-the-international-incident-to-donald-trumps-round-of-golf-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T14:41:37Z","webTitle":"Match the international incident to Donald Trump's round of golf – quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/26/match-the-international-incident-to-donald-trumps-round-of-golf-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/26/match-the-international-incident-to-donald-trumps-round-of-golf-quiz","fields":{"headline":"Match the international incident to Donald Trump's round of golf – quiz","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This year, Donald Trump was president of the United States of America.

The letter is dated 31 October 1584 – less than three years before Mary was executed at the age of 44 on 8 February 1587. Mary had fled Scotland for England in 1568, after an uprising against her. She had sought help from her cousin, Elizabeth, but the queen felt Mary was a threat and imprisoned her for years, latterly with Sir Ralph Sadler, who kept her in custody at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire between 1584 and 1585. Elizabeth’s 1584 letter, which shows her hardening attitude, is one of 43 letters to Sadler that have been given to the American Trust for the British Library by the industrialist and philanthropist Mark Pigott. Four of the letters are signed personally by Elizabeth, with the others from her chief minister, Lord Burghley, and her secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham. The 1584 letter was intended to be shown or read by Sadler to Mary, because, Elizabeth wrote, of “a vowe heretofore made not to writte unto her with our own hand untill we might receave better satisfaction by effect from hir to our contentment then heretofore we have don”. Criticising Mary’s “sundry hard and daungerous coorses heald towardes us”, Elizabeth tells Sadler that “you may lett hir understand that we wish she had been as carefull for the tyme past to have avoyded the cause and ground by hir given of the just jealousy by us conceaved, as she now sheweth to mislyke of the effectes that the same hath (by due desert) bread towardes hir”. Mary “knoweth”, writes Elizabeth, “howe great contentment and lyking we had for a tyme of hir frendshippe, which as we then esteamed as a singular and extraordinary blessing of god to have one so neerely tyed unto us in blood and neighborhood, so greatly affected towardes us as we then conceaved. “So are we nowe as much greeved to behold the alteration and interuptuion thereof, taking no pleasure to looke back on the causes that have bread so unpleasant affectes which we wish that ether they had never been, or at the least we could never remember, and that She were as innocent therein as she laboreth greatly to beare both us and the world in hand that she is.” Pigott had loaned the collection to the British Library since he acquired it in 2010 for almost £300,000. The library now plans to digitise the manuscripts, which Pigott said “offer a unique window on that world both for researchers today and for future generations”. The letters show the tightening security under which Mary was kept – all mothers with young children were to be removed from her household, for example, while Sadler is told that his charge is “not permitted to ride farre abroad but onely suffered on foot or in a Coche to take the ayre and use some such exercise neere the howse where she shall lye”. Elizabeth warns him to “use but olde trust and new diligence” as he takes over her charge, while on 22 March 1585, Sir Francis Walsingham tells Sadler that “this doubtfull and dangerous state of thinges geveth her Majesty iust cause to cary the more watchefull eye over that Queene &amp; her doinges”. Further letters to Sadler give an insight into Mary’s life at Tutbury – her requests for table silver, for example, or how Sadler is reprimanded for allowing Mary to accompany him when he goes hunting. In a letter sent on 19 March 1585, Walsingham reports that Elizabeth is displeased “that the Queen of Scotts hathe more liberty nowe than at any tyme when she was in the Earl of Shrewsbury’s chardge”. Sadler is also instructed “once or twise a moneth to have a privie serche sondelie in all places within som Compas of the Castell, so as all strangers to be found in that serche maie be forthecomming”. Curator Andrea Clarke said: “On the continent, there was a lot of upheaval. There was a sense of fear, and one of the reasons Mary was moved from Derbyshire to this secure location was to move her further from the sea ports – to make her more unreachable. These letters tell of an incredible part of our history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/19/tower-hamlets-postal-voters-monitored-pilot-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T16:01:43Z","webTitle":"Tower Hamlets postal voters to be monitored under pilot scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/19/tower-hamlets-postal-voters-monitored-pilot-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/19/tower-hamlets-postal-voters-monitored-pilot-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Tower Hamlets postal voters to be monitored under pilot scheme","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Postal voters in the scandal-hit London borough of Tower Hamlets are to be closely monitored as part of new pilot schemes designed to stamp out electoral fraud, a government minister has said. Chris Skidmore, the minister for the constitution, said a package of measures would be introduced across several local authorities in May as the government experimented with new systems to ensure only those entitled to vote did so. They include Tower Hamlets, as well as Watford in Hertfordshire, where voters will be asked to present poll cards marked with barcodes. Ministers would later decide which of the measures to introduce nationwide, Skidmore said. Postal voters will also be selected at random in Tower Hamlets and other selected councils and will be asked if they received applications. There will be restrictions on how many postal vote packs campaigners are allowed to handle. The move follows complaints the postal vote system has been used to farm votes in the past, particularly among minority ethnic communities. Tower Hamlets was placed into special measures in 2015 after the former mayor Lutfur Rahman was found guilty of electoral fraud. Skidmore detailed the plans before the launch on Tuesday of the National Democracy Week Council, made up of organisations from across the civil society sector. The new details will cause some anger among Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs. Both parties have expressed concerns that such initiatives could lead to greater disenfranchisement among poor and minority ethnic communities. Skidmore told the Guardian: “A new initiative to stamp out postal vote fraud will be trialled across Britain this spring including postal vote pilots. “Postal voters will be tracked, they will be selected at random and contacted to make sure they received their postal votes. We will also be looking at how we put a cap on the number of completed postal vote packs that campaigners can handle.” This month, Sir John Holmes, the chair of the Electoral Commission, said requiring photographic ID was vital if the government was to stamp out postal vote fraud. Reports of alleged electoral fraud through impersonation more than doubled between 2014 and 2016, according to the Electoral Commission, but other campaigners voiced concerns that the scheme would be a barrier to voting. Skidmore said the government did want some form of ID to be introduced but had not yet decided if it should be photographic. “We will also be looking at the legislative means of introducing that and trialling forms of ID for voters. Some will be photographic and some non-photographic,” he said. “Watford will be taking forward a poll card that has a barcode down the bottom which you can scan through.” Voters in Woking, Gosport, Bromley and Slough are also expected to take part in different schemes. “We want to use evidence-based policy process here to make sure which are the best forms of photo ID to use. The aim is to stop disenfranchisement. If people feel electoral fraud is an issue, it erodes confidence in people wanting to participate in our democracy,” Skidmore said. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake has previously called requirements for photo ID “a completely unnecessary move that risks undermining our democracy by preventing millions of people from voting”. Brake said there was widespread evidence it led to even lower turnouts from young voters and minority groups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/brexit-vote-exposure-trade-effects-report-uk-regions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Parts of UK that voted Brexit are most exposed to its effects, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/brexit-vote-exposure-trade-effects-report-uk-regions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/brexit-vote-exposure-trade-effects-report-uk-regions","fields":{"headline":"Parts of UK that voted Brexit are most exposed to its effects, report says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK regions that voted to leave the EU are more economically exposed to the effects of Brexit than anywhere else in Europe, research suggests. A University of Birmingham study examined the degree to which EU regions were exposed to the possible negative trade-related consequences of Britain’s departure and found areas in the Midlands and north of England, many of which voted for Brexit, had the greatest exposure. This appeared to contradict claims during the EU referendum campaign in 2016 that London benefited the most from membership. Researchers from the university’s City Region Economic and Development Institute looked at regional variations in the share of labour income and GDP reliant on the EU. The UK was found to be 4.6 times more exposed than the rest of the EU, with the majority of member states facing almost no exposure. An estimated 2.64% of EU GDP was at risk because of Brexit trade-related consequences, the report found, whereas 12% of UK GDP was at risk. The report’s authors concluded that this left Britain in a very weak bargaining position in economic terms. Parts of Ireland had levels of exposure similar to those in London and northern areas of Scotland, the regions of the UK with the lowest levels. The next most affected regions after Ireland were in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, while regions in southern and eastern Europe were barely affected. “Mercantilist arguments popular in the UK media, which posit that the UK trade deficit with the rest of Europe implies that on economic grounds, other EU member states will be eager to agree a free trade deal with the UK, are not correct,” the report said. “When we consider the real trade-demand impacts on the EU member states and their regions ... the emerging picture is very different.” Prof Raquel Ortega-Argilés from the University of Birmingham said: “London is genuinely the most globalised part of the UK and as such less dependent on European markets for its prosperity. “In contrast, many parts of the UK, especially in the Midlands and in the north of England, are heavily dependent on European markets for their trade and prosperity, but in fact these are the regions that voted for Brexit.” The economic readjustments following Brexit, she said, “are expected to be more challenging and difficult for the UK’s weaker regions, in part because they are more dependent on European markets, but also because they are less resilient”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/19/extra-police-funding-council-tax-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T15:23:41Z","webTitle":"Extra £450m for police to be partly funded by council tax increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/19/extra-police-funding-council-tax-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/19/extra-police-funding-council-tax-increase","fields":{"headline":"Extra £450m for police to be partly funded by council tax increase","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A £450m boost to police funding has been announced by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, but £270m of the extra cash is to be funded by a £12 increase per household in council tax bills. The £450m increase for forces in England and Wales includes an extra £130m for national policing priorities, including armed officers and digital technology, and £50m for counter-terrorism. The move follows a high-profile campaign by senior police officers, who said the loss of 20,000 officers since 2010 had led to overstretched counter-terrorism policing and a reduction in day-to-day activities in the face of rises in violent crime. Ministers said the extra £270m for local police forces meant they would move from a “flat cash increase” to a real-terms rise that matched inflation. The Home Office intends to repeat the 2018-19 settlement in 2019-20. Opposition MPs said the Home Office’s direct grant funding for local forces amounted to a flat cash settlement, which meant they faced a cut to make up for inflation. The home secretary said the settlement would ensure forces had the resources required to keep people safe. “Taxpayers will invest more money in forces because the work our officers do to protect us is absolutely vital, and we recognise demand is changing. However, my message to police forces is that this increased investment must mean we raise the pace of reform,” Rudd said, adding that embracing digital and increasing productivity were necessities. In the Commons, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said austerity had been as damaging to the police as it had been to other public services. She said the government’s decision to lift the 1% pay cap for officers had not been funded in the settlement, and asked that there be no more cuts in police numbers. The £12 a year levy on household council tax bills to raise £270m is the limit of the increase that can be levied by police and crime commissioners without a local referendum having to be called. The extra £450m appeared to more than match the £440m demanded in a joint submission by police and crime commissioners and the national police chiefs council. But while they pressed for an extra £440m for 2018-19, they argued that an extra £845m was needed in 2019-20 to provide an extra 5,000 officers and to arm a further 1,100 officers. Abbott said the decision not to increase the Home Office grant funding for the police amounted to a real-terms cut. She said: “Since 2010, the Tories have made huge cuts to the police; 20,000 police officers have been lost and an increasing number of overstretched forces say they cannot respond to certain crimes.” The package requires a further £100m in savings through “smarter procurement” of everything from police vehicles to uniforms. The Home Office said it intended to publish data on the usable reserves of police forces, which stood at more than £1.6bn in March. Individual force reserves range from 7-42% of annual funding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/20/uk-arms-trade-no-moral-or-economic-sense-liam-fox-killing-machines","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T11:30:14Z","webTitle":"The arms trade isn’t the post-Brexit future we’re looking for | Lloyd Russell-Moyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/uk-arms-trade-no-moral-or-economic-sense-liam-fox-killing-machines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/uk-arms-trade-no-moral-or-economic-sense-liam-fox-killing-machines","fields":{"headline":"The arms trade isn’t the post-Brexit future we’re looking for","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the spectre of Brexit emerges, so do the first meaningful signs of the Tory vision of “building a global Britain”. The Department for International Trade, set up by Theresa May to put some flesh on the bones of her slogan, has prioritised arms sales for Britain’s post-Brexit industrial policy. The DIT, which licences Britain’s exports guns, planes and bombs, has overseen a sharp spike in sales to repressive regimes, many of which it has identified as “priority markets”. The biggest of these is Saudi Arabia, which is using our arms to bomb into famine its political enemies in Yemen. Liam Fox, who runs the department, has said he will “personally lead on helping the defence and security industries to export and will be involved in the most significant global deals across all sectors”. It is remarkable that a figure like Fox remains in charge of anything, least of all Britain’s trade policy. In 2011 Fox was forced to resign as defence secretary after being accompanied on several trips to key UK arms markets by the businessman and his friend Adam Werrity, who did not work for the government and had not been security-checked. Fox likes to tell us that there is moral virtue in selling arms to our allies because they save lives and improve global security. He says that Britain has one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world. He also says that the arms industry is a huge boon for the economy, tax revenue and employment in this country. These are useful myths to defend his government’s actions. Our arms export control regime clearly states that it is illegal for the government to licence weapons to nations that oppress their own people or violate international humanitarian law. The UN has said that Saudi Arabia is targeting civilians in Yemen. The Yemen Data Project has calculated that nearly a third of more than 15,000 air raids in Yemen have targeted non-military sites. By selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which uses them to bomb hospitals, schools, food storage sites, ports, hotels, centres for the blind and funerals, we violate British law. Why are we doing this? It can’t just be for the money. The UK arms export industry is fairly small. British defence exports in 2015 took £7.7bn in turnover, which was 0.27% of our GDP, and 1.6% of our exports in the same year. In value, Britain’s arms exports are worth about the same as its exports in beverages. Experts put the direct subsidy at somewhere between £104m and £453m and the indirect subsidy – mainly defence research and development – somewhere between £483m and £576m. Not only are we arming the world’s most repressive and violent regimes but the British public is paying to grease the wheels. The taxpayer funds a huge team of sales reps for the private arms export industry many of whose priority markets (Saudi, Turkey, Bahrain, Colombia et al) appear on the Foreign Office’s list of countries of human rights concern. More than 70% of the total number of Britain’s export promotion staff focus on arms, which constitutes only 1.5% of total exports in value. Half of Fox’s new secondees have been transferred from the private arms industry. When buyers cannot afford our weapons, the government subsidises loans for them through export credit guarantees; UK Export Finance, which is supposed to support all British exports, says 50% of the support it provides (in the form of loans or guarantees) was given to defence exports. Although tiny, the arms export industry is shockingly destructive. Yemen is just one example. UK arms sold to Libya (worth £105m from 2005 to 2009) can no longer be accounted for as the arms caches of our erstwhile ally Muammar Gaddafi are now enabling Islamist insurgencies across the Maghreb, one of the poorest areas on Earth, to terrorise millions. After the Arab spring quickly turned to winter, the UK temporarily revoked many of its arms exports to Egypt and Bahrain. But by then, of course, it was too late for the Arab citizens being tracked with UK surveillance equipment, bundled into UK armoured vehicles and killed and tortured by a military with access to all manner of UK weaponry. The British arms sold during our military adventures in Iraq ended up in the hands of Isis militants. The collateral cost of UK arms sales is incalculable. The last refuge for men like Fox is to declare that arms exports are a boon for the economy. This is also false. In 2013 a report in the Economics of Peace and Security Journal concluded that the “literature is moving towards a commonly accepted, if not consensus, view: military expenditure has a negative effect on economic growth”. Evidence from the US shows that equivalent public investment in almost any other industry, such as renewable energy, health care or education, creates more jobs. So why does Fox spend up to a billion pounds of our money every year to prop up such a controversial, dangerous and dysfunctional export industry? Because he is an ideologue. He believes that by exporting arms, Britain can somehow project power. But the truth is that our arms exports serve to slow our economy and disempower us against the rising tide of extremism that our arms sales help to ferment. Rather than subsidising killing machines, Britain should be spending our wealth on building productive export industries that contribute to global development and stability such as renewable energy, civil engineering and low-carbon technology. As a member of the Commons committee on arms exports controls – which in its past has been poorly funded and frequently fobbed off by the government – I intend to shine a light on the wilful misinterpretation by the government of this regime. Ensuring our arms exports do not sow chaos across the world necessitates a deep change to our political culture, which only a Labour government will bring. Labour has higher aspirations for our industrial base in post-Brexit Britain than trying to make money out of war and human suffering. • Lloyd Russell-Moyle is a Labour MP and member of the Commons committee on arms export controls"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/20/wilde-creatures-review-vaudeville-theatre-london-oscar-wilde","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T09:28:51Z","webTitle":"Wilde Creatures review – fairytale fun shows the world according to Oscar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/20/wilde-creatures-review-vaudeville-theatre-london-oscar-wilde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/20/wilde-creatures-review-vaudeville-theatre-london-oscar-wilde","fields":{"headline":"Wilde Creatures review – fairytale fun shows the world according to Oscar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s good to see Dominic Dromgoole’s Oscar Wilde season in the West End includes a show for family audiences. Particularly as Wilde’s fairytales, written before the plays that made his reputation, are so much less well known. They have much in common with Hans Christian Andersen’s more familiar stories, and offer a sly, snappy look at the best and worst of human nature. Who better to put some of these tales on stage than Tall Stories, one of our most undersung but most successful theatre companies? They were making shows for family audiences long before such work became fashionable and its box-office potential was recognised. The Wilde Creatures of the title are a raggle-taggle band of storytelling actor-musicians who bring to vivid life characters who populate the stories. These include a spoilt brat of a princess in The Infanta’s Birthday, a rich miller who exploits a poor gardener in The Devoted Friend, and, in The Nightingale and the Rose, a student who knows everything but understands nothing of love. There are clever little nods to other stories, too. The signs on the stage saying trespassers will be prosecuted hint at The Selfish Giant. A smart framing device uses the ending of The Happy Prince, which sees a selfless statue pulled down after he loses his beauty, to start a conversation about a topical issue: who should we erect statues to and why? The audience get to have their say. It is done with a light touch, and this amiable hour is intelligently packaged by writers and directors Olivia Jacobs and Toby Mitchell who recognise the emotional power of the stories while steering away from mawkish sentiment. It has been designed on a shoestring but with real flourish by Barney George, using wooden packing cases to conjure a town. The casting could be more diverse, but the quartet of performers – Matt Jopling, Tom Jude, Steve McCourt and Lauren Silver – are engaging even if on occasion they slip into that smiley, earnest mode that sometimes infects actors in family shows. But this thoughtful show, enlivened by Jon Fiber and Andy Shaw’s jaunty music and lyrics, has a brain as well as a heart. Which is not true of Wilde’s self-important strutting characters whose hypocrisy and hollowness is gleefully pricked. • At the Vaudeville, London, until 31 December.

Sally Collier, chief regulator at Ofqual, said she was “very disappointed” with the 52% increase in grade changes this summer, which followed reforms aimed at tightening up re-marking, and she promised action to ensure it didn’t happen again. Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, Collier said Ofqual was currently in discussion with exam boards about what went wrong, but an investigation had already shown there were no problems with the original marking. “We’ve had a look at marking consistency metrics across all of the exam boards and the level of consistency in that marking was very similar to last year. So nothing happened in the original quality of marking that suggests there was a problem,” she said. “There has been a problem with the reviewing,” she continued. “That problem is not consistent across the exam boards. Some exam boards have implemented it very well, and some exam boards haven’t.” Previously, exam results that were challenged were re-marked in detail, with higher marks often the result of minor differences in opinion between markers. Under Ofqual’s reforms, marks are only supposed to be changed if a clear marking or procedural error is discovered. Teachers’ leaders last week accused exam boards of creating a “massive muddle” after Ofqual data revealed that almost 74,000 GCSE grades were changed this summer, compared with just over 48,000 last year. Of particular concern was the number of appeals that resulted in increases by two or more grades, which also rose significantly from 401 in 2016 to nearly 2,000 in 2017. Collier told MPs: “I would not be able to talk about the specific regulatory action that we are taking with those exam boards that did not follow our rules, but we will ensure that it does not happen again in subsequent series.” During the hearing on Tuesday, MPs also expressed concern about the potential “unfairness” of the current exam appeals system, which they said put wealthier schools and parents who could afford to request a re-mark at an unfair advantage. If the mark is changed there is no cost, but many schools will choose not to run that risk. MPs called for the introduction of a deprivation measure to provide additional funding for children from deprived backgrounds to seek exam re-marks. They also raised concerns about a 40% increase in the number of unconditional offers made by universities. Figures released last week by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service revealed that almost 52,000 unconditional offers were made to students seeking places this year. The chair of Ofqual, Roger Taylor, told MPs: “From Ofqual’s point of view, it becomes particularly concerning at the point that it dramatically affects pupils’ motivation and the way that they approach qualifications. “That can actually undermine the validity of the qualification. I don’t think we are at that point yet, but it’s something we need to keep a close eye on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/19/uk-to-pursue-ambitious-trade-deal-with-eu-theresa-may-tells-cabinet","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T19:48:28Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Michael Gove 'warns colleagues to avoid re-run of project fear'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/19/uk-to-pursue-ambitious-trade-deal-with-eu-theresa-may-tells-cabinet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/19/uk-to-pursue-ambitious-trade-deal-with-eu-theresa-may-tells-cabinet","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Michael Gove 'warns colleagues to avoid re-run of project fear'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Gove has warned senior colleagues to avoid a re-run of “project fear” during a crunch cabinet meeting over what Brexit end state the government should be aiming for, the Guardian understands. Those present claimed the environment secretary – who was one of the figureheads of the Vote Leave campaign – urged the room to avoid a repeat of the divisive arguments of the EU referendum. Details of the cabinet discussions emerged as Theresa May told her cabinet that she aims to pursue a bespoke trade deal that is “significantly more ambitious” than the EU’s deal with Canada, in the first formal discussion ministers have held about goals for final outcome. That position was broadly backed by the leading ministers, who took it in turns to have their say as British negotiators gear up to enter phase two of talks, focused on transition and then the future trading arrangement. One source said Gove, backed by Boris Johnson and others, was pushing for the government to adopt an optimistic tone about Britain’s exit from the EU, but that his comments were not directed at any colleagues in particular. However another individual said they felt he was hitting out at the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and effectively accusing him of “peddling project fear”. Another figure confirmed that Gove had made a “pointed comment” aimed at Hammond but said it was over a different argument in relation to the negotiation strategy, and it was also suggested that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, told off the environment secretary in response. In what was described as a more “lively” meeting than Monday’s Brexit inner cabinet discussion, the chancellor was supported by Rudd and others in pressing for a final outcome in which the British economy remained close to that of the EU. Amid a spectrum of views set out at length over a long session, they wanted to see the most alignment, while others – such as Johnson and Gove – pushed for Britain to be more able to diverge on standards from the EU. The home secretary reiterated her argument that ministers must be wary about moves that could be damaging economically and harm current jobs in the UK. The position is backed by Hammond but also others such as the welfare secretary, David Gauke, business secretary, Greg Clark, and Damian Green – effectively the deputy prime minister. Justine Greening, the education secretary, was also supportive, although sources insisted she did not identify herself as a backer of soft or hard Brexit. However, she did make clear that business needed certainty – particularly in some sectors, such as financial services. Meanwhile, Johnson’s arguments about protecting Britain’s ability to opt for different regulations in the future was strongly backed by Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, with sources claiming the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, also offered her support. However, one source insisted that there is a growing consensus – including from Hammond and Rudd – around the idea that the UK should be able to slowly diverge in certain sectors, although such a position could be resisted by the European commission. Downing Street said the meeting was “good, clear and detailed”. It said ministers agreed they would not seek a deal to keep the UK in the single market, such as through membership of the European Economic Area, calling it “democratically unsustainable” because it would mean automatically adopting EU rules without a vote. In total, 25 ministers spoke at the final cabinet meeting of the year, which lasted an hour and 25 minutes, making a range of contributions that Downing Street said were not restricted to their specific briefs. Only James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, did not attend. No 10 said May hoped to secure a deal that “secures the best possible trading terms with the EU, allows the UK to set rules that are right for our situation and facilitates ambitious third-country trade deals”. Further discussions, including about plans for a transitional period after Britain leaves the EU, are expected to be held in the new year. May has been widely rumoured to be planning a speech, to follow her Lancaster House and Florence speeches over the last 12 months, setting out the next stage of the government’s Brexit plans. No 10 said nothing had been planned yet but the government had always intended to be “transparent about the process”. “The PM said that in developing our future economic partnership we should be creative in designing our proposal,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. “The Brexit secretary and PM were clear that the UK is seeking a bespoke deal.” Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the UK will not get a bespoke trade deal, arguing it is important not to set a precedent of “cherry-picking” sectors. He said leaving the EU would mean City firms automatically losing the financial passports allowing them to trade freely in Europe. “There is no place [for financial services]. There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn’t exist,” Barnier said. He said the outcome was a consequence of “the red lines that the British have chosen themselves. In leaving the single market, they lose the financial services passport.” Asked about these objections, the spokesman said: “This is the beginning of the phase two negotiations. You would expect the commission to be setting out their position. I would imagine you will hear a lot more from them before you hear less.” Ministers discussed the future deal for the City, among other sectors, though did not directly address Barnier’s comments, Downing Street said. “As we have said throughout, we are confident of negotiating a good deal for financial services and, as we have always been clear, that will be in the EU’s interest as well as ours,” the spokesman said. No 10 said the UK’s future immigration system had not come up as part of the discussions. A government source said the focus had been the economic partnership with Europe, with work on a new immigration system already well under way and the immigration bill due to published next year. Labour’s Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of Open Britain which campaigns to keep Britain in the single market, said it was late in the day for the cabinet to be having its first full discussion on the future relationship with Europe. “The cabinet cannot agree among themselves about what Brexit outcome they want beyond an unrealistic ambition to have cake and eat it,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/theresa-may-to-visit-poland-amid-eu-row-over-judicial-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T22:32:02Z","webTitle":"Theresa May will 'raise concerns' with Polish PM over judicial reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/theresa-may-to-visit-poland-amid-eu-row-over-judicial-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/theresa-may-to-visit-poland-amid-eu-row-over-judicial-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May will 'raise concerns' with Polish PM over judicial reforms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May is prepared to challenge her Polish counterpart over his government’s controversial interference in the country’s judicial system, Downing Street said, as the prime minister prepared to fly to Warsaw on Thursday. Her visit will come in the aftermath of an unprecedented decision by the EU to censure Poland for a “serious breach” of its values, which could ultimately see Warsaw stripped of its voting rights in Brussels. May and senior cabinet ministers face a delicate diplomatic challenge for the visit, which had been intended to underline the UK’s defence and security cooperation with eastern Europe. Ministers see Poland and other eastern European countries as potential key allies in trade talks, given their desire to retain close security cooperation. In Warsaw, May will announce a new joint UK-Poland treaty on defence and security cooperation, only the second such treaty the UK has signed, after one with France. The governments will also jointly launch UK-funded offensives to combat alleged Russian state-sponsored “disinformation”.The UK has remained neutral in the growing rift between Poland’s hardline right-wing government and the European Union, concerned about the image of Brussels’ apparent interference with a country’s domestic affairs. However, May’s spokesman said she would not shirk a difficult conversation with the new Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, but stopped short of saying the UK would vote to censure Poland when potential action against the country is put before EU leaders. The rift with Brussels came to a head after a decision by the Polish senate to give the executive greater control of the supreme court and the judicial appointments’ body. European commissioners have recommended member states issue a formal warning to Poland under the article 7 procedure, which has never before been used, warning that Poland’s government is putting fundamental democratic values at risk. May said the UK government did have its own concerns. “We place importance on respect for the rule of law and we expect all our partners to abide by international norms and standards,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. “The prime minister will raise her concerns when they meet tomorrow. We hope that Poland and the commission can resolve this through discussion.” The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said it was imperative the prime minister raised concerns over the reforms, which critics say are anti-democratic. “Time and again on her foreign travels, from Saudi Arabia and Turkey to her various meetings with Donald Trump, Theresa May has chosen to duck the difficult issues rather than confront them,” said Thornberry. “She must not repeat that failure in Poland. She must demand that the government either stop undermining human rights and democratic freedoms in Poland through these judicial reforms, or face the loss of its voting rights within the EU.” Any future vote on Poland is likely to put the UK in a bind, with Poland viewed as a key ally ahead of the upcoming Brexit trade negotiations. Conservative MEPs sit in the same conservative grouping in the European parliament as the Law and Justice (Pis) party. The UK had sought to court Polish support over the last few months, despite rising concern about the actions of the hardline government, including dining with former prime minster Beata Szydło at a summit in Sweden and deploying 150 soldiers from the British Light Dragoons to the Polish-Russian border to counter potential Russian aggression. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge also visited the country as part of the European tour this summer. May will travel to Warsaw accompanied by her most senior cabinet ministers, the chancellor Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the home secretary Amber Rudd, and the business secretary Greg Clark. Downing Street said the new defence partnership expected to be announced on Thursday would deepen ties that would build on the deployment of British troops to the Polish-Russian border. May will announce £5m of UK funds to build joint capacity to detect and counter the spread of Russian information operations, some of which will fund Belsat, a Polish-funded TV channel for Belarussians. Speaking ahead of her trip, May said: “I am determined that Brexit will not weaken our relationship with Poland. Rather, it will serve as a catalyst to strengthen it.” May said she would reaffirm how European states needed to continue to work together to “protect our shared values, people and interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/20/triple-m-says-it-will-host-its-own-version-of-hottest-100-on-australia-day","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:02:52Z","webTitle":"Indigenous artists criticise Triple M's decision to run Australia Day top 100","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/20/triple-m-says-it-will-host-its-own-version-of-hottest-100-on-australia-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/20/triple-m-says-it-will-host-its-own-version-of-hottest-100-on-australia-day","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous artists criticise Triple M's decision to run Australia Day top 100","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Indigenous writers, artists and organisations have voiced their disappointment at Triple M’s decision to host its own version of the Hottest 100 on Australia Day. Adam Briggs, who makes up one half of the Indigenous hip-hop duo, AB Original, called on fans to hijack Triple M’s countdown by voting for his song January 26, which argues for changing the date of Australia Day. “Fuck up the party before it even starts!” he wrote on Twitter. Briggs said Triple M’s decision to run the program, titled “Ozzest 100”, pandered to nationalists and racists. Other indigenous groups also voiced their disappointment. Triple M’s countdown will focus largely on songs that it says define Australian music. “So, the taxpayer-funded FM has decided that there’ll be no soundtrack for Australia Day. Let’s face it, that’s usually full of hipsters or kids making music on a Mac,” the national radio station said in a statement on Wednesday. “At Triple M we’re going to give you what you asked for. The perfect Australia Day soundtrack.” The move immediately attracted criticism. Triple M’s decision to run Ozzest 100 follows Triple J’s move to shift the Hottest 100 music countdown from 26 January after a nationwide debate on the date’s historical significance. In 2018 and 2019 the event will be held on the fourth weekend of January. Almost 65,000 people voted in Triple J’s nationwide survey, which was prompted by debate over the appropriateness of holding the countdown on a day that marks the beginning of British invasion and colonisation. According to independent analysis of the responses, 60% voted in favour of changing the date, while 29% said they did not support the change. A second poll of more than 700 18-to-30-year-olds validated the results – 55% said the Hottest 100 should move. For many Indigenous groups and supporters, Australia Day is largely associated with dispossession and violence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/21/dreamers-fear-deportation-if-congress-delays-debate-on-daca-fix-until-new-year","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"'We have plenty of time': Congress may delay decision on fate of 700,000 Dreamers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/21/dreamers-fear-deportation-if-congress-delays-debate-on-daca-fix-until-new-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/21/dreamers-fear-deportation-if-congress-delays-debate-on-daca-fix-until-new-year","fields":{"headline":"'We have plenty of time': Congress may delay decision on fate of 700,000 Dreamers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Indira Marquez Robles will turn 18 on Friday. But more than a party or presents, the Houston teen wants Congress to pass the Dream Act, a bipartisan plan that would protect young, undocumented immigrants like herself from deportation. “The deadline for deciding what to do on Daca is on my birthday,” Marquez Robles said. “So it could be the best birthday present ever or the biggest blow to the chest I could imagine.” The high school senior is part of a groundswell of liberal activists demanding that Congress enact protections for the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, before adjourning for the year. But on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are now all but certain to leave Washington for the holidays without resolving the fate of the young immigrants. It remains to be seen whether Democrats, who vowed action before the holidays, are prepared to force a vote on the issue this week as Congress moves toward passing a spending bill to avert a government shutdown. Republican leaders in Congress have ruled out taking action before the year’s end. “That’s a matter to be discussed next year,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, told Fox News on Tuesday when asked about the status of Dreamers. “The president has given us until March to address that issue. We have plenty of time to do that.” On Wednesday, McConnell pledged to hold a vote on the status of Dreamers in January – pending a compromise from a bipartisan working group in the Senate. In September, Donald Trump plunged Dreamers into uncertainty by announcing that he was rescinding Daca, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, implemented by Barack Obama in 2012. The policy paved the way for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers to come out of the shadows to study and work legally in the US. Trump placed their fate squarely in the hands of Congress, giving lawmakers until 5 March 2018 to find a legislative solution. Democrats have long insisted Congress must act by the end of the year, setting the stage for a possible government shutdown over Dreamers. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, appeared to stand by that promise, urging her caucus on Wednesday to vote against a spending bill if it didn’t include, among other Democratic priorities, support for the Dream Act, a bipartisan bill that was first introduced in 2001 and would provide a pathway to citizenship for roughly 1.2 million immigrants. “House and Senate Democratic Leadership has continued to insist on parity in the CAPS, which we insist should include funding for opioids, veterans, pensions, NIH, and support for the DREAM Act,” she wrote in a letter to colleagues. “Unless we see a respect for our values and priorities, we continue to urge a strong NO on the Continuing Resolution.” A handful of Democrats in both chambers have said publicly they will withhold their votes on any spending bill that does not also address protections for Dreamers. But whether the party is willing to risk the political blowback of a government shutdown is unclear. As lawmakers approach a deadline of midnight on Friday to pass a bill that would keep the US government open, immigration advocates are increasingly concerned by what they view as equivocal statements from top Democratic leaders. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, would not explicitly say if he would oppose a short-term government funding bill that did not include protections for Dreamers. “I’m hopeful that we won’t get to that,” Schumer told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, while noting negotiators were nearing a resolution on a spending bill and he remained “hopeful” that it would include both the Dream Act and border security measures. Trump and Republicans have demanded that any Daca fix must be paired with tougher restrictions along the US-Mexico border. A bipartisan group of senators has been seeking a compromise to enact legal protections for Dreamers. The group met with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, on Tuesday and is expected to unveil a proposal this week. But the Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a Republican member of the working group and longtime proponent of immigration reform, said the bill would not receive a vote until next month. “Bipartisan #DACA bill will be on the Senate floor in January.” Flake tweeted on Wednedsay. Democrats on Capitol Hill, who overwhelmingly support Dream Act-style legislation, are divided over how to meet the urgency of young, undocumented immigrants. “If Republicans refuse to do the right thing and protect Dreamers in the upcoming long-term spending bill, then they are going to cause the government to shut down,” Kirsten Gillibrand, a senator from New York, said at a rally across the street from the US Capitol on Tuesday. Senator Kamala Harris of California, agreed and accused lawmakers of inflicting “trauma” on the young immigrants by allowing their fate to hang in the balance without a resolution. “Each day matters,” Harris said. “And for that reason we must get this done and we must get it done before the end of this year. No January. No February. No March. Now.” Harris cited statistics from the left-leaning Center for American Progress showing that with each passing day, roughly 122 Daca recipients lose their protections, including the authorization to work legally in the US. As the clock winds down, hundreds of activists have descended upon Washington from dozens of states across the country as part of efforts to urge Congress to act. They held peaceful sit-ins in the offices of congressional lawmakers, and some were arrested in an escalation of their tactics. More protests and marches are expected throughout the coming days. While some House and Senate Democrats joined the advocates, a growing number of Democrats, namely those facing re-election next year in states won by Trump, are less emphatic. Those Democrats are less comfortable with the optics of shutting down the government – thus forcing federal agencies to cease their services and workers to remain at home – over the issue of immigration. Polls showing that the majority of Americans oppose a shutdown, and would distribute blame evenly among both parties, have compounded their concerns. Immigration reform has loomed over the US for decades, often acting as one of the most polarizing and politically vexing issues before Congress. In 2013, a bipartisan bill to overhaul the US immigration system passed the Senate but died in the House amid stiff opposition from conservatives. A separate version of the Dream Act had failed to advance in the Senate in 2010, prompting Obama to take executive action in 2012. While polling shows support for Dreamers among a majority of Americans, conservative hardliners have been emboldened by Trump’s victory in last year’s election on a decidedly anti-immigrant platform. Immigration advocates believe this is their “do-or-die” moment. Kicking the issue into 2018 would amplify an already complex issue against the backdrop of an election year, they argue, when there might be even less appetite among lawmakers to take political risks. They have also seen how standalone immigration bills have fared in the past. “We’re the closest we’ve ever been to passing the Dream Act,” said Karen Caudillo, a university student from Orlando, Florida, and a Daca recipient. “If we don’t do it now we just know that next month lawmakers will start worrying about 2018 and it will be impossible to pass. Then the next thing you know, we’re being deported.” Caudillo has spent the past two weeks in Washington at rallies and protests on Capitol Hill to urge lawmakers to demand Congress pass the Dream Act before the end of the year. On Tuesday, she joined activists at a sit-in inside the office of Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico who supports the Dream Act. She said he was gracious and listened to their stories but ultimately did not commit to withholding his vote on the spending bill. “What we tried to explain is that we don’t want a government shutdown either,” Caudillo said. “But if enough people refuse to go home without a deal we can create enough pressure on Republicans so that they have to do something.” Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group, said time and patience were running short. “Any lawmaker, Democrat or Republican, who votes for a deal to fund the deportation of Dreamers rather than protecting them will be scorched by a grassroots uprising hot enough to boil snow,” Wikler said in a call with immigration and progressive activists. “The Dreamer deadline is December. No extensions,” he added. For Marquez Robles, who expects to spend her 18th birthday anxiously checking her phone in between classes for updates from Capitol Hill, the Dream Act’s passage is urgent. Her protected status expires in less than 100 days. Yet despite the uncertainty, Marquez Robles maintains an unshakable confidence in the American Dream, which for her means going to college and becoming an immigration lawyer in the country where she has lived since she was six months old. “Sometimes I get overwhelmed but I am trying not to dwell on these negative feelings,” she said. “I always think that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/23/who-said-it-donald-trump-or-buddy-from-elf","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T21:54:18Z","webTitle":"Who said it: Donald Trump or Buddy from Elf?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/who-said-it-donald-trump-or-buddy-from-elf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/who-said-it-donald-trump-or-buddy-from-elf","fields":{"headline":"Who said it: Donald Trump or Buddy from Elf?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/beyond-the-beer-how-to-match-booze-to-an-aussie-christmas-lunch","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Beyond the beer: how to match booze to an Aussie Christmas lunch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/beyond-the-beer-how-to-match-booze-to-an-aussie-christmas-lunch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/22/beyond-the-beer-how-to-match-booze-to-an-aussie-christmas-lunch","fields":{"headline":"Beyond the beer: how to match booze to an Aussie Christmas lunch","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There’s something a little perverse about the way Australians shoehorn European religious and cultural traditions into our summer. European Christmas is all about cold weather, warming food and rich drink; in the midst of a sweltering Australian summer, it’s hard to muster the appetite for anything heartier than a salad and an ice-cold lager. Despite this, there’s something to be said for the joys of an Australian Christmas – especially its culinary joys. The country’s gradually weakening ties to the British empire mean our Christmases are no longer dominated by seasonally inappropriate roasts and boiled puddings with heavy custard; instead, we opt for lighter flavours and textures that reflect a certain nostalgia, tempered by practicality. Australia’s love of a good drink means these hybrid dishes cry out for matching beverages. So rather than sticking to the usual suspects – crisp lagers, dry sparkling whites, and still whites and reds – why not match these unusual foods with some off-the-radar drinks? 1. Seafood and dry sherry For many Australians, Christmas means seafood – preferably a heaped platter of cold cooked prawns, freshly shucked raw oysters and a smattering of Moreton Bay bugs or rock lobsters. Never mind that this year Australia will experience a shortage of oysters – for many of us, Christmas will still involve a trip to the fishmonger, even if oysters are off the menu. While there are few culinary pleasures as true as oysters with chablis or scallops with a zippy champagne, it’s worth considering a dry sherry with your seafood this Christmas. If your mental image of sherry is a sticky brown substance found in mouldering bottles in grandmother’s sideboard, it’s time to reconsider. While sherry isn’t exactly hip, it’s definitely back, and the drier styles are leading the charge towards mainstream respectability. The lucky inhabitants of Spain’s sherry triangle – the area just south of Seville from which the only wines that can be legally be labelled sherry originate – are blessed not only with proximity to one of the world’s great wine regions, but also with an abundance of seafood, and they’re more than happy to wash the latter down with the products of the former. Their rules are pretty simple: if it swims, serve it with a fino or a manzanilla sherry. These two closely related styles of sherry are fresh and vibrant even when they’ve been subjected to years of ageing, thanks to the veil of flor that protects the maturing wine from oxygenation. Their unusual salinity, leanness and striking minerality make them a perfect foil for seafood – especially prawns. The great thing about acquiring a taste for slightly daggy wines is that their lack of prestige dramatically lowers prices, and reasonable entry-level fino and manzanilla sherries can be found for not much more than $25 per full bottle (these wines are commonly sold by the half bottle). I have a soft spot for Hijos de Rainera Pérez Marín’s entry-level manzanilla, La Guita, which manages to pack a fair wallop of layered savouriness despite being made in gargantuan quantities – it’s one of Spain’s most popular sherries, and for good reason. A little further up the scale you’ll find Sánchez Romate’s Fino Perdido, which is bottled en rama (without filtration) and with a few more years of age on it than is strictly customary, which gives it a wonderfully dense texture. If you’re a patriot who is after an Australian drop, it’s worth investigating the dry sherry-like wines of Seppeltsfield and Pennyweight, both of which stand in stark contrast to the cheap cruft that is the vast majority of Australian “sherry”. And if you have the money and the patience to track them down, it’s worth trying to find a bottle of either the Equipo Navazos La Bota de Florpower vino blanco or the Navazos-Niepoort vino blanco – both unfortified white wines from the sherry region that demonstrate the region’s potential for profound and layered fine wines. Sticking with tradition? If you’re going to buy champagne, do the right thing and steer your money away from the big houses and their huge marketing budgets, and instead invest in a grower champagne, which is bound to represent better value. Larmandier-Bernier, Laherte Frères, Egly-Ouriet and Piollot père et fils are all names to look out for. For Australian sparkling wines of the dry white variety, look no further than Tasmania, the cold climate of which echoes the severity of the French Champagne region. Go-to names include Arras, Frogmore Creek and Josef Chromy. And if you want to split the difference between bubbles and the funk of sherry, try to find a bottle of either of the two Colet-Navazos wines – a collaboration between Catalonian cava house Colet and sherry negociants Equipo Navazos that sees lean, zippy cava dosed with high-quality dry sherries. 2. Stonefruit salad and rosé Christmas happens to coincide with the peak of Australia’s stone fruit season, which means an abundance of peaches and nectarines. These fruits, in either their white or yellow forms, just beg to be cubed and tossed with a handful of rocket, fresh mint, maybe some green beans, lightly toasted almonds, and olive oil and vinegar. If you’re after something a little more substantial, you can throw in some fresh bocconcini or a burrata cheese, too. The pairing of rosé with this kind of salad goes beyond the Insta-worthy partnership of pale pink peach flesh with pale pink wine. The acidic dressing of salads can dominate a medium- or low-acid wine, but many rosés have the acidic backbone to stand up to it. A little hint of residual sugar, which many rosés possess, can also help tame the dressing. And the fruit-driven nature of rosé means it chimes beautifully with the fruit in the salad. While there’s an ocean of indifferently made, easy-to-swill Provençal rosé out there – global sales of rosé are growing at a remarkable rate and production has boomed in the south of France – it’s still possible to find high-quality rosés that have a bit more heft and are perfect pairings for food. I’m rather fond of the Cuvée Tradition rosé made from tibouren grapes by Provençal producer Clos Cibonne – aged under a thin veil of yeast not unlike the flor that protects dry sherries, it balances orange peel and rose petal notes with a savouriness from the yeast and a herbaceous complexity. If you’re looking for something made a little closer to home, consider one of the rosés made by Australia’s naturalist set. The 2017 vintage of Tom Shobbrook’s Poolside syrah straddles the line between an incredibly light red and a dark rosé, but wherever you place it in the taxonomy of wine, it’s an immensely likeable wine full of white pepper and juicy red fruit. The coppery pinot gris made by Murrumbateman producer Ravensworth similarly blurs the line between a rosé and an orange wine, but the extended skin contact gives this gris some grip and a complexity that a watery pinot gris often sorely lacks. Finally, if you’re after a truly luxe rosé, try to get your hands on a bottle of one from the tiny Provençal appellation of Bandol. Both Domaine Tempier and Château de Pibarnon are standard-bearers for the region. Sticking with tradition? If you’re allergic to pink wine, or can’t stand the hashtag #roséallday, any high-acid white wine with clean-cut fruit flavours would pair well with this kind of salad. Albariño-based wines from Spain’s Rias Baixas have acid and fruit character in spades, and their notes of white peach and nectarine play well with the real deal in the salad bowl – look for examples from Bodegas Eidosela, Zarate or Forjas del Salnés. The green, herbaceous notes of an Austrian grüner veltliner will also find an echo in the herbs in the salad – producers of note include Emmerich Knoll, Ingrid Groiss and Rudi Pichler. For an Australian drop, look no further than a dry Clare Valley riesling – I’m particularly taken by the work being done at Rieslingfreak, while Grosset remains the benchmark producer. 3. Roast chicken, turkey, duck or goose with dry madeira If sherry has something of an image problem, then madeira has a whole complex. This unusual fortified wine, produced only on the subtropical Portuguese island of Madeira, possesses intensely layered flavours, vibrant acidity and an incredibly rich history – but remains unfortunately neglected by most wine drinkers. Which is a real shame, because a good madeira can make an excellent food pairing, especially when matched with something opulent, like a traditional Christmas poultry roast. The lively acidity of the wine cuts through the fat of roast, while its rich, caramelised and nutty flavour – a byproduct of the estufagem process, in which the wine is deliberately heated and oxidised – pairs well with the similarly rich flavour of roasted meat. Madeira’s labelling system does make it a little difficult to walk into a bottle shop and pick up the right style. Very young madeiras, made with the widely grown negra mole grape, are labelled in terms of their dryness – seco (dry), meio seco (medium dry), meio doce (medium sweet), or doce (sweet). Better, older madeiras, however, are made from one of the four traditional Madeiran grape varieties, and are labelled with that name: sercial (dry), verdelho (medium dry), bual (medium sweet), or malmsey (sweet). The younger styles made from negra mole are fine for cooking with but aren’t exactly profound drinking experiences, so look for the named varietals when shopping. Sercial and verdelho madeiras are the best bet to go with your roast – save the buals and malmseys for after dinner. As far as producers go, I’m a fan of both Barbeito and D’Oliveras, although so little madeira makes it to Australia that you might not have the luxury of choice. If you’re after something very fancy, splurge on a medium-dry bottle of the nearly extinct terrantez varietal, most examples of which have some serious cellar age on them. (The estufagem process makes madeira practically indestructible, which means that very old madeiras – some can be found that are well over a century old – are still drinking remarkably well today.) Sticking with tradition? If madeira with dinner sounds like a bridge too far, go for a rich, textural white wine with acidity and structure to pair with your roast bird. The chardonnay-based white wines of Burgundy’s Côte de Beaune, particularly those of Domaine Leflaive, are the paradigm, but are frighteningly expensive. For something approaching the texture of white burgundy on a budget, look to the godello grape grown in the Spanish province of Galicia, particularly examples from the Valdeorras, Monterrei, and Ribeiro wine areas. A Hunter Valley semillon with some serious cellar age on it – at least five years, preferably 10 – would also work wonders: look for examples from Mount Pleasant or Tyrrell’s. 4. Cold glazed ham with sparkling shiraz No Christmas dish could be less suited to Australia’s summer climate than a glazed ham, but that small impediment hasn’t made a dent in its popularity as the centrepiece of Australian Christmas lunches and dinners. (Fortunately, practicality dictates that it is more often than not served cold.) A Christmas ham has big, bold flavours that could easily overpower the lighter styles of red wine that respond best to being chilled, which makes wine matching cold ham something of a challenge. Enter sparkling shiraz. There’s something terminally daggy about the entire concept – a rich, decadent Australian shiraz that has undergone secondary fermentation in the traditional champenoise method. But these wines are loved by Australian wine anoraks for a reason – the best examples match gutsy fruit character and grippy tannin with the elegance of good champagne. They’re also a uniquely Australian product – while other parts of the world make lightlysparkling red wines (think Italian lambrusco or brachetto), nobody else matches the hulking weight of warm-climate shiraz with full-throated bubbles. Seppelt’s high-end (and relatively expensive) Show Sparkling is the true original of the style, but even the winemaker’s much cheaper entry-level sparkling shiraz remains delicious. Best’s Great Western is dosed with a touch of sweet muscat, which gives it a suitably Christmassy hint of raisins and spice. If you have a bit of money to spend, the Joseph sparkling red blend (with some merlot and cabernet sauvignon in the mix) from Primo Estate and Leasingham’s Classic Clare both vie for the title of Australia’s best red fizz. For something a little different, try Sassafras’s sparkling red, made from the Italian montepulciano varietal and made fizzy by the ancient ancestrale method. Sticking with tradition? Look for a medium-bodied red wine that can take some chill but still has tannic grip to work with the fat and protein of the glazed ham. A young, fruit-driven Spanish tempranillo such as Olivier Rivière’s Rayos Uva rioja or Palacios Remondo’s La Vendimia rioja would work here, or a pineau d’aunis such as Patrice Colin’s coteaux du vendômois. For something closer to home, try Bobar’s Gamma Ray red blend – 75% fruity gamay with 25% cabernet franc for tannin and a hint of herbaceousness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/22/how-about-a-tax-on-auspol-short-termism-lets-call-it-the-tony-","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"How about a tax on #auspol short-termism?

Voters surveyed for the last Guardian Essential poll of 2017 gave politics an emphatic thumbs down, and they weren’t hopeful 2018 would be any better. Tired of banging on about the symptoms of dysfunction in my own ecosystem, I wrote a long essay in the middle of the year in which former protagonists, politicians and staff told their stories in candid but not self-pitying terms. The object of the exercise was to tell the real story of what it is like to be a professional politician in the current era. In journalism you always strive to unearth the truth but it’s hard, because the narrators are unreliable, and because facts are often refracted through self-interest. But with this exercise, I felt as though I’d touched down, briefly, in truth. But to what end? The dispiriting thing in this case is truth isn’t catalytic. No one will call for a royal commission into contemporary political life, no one will set up a Senate inquiry, because what would be the point? There’s no easy fix and the root causes are complex. What is broken can’t be fixed with a couple of top QCs, some searing testimony and a bit of introspection. When people outside politics ask me to explain what is going on, I generally start by saying the political and media class didn’t all wake up one day and just decide to be hopeless. There are seismic things going on. Technology has disrupted the media cycle, with massive impact. Instead of amplifying long cycles of deliberation –deliberation being the central business of politics – the waterfall news cycle now gobbles up and spits out short cycles of outrage, posturing and contention. Everything has speeded up to the point where there now seems to be an inexorable obsolescence about everything in public life. Debates get old before they start. Leaders are cannon fodder in this febrile, fretful, environment. Australian prime ministers have become biodegradable courtesy of the coup culture. So far, I’m in reasonably familiar territory. Readers who have been with me throughout the year will know I try to turn these issues around in my mind in different ways to see if there’s some mysterious code we might be able to crack. Thus far I certainly haven’t cracked it. But in the spirit of the festive season I thought we might end 2017 with a lighthearted thought experiment rather than talking ourselves relentlessly into a funk. Regular readers will know I care a lot about climate change and I’m moderately obsessed with energy policy. Knowing something of my professional obsessions, a friend suggested to me that we might be able to fix politics by bringing the approach economists bring to wicked problems such as climate change. Economists talk about pricing negative externalities. But before we get to pricing externalities, let’s set the scene. Let’s start with an assumption that politicians are rational actors, responding to clear incentives. (Don’t laugh, bear with me.) Let’s also acknowledge that we in the media like to have everything both ways. We moan constantly about how crap everything is while the beast we feed 24/7 sends a very different set of messages. The contemporary media cycle rewards politicians who emote (thinking in the current period really is strictly optional, how else do you explain Donald Trump?), disrupt (the contemporary currency of everything) and go negative – or even better – go full ad hominem (because it works more often than it should). Voters say they are repelled by negativity, and I think some people genuinely are, but it cuts through. While I was sitting in Canberra bemoaning the cartoonish debate playing out about whether the Labor senator Sam Dastyari was a double agent, wincing about a serious issue being reduced to a potboiler, Labor MPs were telling me they were being approached in their electorates about Dastyari being some new cold war operative. Clearly it gripped. So if an issue grips in an environment when others struggle to gain traction, a rhetorical arms race develops, where the language becomes more and more shrill and reckless – never mind the long-term implications. So now we’ve arrived at the need to price negative externalities. Let’s understand the concept by thinking about our climate change example. Externalities occur when the costs of some action are not borne by the perpetrators but instead fall on to others. Carbon emissions are a textbook example. Rising emissions contribute to climate change which will impose costs on future generations. When businesses aren’t forced to bear these costs, they will produce an environmentally damaging level of pollution, because it serves their short-term interests. It’s a form of market failure which economists would say justifies regulatory intervention to shift the costs on to the emitter, so that their incentives become aligned with the wider social good. In politics, by analogy, negative attacks, short-termism and appeals to sectional interests are imposing social costs, eroding the public’s trust in politicians, damaging the health of our democracy and acting as a barrier to the pursuit of reforms in the national interest. So when you think about it, politicians are a lot like polluting businesses, responding to incentives in the political marketplace. If there’s no obvious penalty for bad behaviour (apart from a few political commentators rolling their eyes and firing off a scarifying hot take – which will be replaced in five minutes by a puff piece from someone else), then people will go on doing it. Given the conditions we’ve just mapped out, economists would conclude we need some sort of regulatory intervention. So let’s think of a scheme, which just for fun, we can call the short-termism tax (in honour of Tony Abbott, the patron saint of yolo). Let’s call our tax the Tony. The design of our scheme is simple. We would impose a cap on bad behaviour in politics. We can allow a bit of it but not enough to cause serious harm; and any belch of short-termism above the cap attracts a penalty. After a bit of head scratching, I fancied the penalty might be a subtraction of votes from the last election. Every time a prime minister, minister, opposition leader, shadow minister makes an obvious foray (and they are always obvious) into short-termism, a percentage of their personal vote gets subtracted. If we were being generous, we could also create a system of positive incentives. When politicians do something courageous, something in the national interest, they could get a top-up of votes, giving them more of a buffer in their seat. Back when John Howard kicked off the carbon pricing debate, his government used to talk earnestly about the benefits of first-mover advantage and interlinking. So Australia’s short-termism tax (the Tony) could perhaps be exported to the rest of the democratic world. Obviously Australia isn’t the only country with a busted political system, so we might see similar schemes pop up around the globe. A flourishing international market could develop, where countries trade credits to ensure short-termism in politics is reduced at least cost. While the vote currency seems an easy metric for politicians, and one likely to influence behaviour, I don’t have an obvious penalty concept for journalists and media outlets who live to amplify stupidity and commoditise conflict as a method of driving reader engagement. Perhaps readers might send me some thoughts about that over the Christmas break? Speaking of breaks, I’m off for a few weeks to lie down in a dark room. Let me take this opportunity to thank the readers who have been with me and my wonderful politics team in Canberra through every step of a gruelling year – particularly the readers supporting our work by taking out Guardian membership.

The grandnephew of António César de Vasconcelos Correia – the 93rd governor of Portuguese India – had arrived at Sporting Lisbon the previous summer after being spotted by scouts while he was growing up in Angola, and promptly scored an astonishing 69 goals in 33 appearances as part of the celebrated Cinco Violinos (Five Violins) forward line. To put that figure into perspective, that meant Peyroteo became only the third man in history to pass the 60-goal mark in a calendar year, following in the footsteps of Hungary’s Imre Schlosser (64) in 1912 and Everton’s Dixie Dean (62) in 1927. Amazingly, he went on to repeat the feat eight years later, finding the net on 62 occasions in 32 appearances, including one match in which he recorded nine. “Fernando was a goalscoring machine,” declared the manager Cândido de Oliveira at the time. Defences have certainly improved in the intervening years, even if Pelé and Gerd Müller managed to break through the 70-goal barrier for the first time in 1958 and 1972 respectively. But the emergence of Lionel Messi’s rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo has set new standards in European football. Since Messi joined the exclusive club in 2010 by scoring 60 goals, he and his arch rival have both surpassed that figure on four occasions, with Messi’s 91 in 69 matches during 2012 – achieved at rate of 1.32 goals per game and including six hat-tricks – the current record. He may not have hit those heights this year, but with Messi, Ronaldo and three others still vying to become 2017’s top scorer, there is more competition than ever before. Robert Lewandowski, Edinson Cavani and Harry Kane have all enjoyed record-breaking years for club and country, with the Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain strikers both tied with Messi and Ronaldo on 53 goals and Tottenham’s Kane only three behind. But while all of his rivals have only one more chance to stake their claim, the Spurs striker still has fixtures against Burnley and Southampton to come – in which he will also attempt to break Alan Shearer’s record of 36 Premier League goals in a calendar year, which was achieved over 42 matches in 1995. Failure to score in his last two matches has seen Kane slip slightly off the pace in the final straight, although he will still fancy his chances of making up the three goals he needs to match Shearer’s record, having recorded the best ratio (1.04) of goals per game. Clearly irked by his failure to win the kicker Torjägerkanone for the Bundesliga’s top scorer back in May, Lewandowski has made up for losing out to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang by setting a slew of new records since. In September, a return of 82 goals in his first 100 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern meant the 29-year-old surpassed Rudi Völler’s record of 72, while he also became the first player to score 16 goals in a major European international qualifying campaign as Poland booked a World Cup spot in Russia with ease. Renowned as a penalty expert – he has missed just three from 38 in his entire career, including converting all 10 this year – Lewandowski has also scored an unusually high number of goals with his left foot (11) in 2017 in comparison with previous seasons, including the winner against Cologne last week and in the recent Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain. However, his failure to score against Stuttgart on Saturday means he has only one more opportunity to increase his tally, with former club Borussia Dortmund due at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday for a DFB-Pokal tie. PSG’s Edinson Cavani goes into his final match of the year against Caen on Wednesday after ending a run of five matches without scoring against Rennes at the weekend. Predominantly right-footed (just four of his goals this year have been converted by his weaker foot), Cavani’s exploits are all the more remarkable given that he now shares penalty duties with Neymar following their high-profile disagreement during the win over Lyon in September. His miss against Troyes at the end of last month came just three days after Neymar converted from the spot against Monaco and would have given the Uruguayan a slender lead going into his final match of the year. Perhaps fittingly, however, it is likely to be Saturday’s clásico that will determine who comes out on top. Messi equalled another of Müller’s seemingly insurmountable tallies when he scored his 525th goal for Barcelona against Villarreal this month – a record number for a single club in Europe’s major leagues. Had one of his three efforts that hit the woodwork against Deportivo La Coruña on Sunday (not to mention the penalty saved by Rubén) gone in, he would already be out on his own, although perhaps it was fate that it should go down to the final match of the year. Failure from the spot against Deportivo also meant Messi is the first Barça player to miss three penalties in a calendar year since Samuel Eto’o in 2005, but with 17 assists to add to his 53 goals for club and country, he remains by far the most productive of the five contenders. Only his former team-mate Neymar (33 goals and 29 assists) comes close to matching the Argentina forward’s overall tally of being directly involved in 70 goals in 2017. By way of contrast, Ronaldo has reached 53 goals having made four fewer appearances – incidentally his lowest total since 2010 – and contributed 13 assists in leading Real Madrid to five trophies this year.

Nor will it safeguard America’s national security. Instead, the national security strategy which Donald Trump unveiled on Monday is an attempt to patch together a worldview and corresponding plan of action from the US president’s public statements – plus the better judgment of those around him. It is the grown-ups (who remain in the room for now, at least) creating a veneer of credibility for this erratic and dangerous administration and attempting to build some sort of framework for decision-making; it is unlikely to be observed. Producing the document is a legal requirement. Abiding by it is not. Many former officials acknowledge they paid scant attention to its predecessors. It is in large part a paper exercise, but not meaningless. At best, it can force an administration to step away from the urgent but ultimately less important matters to look at the big picture, and to consider how multiple and often competing priorities relate. At other times – as with the George W Bush administration before the Iraq War – it lays out US thinking. This administration has no body of thought; merely a crazy-quilt of ideas and assertions, as is evident from the frequency with which its members contradict each other. The strategy is Trumpian in its brash branding: “AMERICA is DETERMINED to WIN!” he wrote on Twitter. It is Trumpian in its money-mindedness, skewing towards economic issues, and dropping climate change from the list of global threats. It is Trumpian in its general tone of both gloom and hawkishness – with its declaration that Russia and China are “revisionist” powers trying to “shape a world antithetical to US values and interests”. The criticism of Moscow is striking because it is so rare. But it was not echoed in Mr Trump’s remarks. The document accuses Russia of interfering in the domestic political affairs of other countries without mentioning the evidence of its meddling in the 2016 election, which the president rejects, let alone Robert Mueller’s investigation into his campaign’s alleged collusion, which he denies. He and his supporters have attacked the inquiry relentlessly. Few expect a tougher stance on Russia in practice. The remarks on China are milder than predicted – and the document acknowledges the need to cooperate with both countries. Beijing will wait to see what, if any, action is taken before responding. But the underlying issue is undeniable. China is growing more powerful and more confident in its power. It wants to redraw international rules accordingly. This is the hardest of challenges for other powers, most of all the US; and it is complicated by the fact that America still needs China in handling issues such as North Korea. Moscow and Beijing’s own actions have provoked much of the alarm and hostility they now face. The Obama administration did not find an adequate response, and its hopes of resetting the relationships and achieving wide-ranging, constructive engagement proved doomed. But it was serious in examining the problems and it never imagined that personal chemistry or a few bellowed threats would solve them. In contrast, Mr Trump has talked tough but has smoothed the path for China, diminishing his nation through his bigotry, ignorance, bluster and unreliability. Needing to strengthen alliances, he has frayed them. Ditching the flawed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement without offering an alternative vision of US engagement in the region left the field open. His bellicose rhetoric on Pyongyang has frightened old friends. He has hectored Japan and South Korea about economic and other disagreements, threatening to tear up the free trade deal with Seoul. Further afield, he cosies up to authoritarian leaders and appears disengaged from – even disdainful of – those usually regarded as sharing US values. Meanwhile, some of those around him continue their attempts to normalise an abnormal administration. If the world is lucky the grown-ups will be at least partially successful – dodging a trade war with China (not in either country’s interest) or the much more frightening prospect of an actual war with North Korea or Iran. They carry the weight of Atlas, but their task is Sisyphean in its unending nature. A strategy requires coherence and at least the intention of consistency in carrying it through. Neither aspect is possible while Mr Trump remains in office. Whim, half-digested advice from all-comers, wishful thinking and reflex reactions will continue to carry the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/28/nora-lum-awkwafina-genitalia-feminist-message","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Awkwafina: ‘I was just rapping about my genitalia – not making a feminist message’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/28/nora-lum-awkwafina-genitalia-feminist-message","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/28/nora-lum-awkwafina-genitalia-feminist-message","fields":{"headline":"Awkwafina: ‘I was just rapping about my genitalia – not making a feminist message’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For most actors, a supporting role alongside Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett doesn’t usually land on their plate four years after starting out on YouTube – as a rapper. Yet that is exactly what has happened to Nora Lum, AKA Awkwafina. The 29-year-old Queens-born multihyphenate has gone from a job at an air-conditioning company and making beats on the side to being the scrappy wingman to Bullock and Blanchett’s Pitt and Clooney in forthcoming gender-swapped caper Ocean’s 8. This is no small feat. And Lum is as surprised as anyone. “There are definitely people who are confused that I was cast – I was confused. They are a group of idols. But we got along swimmingly.” While Lum has, since childhood, had an effortless ability to make people laugh. (When asked which characters she would have loved to play, she names My Cousin Vinny, “because we have a similar body type.” That is a good indication of what makes her tick.) But she never really planned on capitalising on it. “I never even expected to be popular on YouTube. I’ve got a lot of people telling me: ‘Oh my God, you’re going to be so famous,’ but people have been telling me that since I had, like, 300 views on YouTube. It’s all subjective …” That might be true, but it is also to downplay the tremendous potential on display in those videos. Because there really aren’t that many of them. Awkwafina has precisely one viral hit, one album, and one high-profile collab under her belt: respectively, 2013’s My Vag, 2014’s Yellow Ranger and 2016’s Green Tea, with the standup comedian Margaret Cho. As an actor she’s been in a documentary, three TV shows and a couple of indie comedies. Though we shouldn’t neglect to mention Tawk, the excellently unhinged self-made webchat show she hosted from various bodegas around NYC with a boombox-wielding, octogenarian sidekick. My Vag, the viral hit, perhaps most succinctly showcases what makes her so watchable. She made it on a whim, in a direct albeit strangely belated response to Mickey Avalon’s 2006 My Dick. It’s an epic boast battle that – with bonkers rhymes – pits her bits against a rival’s. “My vag like a operatic ballad / Your vag like Grandpa’s cabbage […] My vag, like tastin’ heaven / Your vag manages a 7-Eleven”. The track understandably caught people’s attention – not all gleeful; some feminists took exception – and gave the rapper a greater understanding of the platform she had stumbled on. “I didn’t mean My Vag to be a feminist message,” she says. “I was just rapping about my own genitalia.” Awkwafina, who achieved a double major in women’s studies and journalism, is unafraid to speak her mind. And being Asian-American with Chinese and South Korean heritage means that just doing what she does is a political statement. “The existence of someone like me, especially from my earlier videos, when YouTube was a landscape where not a lot of people saw an Asian-American woman being entirely unashamed – save for Cho – is in itself provocative,” she says. This might go some way to explaining the buzz around her, too: she’s in the right place at the right time. Alongside Ocean’s 8, she has a starring role in what is poised to be one of next year’s more groundbreaking features: the screen adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s best-selling novel, Crazy Rich Asians. Scheduled for release in August 2018, it boasts an all-Asian cast, headed up by Constance Wu, breakout star of sitcom Fresh off the Boat. “These are Asian-American stories – just as American as anything else. I’m an Asian-American kid who didn’t have that when I was growing up.” Of course, as Lum is quick to point out, Crazy Rich Asians is a gamble, because no one knows how Asian leads will do at the box office. Given Lum’s track record, a gamble is probably what suits her best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/16/a-punchers-chance-amateur-fight-event-offers-a-desperate-swing-at-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"A puncher's chance: amateur fight event offers a desperate swing at glory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/a-punchers-chance-amateur-fight-event-offers-a-desperate-swing-at-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/a-punchers-chance-amateur-fight-event-offers-a-desperate-swing-at-glory","fields":{"headline":"A puncher's chance: amateur fight event offers a desperate swing at glory","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"George White is eating pizza in the living area of his one-bedroom trailer in Princeton, West Virginia. He seems calm, which is striking. In a few hours, White will be fighting a man who is a foot taller than him in front of thousands of people. White will be taking part in Rough N’ Rowdy, an amateur fighting competition based in his home state. It’s a chance for men from the local area to climb into a ring and pummel each other for three minutes. Rough N’ Rowdy is nominally a boxing competition, but given the fighters don’t have to be in good shape – and most aren’t – and aren’t allowed to have any formal boxing training, it more resembles a barroom brawl. In this part of the country, the event is a big deal. “Around here there’s really nothing to do,” said George White. “You’re basically sitting around doing nothing unless you’re doing something illegal. You either fight or sell drugs and this is what we choose to do.” With his spiky hair and sloping shoulders, White does not look like your typical boxer. He is stocky, but he’s never had any formal training and has never fought in a ring before. He doesn’t run or lift weights. At 19 years old, he is one of the youngest fighters, and at 5ft 9in and 205lb, he is the shortest man in Rough N’ Rowdy’s heavyweight division. Despite this, White decided to challenge the tallest man in the heavyweight division: 25-year-old Chance Fudge. Fudge is 6ft 9in tall, and works as a personal trainer. This doesn’t seem to faze White, who sees this as an opportunity to make a name for himself. “I feel like I’m going to be the center of attention because I’m fighting a giant,” he says. • • • Rough N’ Rowdy is technically a boxing competition, and the fighters wear gloves. But unlike most amateur fights, competitors do not wear headgear, and the rounds are shorter than standard boxing matches, to encourage aggressive brawling. White would be fighting in Bluefield, West Virginia, about 10 miles from Princeton. Fighters must live within a 75-mile radius of the event, and the brawls draw scores of competitors and thousands of spectators. One of White’s motivations is the $1,000 prize money. White recently lost his job washing dishes, and he and his mother, Angie White, have been surviving on food stamps. White is not the only person struggling here; the state has the third lowest median income in the US. As the coalmining industry has declined young people have been leaving West Virginia to work elsewhere. Their trailer park is on the outskirts of town, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The mountains loom over, with leafless trees lending an eerie, ominous atmosphere. Princeton is not a town on the up: the median household income, at $30,523, is more than $20,000 less than the US average, and the 6,400 population has been in decline since the 1970s. “That money is mainly going to be for her when I win,” White said of his potential earnings. “I can pay a few months’ rent up on this place, pay the water up a bit, pay the electric up a bit.” But beyond money, White was also motivated by the potential exposure. In November, the Rough N’ Rowdy contest was bought by the website Barstool Sports. The controversial satirical website is perhaps best known for having a partnership with ESPN torn up in October after it emerged Barstool’s CEO, Dave Portnoy, had called ESPN sportscaster Sam Ponder a “slut” in a blogpost. Portnoy also stated that Ponder’s role was to “make men hard”. He said he stands by the latter statement. Portnoy had decided to buy Rough N’ Rowdy to live stream it after someone sent him footage of some of the fights. In a video posted before the event, he referred to the competitors as “rednecks” and described the event as “hilarious”, which didn’t seem entirely fair on people like White, who wanted his boxing skills, rather than his background, to be the subject of interest. “It’s comedy to a degree,” Portnoy said. “But it’s not because of them. If you watch any fight that is just wild action, there is definitely the entertainment value to me. It would be no different I don’t think [than] if you’re looking at, like, Jersey Shore on MTV or you’re looking at Floribama. There is that aspect that people like to watch. Because – I don’t want to say it’s the circus – but it’s colourful people.” Portnoy said he was expecting 30,000 people to pay for the live stream. At $9.99 – $15 if purchased on the day of the fight – Barstool Sports was looking at an income of $300,000 through the pay-per-view fees alone. Given the fighters would earn only $1,000 if they won their weight class, it left a sour taste in the mouth. And given Portnoy’s views on these people he was making money from, I asked if his venture could come across as exploitative. He disagreed. “No, because they were doing it anyway,” Portnoy said. “I don’t feel like we’re leading them on, primarily because this has been going on for decades before this event. And we just are adding the pay-per-view.” • • • On the afternoon of the fight, I traveled with White to his friend Ronnie Barrett’s house, in a wood high in the hills of Princeton. Barrett, fighting in the bantamweight class, also hoped to get spotted and maybe even turn pro. The pair had been training together for months. Barrett, who is 26 and works as a certified nursing assistant in a nursing home, said he runs two miles a day, alongside sparring with White and others in his cramped basement. He pointed to some blood on the floor to prove it. “It’s about the only trade you can have under your belt coming from this town,” he said of his fighting. “And everyone that buys this pay per view is gonna see me. Everybody that buys it is going to see that I’m a cut above the rest of these guys. “It’s going to let a lot of people realise that there is somebody with skills and talent in this piece of shit town. That’s the biggest motivator, that’s what’s gonna get the eyes on me.” Barrett had already fought in Rough N’ Rowdy twice. He won his first fight both times, but lost the second. It’s an elimination tournament, one loss and you’re out. Barrett had high hopes this time round. “Make no mistake. I’m gonna win,” he said. It was bitterly cold, but White and Barrett braved the elements to train outside on Barrett’s porch. Barrett, at 6ft 2in and 136lb, is whippet thin with short brown hair. He stretched and jumped rope for a couple of minutes while White punched the bag. Barrett’s brother, Harold “Savage” Roberts, had joined the pair to oversee their workout. White was battering the bag ferociously, but some of Savage’s 11th-hour advice didn’t inspire a great deal of confidence for that night’s fight. “You need to keep your chin down,” Savage told White, who was merrily pounding away at the bag with his head in the air. “And put your gloves up.” It was difficult to see how someone’s technique could be overhauled on the afternoon of the fight, but White was bullish about his chances. “I’m going to break his ribs,” White said of his opponent. “Everyone of them.” • • • Rough N’ Rowdy was started 21 years ago by Chris Smith, a former heavyweight boxer from West Virginia. His fighting career ended at 24 when he injured his right shoulder, at which point he started hosting amateur brawls, mostly in West Virginia. “It’s kind of like part of the local heritage. It’s part of a right of passage for a lot of guys around here,” Smith said. Smith thinks a lot of people fight for local bragging rights and recognition. “In one weekend they can come out swinging and be a well-known person in the community, just like that.” On the night of the fight, contestants gathered at the Brushfork Armory, a looming arena which seats up to 2,000 people. There was a boxing ring in the middle of the floor, with tables surrounding it for the fight judges and Smith, who would be commentating. Some of the fighters wore calf-high boxing boots, others had silky shorts, and a couple even had theatrical gowns. At the other end of the scale, one man was wearing denim jeans. White showed no sign of nerves. He was telling anyone who would listen that the hulking 6ft 9in Fudge was much smaller and skinnier than he’d imagined. Fudge, who was wearing a tight grey vest that showed off his bulging chest and shoulders, was baffled as to why White had chosen to fight him. “I don’t know why he would do that. That’s not too smart,” he said. By 7pm, the arena was pretty much full. Chris Smith, in his role as announcer and commentator, was blasting out a playlist of motivational music, including Eye of the Tiger. • • • The first match started at 7.30pm, to wild cheers from the crowd fuelled by Bud Light and Michelob Ultra. The two fighters charged at each other as soon as the bell rang, throwing wild punches. Not many were landing. It continued this way for the full three rounds, with the judges deciding the winner. In Rough N’ Rowdy a round is only one minute long – compared with three minutes for professional and most amateur fights. It lends itself to more frantic fighting, as people desperately try to knock each other out in a short time span. Soon after, two giant men – each 6ft 6in, and weighing more than 350lb – tested the strength of the surface for about 15 seconds before one of them got knocked out. Another was hopelessly mismatched against someone who actually looked like a professional boxer; he was swiftly knocked unconscious and had to be examined by a doctor. The man wearing jeans battered his opponent into submission. White was summoned to the ring just before 10pm. He was still relaxed. In the crowd, his mother Angie, was not. “I’m a little nervous,” she said. “That’s my baby. I mean, that’s my baby.” Angie White said she was powerless to stop her son from fighting. But she also gave a new insight into why White was so determined to make a name for himself. “On his dad’s deathbed, he promised his dad he would take care of me. And that’s why he tells me he’s going to do this and win the money.” White clambered into the ring and raised his hands to rouse the crowd. They cheered. Fudge stood quietly in his corner, eyes on his opponent. The bell rang. Although Fudge had a huge height advantage, it was soon apparent that he wasn’t very skilled at boxing. He threw looping punches, which White easily blocked. Alas, White wasn’t on top form either – he hammered away at Fudge but few of his punches connected. At the end of the round, it was unclear if either of them had actually been hit. But White already looked exhausted. He slumped on his stool, face bright red, and desperately tried to catch his breath. When he went out for the second round his lack of physical preparation became apparent. He could barely lift his arms. The referee insisted he quit the fight. White stumbled out of the ring, sweat pouring down his temples, and slumped on a bench away to the side. “I didn’t expect him to be as quick as he was,” he said. “I gotta learn to keep my hands up better and I need to train cardio a hell of a lot, man. I got winded way too fast.” Barrett didn’t win either; the fight went the full three rounds, but the three judges unanimously scored it for Barrett’s foe. It was the third tournament in a row that Barrett had lost, but he said he’d be back. White is planning the same. There isn’t much else to do around here, he said, and there also isn’t any other way to swiftly earn $1,000 to fulfill the promise he made to his dad. For them, these competitions are not comedy. They’re not a joke. Here in the deep south of West Virginia, the fights offer something that is otherwise in short supply: hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/21/snowy-hydro-2-viable-government-backed-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:08:32Z","webTitle":"Snowy Hydro 2.0 is viable but will cost billions more than predicted, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/snowy-hydro-2-viable-government-backed-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/snowy-hydro-2-viable-government-backed-study","fields":{"headline":"Snowy Hydro 2.0 is viable but will cost billions more than predicted, study says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A feasibility study into the proposed expansion of the Snowy Hydro scheme has given the project the green light, but says it will cost billions of dollars more than predicted. The study, supported by Malcolm Turnbull, found the proposed expansion was both technically and financially feasible, and that Snowy Hydro would be able to finance the project itself. But it says the current estimate for the project is between $3.8bn and $4.5bn, more than the $2bn estimated by Turnbull when he promoted the project earlier this year. It has withheld details of the cost estimate, saying they include commercially confidential information, but says the larger capital costs take into account the need for “extensive reinforcement” of the project’s proposed structures owing to the challenging geological conditions that were uncovered during the geotechnical drilling program. If construction gets under way shortly the expanded Snowy Hydro could begin operating from 2024. The $29m feasibility study – led by Snowy Hydro’s former engineering unit SMEC, now owned by Singapore-based Surbana Jurong – was released on Thursday. “Snowy Hydro 2.0 is a nation-building project,” a spokesman for the prime minister said before its release. “It will not only deliver a more affordable and reliable energy system but will also generate jobs and grow our economy. “The feasibility study clearly demonstrates that Snowy 2.0 is a viable pumped hydro project that will futureproof the National Electricity Market (NEM), helping stabilise the system and deliver lower prices.” The Snowy Mountains hydro scheme, built between 1949 and 1974, is made up of 16 dams, seven power stations and 225km of tunnels. The proposal to expand the scheme – dubbed Snowy Hydro 2.0 – involves boring 27km of tunnels linking the Talbingo dam, at an elevation of 552 metres, to the Tantangara reservoir, at 1,233 metres, so energy can be generated by pumping water uphill to the higher reservoir when energy is cheap (say, in the middle of the night) and releasing it back downhill when energy is in high demand and prices are higher. It will expand the Snowy Hydro scheme by 2,000 megawatts, enough to power 500,000 homes, adding to the scheme’s 4,100MW capacity. Snowy 2.0 could run for over seven days continuously or 15 days at times of peak demand without “recharging”. An expert on climate change mitigation and clean energy warned this month the all-in cost of the project could be as much as $6bn or $7bn, once transmission upgrades to transport the stored energy were taken into account. “I wouldn’t expect [the feasibility study] to have a positive NPV [net present value],” a Monash University engineering senior lecturer, Roger Dargaville, told Fairfax Media. “I think it would be a loss-making venture but that being said lots of big infrastructure projects don’t make money so that doesn’t have to be a hurdle.” In the shadow of a cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, the Turnbull government released a long-anticipated review of its climate policies that revealed it would be loosening the current safeguard mechanism that sets limits on pollution. The late-year release of the climate policy review, which pointed to allowing Australian businesses to increase their emissions as their production grows, came as new figures confirmed Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions were the highest on record when emissions from land use change were excluded. Projections also suggested the country would increase its emissions all the way to 2030 and beyond. The new official emissions data confirmed projections produced exclusively for the Guardian six months ago. In both 2015 and 2016, the government quietly released this data in the days before Christmas showing rising emissions. This year they were released almost a week before Christmas. Labor and the Greens have blasted new annual emissions projections, and the Turnbull government’s review of its climate policies, characterising the Coalition’s action on climate change as woefully inadequate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/jacinda-ardern-takes-part-in-new-zealands-nationwide-secret-santa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T02:13:43Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern takes part in New Zealand's nationwide Secret Santa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/jacinda-ardern-takes-part-in-new-zealands-nationwide-secret-santa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/jacinda-ardern-takes-part-in-new-zealands-nationwide-secret-santa","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern takes part in New Zealand's nationwide Secret Santa","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New Zealand’s prime minister has taken part in the country’s nationwide Secret Santa. New Zealand Post has been running the scheme, in which complete strangers send each other gifts in the post, for the past seven years. Each festive season New Zealanders send and receive gifts, sharing pictures of the results on social media using the hashtag #NZsecretsanta. This year is the first time the nation’s leader has taken part – recently elected Ardern said that being a “ridiculous lover of Christmas” she couldn’t resist. On Tuesday, Ardern posted a video on Twitter showing her opening the gift she had received – a homemade Christmas tree decoration. The gift from her allotted anonymous giver was delayed, so she said a “Super Secret Santa stepped up” to send her a present. The gift originally meant for Ardern arrived on Wednesday, leaving the prime minister with two presents. Ardern posted a second video showing her opening an artwork by an Auckland school student. On the same day, the gift sent by Ardern reached its destination, with the recipient Rebecca Terry posting a thank you on Twitter. As well as a book and some body cream, the gift included an Apec pin and a card that gave away the identity of the sender. Ardern replied saying she was glad the present, “from your not very Secret Santa”, had made it. Other participants also shared the joy on Twitter. The game was started in 2010 by Hamilton man Sam Elton-Walters, who matched strangers on Twitter to send Secret Santa gifts to each other in time for Christmas. Participants would drop hints of their interests and hobbies via tweets – or, more directly, write lists of gifts they would like to receive. When the endeavour became too big for Elton-Walters to manage, he handed the torch in 2013 to New Zealand Post which assigned a team of 10 “elves” to run it. In 2017 New Zealand Post said more than 3,600 people had taken part. In 2016, 8% of those involved were “Bad Santas” – participants who registered to receive gifts, but failed to send any."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/20/steve-smith-edges-closer-to-bradman-with-new-icc-rankings-high","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T00:29:51Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith edges closer to Bradman with new ICC rankings high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/20/steve-smith-edges-closer-to-bradman-with-new-icc-rankings-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/20/steve-smith-edges-closer-to-bradman-with-new-icc-rankings-high","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith edges closer to Bradman with new ICC rankings high","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steve Smith’s imperious Ashes form has seen him move level with Len Hutton and closer to Don Bradman at the top of the ICC’s Test player rankings system. The Australian captain’s 239 in the series-winning third Test in Perth saw him reach a career-best 945 points, just 16 shy the highest ever rating achieved by Bradman back in 1948. Smith’s double century at the Waca, which helped Australia to a series victory over England after three Tests, propelled him to a new high after his knock of 143 in the first Test had lifted him to 941 points – equal fifth best of all time. A brief dip after returns of 40 and six in Adelaide followed, but his innings in Perth took him above the likes of Peter May, Jack Hobbs and Ricky Ponting, level with former England opener Hutton, and closer to Bradman’s benchmark – set after a stunning run of Test scores against India in 1948. Sir Clyde Walcott, Sir Viv Richards, Sir Garfield Sobers and Kumar Sangakkara complete an illustrious top 10. Smith is also second only to Bradman in terms of career batting average for players with over 20 Test matches under their belt and he has been the world’s No1-ranked batsman for nearly two years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/britain-and-eu-clash-over-status-of-gibraltar-under-transition-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T00:27:13Z","webTitle":"Britain and EU clash over status of Gibraltar under transition deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/britain-and-eu-clash-over-status-of-gibraltar-under-transition-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/britain-and-eu-clash-over-status-of-gibraltar-under-transition-deal","fields":{"headline":"Britain and EU clash over status of Gibraltar under transition deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain has turned its fire on the EU over its insistence that Theresa May must come to an arrangement with Spain over the future of Gibraltar, if the rock is to be covered by a deal on a transition period. The EU effectively backed Spain in the centuries-old territorial dispute in April, when its guidelines outlining their approach to the Brexit negotiations insisted Gibraltar would be outside any future trade deal with the UK unless an agreement was reached in advance with Madrid. Last month the Guardian revealed that this position included any agreement with the EU on a transition period, to cushion Britain’s exit out of the bloc on 29 March 2019. The latest EU document on bloc’s negotiating position, due to be published on Wednesday, is said to confirm that position. A UK government source, however, accused Brussels of taking an inconsistent and contradictory position on Gibraltar, over which Spain and the UK have been in dispute for centuries. “If Britain’s overseas territories aren’t included in the transition guidelines it would be a total contradiction in the EU’s own position,” the source said. “The April guidelines made clear that the article 50 negotiations applied to our overseas territories, and that transition is part of that process. They are also explicit a transition period should use current terms, structures and the acquis [common rights and obligations that binds EU states] – consistency and clarity must flow both ways.” The British government has not made any approach to Madrid over the future of Gibraltar, Spanish government sources have said. Spain believes the British cabinet, which is wrestling with how to define its vision of a future trading relationship with the EU, has bigger issues to deal with than the fate of the 28,000 people who live on the rock. “I think the situation with Gibraltar is crystal clear,” a source had told the Guardian. “This is what we are telling the Gibraltarians. If you want to have your existing status, you will have to talk with us.” Last week the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, attending a summit in Brussels, told reporters: “Whatever future agreement between the EU and the UK, there has to be an agreement between Spain and the UK for that to apply to Gibraltar. We also asked that this applies to the transition period.” Gibraltar’s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, has previously suggested that a hard Brexit would pose an “existential threat”. Such is the economic importance to Gibraltar of retaining the rights of EU membership that just 4% of the population of Gibraltar voted to leave in the UK’s 2016 referendum. In October, May claimed she would be fighting for a deal that “works for Gibraltar as well as the United Kingdom”, in response to concerns expressed in the House of Commons that Downing Street was willing to abandon the territory in its effort to secure an EU-UK trade deal. Clare Moody, the Labour MEP representing Gibraltar, said: “The British government have a moral obligation to ensure that Gibraltar is included in any transition deal should we leave the European Union. “Leaving the customs union without a transition would be disastrous for somewhere that relies so heavily on its relationship with the EU. “Theresa May and her government are the only ones who can make this happen, and it’s time for them to step up. If they fail, it will be Gibraltar that suffers more than anyone else.” The town of Gibraltar, its castle and port were ceded to the UK under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but the terms of the agreement have been long disputed and Spain has not hidden its determination to bring the rock back under its flag."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/30/the-nuclear-confrontation-by-rodric-braithwaite-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T07:30:06Z","webTitle":"Armageddon and Paranoia by Rodric Braithwaite review – the nuclear confrontation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/30/the-nuclear-confrontation-by-rodric-braithwaite-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/30/the-nuclear-confrontation-by-rodric-braithwaite-review","fields":{"headline":"Armageddon and Paranoia by Rodric Braithwaite review – the nuclear confrontation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As a lifelong diplomat whose last foreign post was as Britain’s ambassador to the Kremlin in the Soviet Union’s final years, Rodric Braithwaite acquired decades of insight into UK and US policy on nuclear weapons. In policy debates in Whitehall as well as in meetings with Soviet officials, he took part in numerous discussions on arms control. He has also read a phenomenal amount of the literature on “the bomb” and, unlike most other western researchers, has studied the work of Russian analysts. This includes the memoirs of physicists involved in the Soviet nuclear programme, many of which have not yet been translated into English. Personal experience plus careful study have given him a remarkable platform from which he brilliantly dissects the ethical dilemmas facing the scientists who developed the weapons as well as the policymakers who framed strategies for their potential use, both groups knowing full well that they could bring humankind to Armageddon. There was equivalence on the western and Soviet sides and Braithwaite is absolutely fair in describing this. He is equally even-handed when he comes to explain each side’s paranoia. Policymakers routinely accepted the worst-case analysis of the other’s arsenal, confusing capabilities with intentions and suspecting that the adversary was trying to sneak out of his proclaimed acceptance of parity by secretly developing a first-strike potential. With public access to official papers now available, Braithwaite writes that within months of Hiroshima the US drew up contingency plans to use nuclear bombs on the USSR to “deter or reverse any Soviet adventure in Europe”. Yet no proof has emerged that Stalin ever had such plans, he writes. Nothing changed with his successors. “There is no evidence that the Russians ever hoped to incorporate western Europe by military means,” Braithwaite adds, but western planners were bound to consider Soviet deployments as a potential invasion force since, as Anatoly Dobrynin, Moscow’s longtime ambassador in Washington, commented in his diary, “we were building up our nuclear and conventional arms in Europe beyond any reasonable measure”. Braithwaite is especially interesting on the “special relationship” with the US, pointing out that the US initially tried to cut Britain out of any joint research on nuclear weapons. Successive British governments, Labour as well as Conservative, wanted the bomb because they did not trust Washington to defend Britain in all circumstances. The bomb also gave them, they felt, prestige. Braithwaite makes that last point in a bracket and with no attribution since he remains nothing if not discreet, rarely alluding to inside knowledge beyond a few references to his own “unpublished diary”. As a career civil servant, Braithwaite had more affinity with the decision-making class than with street protesters. He has little to say about the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND)although he mentions that MI5 for 25 years described it as “communist-controlled”. This was an extraordinary intelligence blunder which Braithwaite merely puts in a footnote. He ignores European Nuclear Disarmament (END), which had links with eastern European peace campaigners, and makes only one brief mention of its leading light, EP Thompson. Instead, he repeatedly stresses that the massive anti-nuclear demonstrations in the UK and US had no effect in changing government policy, seeming to find satisfaction in the fact that all this public noise was, in his view, unsuccessful. This reaction is baffling since Braithwaite shows considerable sympathy for the top policymakers who, in the psychological comfort of losing responsibility on retirement, came out against the bomb, including former US secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. If you admire the sinner who repenteth, why be so dismissive of the scruffy saints who went marching past with banners that displayed the same message? Braithwaite ends his book with the conclusion that “whatever their nationality, the politicians were trapped in a web of inexorable logic. The nuclear weapon could not be uninvented. If their opponent had it or was getting it they too had to have it if they were not to fail in their patriotic duty”. That is not wholly true. Earlier in the same chapter he mentions that Canada, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil were capable of acquiring the skills necessary to develop their own nuclear weapons but renounced them. He could have added that Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, which already had them on their territory, gave them up. It might have been useful to examine the reasons why all these states went non-nuclear and the way their publics reacted. The evidence would suggest that in some contexts it need not be a politician’s “patriotic duty” to have the bomb. Abandoning the nuclear option may make better national sense and command broad political support. The key issue in any country is the perception of the threats it faces. Could there be alternative ways of defending or insuring against them without resort to a nuclear arsenal? One man about whom Braithwaite writes with admiration is Joseph Rotblat, a Polish émigré physicist who worked on the Manhattan project to develop the US bomb but after Hitler’s defeat became a campaigner for nuclear disarmament and set up the Pugwash conferences of international scientists. (He won the Nobel peace prize in 1995). Based in Britain, Rotblat was a member of the Alternative Defence Commission, a group of British scientists, academics and peace campaigners, which produced two reports in the 1980s that looked at the threats facing the UK and analysed how defence and foreign policy could meet them satisfactorily without nuclear weapons (Full disclosure: I was a member of the commission, too). Many of the ideas the commission put forward – “sufficiency’, “non-offensive or non-provocative defence” and “interdependence” – emerged in the policies advocated by Gorbachev’s advisers during perestroika. It remains an irony that CND and END were attacked as dupes or fronts for Moscow while influence actually went in the opposite direction. Even under Brezhnev there were hints of this. The Kremlin’s 1982 declaration that it was adopting a strategy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons mirrored the western peace movement’s position. Whitehall and Washington may have been stoney-faced towards peace movement demands; Moscow was less so. • To order Armageddon and Paranoia for £21.25 (RRP £25) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The British Horseracing Authority’s disciplinary panel heard a claim that Morrison had been the victim of a “malicious” plot and should therefore not be penalised under the BHA’s strict liability anti-doping rules. Morrison’s four-year-old filly Our Little Sister returned a positive test for the anabolic steroid nandrolone after finishing last in a race at Wolverhampton on 14 January, the first positive for an anabolic steroid in British racing since 2013. At the start of what is expected to be a two-day hearing in London, the panel heard that Morrison concedes he is in breach of the strict liability rule, and the hearing will proceed to decide what penalty, if any, should be imposed for an offence which has an entry-level penalty of a two-year ban and a range, depending on mitigating or aggravating factors, from one to 10 years. The hearing opened with the presentation of a note prepared by the BHA to outline the issues in the case, including Morrison’s claim he should not be penalised “because he says he can prove on the balance of probabilities that the substance was administered to the horse maliciously”. The BHA contends any deliberate administration would still demand a penalty owing to the strict liability nature of the rules, while conceding that proof of malicious administration would “clearly amount to considerable mitigation on behalf of Mr Morrison” when it is determined. The authority also insists Our Little Sister was randomly selected for drug testing, rather than on the basis of intelligence received, which it says “fatally undermines the contention for a malicious intervention”. Witnesses who gave evidence included Greg Pearson, the stipendiary steward at Wolverhampton on 14 January, who told the panel that while he could not remember with 100% certainty whether he had selected which horse at the meeting would be randomly selected, there was a “strong likelihood” he was responsible as he is usually the first official to arrive at the course. Pearson also said his computer records confirmed Our Little Sister was randomly selected for testing. The panel also heard a dispute between witnesses giving scientific evidence on the probable date, or range of dates, when Our Little Sister was administered with nandrolone. Stuart Paine, an associate professor of pharmacology at Nottingham University giving evidence on behalf of the BHA, told the hearing that, in his opinion, it was only possible to say the drug had been administered by intramuscular injection “between mid-December 2016 and mid-January 2017”. His evidence was disputed by Thomas Tobin, a professor of toxicology at the University of Kentucky, who gave his testimony via Skype. Tobin insisted the date of administration could be narrowed to the middle of Paine’s one-month window. The panel also started to hear evidence from Tim Miller, the leader of the BHA team investigating the case. Miller will conclude his testimony on Wednesday, when Morrison is also expected to give evidence.

On the company’s proposal, only 800 employees would depart and the others would resume the fight against Amazon’s invasion of the toy market. The PPF, however, is not to blame for this mess. Its hands are tied. The PPF’s jobis to look out for the interests of pensioners in Toys R Us’s defined benefit scheme and bargain accordingly. It has put forward a plan that looks more than reasonable: Toys R Us, as the price of support for its self-help plan, should put £9m into a pension fund that is showing a £30m deficit. The company pleads it hasn’t got the money, a cry that raises many questions, most of them identified by Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee. What on Earth was going on when the UK division of Toys R Us wrote off a £584m loan to the US parent, which has entered bankruptcy proceedings? And why was the UK managing director of Toys R Us being paid £1.3m last year? For now, the PPF must contain itself to the immediate question of Toys R Us’s survival prospects in the UK. If the company – actually – can find £9m, it should cough up. If the cupboard really is bare, then the self-help plan may be doomed anyway and carrying on could make matters worse for the PPF. So-called company voluntary arrangements, of the sort Toys R Us is seeking, do not have a great record of success. The best short-term solution is for Toys R Us’s management to turn somersaults to find the £9m. If it’s too late to ask the US bankruptcy courts to waive annual royalty payments of £8m-ish for a year, then look for a bridging loan or find other means. Managements cannot just assume that the PPF, when pushed, will agree to anything. Whatever happens at Thursday’s CVA hearing, that huge loan write-off needs to be examined by the Pensions Regulator. There may be an innocent explanation but, on the face of it, it is extraordinary that the trustees of the pension fund and the regulator were kept in the dark. One lesson from the BHS pensions debacle was that the regulator needs more powers to intervene in substantial transactions. The government, which hasn’t got further than a white paper, needs to hurry up. Tales from the City Which version of events do you prefer? Did Donald Brydon, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange, score a thumping four-to-one majority as shareholders rallied to his support to put a decisive end to the fallout from Xavier Rolet’s departure as chief executive? Or did he achieve a hollow victory that leaves his authority damaged? A fair analysis probably lies somewhere between those extremes. In the weird world of City voting, where mega majorities are the norm, 79% support counts as an in-between result. Anything less than 80% these days gets a company on a “blacklist” where it is obliged to explain what it plans to do to improve relations with shareholders. The LSE will now suffer that indignity. The angry hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn, who bizarrely didn’t bother to turn up to a meeting he had called, was crowing about the blacklist point afterwards. Fair enough. Yet let’s not lose sight of the wider picture. Hohn’s TCI fund set out to keep Rolet at the LSE until 2021 but only hastened his departure. The chief executive went last month, instead of staying until a successor could be recruited next year. Hohn can’t put a positive gloss on that outcome. He failed to achieve his main goal. Brydon’s mistake – actually, the mistake of all the non-executive directors – was smaller. The LSE’s board should have said more in the first place about its reasons for wishing to replace Rolet after nine successful years. The chairman is correct to say boards can’t be expected to put “all relevant information” in the public domain. Equally, however, there is a skill in saying just enough to prevent Hohn-style explosions. Brydon is now safe to lead the hiring of a new chief executive and carries the confidence of the regulators, which is what matters after Tuesday’s vote. Will he, though, make it all the way to April 2019, the previously agreed compromise date for his own departure? If he’s determined to do so, he probably can. Do not be surprised, however, if late 2018 is deemed a better fudge. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/19/ben-duckett-omitted-england-lions-squad-west-indies","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T22:00:05Z","webTitle":"Ben Duckett omitted from England Lions squad to tour West Indies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/19/ben-duckett-omitted-england-lions-squad-west-indies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/19/ben-duckett-omitted-england-lions-squad-west-indies","fields":{"headline":"Ben Duckett omitted from England Lions squad to tour West Indies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ben Duckett has paid a heavy price for his off-field indiscretions in Australia by being left out of the England Lions squad that will tour the West Indies next year. The Northamptonshire opener was a notable absentee from the squads announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board on Tuesday after he was suspended, fined and given a final written warning about his future conduct following an incident in a Perth bar that led to him pouring beer over Jimmy Anderson. Duckett, who played four Tests last year, against Bangladesh and India, was also left out of the Lions’ two-day match against a Cricket Australia XI this month and an ECB spokesman confirmed that his absence from the West Indies tour, which begins in February, was further punishment for his behaviour. “Ben Duckett has not been selected as a result of the off-field incident which led to his suspension and fine in Australia,” he said. The Lions have been in Australia since November for a training camp and have played five matches so far, drawing twice and losing three times to Perth Scorchers in Twenty20s. Aside from Duckett, the 10 players currently on tour will now head to West Indies in February to play three four-day matches and three one-dayers, with Haseeb Hameed, Ben Foakes, Sam Curran, Mason Crane, Jamie Porter and Toby Roland-Jones added to the squad for the red ball games. They will be captained by Lancashire’s Keaton Jennings in both formats, while fast bowlers Josh Tongue and Tom Helm have been selected despite being affected by injury during the Australia camp. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson, Kent batsman Sam Northeast and Lancashire leg-spinner Matthew Parkinson are the other call-ups to the one-day squad. “We have selected a total of 22 players for these two series in the West Indies, to ensure we gain the most value in terms of assessing players in both first-class and one-day cricket,” said national selector James Whitaker. “Haseeb Hameed, Jamie Porter and Toby Roland-Jones are all available again after injuries - Jamie and Toby after working exceptionally hard on the ECB’s Pace Programme over the last couple of months. “Sam Curran missed out on the Lions training camp in Australia but he has also been training hard, under the supervision of Surrey’s strength and conditioning coaches, before going out to play T20 cricket in New Zealand. “We have included two members of the Ashes tour squad, Ben Foakes and Mason Crane, for the four-day matches, with the possibility of either or both of them leaving the Lions tour early if they are selected in the England squad for the two Tests in New Zealand in March and April. “We will be naming that squad in the new year, and the same goes for the squads for the North-South Series which will be played in Barbados at the end of the Lions tour – and is likely to include the players who have been selected for the one-day series against West Indies A.” Lions squads Whole tour: K Jennings, (Lancashire, capt), J Clarke (Worcestershire), L Livingstone (Lancashire), S Curran (Surrey), J Porter (Essex), P Coughlin (Nottinghamshire), S Mahmood (Lancashire), N Gubbins (Middlesex), A Davies (Lancashire, wk).

Chelsea v Arsenal Manchester City v Bristol City First legs to be played on the weekend commencing 8 January Second legs to be played on the weekend commencing 22 January Asked what his thoughts are: “My thoughts are they were a bit lucky, but they fought hard to be lucky,” he says of Bristol City’s win. “They win the game in the moment when everyone was waiting for our goal. But also we hit the post twice in the first half., But they played brilliantly and fought like it was the biggest night of their lives and it probably was. It’s a beautiful game for football. I don’t want me saying they were lucky to be the most important thing. The most important thing is that a team from the Championship beat Manchester United. In the first half we lacked intensity. And when I say intensity I mean not just physically but mentally. For some of us it was like one more day in the office, probably a day for some of them where they don’t even want to come to the office. For the Bristol boys it was a big, big day for them, and you could see that.” Ben Fisher was present for the Guardian on one of the more famous night’s in the history of Ashton Gate. Korey Smith speaks: “Absolutely unbelievable,” he says. “The lads have played brilliantly. I don’t score a lot, but as you can see the lads are very happy. I said to the boys at half-time, if I make the run try to pick me out and Joe played me in.” Korey Smith is in big demand: The Bristol City match-winner is posing for selfies with hundreds and hundreds of Bristol City fans and looks exhausted, but is now being helped towards the dressing room by some stewards. That was a great game of football and City are worthy winners. Stay tuned for the semi-final draw, in which City will be paired with Manchester City, Arsenal or Chelsea. They’ve already knocked out four Premier League teams, who’s to say they won’t beat another. It’s all over! There’s a pitch invasion as Bristol City’s fans run on to the field to swamp their exhausted players at the end of a wonderful Cup upset. Bristol took the lead early in the second half courtesy of a Joe Bryan howitzer, only for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to equalise with a free-kick a few minutes later. On the rack and under immense pressure, Bristol City kept on keeping on and with the game looking certain to go to extra time, up popped Korey Smith at the death to nick a late, late winner for the Championship side. Incredible scenes at Ashton Gate! Working tirelessly at the knockings of normal time, Korey Smith puts Bristol City 2-1 up against Manchester United, ghosting in behind the defence to pick up a dinked pass over the top from Joe Bryan and control and volley the ball past the hopelessly exposed Romero from four yards out. Would you believe it?!?!?!?!? Bristol City have almost certainly snatched it at the death. 90+3 min: United get forward again, but Lukaku’s shot from inside the Bristol City area is blocked. Now it’s the home side’s turn to attack on the break, but a poor delivery from Niclas Eliasson lets them down. 89 min: Aden Flint wins a free-kick for Bristol City not too far inside the Manchester United half. Marlon Pack lofts the ball forward and United clear. With United breaking on the counter, Matt Taylor brings down Romelu Lukaku and gets booked. Paul Pogba picks up a yellow card too, after mouthing off at referee Mike Dean for something or other. 87 min: Victor Lindelof looks to have sold Sergio Romero short with a back-pass, but there’s just enough on it to enable the United goalkeeper to hoof the ball clear under pressure from Bobby Reid. 87 min: We approach the end of normal time, with Manchester United turning the screw on Bristol City, but unable to find a way through on goal. 83 min: Chelsea have beaten Bournemouth and go into the Carabao Cup semi-final draw along with Arsenal and Manchester City. Back at Ashton Gate, Luke Steele saves brilliantly from Lukaku’s low drive, getting down quickly to scramble the goal-bound effort clear for a corner. 80 min: Great play from City, who go close as Marlon Pack has a cross deflected over the bar for a corner, which results in the ball being sent sailing straight into the arms of Romero. 79 min: For Bristol City, Jamie Paterson cuts inside Matteo Darmian and sends a shot curling wide of the Manchester United goal. Meanwhile at Stamford Bridge: Dan Gosling has equalised for Bournemouth against Chelsea in the 90th minute ... only for Alvaro Morata to nick what looks likely to be a very late winner for the hosts. 77 min: Another corner for Manchester United, which is cleared by a meaty header from Aden Flint. 76 min: Great goalkeeping from Luke Steele, who does well to tip a Lukaku header around the upright and out for a corner, from which nothing comes. Bristol City are under immense pressure here. 75 min: Bristol City substitution: Josh Brownhill off, Niclas Eliasson on. 74 min: Marcus Rashford gets a yellow card for a late challenge on Joe Bryan, moments after putting Bryan had put in a wonderful, potentially match-saving covering tackle on the Manchester United striker who looked through on goal with an unmarked Lukaku up in support to his right. 73 min: Bristol City win a free-kick just inside the Manchester United half. Bryan floats the ball forward, but Marcos Rojo clears. 71 min: United advance into Bristol City territory with Lukaku and Mkhitarian linking up well. With Rashford calling for the ball, Lukaku opts to shoot himself but doesn’t trouble Luke Steele unduly with his effort. 68 min: There’s a pause in play as Josh Brownhill receives treatment down by one of the corner flags. Manchester United substitution: Zlatan Ibrahimovic off, Henrikh Mkhitaryan on.Bristol City substitution: HOrder Magnusson off, Matt Taylor on. 66 min: Bristol City’s defence are being pinned further and further back by a Manchester United team that seem to have the smell of blood in their nostrils. Bristol City win another throw-in deep in United territory, which Magnusson takes long again. Romero comes for the ball and misses it, but Aden Flint sends his header floating agonisingly wise of the upright. 63 min: Replays of Zlatan’s free-kick show that he took advantage of a gap in the Bristol City wall and the ball took a slight deflection off the back of Korey Smith on it’s way in. I suspect Luke Steele would have beaten anyway, as he was completely unsighted. 60 min: Manchester United substitution: Romelu Lukaku on for Daley Blind. A striker for a holding midfielder - Joe wants to put this one to bed as quickly as possible and as entertaining a game as it is, for that we should all be thankful. Zlatan equalises with the free-kick. He blasts a shot through the wall and into the bottom right-hand corner. Bristol City’s lead was short-lived, but Manchester United have equalised from a free-kick they were very lucky to get from Mike Dean. It was a good shot from the has-been, though. Write him off at your peril. 57 min: Manchester United win a free-kick in a good position just to left of the day for a Korey Smith “foul” on Paul Pogba, who appeared to just run into the midfielder. 55 min: With their tails up, Bristol City carve out another shooting opportunity courtesy of a nice dummy from Bobby Reid that allows the ball to run to Joe Bryan again. This time he shoots from the edge of the area on his weaker right foot, but his low daisy-cutter doesn’t trouble Romero unduly. 53 min: That was a brilliant finish to an excellent move that began and ended with Joe Bryan. He played the ball forward, kept on running up the inside left channel past two or three Manchester United players, picked up a pass from Marlon Pack and blasted the ball past Romero. Bristol City lead and you can’t say they don’t deserve it. Bristol City take the lead! Joe Bryan sends a diagonal surface to air screamer fizzing across the bows of Eduardo Romero and inside the far upright. 50 min: Bobby Reid gets a yard on Victor Lindelof in the United 18-yard box and shoots into the side-netting from a narrow angle. 48 min: Another free-kick for Manchester United in much the same position for a Josh Bronhill foul on Anthony Martial. This time the one-man wall, Korey Smith, almost diverts the ball into his own net, but Luke Steele recovers well to save his team-mate the embarrassment of what might have been a hideous own goal. 46 min: Jamie Paterson gets the first yellow card of the evening for a late challenge on Paul Pogba. Free-kick for Manchester United wide on the left, about 35 yards from the Bristol City goal. Ibrahimovic runs over the ball and Rashford blasts a low drive into the one-man wall. 46 min: Play resumes with Manchester United getting the ball rolling. With Arsenal and Manchester City already in the Carabao tombola for the semi-final draw immediately after tonight’s game, Chelsea currently lead Bournemouth in the other quarter-final being played this evening. There are no changes in personnel on either side at Ashton Gate. Peep! Mike Dean blows for half-time and both sets of players march in after a thoroughly entertaining 45 minutes of play. Bristol City boss Lee Johnson will be the happier of the two managers so far - his team have acquitted themselves very well so far and have been brave in their attempts to take the game to Manchester United. 44 min: Another long throw from Magnusson, who hurls the ball straight into the arms of Romero. 41 min: Daley Blind dives in to take the ball off the foot of Korey Smith in the Manchester United penalty area when the midfielder was clean through on goal and dithering over a shot. Brilliant play from Bristol City to get in behind the United defence after catching them napping with a quick throw-in. Smith shouldn’t have given Blind the opportunity to save United’s bacon with a last-ditch tackle after finding himself through on goal. 40 min: Daley Blind sends the ball into the mixer, Mctominay gets his head to it and the ball drops for Zlatan Ibrahimovic who volleys high over the bar from a tight angle under pressure from Josh Brownhill. 39 min: Zlatan wins a corner off Magnusson after trying and failing to barge his way past the Icelandic international in the Bristol City penalty area. 36 min: Bristol City win a throw-in deep in Manchester United territory and, not for the first time, Hordor Magnusson Delaps/Challinors the ball into the penalty area to an Icelandic thunderclap soundtrack provided by the occupants of the stands. Manchester United clear. 33 min: Zlatan Ibrahimovic gets the ball, attempts to jink his way through a thicket of players on the edge of the Bristol City penalty area and quickly loses it. Why did Manchester United offer him a new contract? Answers on a postcard, please? 31 min: Bristol City’s players are quickest to every ball in midfield and here, Hordur Magnusson beats Marcus Rashford to a loose ball despite giving him a head-start. He unleashes a venomous shot, which Romera puts out for a corner after diving to his right. Nothing comes of the subsequent dead ball. 29 min: Aden Flints gets the ball in the Manchester United net, having inadvertently blocked a Sergio Romero throw-out as he jogged past the goakeeper, before quickly booting the loose ball into United’s goal. Mike Dean curtails his celebrations with a shrill blast of his whistle which the Bristol City central defender greets with a grin. 28 min: Pack wins a corner that goes out of play off Anthony Martial’s hand. Bristol City’s fans appeal for a penalty, but none is forthcoming. 25 min: Paul Pogba and Marlon Pack are having quite the battle in midfield and we’ve just seen a replay of a high challenge from the Manchester United man on his Bristol City counterpart. He could easily have got a yellow or worse for that. 23 min: Paul Pogba drives forward from midfield and with Bristol’s defence backing off him, unleashes a shot from outside the penalty area. It curls a yard or so wide of the left upright. 21 min: A good move from Manchester United ends with Marcus Rashford finding a pocket of space outside the Bristol City penalty area and unleashing a drive that hits the right upright. 19 min: Bristol City win a free-kick about three yardfs outside the Manchester United penalty, well left of centre. Luke Shaw, it was, with the infringement. Joe Bryan rounds off a rehearsed training ground move by firing the free-kick high and wide of the Manchester United goal 16 min: Good play from Anthony Martial, who’s giving Bailey Wright a torrid time of it down the left flank. He cuts inside the Bristol City full-back and unleashes a shot that’s blocked on the edge of the penalty area. The ball drops for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who chests it into the path of Scott McTominay. From 20 or so yards, he shoots high over the bar. 14 min: Under pressure from a heavy Bristol City press far up the field, Manchester United concede a cheap throw-in. 13 min: The camera cuts to Margaret Dodds, a Bristol City fan who is enjoying the game. She recently celebrated her 100th birthday. Well done her. 10 min: Joe Bryan is quicker to the ball than Daley Blind in midfield and bursts forward for Bristol City, whose counter-attack breaks down due to a poor final ball. Manchester United go down the other end of the pitch, where Anthony Martial sends in a cross from deep towards the far post. Zlatan’s attempt to sidefoot the ball home from a very narrow angle almost comes to fruition - it takes a deflection off Nathan Baker and bounces off the cross-bar. 9 min: Meanwhile in Wales, Paul Clement has been sacked by Swansea City, who are in the market for a new manager. 8 min: From that corner, Zlatan heads clear at the near post, but the ball is floated back into the mixer. Manchester United clear again. They’re under pressure here, after a fine start by Championship opponents who don’t look at all overwhelmed. 7 min: Josh Brownhill, who looks about 12 years old, takes the free-kick and gets it over the Manchester United wall. Sergio Romero fists it over his own cross-bar for a corner. From that inswinger, Pogba concedes another corner. 4 min: Paul Pogba, for anyone who is interested, has lined-up with his mohawk dyed a kind of neapolitan pink and yellow on one side, but browny-black on the other. He gets on the ball early doors but loses it about 10 yards in front of his own goal and has it robbed from him by Marlon Pack. In his attempts to win it back, he concedes a free-kick. Good play by the Bristol City midfielder. 3 min: Bristol City seem to have lined up in a 4-5-1 formation, while their visitors look to have opted for a 4-3-3, rather than the 3-4-3 their line-up suggested. Stop yawning, this is important stuff. 2 min: Meanwhile at Stamford Bridge, Willian has fired Chelsea into a 1-0 lead against Bournemouth in the other semi-final, which started 15 minutes before this one. 1 min: On a run of four consecutive wins, Bristol City get proceedings under way, with their players wearing red shirts, white shorts and red socks with white Santa Claus turn-down trim. Manchester United’s players wear light grey shirts, shorts and socks. Not long now: The teams march on to the Ashton Gate pitch as a record-breaking crowd looks on. As the teams line up either side of the match officials, Zlatan Ibrahimovic uses a linesman to lean on for balance as he performs some last-second stretches. A meeting of minds: Lee Johnson has voiced his desire to pick the brains of Jose Mourinho after tonight’s match and Sky Sports footage from behind the scenes at Ashton Gate show the pair engrossed in deep conversation ahead of kick-off. Fairly uninteresting travel news: Manchester United actually attempted to fly to Bristol airport on a private jet this morning, but bad weather meant their plane was diverted to Cardiff instead. Bristol City’s celebratory comedy goal gifs have become quite the social media phenomenon this season, so with the obligatory insincere apologies to Manchester United here’s hoping we see a selection tonight. Marcus Rashford is the only Manchester United player starting tonight who was also on the field when his side’s 2-1 win over West Brom kicked off at the weekend. Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his first start of the season for United and will captain United. Lee Johnson, by contrast, fields 10 of the 11 players who beat Nottingham Forest last Saturday, with Luke Steele replacing Frank Fielding in goal for his third appearance of the season. Bristol City: Steele, Wright, Flint, Baker, Magnusson, Brownhill, Pack, Smith, Bryan, Paterson, Reid. Subs: Fielding, Taylor, Eliasson, Kelly, Vyner, Lemonheigh-Evans, Garita. Man Utd: Romero, Lindelof, Rojo, Blind, Darmian, McTominay, Pogba, Shaw, Rashford, Ibrahimovic, Martial. Subs: Mata, Lukaku, Smalling, Lingard, Ander Herrera, Mkhitaryan, Joel Pereira. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) Bristol City are missing plenty of players, including striker Famara Diedhou, the club’s record signing, and defender Jens Hegeler, who are both long term absentees with knee injuries, while Milan Djuric, Callum O’Dowda, Ivan Lucic, Korey Smith, Eros Pisano and Gary O’Neil are also unavailable. Loanees Cauley Woodrow and Jonathan Leko are both cup-tied. Jose Mourinho has hinted that the lesser-spotted Henrikh Mkhitarian could be involved against Bristol City, having failed to feature in a Manchester United starting line-up since the team’s defeat at the hands of Chelsea on 5 November. Paul Pogba is available for selection again after suspension, but Michael Carrick, Eric Bailly and Marouane Fellaini are all sidelined, while Antonio Valencia is also expected to sit this one out. “I am making a few changes for the match, but not many because Bristol City are one of the best teams in the Championship,” said Mourinho. “For me now, the Championship is not the Championship of five or 10 years ago. The Championship is now high-quality teams with lots of players that could be playing in the Premier League easily. So we need to take the game really seriously. I am going to make a few changes and it is possible Micki is involved.” Barry will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/20/prisoners-mental-health-self-harm-deaths-jails-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T10:44:24Z","webTitle":"There’s a mental health crisis in our prisons, yet the justice secretary is silent | Eric Allison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/prisoners-mental-health-self-harm-deaths-jails-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/prisoners-mental-health-self-harm-deaths-jails-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"There’s a mental health crisis in our prisons, yet the justice secretary is silent","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The news that living conditions at Liverpool prison are the worst that jail inspectors have ever seen will come as no surprise to anyone who has spent time there. The gaunt Victorian pile on Hornby Road, in the Walton area of the city, was always known as the dirtiest jail in the system. Most of the old jails have a cockroach problem, but Liverpool took the infestation to a new low, with cell floors carpeted with them, as they came out at night to feed off the crumbs. I experienced those conditions some 20 years ago. With prison budgets still reeling from the cuts imposed by former justice secretary Chris Grayling, it can hardly be imagined that conditions have improved since my time there. According to a leaked report on Liverpool, some areas of the jail were so filthy and hazardous they were beyond cleaning. The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, spoke of a prisoner with complex mental health needs, caged in a cell that had no furniture other than a bed. The cell windows were broken, as was the light fitting. The toilet was filthy and blocked and electrical wires were exposed in his “dark and damp” living space. He had been held in these conditions for weeks. Conditions such as these would challenge the wellbeing of prisoners in good health. To impose them on prisoners suffering mental health problems is taking punishment to a shameful and degrading level. For some years now, I have been saying that mental health is the biggest single problem facing a prison service beset with difficulties. I saw it coming back in the 1980s, when the Thatcher government closed many of the old asylums and, supposedly, replaced them with care in the community. We know what happened there. Mental health became – and still is – the poor relation of the NHS, and many of those suffering end up on the streets and in our prisons. And our political masters cannot say they are unaware of the problem. The Commons public accounts committee this month published a report saying that the record levels of self-harm and deaths are a “damning indictment” of the state of mental health provision in jails across England and Wales. The committee found that long-standing understaffing and increased prevalence of drugs in jails have led to deep-rooted failures in the management of mental health. Shockingly, MPs concluded that, while the prison service and NHS England have a duty of care to prisoners, they “do not know where they are starting from, how well they are doing or whether their current plans will be enough to succeed”. Incredibly, the most commonly used data, used to estimate the scale of the problem within our prisons, is 20 years old, when the prison population was about half of what it is today. Yet the committee found that governments efforts to improve the mental health of prisoners so far have been poorly coordinated, with information not shared, not even between community and prison GP services. Prisoners miss an average of 15% of medical appointments because there are not enough staff to escort them. Yet the loss of staff continues to outstrip recruitment in many jails. The chair of the committee, Meg Hillier, said the appalling toll of self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in prisons can be laid at the deep-rooted failures in the management of prisoners’ mental health. When The NHS replaced the prison medical service and took responsibility for healthcare in prisons in 2000, it seemed a change for the better. Prisoners come from the community and are released back there. It never made sense for them to be treated by a different health service while locked up. But it is no coincidence that a struggling NHS, particularly the mental health sector, is failing to cope with the demands of thousands of prisoners in need of therapeutic care. There are no votes to be won behind bars. Deborah Coles is the director of the charity Inquest and sees, more than most, the results caused by the neglect of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. She says that alternatives to prison must be found for those suffering mental health problems and a more therapeutic response for those for whom prison is the last resort. Can we hope her words will be heeded? On Monday, the justice secretary, David Lidington, gave a speech to the thinktank Reform. He said the “overriding trigger” for the levels of violence, self-harm and disorder inside prisons in England and Wales was “the availability of drugs, including new psychoactive substances and other contraband”. On mental health, the minister had nothing to say. He should be taken to that filthy cell in Liverpool and made to explain his failure to master his brief to that prisoner with complex mental health needs; to whom, I remind him, he owes a duty of care. • Eric Allison is the Guardian’s prison correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/03/the-life-to-come-by-michelle-de-kretser-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T07:30:09Z","webTitle":"The Life to Come by Michelle de Kretser review – tales of human complexity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/03/the-life-to-come-by-michelle-de-kretser-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/03/the-life-to-come-by-michelle-de-kretser-review","fields":{"headline":"The Life to Come by Michelle de Kretser review – tales of human complexity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Along the paths down from the rim of the Grand Canyon to the Colorado River, there are signs warning walkers that they shouldn’t even consider setting off unless they are planning to spend at least one night in the valley. The delights at the base of the canyon are not for the uncommitted, day-trippers or the ill prepared. At least, I presume so: in two brief visits, I never dared disobey the signs. A warning of this kind seems to be implied in the brambly first sentence of Michelle de Kretser’s new novel. “The house by the river belonged to an old man whose relationship to George Meshaw was complicated but easily covered by ‘cousin’.” It’s both awkward and precise, a little bit off-putting and a little bit intriguing. And since neither George Meshaw, his “cousin” nor the house is really the subject of the book, perhaps you can get a glimpse of the patience and tenacity it takes to explore this novel. The Life to Come is billed as the Sri Lankan-born Australian’s fifth novel, but it could perhaps more accurately be described as a collection of linked stories. It doesn’t offer the conventional integrity of a novel: the life of a central character or characters unfolding through time. Instead the five long chapters present us with separate stories, mostly set in Australia, vaguely linked by the recurring character of Pippa, a writer with more drive than obvious talent. A tale of youthful ambition is followed by one of young love. A story about an émigré Australian in Paris coming to question her life’s meaning and the commitment of her married female lover is succeeded by another about motherhood and betrayal. The last story deals with senescence and the awfulness of dementia. The outstanding section of the book – the panorama from the canyon floor – is this final chapter, Olly Faithful. In it, Christabel, a Sri Lankan woman, follows her friend Bunty to Australia to make a new life in Sydney. Christabel’s life from girlhood to old age is related in a succession of vignettes. The daughter of a professor of English, she is smart, well read, well travelled, a complicated blend of naivety and sophistication, passion and reserve. We see her patronised and down on her luck in Colombo in the years following Sri Lankan independence. Once in Australia, she briefly takes a lover who is intrigued by her exoticism. “Teach me to explore darkness, Chrissie,” he says, making the reader cringe as he leads her to the bedroom. She wrestles with the jargon of her new job in a high rise: “Cars rolled round Christabel’s ankles as she proactively monitored her competency framework.” As she ages, she forsakes sexual intimacy and takes up the burden of caring for Bunty, who is stricken with dementia. In a few elegant pages, De Kretser conveys the sense of a human being who is vivid, specific and contradictory. Christabel has the misfortune of living next door to a writer, Pippa, who is thin-skinned, self-regarding and shallow, but still never wholly contemptible. She is grateful to be offered friendship, but then feels betrayed when she discovers herself in the pages of one of Pippa’s books, recognisable but inaccurately described as “a closet lesbian with a mannish face”. Christabel’s hurt leads her to the devastating conclusion: “She was only a minor character on the margins of lives that mattered and it was impossible to feel sympathy for her: Pippa had seen to that.” Of course, the reverse is the case. Pippa the professional writer has collapsed a complex human life into a hurtful, lazy stereotype. This is an epiphany that resonates throughout the book; Pippa is a marginal character in lives she has failed to comprehend. From the floor of the valley, you can trace this theme through the preceding chapters. They have been preoccupied by questions about how we represent ourselves, the difference between the trivial and the non-trivial, and the violence that is done by the simplifications of storytelling. The book is replete with examples of important things being forgotten, suppressed or misunderstood. In the second chapter, half-Sri Lankan Ash and Australian Cassie have an affair that’s based on a mutual misapprehension. Ash trades on his appearance and the assumption that he’s an exotic and possibly oppressed “Other”. In fact, he’s the beneficiary of oppression. The massacres of Indigenous Australians, the murder of Algerians in Paris in the 1960s and the complex ethnic politics of Sri Lanka are reproachfully present on the periphery of a novel in which so many characters are self-absorbed and vain. De Kretser is especially fond of skewering characters such as Pippa, who are keen to signal their own good intentions. But she also wrongfoots us here: Pippa has a suppressed tragedy of her own. Given this preoccupation with what gets oversimplified, it’s not surprising that the author doesn’t let the reader settle comfortably into a single clear storyline. All this sophistication comes at a cost. With a tone that often refuses to indicate whether a detail is important or trivial and that wavers between satire and sincerity, the book is a difficult read at times. It can feel like staring at a page in a Where’s Wally? puzzle book, hoping for a reassuring glimpse of a hooped shirt among all the lovingly described weather, Australian landscapes, flora, clothing, fragments of history and multiplying minor characters. Storytelling is certainly reductive, but its simplifications are the means by which human beings make sense of themselves and of each other. It’s not until the book’s brilliant final act that De Kretser allows the reader to fall in love with a character, Christabel, whose particularity grips and moves, and who achieves the ultimate revenge against the writers who have wounded her, by throwing their novels in the bin. • Marcel Theroux’s The Secret Books is published by Faber.

There is nothing terribly seasonal about Die Hard, despite its Christmas Eve setting. It takes places in Los Angeles, so there’s no snow. There’s a tree in the building, and a few items of Christmas clothing – allowing McClane, when he knocks off his first terrorist, to put him in a Santa hat, write the words “Now I have a machine gun. Ho-ho-ho” on his top and send him in the lift to Rickman. There is nothing terribly seasonal because Christmas doesn’t matter in Die Hard: it’s just a McGuffin, a convenient reason for McClane to be travelling across the country. It was such a good McGuffin that it was recycled for Die Hard 2, the one set in the airport on Christmas Eve. Yet Die Hard 2 is just the second movie in the Die Hard series, while Die Hard has become “a Christmas movie”. That doesn’t necessarily mean you watch it at Christmas, or that it’s on prominently in the Christmas TV schedules.But Die Hard most certainly is indelibly associated with Christmas. It crops up in polls of people’s favourite Christmas films: earlier this year, the readers of Empire magazine rated it the greatest Christmas movie ever. The internet is awash with thinkpieces explaining why exactly it is a Christmas movie. If that’s not enough the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appeared on breakfast TV in Toronto last Friday, where he asserted: “Yes, Die Hard is absolutely a Christmas movie. There’s no doubt about it.” So let’s take that for granted, whether or not we really agree with the proposition: Die Hard is a Christmas movie. And it is one because so many people passionately believe it is. What’s more interesting, though, is why it has become regarded as a Christmas movie, because it certainly wasn’t made as one. Die Hard was released in the US in July 1988, and reviewers made only passing reference to its Christmas element– why would they, given they were writing in the heat of midsummer? It came out in the UK the following February, and only received a December release in Argentina, Portugal, El Salvador, Uruguay and Denmark. Nor was it one of the movies selected by the UK’s terrestrial broadcasters – in the days when viewers only had the choice of four channels and no internet – to be a tentpole of their Christmas schedules. So there’s nothing in Die Hard’s history to make it into a Christmas movie. Yet a Christmas movie it has become, but not to everyone. Earlier this month, YouGov released a poll about the movie – surely the founders of psephology did not foresee the day that pollsters would be earning a crust assessing the seasonal status of old action films – which found that only 30% of people thought it was a Christmas film, while 52% didn’t. The age breakdown, though, was more telling . The only age group in which more people thought of Die Hard as a Christmas movie than didn’t was 25- to 34-year-olds (44% against 37%), while 35- to 44-year-olds were narrowly against the idea (42% said it was a Christmas film, 47% said it wasn’t). So Die Hard is most likely to be seen as a Christmas film by those who were too young to see it at the cinema (where it received an 18 certificate). Interestingly, 18- to 24-year-olds, the first generation for whom the box in the corner is not the main provider of visual entertainment, were overwhelmingly against the idea of it being a Christmas film (52% to 28%). If you add in some data, you can see when the association of Die Hard with Christmas begins – or at least make an educated guess. Google Trends goes back to 2004, but when you look at its search trends for Die Hard, you can see the first noticeable spike is in December 2006, with small spikes every December since (the two massive spikes are tied in to the release of sequels, and nothing to do with the original film). Something else was happening around the time of that first spike, too: Facebook launched in 2004, and Twitter launched in 2006. Suddenly, social media gave people a chance to share their own perspectives, and while some people communicated about politics or society, others really wanted to tell their friends that Die Hard was a Christmas movie. This ties into an observation the film historian Matthew Sweet makes about how the context of films changes when people share a single observation, or a single image. “Films now have this other afterlife in tiny clips and gifs,” he says, “so a particular image from a film – like the dead terrorist in the Santa hat in Die Hard – can break free from the film and have this other life online that might be its most vigorous form of life.” Die Hard is really only a Christmas film to a narrow band of people, and YouGov knows exactly which ones: the ones between young adulthood and early middle age for whom Die Hard has been a constant presence. They think of it the same way as I think of Where Eagles Dare: I know I have seen Where Eagles Dare at Christmas – I have a vivid memory of Isla St Clair from the Generation Game making it her Christmas pick in the Radio Times – but I’ve also seen it lots of other times. Yet it’s associated with school holidays in my mind, and so it became a Christmas film. That’s a point Sweet makes, too, suggesting that films associated with some special childhood event get associated with Christmas, because Christmas is the most special time: “You might find some Christmas films were really Easter films, you just saw them when you were off school,” he says. I suspect that what has really made Die Hard into a Christmas film is its familiarity. Christmas is about routine, about doing things the same way every year, about being able to slip into familiar roles with barely a thought. A film as boundlessly familiar as Die Hard slips into that same part of the mind. It makes no demands: once seen, it is a film one can begin watching at any point without the slightest trouble. It almost doesn’t matter whether or not Die Hard is actually on at Christmas: the very certainty of it makes it seem as if it should be, and that is backed by the example of another non-Christmas film, the Wizard of Oz. On both sides of the Atlantic, there are many who regard the Wizard of Oz as a Christmas film, because they think they saw it on TV at Christmas. In fact, of 39 screenings of the film on US network TV between its premiere in 1956 and 2002, only four were in December. It was much more commonly shown at Easter – just as Sweet says, the association of holidays and film makes one think of Christmas. And routine and familiarity reinforce that impression. Since 2003, the Wizard of Oz has been shown much more frequently in December, but that postdated its Christmas status. So Die Hard: not a movie released at Christmas, or about Christmas, or necessarily associated with being shown on TV at Christmas, but a Christmas movie. That’s the magic of film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jan/03/8p-banana-open-public-procurement-bogota-colombia","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T11:35:36Z","webTitle":"The 8p banana that showed Bogotá needed open public spending | María Victoria Angulo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jan/03/8p-banana-open-public-procurement-bogota-colombia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/jan/03/8p-banana-open-public-procurement-bogota-colombia","fields":{"headline":"The 8p banana that showed Bogotá needed more open public spending","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On a typical school day in Bogotá, Colombia’s capital city, about a million pupils, from four to 18 years old, will sit down for a meal at one of our 384 public schools. Balanced nutrition is crucial for children’s development. The food we provide may well be their main meal for the entire day. So when concerns were raised in 2016 over the quality, delivery, price, and even the origin of our meals, we took them very seriously. Colombia had recently started publishing detailed public contracting records as open data for the first time. So our first port of call was to work with our national procurement agency, Colombia Compra Eficiente, to analyse the US$136m that we were spending on meals and other services. What we found shocked us: severe inefficiency, or worse. Mayor Enrique Peñalosa and I set out radical reforms based on an open contracting approach. We established minimum and maximum prices for meals and we made the whole contracting process competitive and fully open. Sourcing, packing and distribution of food would no longer be a single contract, and the lowest bid price would not be the deciding factor when choosing a supplier. Instead, it would be about quality. We began sharing all the information about how meals were procured, from their planning to their delivery, on a public online platform for anyone to see, in a way that was easy to understand. We faced resistance from all directions. Some of the existing suppliers threatened to sue, with nine lawsuits attempting to halt the process, and tensions flared in our politically polarised city, with more than 10 debates in the city council over the process. On top of that, a media smear campaign attempted to discredit and sabotage the reforms by spreading misleading information about, for example, food arriving damaged because of the new system. In December 2016, we opened up for bids to procure 74 products. By March 2017, suppliers had been found for all of them, except one: no company put in a bid to provide fresh fruit at the set cost. This made us suspicious. The US$22m that companies said they needed to supply us was more than we had budgeted for. Had firms boycotted the bidding process to force us to open a new one with higher prices? Armed with our information, the education secretariat and Colombia Compra Eficiente complained to the market regulator, the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce. It initiated an investigation looking into the allegation that companies were exaggerating the cost of fresh fruit by a staggering 50%. For instance, our budget was 4p (141 Colombian peso) for a banana and 11p (418 Colombian peso) for an apple. Instead, we were being offered prices of 8p for a banana and 15p for an apple. The case continues. In the meantime we have been able to push through our reforms, using open data to be transparent and make our tendering smarter. The budget of US$136m previously shared between 12 companies is now being spent among 54 specialised producers. They sell to us directly, cutting out intermediaries. We now distribute 790,000 cold snacks, and 163,000 hot meals every day to Bogotá’s schoolchildren and our school food programme has been recognised with an award from the Ministry of Education in Colombia. Just as our children need healthy food to thrive, governments need transparency and integrity so that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely and benefits citizens. Public contracting is a trillion-dollar business; it needs a revolution, not just in Bogotá’s schools, but everywhere public money is being spent.

After all, it is not uncommon and those who catastrophise seem to do it a lot. Catastrophisers tend to be fairly anxious people. Whether this characteristic is principally genetic or more the result of learning is unknown. High levels of anxiety are extremely unpleasant, so we look for ways to discharge those unpleasant feelings as quickly as possible. If a catastrophiser is told something inconclusive – for example, if they go to a GP and are asked to have tests – they look for a way to feel in control again immediately. They learn to choose the worst possible outcome because it allows for the greatest sense of relief when they are reassured. Considering all possibilities is not a bad strategy if you examine them logically. However, unable to bear their distress, catastrophisers rush to external sources to calm themselves down: checking whether anyone else has “come through” the same problem; matching symptoms online to obtain a diagnosis and treatment options; asking a professional to tell them that they will survive. Once they are reassured, they feel better – in psychological jargon, they have “rewarded” this seeking behaviour. The next time they feel uncertain or threatened, they will ratchet up their anxiety with a catastrophic thought, then look outwards for reassurance even faster than before. In this way, catastrophising soon becomes a well-entrenched habit. The greatest problem with seeking others to alleviate anxiety is that it offers only temporary relief. There is always another source to check or another opinion to be had; as a result, catastrophisers feel anxious again increasingly quickly. The only way to break this cycle is to tame anxiety. After this, you can still seek advice. So, if you are a catastrophiser and you would rather not be, how do you go about making changes? •Accept yourself. Anxiety is energy: if you are an anxious person, celebrate! However, why waste that energy feeling uncomfortable and preparing yourself for circumstances that will almost certainly never occur? Look for enjoyable ways to challenge yourself and use your energy more positively: taking regular aerobic exercise; learning something new; taking up a creative passion. •Take control. Establish a regular “worry time”. Start by setting aside half an hour every day. Write down all your concerns in specific terms. For example: “I felt nauseated this morning. Do I have stomach cancer?” Assign a score on a scale of 0 to 100% to estimate how distressed this possibility makes you feel. Next, list all the possible explanations for your concern, then rank each one according to how likely it is to be correct. Make use of external sources if necessary, but stick with reputable websites and professionals. Finally, score your worry for the level of distress it is causing you now. Gradually, you will be able to reduce the amount and frequency of worry time. •Use the “best friend test”. Ask yourself what you would advise your best friend to do about each concern, and take that action. •Learn to self-soothe. Whenever you are overwhelmed by anxiety and feel you must seek reassurance, give yourself permission to do so – but not straight away. Establish an interval before you are allowed to act. Even two minutes is enough at first, because you are still exerting self-control. Breathing slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth, or taking some gentle exercise, will help. Gradually, you will find you can wait longer. When you get to the point where you can wait more than 20 minutes, most people find they no longer need to be reassured by others. This three-pronged approach – using your “worry energy” to carry out new and enjoyable challenges, approaching your tendency to catastrophise logically and systematically, and learning to wait through discomfort – takes time. But if you invest the necessary time, you will start looking forward to each day knowing you can deal with uncertainty in a more positive, balanced way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/21/why-tv-finales-didnt-matter-in-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Why TV finales didn't matter in 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/21/why-tv-finales-didnt-matter-in-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/21/why-tv-finales-didnt-matter-in-2017","fields":{"headline":"Why TV finales didn't matter in 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Television this year had plenty of its usual ups, downs and sideways moves, but was it us or did finales die a death? A classic last episode, like the ones that signed off The Sopranos, Six Feet Under or Breaking Bad, can keep us talking for months. But, in 2017, most endings were a bit meh. How come? In this era of peak TV, finales have lost some of their currency. Now, nothing is safe from a revival, because, with so many rivals to compete against, TV networks love revamps that have a headstart thanks to brand familiarity. And if the revival itself is a success, its own end won’t be the end: anyone silly enough to think Twin Peaks: The Return would helpfully clear up all the lingering mysteries of the original classic will have been dismayed to see a season closer that was more like a launchpad for a whole other programme. Peak-TV fatigue was also a factor with David Lynch’s triumphant TV comeback, which had already delivered 17 game-changing, bewilderingly awesome episodes before it came to a close. Nobody had any emotions left to care about it going. On a couple of occasions in 2017, we did mind, and the appropriate people took action. Peter Kay’s perfect miniature sitcom Car Share suddenly wasn’t perfect in its last two minutes, delivering a fake-out double ending that was both annoying and unsatisfying. Kay reconsidered and has promised another episode of some kind. Netflix, too, realised it had killed Sense8 with more abruptness than its loyal fans deserved, so it is saying sorry with two closing specials in 2018. Likewise, Looking got a film to bid farewell after its unceremonious dumping in 2015. In a world where nothing televisual ever really dies, anticlimaxes can at least be reversed. Anticlimaxes were, however, everywhere this year. Lena Dunham’s Girls, for example, sloped off having done its job. All the thinkpieces had been written. Kooky half-hour dramedies poking deep into millennial psyches had become the norm. In fact, shows such as Insecure and Broad City were threatening to make Girls lose the zeitgeisty freshness it needed to maintain to survive. Never mind that it was still miraculously well-written and acted: its cultural moment had expired and the finale was not in itself an event. Sometimes, finales are a chance for underrated shows to bid for posthumous acclaim. Halt and Catch Fire signed off with the perfect amount of closure for its characters, the rounded portrayal of whom had gradually won the show a small army of fans. And The Leftovers, a saga about the aftermath of 2% of the world’s population suddenly vanishing that only ever attracted about 2% of the audience it deserved, won wild acclaim from followers for how it ended. That might prompt some of the other 98% to go back, catch up and eventually arrive at the season three denouement. It will be there, waiting for them with a chilly I-told-you-so look, as it unfurls in all its ethereal majesty to confirm that The Leftovers was great all along. This year’s most successful swansongs were for new shows that had snuck up on us, hooking viewers into an unfamiliar narrative. Big Little Lies had a core secret that was teased out via flashforwards and was, when all was revealed, worth hanging around for. Its miniseries format, with a punchy seven episodes, just about allowed stragglers to catch up and see the conclusion in real time. Of course, that on-demand viewing means we are doing this less and less is one more factor in finales’ reduced importance. And with no promise of a second season – there will be one, but we didn’t know that then – the climax was given extra urgency. A very different show that nevertheless mirrored BLL’s gathering momentum was Broken, which, on one level, was yet another predictably excellent Jimmy McGovern drama about impoverished people living on a precipice of social injustice. As it went on, though, the surprising lead performance by Sean Bean, and the show’s slow accumulation of shards of hope amid the despair, got us rooting for a final episode that might offer redemption. When it did, Broken broke through into contention for the British drama of the year. Then there was Line of Duty, which now builds every season to not just the most exciting last episode of the year, but to a resolution that trumps every previous season finale of Line of Duty. No big spoilers if you’re dashing through the revived box set on iPlayer, but the 2017 LoD completed that impossible task once again, managing to outdo the previous year’s pivotal interview scene for sheer excitement. Given that someone whipped out a machine gun in 2016, this was impressive. When Line of Duty one day says goodbye for ever with a last episode more thrilling than all the others, that will finally be a finale worth shouting about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jan/30/ireland-abortion-referendum-debate-young-women","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T09:39:21Z","webTitle":"'Shrouded in shame': the young women on either side of Ireland's abortion debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/30/ireland-abortion-referendum-debate-young-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jan/30/ireland-abortion-referendum-debate-young-women","fields":{"headline":"'Shrouded in shame': the young women on either side of Ireland's abortion debate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An average of 11 women travel each day from the island of Ireland to have an abortion in England and Wales, according to the most recent Department of Health data. That adds up to more than 200,000 journeys since 1983, when the passing of the Eighth Amendment underlined the ban on abortions in the republic. In Northern Ireland, the potential punishment for contravening the ban is even more severe. “It’s much more difficult even to have a conversation about abortion in Belfast,” says Jess Brien, a 25-year-old pro-choice campaigner who lives in Northern Ireland’s capital, “because the maximum sentence for having one here is life imprisonment.” No women are currently in prison for having an abortion in Ireland, with only suspended sentences having been handed out in recent years (in the republic, the maximum jail sentence is 14 years). But Brien, who returned to Belfast last year after working in music PR, says it’s “definitely strange moving to Belfast after living in London. You have the privilege of free healthcare in England – whereas if you’re going to a family planning clinic in Belfast, it’s shrouded in shame. You get questioned intensely.” Maria Maymes also lives in Belfast, but the 21-year-old Ulster University student is poles apart from Brien when it comes to abortion. “Media bias has created this idea that all young people are pro-choice,” Maymes says. “But when I’m on the streets [campaigning], I get a very positive reaction from young people. The negative reactions to our views come mainly from a middle-aged or older demographic. Most young people have an instinct within them to protect life.” Maymes and Brien represent a new wave of youth-driven campaigning on both sides of the abortion argument, which will come to a head over the next few months now the Irish government has confirmed it will hold a referendum on reform of the country’s strict anti-abortion laws by the end of May. The battle is hard fought and the youth vote could be all-important – as was shown by the vote to legalise same sex marriage in 2015, when the 60% turnout played a considerable part in its passing. “It’s an incredibly emotive issue – moral, ethical, and a matter of human rights,” says Maymes, who campaigns for Youth for Life, a subsidiary of Precious Life, the largest anti-abortion group in Northern Ireland. She complains that “it’s difficult to engage in a conversation with pro-choice people, because they’re just so angry”. But according to Brien, who is a member of Room for Rebellion, a female-led pro-choice organisation with strong links in London: “People judge you heavily for being pro-choice. There’s no support at all if you go through an abortion – you feel humiliated voicing your story.” ‘Shameful experience’ The founder of Room for Rebellion, 25-year-old Isis O’Regan, was born and raised in Galway, on Ireland’s west coast. “I went to a Catholic all-girls school there where there was no sex education and we were made to promise abstinence,” she says, adding that this lack of education led to some unplanned pregnancies among her school peers. The silencing of those who subverted sexual prohibitions led to a crisis for O’Regan. “When I was 16, I had to get the morning after pill,” she recalls. “It was illegal at the time because I was underage, so I couldn’t tell my parents and I didn’t have the €80 to pay for it. I ended up stealing the money – and then I still had to convince the doctors to give it to me, after they threatened to tell my parents. It was an incredibly shameful experience.” O’Regan argues that young people in Ireland are “brainwashed”, and that the journey to England to have abortions in secret has been normalised. “It becomes routine for these young girls to disappear and put their lives in danger,” she says. “We’re discriminated against on a daily basis. When it comes to reproductive rights, women are second-class citizens in Ireland.” Room for Rebellion, a protest group centred on holding fundraiser club nights, aims to build a pro-choice community amongst the diaspora, supporting women in Ireland through politicised partying. For their first event in February last year, O’Regan – who says she moved to London three years ago “to get away from the sense of prohibition against my bodily rights” – held two parties simultaneously in Dublin and London, live-streaming each city on to the other’s dancefloor. “I needed to have a visual representation of the women at home,” she explains. “I wanted my sisters and my best friends to see us physically dancing beside them. Streaming it on to the dancefloor was as close as we could get to each other.” That dislocation became clear in Belfast, where O’Regan attempted to hold another Room For Rebellion event. “Getting venues to agree to hosting a pro-choice night was much more difficult than we’d expected,” she says. “People there were scared of negative reactions and the legal implications, so we didn’t go ahead.” Campaigners on the other side of the abortion argument also talk about an atmosphere of silence. “The best tactic that those pushing for abortion in Ireland have is to keep pro-life people quiet,” says 22-year-old campaigner Clare McCarthy. A student at Trinity College in Dublin, McCarthy says she hid the fact she was pro-life “for years, because of the intolerance my peers expressed in front of me. The disdain I witnessed was alienating.” Identifying as a feminist, McCarthy sees the abortion debate as an equality issue: “Even one abortion is a tragedy. As a feminist, I embrace the rights of all human beings and reject the use of force over another. Abortion does not liberate women.” McCarthy’s fellow Trinity student and anti-abortion campaigner, 22-year-old Blánaid ní Bhraonáin, says her views were challenged at a pro-life rally last summer. “A counter-protester jumped in front of me and shouted, ‘How dare you call yourself a feminist!’” she recalls. “But abortion is never going to create an ideal feminist society, because an act of violence is never empowering.” ‘Not here to punish’ Room For Rebellion member Anna Cafolla had a similar Catholic education to O’Regan, despite living on the other side of the border. “We would be made to go to pro-life conferences from 13 onwards, and would pray for the souls of dead babies together – it was brainwashing,” she says. “Since the church is so tied to our education and political systems, it creates an endemic denial of allowing young women the freedom of choice.” Cafolla recalls how friends would “queue up on a Saturday at the Brook centre in Belfast to get the pill. You’d see people you knew from school – kids were calling you sluts for being there.” The Brook is one of the few sexual health clinics remaining in Belfast, after the Marie Stopes centre closed recently as government funding refocused on projects in England. Maymes sees the closure of the Marie Stopes clinic as a positive development, suggesting such organisations contribute to “a huge culture of death in England, where one in five pregnancies end in termination”. The latest government statistics show that, among women aged 15-44 in England and Wales, the abortion rate was 16 per 1,000 women last year. Maymes works with Stanton Healthcare, an anti-abortion organisation that supports unwanted pregnancies to term. She labels it “a replacement for Marie Stopes; a loving and beautiful alternative for women”. “We’re not here to punish women and we’re not advocating for jail sentences”, Maymes says, “but we do not support the legalisation of abortion in any case.” With nearly 80% of the Northern Irish public believing abortion should be legal when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, and 73% in favour of abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, according to 2016’s Life and Times Survey, opinion is moving decisively away from blanket criminalisation. “There are several close friends of mine who have had to travel to England to have terminations, one because of a fatal foetal abnormality,” says O’Regan. “The fact that women can’t even speak to each other about these traumatic experiences says volumes about the inequality we face.” The risk of sharing experiences even with trained professionals has come to light through a number of recent high-profile legal cases. Last year in Northern Ireland, the mother of a 15-year-old was reported to the police by her GP for buying abortion pills online for her daughter. In 2016, a 21-year-old woman was given a one-year suspended sentence for procuring her own abortion by using poison; the foetal remains were found and handed in to the police by her flatmates. With such strong beliefs on both sides, Cara Sanquest – co-founder of the London Irish Abortion Rights Campaign – believes that, regardless of the referendum result, “We’re not going to get free, safe and legal abortion across the island of Ireland by May 2018.” There is no proposed referendum in Northern Ireland, and with its government at a stalemate over Brexit, there are yet to be talks on the state of the devolved law on abortion there. In the Republic, a recent Amnesty International poll showed 87% of the population supported a general increase in access to abortion there. An earlier Sunday Times poll found that 37% of 18- to 34-year-olds supported allowing abortion with no restrictions, compared to 31% of 35- to 54-year-olds. According to Sanquest, “The responsibility for changing this law cannot only be on the people who have had abortions. It’s a huge burden to expect people to campaign who have already been exiled from their country and let down by its laws. Even if you don’t have a personal experience, you should still care. This is about how women are being treated in our society.” O’Regan, however, remains positive. “We have to believe that the referendum will be a success; that young people will push it through, just like the vote for same sex marriage. I have faith in everyone back home. And if it doesn’t happen, we’ll keep protesting and dancing.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/the-british-elite-is-at-war-with-itself-on-a-scale-weve-never-seen-before","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T16:41:47Z","webTitle":"The British elite is at war with itself – on a scale we’ve never seen before | Paul Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/the-british-elite-is-at-war-with-itself-on-a-scale-weve-never-seen-before","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/the-british-elite-is-at-war-with-itself-on-a-scale-weve-never-seen-before","fields":{"headline":"The British elite is at war with itself – on a scale we’ve never seen before","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When I first started working at the BBC, in 2001, what struck me was not how most of the people in charge were from the same universities, or that it was assumed you were a ski enthusiast, or how casually people dropped the names of powerful people they knew. It was the uniformity of thinking. There were progressive people and conservative people, but they mostly subscribed to the groupthink of the elite. Surveying the levels of anger, abuse and fractiousness in the upper levels of British society today, it feels like a very different country. The Daily Mail’s front page, attacking the Tory Brexit rebels and triggering an avalanche of threats and abuse, was just the latest example of a culture war inside the British elite that makes any remaining class resentment against them look mild. You might say we’ve been here before – but not often. When Churchill had to browbeat his cabinet to go on fighting the Nazis during the Dunkirk crisis in May 1940, there was a strategic fissure, but it was containable within the high Tory monoculture he shared with opponents such as Lord Halifax. The cultural conflict depicted in the recent TV series Howards End – between action and reflectiveness among the English upper middle class – was also conducted civilly. But what’s happening now is off the scale. I can’t remember a time in British politics when different wings of the Tory party wanted to destroy each other more than they wanted to destroy the left. I can’t remember this level of viciousness in the briefing and whispering campaigns politicians conduct against each other. It’s as if every minor issue has become framed around the existential issues. And they are real. The first one is obvious: Brexit. Two generations of lawyers, bankers, accountants and corporate managers had become so moulded to the Lisbon treaty, the European court of justice and the commission that even now, 18 months after the referendum, some are struggling to get beyond the denial stage. The second existential issue is the one in the Daily Mail’s strap heading: “the possibility of a Marxist in No 10”. Combining the government’s defeat on the Brexit process with the fear of a radical left government in 2018 was a stroke of genius by the Mail’s editor because it goes to the heart of the British elite’s internal civil war. Brexit was supposed to make the rich popular again. It was the great rhetorical wheeze that would reunite the Boris Johnsons and the Rees-Moggs with the plebs amid a bonfire of regulations and a sick-inducing spasm of nationalist joy. Instead, because the elite has already lost control of Labour, it threatens to put in power a government that will switch off the great privatisation machine, save universal public health provision and empower workers to an extent that has not been imagined since the 1970s. Because the Tories screwed up Brexit, and Yvette Cooper screwed up the Labour leadership election, and then Theresa May screwed up almost everything, the British elite is mad as hell, spitting fury, spleen and threats at itself like professional wrestlers. One is tempted to order a large tub of popcorn, except that countries have elites for a reason. In a dangerous world, nations divided by class have historically relied on the best-educated, richest and highest-trained people to think strategically on their behalf; not just the politicians, but the top lawyers, central bankers and civil servants. If they do that in times of crisis, then, as Orwell did in the second world war, you can forgive daft hats at Ascot and the crazy rigmarole of regimental dinners. This year’s crop of hypersentimental war movies remind us of why elites are useful: Kenneth Branagh as the naval commander in Dunkirk, stoically managing the evacuation; Julian Wadham as General Montgomery in Churchill, showing the calm leadership qualities that made the real-life Monty a hero to many of his soldiers; Gary Oldman as Churchill in Darkest Hour. This world of cigarette smoke, woollen tank tops and deference is living memory for older people, but seems so alien to the young that it can be readily fictionalised using a few conventions. The main convention is that the British elite never loses its cool. But it has well and truly lost its cool in 2017 – and the repercussions are echoing across public life. Oppose the government and you’re a traitor. Support Labour and you’re a Marxist traitor. Defend progressive values and you’re a luvvie – formerly slang for people in theatre, transformed by the tabloids into slang for people who care about knowledge, reasoned argument and restraint. The denigration of expert opinion emerged as a theme of the Brexit campaign and it has intensified during the elite civil war, as the tabloids belittle the reputations of lawyers, central bankers, economists and anyone foreign. Right now, to a global audience, Britain looks like a sitting duck for every external force that wishes to destabilise it. The current prime minister has lost control and former prime ministers are hiring themselves out to despotic regimes. Soon we will get the results of the FBI probe into Russian manipulation of the Brexit referendum, we will have even more egg on our collective face, and the elite will be even more angry with itself. It’s probably not obvious if you spend your days buried in the British newspapers, but nobody else in the world is suffering this level of elite cognitive dissonance. Not even in the US – because despite the catastrophe of Trump’s presidency, the military and corporate establishments have moved in to sack the crazies and the Russian spies and to protect Trump from reality – and vice versa – in a miasma of Big Mac fumes and cable TV. As many of us will discover over the festive season, a simmering argument among a closed group of people usually ends in an explosion. I can’t see the Tory cabinet or the xenophobic tabloid editors being happy until some cathartic incident happens to put one faction in control. Unfortunately – as everyone in the cabinet knows – that means the Tories cannot go on ruling for much longer. What clears the air in a democracy is an election – and we need one as early as possible in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/22/steve-bicknell-ideal-festival-track-laurent-garnier-acid-eiffel","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T11:00:51Z","webTitle":"Steve Bicknell: ‘The ideal festival track?

But shoppers this year will want to consider their role in propping up the genocide of Rohingya people, and join the tens of thousands of people calling on high-end jewellery retailers to end their relationships with the Burmese military. In early December, 75,000 people signed an online petition calling on Cartier to do just that. Cartier’s response was swift and within days announced it had “decided to stop purchasing gemstones from Myanmar, which will become fully effective as of December 8”. Now other similar companies must follow suit. The past century has had no shortage of stories of people facing plights similar to the horrifying violence targeting the Rohingya. Apartheid South Africa, Nazi Germany and recent genocidal violence in Darfur all offer chilling comparisons that make the escalation of violence now facing the Rohingya horribly unsurprising. Every day brings more stories of families being forced from their homes by the military and vigilante mobs, in a systematic campaign of mass shootings, rapes and house burnings. But these brutal episodes share another common characteristic, too: in each case, corporations were quietly complicit in providing an income stream to the perpetrators of the violence. For Myanmar’s military, involvement in the huge export of gems is an essential income stream. Almost all the world’s superior quality jade originates in Myanmar, and 95% of the world’s rubies. Definitive figures of the national production value do not exist, but various estimates identify the gems and jade industry to be Myanmar’s most valuable non-renewable resource. Not surprisingly, military-affiliated companies get a decent slice of the profitable action: issuing mine licensing and permits, running auctions and controlling a share of every mine. Cartier’s announcement leaves LVMH-owned Bulgari leading the field of luxury jewellery brands funnelling funds to a military widely reported to be engaged in extrajudicial beheadings of its own people. Although Bulgari was boycotting gems from Myanmar at one time (in line with US and EU bans on such imports), that seems to have been quietly abandoned. The company’s current collection prominently features Burmese sapphires, rubies and jade, and supermodels such as Bella Hadid have recently stepped out on the red carpet weighed down by these gems. Although Bulgari has not commented on the campaign, its website states its commitment to conducting its business in “a socially responsible manner, a commitment that also extends beyond the confines of the company, to the promotion of ethical standards and socially responsible management practices throughout its entire supply chain”. In this regard it clearly needs reminding of its own high-minded principles. In Myanmar in 2017 “responsible jewellery practices” can easily be summed up: Bulgari, stop buying gems from a regime responsible for slaughtering thousands upon thousands of its own citizens. SumOfUs members are campaigning alongside the International Campaign for the Rohingya to cut off this income stream to the Burmese military. We want all jewellery corporations to stop selling items containing gems mined, processed or traded by companies owned by the Burmese army – and to be transparent about the approach they are taking to make sure they are monitoring their commitment properly. Our members will also be calling upon trade bodies to make a clear stand against gem-sourcing from Myanmar. Bulgari and its peers can hardly claim to be surprised by the most recent escalation of violence in Myanmar. The abuse of the Rohingya people in the country is nothing new: they have been described as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. Human Rights Watch reports that laws made in 1982 “effectively deny to the Rohingya the possibility of acquiring a nationality”. In Myanmar, eight “national races” are recognised. Rohingya is not one of them, despite a history in the country that goes back at least as far as the 8th century. Rohingya people also face restrictions on freedom of movement and access to state education and civil service jobs. Founded in 1884, the Italian jewellery and luxury goods brand of Bulgari has a history of protecting the vulnerable from persecution. During the second world war, the Bulgaris hid three Jewish women in their home during the raid of the Roman ghetto in October 1943. Bulgari also joined the boycott of gems from Myanmar in 2007 in response to crackdowns on pro-democracy protesters by the military. But all that has changed since the company was taken over by LVMH in 2011 – a French luxury goods company that also owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Moët &amp; Chandon. Instead of protecting the vulnerable, Bulgari is now aiding the persecution of the Rohingya Muslims. It is hard to reckon with the catastrophic losses represented by the Rohingya crisis. In the immediate term, few of the 340,000 Rohingya children who have been displaced to refugee camps in Bangladesh can rely on stable food supplies, water or healthcare. In the longer term, the disruption to their education and the lasting effects of the trauma of witnessing genocidal violence has the potential to diminish their lives far into the future: 12,000 additional children arrive in camps every week. The situation in Myanmar is complex, and finding ways to unpick centuries of conflict and persecution will not be straightforward. Far easier, however, is to take clear steps towards cutting off financing to the forces that continue to abuse the Rohingya people in Myanmar. There is a long and shameful tradition of corporations being slow to disentangle themselves from genocidal regimes. It is time for Bulgari, and other jewellers, to follow Cartier’s example. • Hannah Lownsbrough is executive director of SumOfUs, an organisation using people power to hold the biggest companies in the world to account"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/31/goodbye-europe-review-brexit-jacob-rees-mogg","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T12:00:29Z","webTitle":"Goodbye Europe review – nice but irrelevant anthology of Brexit essays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/31/goodbye-europe-review-brexit-jacob-rees-mogg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/31/goodbye-europe-review-brexit-jacob-rees-mogg","fields":{"headline":"Goodbye Europe review – nice but irrelevant anthology of Brexit essays","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This Brexit anthology is a genuinely odd undertaking.

A National Audit Office report said the Home Office had limited means of tracking the strategy’s progress, an “incomplete picture” of the crime, victims and perpetrators, and that prosecution rates last year remained “very low”. The report warned: “Until the government is able to establish effective oversight of the modern slavery system as a whole, it will not be able to significantly reduce the prevalence of modern slavery or show that it is achieving value for money”. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said that while the strategy had helped to establish the scale and international nature of the issue, a stronger grasp of the problem was required. “To combat modern slavery successfully,” said Morse, “government will need to build much stronger information and understanding of perpetrators and victims than it has now.” In 2016, there were 80 prosecutions under the Modern Slavery Act for 155 offences, the report found. The government announced the modern slavery strategy three years ago, and the prime minister introduced the Modern Slavery Act in 2015 to combat slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking, and to protect victims. There are an estimated 10-13,000 potential victims in the UK, most frequently subjected to labour or sexual exploitation, or domestic servitude. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, described the Home Office as dysfunctional and said the NAO report painted a damning picture of the government’s strategy to end modern slavery. She said: “It is clear that the government doesn’t have a true picture of the scale of the problem, or the perpetrators or the victims. “The NAO also takes the Home Office to task for failing to get a grip on the effectiveness of its spending, or even how much money is spent overall. Overstretched police forces also have highly uneven responses to cases of modern slavery. “Theresa May’s warm words about modern slavery are not enough. The government needs to take strong, coordinated action based on firm evidence.” The NAO report said the Home Office does not know how much money is being spent, or whether services meet care quality standards. It called into question measures taken to support victims. Safe houses for potential victims are not subject to care quality inspections or standards, and there remains “much more to do” to ensure they are protected, said the authors. Rights groups said the government’s lack of coherence meant victims were too afraid to come forward, as they could not be guaranteed support. Kate Roberts, of the Human Trafficking Foundation, said: “It’s frustrating that the higher-level rhetoric is not filtering down to an adequate service that victims can trust. If you are trying to gain the confidence of a victim you need to tell them what they can expect from the system, not that they might get support and might not. It’s very difficult for advocates to get the victims’ trust.” The NAO report highlighted shortcomings in the national referral mechanism (NRM), the framework for identifying victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and facilitating appropriate support. The authors found that delays in determining individual cases caused “distress and anxiety” to vulnerable people. Professor Kevin Bales of the University of Nottingham, co-founder of Free the Slaves, said: “I don’t see this as a failing report card, I see it as a check-up.” “Compared to virtually everyone else, the UK is ahead of the game. The difficulty for the government is not estimating the numbers but determining how you measure progress. It need a joined-up methodology, with built in evaluation and monitoring.” In a separate development on Monday, MPs called on the government “to be brave enough” to stand up for modern slavery victims. A report by the work and pensions committee found “inexcusable failures” by the UK left victims destitute while their abusers go free. Commenting on the government’s response to the report, Frank Field, the committee’s chairman, said it failed to measure up to the prime minister’s leadership on the issue. “The government should be brave enough to stand up for the victims of modern slavery, people made so vulnerable by such evil behaviour,” he said. The independent anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, welcomed the report. He said significant progress had established the UK as a “world leader” in the fight against modern slavery, but that more needed to be done. “The Home Office has begun to address a number of the issues raised, including plans to significantly improve support for victims by reforming the NRM,” said Hyland. “I look forward to the government intensifying action following the findings and recommendations of this report.” Additional reporting by Rod Austin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/18/meghan-markle-prince-harry-memorabilia-engagement","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T15:47:25Z","webTitle":"A nation of mugs?

From people who want to gawp. Where can I buy the stuff? Everywhere. Amazon has Meghan Markle masks, lifesize cardboard cutouts of the couple, porcelain thimbles and cupcake decorations for the street party you are probably already organising. Ebay has mugs, badges, T-shirts and tea towels. Even the Queen is getting in on the act, selling Meghan-related merchandise at Sandringham. Seems rather low-rent for the reigning monarch. As Ingrid Seward of Majesty magazine says: “It’s tacky but clever. They are cashing in, but, the way they see it, everyone else is doing it.” What about the mystery of the monarchy?

Stormzy Big for Your Boots This is sort of the physical manifestation of a really well-timed mic drop, a greasy lump of braggadocio. Sadly, Stormzy’s byword-for-cool, easily-understood-by-lads-in-marketing appeal means the enamel of Big for Your Boots is slowly being worn off one advert at a time, starting and ending with Kevin Bacon playing it in that bad EE one about the aeroplanes.

Despacito is the ultimate party song/summer banger, ruined by the fact that it is both the sound of salty South America and of five PR girls from Balham trying to slutdrop while saying, “Dorito”. Rag‘n’Bone Man Human Harsh for me, a grease monolith pulsing beneath the streets of London, to say, but Rag’n’Bone Man looks as if he sleeps on a mattress on the floor and operates a low-profit enterprise selling squidgy resin to schoolchildren from the comfort of his cherry-pitted sofa. Somehow, he is not any of those things but is your nan’s favourite singer.

Sign of the Times was a strong start to a solo career but was then followed by No 58-charting Two Ghosts, and suddenly Styles’s PR blitz of appearing on every single American talkshow at once while wearing a floral shirt and looking lightly surprised felt like a massive waste of time.

The sloping field by the grey limestone edifices of Pipewell Hall is crowned with a variety of trees, some fairly ancient, and a medley of a dozen horses and ponies come over to say hello; each in turn blowing gusts of warm breath on to the back of my hand, some lingering to gently nuzzle or allow a brief stroke. A Cistercian community, St Mary de Divisis Abbey, was established here in 1143. The monastery and cloisters were surrounded by many facilities – an infirmary, a bakery, a granary, a brewhouse, a quarry, a cemetery, a watermill, carp ponds and refuse pits. A little further to the west the community built one of the first English windmills. This was a thriving, bustling and progressive place, at the forefront of technology, clearing forest and selling timber to create a little agrarian idyll. King Richard I chose the abbey as the location for his first Great Council, just two weeks after his coronation in September 1189. Decorated tiles found here show hunting with dogs, and King John, Richard’s younger brother, was known to hunt in Rockingham Forest. But decline started in the 1280s, as the oak was overexploited and became harder to obtain; the value of timber was also falling. Another king, Henry VIII, eliminated the abbey in 1538, leaving only impressions in the ground. Pipewell is today a small hamlet of 15 scattered houses, the hill to the south-east topped with magnificent white wind turbines, bringing renewable power back to the valley. To the north of the village, running east-west, is Pipewell Wood, a two mile-long site of special scientific interest. The varied woodland includes extensive hazel coppice and oak standards that resound to the crowing and squawks of pheasants, signs of a more recent hunting history. Oaks are still felled and sold, their hulks resting in rows. Above the wood a grim-looking watchtower provides a vantage point for shooting deer; it gives the wood the air of a wildlife concentration camp.

As literary autobiographies go, it was a rather peculiar exercise and the peculiarity lay not in any procedural weirdness or beetle-browed obsession with settling scores, but in a reluctance to entertain the notion of its subject’s personal myth. For literary memoirs, a brisk survey of the genre insists, are hardly ever about what really happens to the people whose names appear on their jackets. They are far more likely to be about what those people think happens to them or how they wish to be regarded by the readers who buy their work. Anthony Powell, for example, and despite compelling evidence to the contrary, always imagined himself to be “a poor boy made good”. Lodge, on the other hand, offered the highly unusual spectacle of a creative writer simply setting down, with sometimes disarming lack of guile, how he had come to be the person he was. Not that his account of an early manhood spent climbing the rungs of the postwar academic ladder lacked historical resonance. From the outset, the author of Changing Places (1975), How Far Can You Go? (1980) and Nice Work (1988) revealed himself to be a classic example of the archetype defined by Richard Hoggart’s sociological classic The Uses of Literacy (1957): the scholarship boy from the modest home – the Lodges came from grimy south-east London – for whom a knowledge of English literature is not only the door into an imaginative world but a crucial stopping-off point on the path to upward social mobility. Naturally, there are differences between twentysomething Dr Lodge, struggling for academic advancement and fretting over his early novels, and fortysomething Professor Lodge, proud author of The Modes of Modern Writing (1977). Most obviously, our man stops being the kind of person whom, half a century before, HG Wells would have enjoyed writing about and turns into the sharpest of professional operators. The novels go mainstream, win prizes and get filmed by the BBC, while the academic life, as well as furnishing raw material, turns into a globe-trotting cavalcade of British Council jollies, James Joyce symposiums in Zurich and earnest colloquia on narrative theory and the poetics of fiction. To do Lodge justice, he occasionally seems uneasy about one or two of the gravy train aspects of the bygone academic life (the record is a 16-flight, 23-day itinerary from 1986) and wonders whether some of the reviewers who sniffed at the peripatetic lifestyle laid bare in Small World (1984) might not have had a point. Meanwhile, a dilemma-strewn professional life – he eventually takes early retirement from the University of Birmingham – has its personal counterpoint and for every Whitbread prize there is the problem of an ageing parent, a Down’s syndrome son or an increasingly less plausible Catholic faith. Style-wise, it has to be said that Writer’s Luck does occasionally reprise the earlier volume’s habit of earnestly conveying information about the literary life that even outsiders might regard as faintly obvious. “Nowadays with computer software a writer can effortlessly produce the simulacrum of a printed book from the very first draft and much of the defamiliarising effect of the traditional process has been lost,” he ventures at one stage. “Another way for an author to measure the effectiveness of work in progress is show it to others,” he notes, a paragraph later, at which point I scribbled the words “No, really?” in the margin. To balance this is a wonderfully Pooterish description of his sidling into a showing of Deep Throat in mid-1970s Toulouse, where the juxtaposition of hardcore porn and shots of fireworks exploding furnish another example “of the binary opposition between metonymy and metaphor”, on which Lodge the academic is so keen, and a high degree of astuteness about the literary world on to whose cash-strewn beach he is so providentially thrown up. As he notes, the period 1980-2000 was a boom time for the literary novelist, a kind of superlatively funded creative paradise where bumper advances, newly fashionable book prizes and media absorption made household names out of writers who in the past would have been confined to the highbrow margin. As for that prize culture, Lodge includes an account of the 1989 Booker deliberations, which famously led to Martin Amis’s London Fields being excluded from the shortlist by what can only be described as an anti-Amis pincer movement fronted by the novelist Maggie Gee and the academic Helen McNeil. I happened to be involved in a TV discussion that night in which Lodge took part and can testify to the air of abject gloom he brought to the proceedings. But the real eye-opener from that judging panel is not the fact that Gee and McNeil should have ganged up on London Fields but Lodge’s revelation that McNeil sternly informed him that among her criteria for a good novel was that “it must be ideologically correct”. I’m glad none of my children ever wandered into her seminar class. • Writer’s Luck: A Memoir 1976-1991 by David Lodge is published by Harvill Secker (£25).

New observations of the cigar-shaped body found evidence for a deep surface layer that formed when organic ices – such as frozen carbon dioxide, methane and methanol – that make up the object were battered by the intense radiation that exists between the stars. The 400-metre-long object is the first confirmed interstellar body to visit our solar system. It was spotted in October by researchers on the Pan-Starrs telescope in Hawaii after it barrelled past the sun on its way through. The name is taken from the Hawaiian word for “messenger” or “scout”. The deep outer crust may have formed on the body over millions or even billions of years and gives ‘Oumuamua a dark red colour, according to researchers who investigated the object with the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands and the European Southern observatory in Chile’s Atacama desert. “This is a slowly spinning skyscraper-shaped object with a greyish-red surface crust and potentially ice in its heart,” said Michele Bannister, a planetary astronomer who worked on the observations at Queen’s University in Belfast. When carbon-rich ice is baked in interstellar radiation, it creates a layer of “organic gunk,” she added. The coating may explain why ‘Oumuamua did not billow clouds of gas and dust when it swept past the sun earlier this year, well inside the orbit of Mercury. Most comets shed vast plumes of gas when they are heated as they swing past the sun, including comet 67P which the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission chaperoned around the sun in 2015. “It may well be that this object is icy inside,” said Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer on the team at Queen’s University. “If the surface layer is a few tens of centimetres thick, then any ice underneath would not have been heated enough by the sun, because it takes time for the heat pulse to travel through.” The astronomers began watching ‘Oumuamua days after it was first discovered when it was more than 40 million miles away and travelling at 130,000 miles per hour. The telescopes found no signs of rocky minerals or ice on the surface, but did find evidence for the carbon-rich crust. “This surface layer is what happens if you take comet ices and comet dust grains and bake them with high energy particles for millions or even billions of years,” said Fitzsimmons. The researchers went on to compare the measurements of ‘Oumuamua with those taken from asteroids and comets circling in our own solar system. They found that ‘Oumuamua resembles the so-called Trojan asteroids near Jupiter, but also objects in the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, the most distant planet in the solar system. “Our observations are very consistent with this having started life as an icy body in its own system, similar to those found in the Kuiper belt or around Jupiter,” Fitzsimmons said. Details of the work are published in the journal Nature Astronomy. Last week, astronomers on an alien-hunting project known as Breakthrough Listen used the huge Green Bank telescope in West Virginia to monitor ‘Oumuamua for radio signals in case it happened to be a passing spacecraft, and not an interstellar asteroid after all. To date, no signs of intelligence have been found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/28/white-fang-review-park-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T00:00:31Z","webTitle":"White Fang review – Jack London's wild tale inspires teen rebel's quest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/28/white-fang-review-park-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/28/white-fang-review-park-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"White Fang review – Jack London's wild tale inspires teen rebel's quest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jethro Compton’s play White Fang is set in the Yukon, north-west Canada, in 1898 – the height of the Klondike gold rush. A couple of the characters share the names of those in Jack London’s eponymous novel and it does indeed feature a wolf, a puppet designed by Eric Davis that is the best thing in the show. Otherwise, this drama bears minimal resemblance to London’s original tale. The wild creature here is a rebellious teenage girl, Lyzbet (Mariska Ariya), whose tribe were massacred by white settlers. She has been raised by Weedon Scott (Robert G Slade), whom she calls grandfather. Lyzbet faces prejudice and is questioning her identity. She takes refuge in hunting on the land she loves in the company of her faithful wolf and she strikes up a spiky friendship with another young woman, Curly (Bebe Sanders). But Lyzbet’s world is about to be rocked. Beauty Smith (Paul Albertson) wants to buy the land Scott owns, which is sacred to the indigenous people, cut down the forest and mine the earth. He’s not going to allow anyone to stand in his way, particularly not a teenage aboriginal girl, who he thinks should be sent to one of the residential schools established by the Canadian government’s Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to “take the Indian out of the child”. The residential schools were responsible for the abuse and death of thousands of aboriginal children in what Canada’s recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission described as a policy of “cultural genocide”. The show, which focuses on Lyzbet, might be described as cultural appropriation, but it is heartfelt as it brings to light a story that should be more widely known. It does so with some narrative verve, even if the play occasionally tips into melodrama. It doesn’t help that the characters lack moral complexity – they are either very good or very bad – although the relationship between Lyzbet and Curly is deftly handled. The staging, however, is not. The space does the production few favours, leading to clumsy transitions and a stop-start jerkiness that often leaches the dramatic tension and undoes all the good work done by Jonny Sims’ atmospheric soundtrack. • At Park theatre, London, until 13 January.

People back home kept on telling me that the royals are racist but I asked Har and he said Philip adores his trips to the colonies. Really, really love it here. So turns out the house used to be Kate and Wills’. And theirs is bigger. WTF. Still need to get a juicer. Wow I used to love the Daily Mail but they are SUPER mean! It’s like they have a whole team of people dedicated to digging through my past! So it turns out the Daily Mail have a whole team of people dedicated to digging through my past! Har said we could totally sue them if they keep publishing old pics. Love my man! Totally bonding with Kate. She’s, like, always pregnant, which is a bit worrying!? But super fun. I met Pippa, too. Seems kind of moody. Pretty though! In the States we’ve only ever seen her from behind. Quit Suits but I’m totally going to quit Twitter, too. Everyone is being so mean about my divorce. Harry says divorcees are hot and that I’m like Wallis Simpson in WE. I love that film! She had the cutest hats. Hope I get to meet Madonna soon. So yeah they already deleted my Twitter for me. Apparently I’m too “outspoken” about Hillary and Trump and Brexit. My lady in waiting has taken the wifi code until I agree to “stay neutral”. Shit here’s like The Circle. Met Harry’s grammy today! She’s super sweet and short, but keeps calling me Miss Merkel by mistake. Like, I get it, she’s old and stuff but like I told Mom, I’m not the German here. They also told me not to call her Grammy. We’ll see :) Really hope I get to meet Madonna. Filmed my last episode of Suits today. Squeal! Can’t wait to be a wifey. I’m so bored. Today I decided to familiarise myself with British culture, because we’ll be travelling around a lot (um that wasn’t in the brochure, Harry!), so I’m watching King Ralph, Grand Designs and something called Currie, which is a show about a street. I also downloaded Monarch Of The Glen, which looked cute, but Harry thinks that it’ll be kind of pointless soon. Should really go to sleep but I’m 368 pictures deep into Cressida’s Instagram and I can’t stop. God she’s pretty. Stupid name though. Harry said he’s going to roast a chicken, but think I’m going to go vegan. Need to tell Har. Brits are so weird. I miss Suits. Notes on a scandal (or how to teach an old dog new tricks): Coco Khan takes a peek at the Weinstein Company’s upcoming diversity day Dear all, 2017 has been the Weinstein Company’s most difficult year, and has resulted in company-wide soul-searching – especially for us, in HR. The world will be looking at TWC for years to come, and it’s crucial that we uphold the highest standards in terms of dignity for our employees, and ensuring diversity across the company. We have a lot to do. With this in mind, please find the agenda of TWC’s diversity day. Attendance is compulsory for all current employees. Please also extend the invitation to any previous employees, any new starters, and any known associates. Please also accept this agenda as my formal resignation. I know that after this diversity day, some of our execs may find it hard to process the new rules of engagement. There will be pain, sadness, even anger. And I cannot be doing with that. If I wanted to spend my life working with fully grown men whose feelings are hurt because they can’t be as big of an asshole any more, I would be working in the Trump administration. Yours sincerely, Pissed-off HR lady AGENDA Coffee and pastries You’re going to need your strength. Opening remarks (pending) Harvey Weinstein has requested to open our diversity day with remarks sent via Skype. We are currently considering the practicalities of this since IT’s network update included a bullshit firewall. Your place or mine? How not to arrange a meeting While the stressful demands of the film executive industry (extremely high pay, royalty-levels of glamour, copious amounts of champagne) mean it may be more convenient (for you, of course) to arrange a meeting at a private residence or hotel room, we would advise all our execs to keep meetings in professional locations. This is so all our actors feel safe and secure during their audition of “topless-for-no-reason woman who has one line, then dies”. Impulse control with a special guest! In a world where touching knees, and comments about human women having actual breasts, seem totally irresistible, how can we expect the industry to change so quickly? In this session you will marvel at how quickly an old dog can learn new tricks, with our special guest Lassie – an old dog who will, quite literally, learn new tricks before your very eyes. One isn’t enough: how to cast people of colour Effective and progressive casting of people of colour is not simply about fleeting glimpses of brown faces on screen. We need also to consider characterisation and screen time, and be mindful of propping up negative stereotypes. In this session we will be hearing from various campaigners who specialise in media representation of marginalised groups. We will also visit a local pub and run script lines by a mumbling drunk man to check the racist factor. Remember: if he laughs, cut the line. “But what you might not know about Woody Allen’s work is...” This session tackles mansplaining, a phenomenon in which men explain ideas and concepts to women they already know, or maybe even created themselves. This very short session asks men one question: does she actually know this? Answer: she probably does. That’s why we hired her. Home time No, of course we’re not doing drinks. *** The generals’ farewell to Robert Mugabe (cc-ed to Stuart Heritage) 19 Nov 2017 From: The Office of Robert Mugabe To: bcc all Subject: Some news Hi all, Sorry for the mass email, but a development has occurred. As many of you will have heard, after a rightsizing of our core competencies across the board, our president of 37 years (non-consecutive) Robert Mugabe has decided to retire from his post. Having created some of this country’s most beloved laws, like the violent overthrow of white-run farms, capping the rate of hyperinflation at a rate of 79.6 billion per cent and the ability to run for an unlimited number of terms, he will now spend more time with his wife, who has coincidentally also made the decision to step down as quasi vice-president. As we’re sure you’ll be aware, we’re really going to miss having Robert around, so we’re planning to see him off with a bit of a do. A card is currently going around the place, so if you could all sign it (Susan – don’t steal the pen this time!), plus there’ll be a Colin the Caterpillar cake on the photocopier for everyone to enjoy later this afternoon. We’re also looking for some funny party songs about the revolution and/or widespread voter fraud – if anyone has any, please drop them into the Google Doc attached. There won’t be any speeches (if you know Robert, you’ll know how much he loves to warble on!) and the party will finish at 3pm sharp, so as not to contravene the terms of Robert’s house arrest. Thanks guys, The assorted generals of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces *** David Attenborough narrates Priti Patel’s hasty return from Nairobi (as overheard by Stuart Heritage) Nairobi. A major migratory hub for many species of bird. And now, the most spectacular migration of them all. The KQ100 Kenya Airways Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, taking flight from Jomo Kenyatta International to Heathrow. Onboard, cowed and ashamed, is secretary of state for international development Priti Patel. Until now, Patel has enjoyed a charmed life. Member of parliament for Witham. Minister of state for employment. And yet she is undone. Caught by a most ferocious predator: an undeclared lobbying trip to Israel sneaked in to a family holiday. Now, summoned back to her natural territory by her pack’s dominant female, she faces an uncertain future. Some 22,000 internet users are tracking the trajectory of the plane on Flightradar24, as they speculate on Patel’s fate. She has no idea of this, of course. There is no onboard wifi and passengers are banned from using mobile devices. This is a hostile, unforgiving environment. As she crosses the Sudan-Egypt border, Patel opts to watch Baby Driver. But disaster strikes. Kevin Spacey. She forgot he was in it, and now she feels queasy. Shutting down the movie, Patel calls for a gin and tonic and spends the rest of the flight staring at her knees. It has been a difficult journey, but the hardest part is yet to come. An ambush by a BBC helicopter, following her journey through Osterley to Downing Street. The whole world is watching her crawl to her doom. Quietly, Patel resolves that she should just go to Majorca for her next holiday, like everyone else does. *** George Osborne becomes London’s paper boy. Exclusive by Stuart Heritage Hi Evgeny, it’s Osborne here. I’ve been thinking. You know how I recommended Matthew d’Ancona to you for the post of Evening Standard editor? Well, listen, I think I should get the job instead. Now, bear with me. I know I don’t have any experience in the newspaper industry, and I’m still a serving MP, plus I’ve got about three dozen other jobs that could realistically be deemed a conflict of interest, and you only have to put my name into Twitter’s GIF search to see that I struggle with tasks as basic as talking to children. However, I am definitely the man for the job. As a rich, white, privately educated man, I already have plenty in common with 90% of journalists. But in many ways, I’m also just a regular Londoner. I’m a Remainer. I hold down several jobs (speaking and advisory) just to stay afloat. Under my leadership this common touch would be reflected in the paper’s outlook. I’d refocus Property to feature only sub-£15m bargains. I’d hire the most working class person I know – Credit Suisse vice-chairman the Hon Edward Sebastian Grigg – to write a lifehack column. We’d run relatable listicles about inheritance tax loopholes and Zone 1 superbasement contractors. Plus, if you think I’m stabbing Matthew in the back here, just wait till you see what I do to my own party when you put me in charge of a newspaper.

All roads lead back to austerity and the gradual chipping away at the size and significance of government. This Tory project has succeeded. Warm words in Theresa May’s election manifesto were instantly forgotten after the general election. One million jobs have gone from the public sector since 2010 and public employment, at 17% of total UK employment, is at its lowest since the second world war. (The rush to fill the cavities opened by Brexit does nothing to counteract the effects of successive budgets from George Osborne and Philip Hammond.) However mean, spending cuts aren’t the public sector’s principal problem. Downsizing the state has been accompanied by fragmentation, encouraging service managers to snarl and fight with one another, or transfer their work to outside companies. Take the Grenfell Tower fire. First responders were magnificent and the follow up, especially with regard to the psychological consequences for residents, showed NHS staff at their best. But Grenfell also exhibited the disjointed, uncommunicative nature of public services and the effects of outsourcing and arm’s-length management. We’re as far away as ever from public services that really focus on individuals, let alone households or communities. Work and pensions pass the welfare buck to underfunded councils, who are in turn suspicious if not downright hostile to the NHS. Fire officers’ connections with local authority housing departments are haphazard, with no one looking at emergency services in the round. Council, trust and agency budgets are jealously demarcated and protected. The Grenfell inquiry won’t even begin to ask about the new public management doctrine, which told public bodies to “steer, not row” and which has pushed much public service delivery to profit-seeking firms or devolved bodies, leaving accountability in tatters and the public befuddled over who does what. Nobody else will ask questions about the bigger picture on public services, either. The National Audit Office nibbles at specific instances of contract failure. But professional bodies and sector associations are silent or cowed. Where’s the wide-ranging, syncretic look at what has been pulling public services apart for 30 years and still continues (witness the recent decision by Lancashire county council to award a major public health contract to Virgin)? Public services have no champion, no vocal, identifiable spokesperson – no one prepared to put their head above the parapet when ideologues and mercenary hacks take pot shots. The cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, is hardly a commanding presence in Whitehall, let alone in the wider public sphere; he spends his time running a fractious, Brexit-fixated cabinet for which the welfare of the nation(s) was long ago neglected in the cause of preserving the Tory party. Of course, “running” is not quite the right word. We’re as unsure now as we were in January about Whitehall management and the Treasury’s role. So 2017 ends as it began, with urgent, unanswered questions about both services and how government is organised. No point in looking to parliament for scrutiny and oversight when committee chairs are consumed by partisanship. As for much talked-about better “evidence for policy”, look at Brexit and the silent impotence of officials when their ministers lie. Do civil servants really have no constitutional identity other than fetchers and carriers for squabbling, shortsighted ministers? In which case, how on earth is Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office head of propriety and ethics, able to sit in judgement on the ethics of those selfsame ministers? Many marvelled at the corkscrew nature of public managers when Andrew Travers, the point man for Tory Barnet’s radical deconstruction of services, turned up as chief executive of Labour Lambeth. Looking at that wider public space, no one could call either the prime minister or the leader of the opposition localists. Neither seems interested in addressing the long run question of giving council funding a secure, buoyant base.The latest finance settlement for local government is a confusing compendium of grants and freedoms, with the centre retaining an iron grip on council tax increases: paying for social care remains a yawning chasm Yet the year’s bright spots must include the election of city-region executive mayors. Despite limited powers, the two Andys, Burnham and Street, and the other regional mayors, may show that England’s conurbations can heal fragmentation and show leadership. Change does not necessarily follow the logic of events and formal decisions. Look below the surface. This year, despite penury, public services have become more diverse, more conscious of the need to recognise minority talent. The #MeToo movement matters in councils and government department as well, and the past year, gloomy as it has been, has seen consciousness of gender discrimination grow along with awareness that public services simply cannot afford the sheer neglect of women’s talent under present arrangements. Maybe 2018 will see further, albeit incremental steps towards greater equality. Sign up for your free Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with comment and sector views sent direct to you every month.

In his new painting Red Man (Sings Calypso) (2017) a colossal figure stands on a golden beach, his bare – reddish – torso framed by the black iron structure of a coastguard’s platform. The sea is a green band flecked with daubs of white. The pale blue sky is hollowed out by puffy cloud shapes. On the ground, a man lounges in shades with a boa constrictor wrapped around him. Is it a pet or is it strangling him? In the Greek legend of the Trojan War, the priest Laocoön and his sons were strangled on the beach by giant snakes. The man with the snake in Doig’s painting looks like the doomed Laocoön as depicted in classical art. Doig was a friend and collaborator with Derek Walcott, the Nobel prize-winning Caribbean poet who died this year and whose epic work Omeros transposes the myths of Homer to the West Indies. Doig’s new paintings are similarly Homeric, or Walcottian. He sees his Trinidad home as a place of giants, monsters, blind singers. Red Man (Sings Calypso) is a big painting, nearly three metres tall. The “red man” in it is a heroic male nude who knows exactly how impressive his muscles look. Doig got this image from an old photograph of the film star Robert Mitchum, who spent time in Trinidad and in 1957 released an album of Calypso songs. This narcissistic colossus blindly sings his calypsos while the figure behind him on the beach seems to be dying in the coils of a snake. Is the Mitchum figure a tourist in paradise, blind to the inequalities and injustices beyond his bubble of beautiful privilege? You can’t accuse Doig of being blind like that. In other works he broods on the yellow walls of a prison in Port of Spain, Trinidad’s capital. It becomes a desolate stage set in these images of a brightly coloured blankness interrupting life. In Rain in the Port of Spain (White Oak) a mangy lion parades in front of the lemon-coloured prison wall. It is the Rastafarian Lion of Judah. Someone has painted this defiant graffiti on the prison and it has come to life – proud but hungry. Does it bring redemption? In Carnival Hat, a man leans listlessly against the yellow wall, hopeless in his red hat. These paintings have the ghostly stillness of Giorgio de Chirico’s empty piazzas frozen in time. They are brand new, yet for me evoke poems written thousands of years ago. The world Doig paints glows with an inner fire, an ecstatic vision. He can explain every detail in almost banal terms – the Laocoön-like figure apparently struggling with a snake is, he tells me, in reality a portrait of a friend who posed with a friendly serpent one day on the beach. Yet all the memories and references that end up in Doig’s paintings are transfigured into a bright palette of dreams. This is imaginative art of the highest order. Two Trees, the grandest and most glorious of the new masterpieces that fill this exhibition, is a monumental seaside scene more than three and a half metres wide. The two trees that rise up in front of a violet sky look like the tentacles of a giant sea monster. The tendrils and leaves that sprout from their twisting forms have mutated into lethal suckers in phosphorescent, lurid colours. The bright yellow top covered with a gaudy floral design worn by a helmeted hockey player in the foreground is just as unsettling. Doig’s colours create emotions that can’t be put into words. Two Trees is not about trees. It is about violence, and the ease with which it can become normal. He says he got the image of the hockey player from a hockey team he saw in New York who were all wearing desert camouflage. Meanwhile at the centre of the scene, a young man’s downward gaze refers to a killing that took place in his own neighbourhood. A third character, toting a video camera, alludes to the chilling phenomenon of people filming death and disaster instead of trying to help. So Doig explains, but even without knowing any of that you feel the bejewelled tragic irony of this modern masterpiece.

This year begins more cheerily, with an excellent dupe from an unexpected source. Launching later this month, Clarins’ SOS To Boost Radiance (30ml) is the standout winner in a new range of six oil-free, colour- and skin-correcting primers (Clarins’ previous primer offering? One slightly crude silicone balm in a pot, so it was high time for a rethink). It strokes on smoothly without bobbling and peeling, and gives skin tones up to mid-brown a blurring, ethereal sort of glow without looking ghostly; for deeper tones, I love Mac’s Prep &amp; Prime Natural Radiance Primer in Radiant Yellow (£30 for 50ml). The Clarins is designed to go under foundation, certainly, but I’m a huge fan of primers worn alone, with a little concealer dotted over the top. It’s exactly the sort of look I want at this time of year, when I’ve eaten too much cheese, have spent too much time indoors, and grown weary of festive glitter and heavy colour, and would like a lighter, fresher look for the seasonal shift. If you like the idea of a radiant finish, but are wedded to your current primer and foundation, the answer lies in Lancôme’s new Custom Glow Drops (£26 for 15ml), in four shades for all skin tones, which launches this month. Lancôme aren’t the innovators here – several brands already make little bottles of glowy drops to be mixed into foundation or moisturiser to add healthy-looking glow – but these are, I think, the most user-friendly so far, mixing well with all the skincare and makeup I tried, then blending smoothly and prettily on the skin without any of the chalkiness common in high-concentration liquid pigments. I find two drops about right for a full face of glow without glitz. If the idea of any shimmer or sparkle immediately turns you off (and I know there are a great many of you out there), get instant, glimmer-free glow from Nars’ superlative Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturiser SPF30 (£29.50 for 50ml). Way more than a mere skin tint, it has great coverage, a rich yet oil-free texture, superior sun protection, and it can be slapped on with near-zero skill. It’s still unfailingly the first thing I grab when drab."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/23/from-trump-to-brexit-2017-was-the-mourning-after-the-year-before","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"From Trump to Brexit, 2017 was the mourning after the year before","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/23/from-trump-to-brexit-2017-was-the-mourning-after-the-year-before","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/23/from-trump-to-brexit-2017-was-the-mourning-after-the-year-before","fields":{"headline":"From Trump to Brexit, 2017 was the mourning after the year before","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If 2016 was the year the democratic world went on a wild bender, 2017 was the year of the hangover. It was when we woke, slumped on the floor, still in yesterday’s clothes, heads pounding, to see how badly we’d trashed the room the night before. It was the year in which we contemplated the damage done, feared what more was yet to come – and searched out glimmers of hope that, somehow, we might avoid the worst. But it was also the year in which troubles that had been stored up years or decades earlier – some ignored, others denied – burst through the surface, demanding our attention and crying out for something else too: a reckoning long overdue. Start with the two epochal events of 2016 – Brexit and Trump – which dominated 2017. For Britons, departure from the European Union was the all-pervasive backdrop to our politics, overshadowing even a general election which, in normal times, would be the paramount event of the political year, but in the end was shaped by, and helped shape, the course of Brexit. On 29 March, Theresa May ordered a six-page letter to be hand-delivered to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, in which she formally invoked article 50 of the Lisbon treaty of the European Union. “There can be no turning back,” she told the House of Commons. Any voters who had assumed, or even hoped, that their vote in the referendum nine months earlier would be a mere protest, an eloquent but ultimately cost-free two fingers to the establishment, now saw things a little more sharply. Their 2016 move had been no mid-term byelection gesture. May had started the clock on a legally binding process that would end the relationship Britain had had with its neighbours for more than four decades, replacing it with something as yet unknown. But the cold light of day that spread through 2017 did not only reveal Brexit was serious; it also confirmed it would be perilously difficult. We heard fewer of the breezy promises of 2016 – though in July Liam Fox did forecast that the Brexit talks would be “the easiest in human history”. Most Britons saw with their own eyes how hard it would be. The narrative arc of Brexit in 2017 was depressingly simple. Brussels would make a set of demands, at which the British government and its press cheerleaders would howl their derision: “Go whistle,” said Boris Johnson at the notion that the UK would have to settle its obligations to the tune of tens of billions. And then, after a period of weeks or months, reality would sink in and the British government would back down. Thus the year began with a row about the sequencing of the Brexit talks – until May accepted the EU’s insistence that negotiations about the trading future would have to wait till agreement on the first phase had been reached. And that’s how the year ended too – with May finally giving way on the money. At a moment of particular frustration, one Brexiter was heard cursing the UK’s interlocutors. “You never beat Brussels in a negotiation!” You always lose. Which is, of course, why many had long argued that it was better to be inside the world’s biggest trading bloc, benefiting from the EU’s negotiating muscle, than outside, vainly arm-wrestling against it. Meanwhile, we watched as the British economy limped along, its anaemia plain to see by the time of the newly rescheduled autumn budget, in which Philip Hammond had to announce a set of economic forecasts that suggested Britain plc was struggling. Our European neighbours boasted much healthier numbers, which made all the Brexiter talk of a bright future in which British buccaneers would head off into the open seas of international trade sound a tad … hopeful. A motif of the year was the coded message, from this or that titan of international business, hinting at a relocation to, say, Frankfurt. In 2017 it seemed it was Britain itself that stood, in the buzz phrase of the previous year, to be left behind. This wasn’t just a matter of economics. In 2017 it was decided that, for the first time in a history that stretched back to 1922, the international court of justice would do without a British judge, as the UK candidate had to make way for a jurist from India. In 2017, we glimpsed a future Britain punching below its weight. Of course, this is how I see it: I’m a remain voter writing for a pro-remain newspaper. Read the opinion of a leaver in a different paper, and they would tell a different story. For what has not emerged in 2017 is any kind of consensus. Some hoped the referendum would settle the great European question once and for all, and that most remainers would become releavers, reconciled to Brexit. But that hasn’t quite happened. Most polls show the country still divided down the middle, the numbers not much shifted. The result is that in 2017 it often felt as if the 2016 referendum campaign had never ended. Indeed, this year we seemed to be having the debate we should have had last year – drilling down into the detail of single markets, Irish borders and the like – but never did. When May returned from the Easter break to announce, to the surprise of her own party officials, that a general election was to be held on 8 June, that seemed, at last, to be the cue for a great national conversation about Brexit. After all, she had called it in order to win the overwhelming mandate that would allow her to “crush the saboteurs”, in the memorable words of the Daily Mail. The real reason – that the polls gave her such a commanding lead over Labour, the opportunity was too golden to waste – was also related to Brexit. It seemed the 2016 referendum had reshaped the political landscape, with seven in 10 Labour seats having voted leave. Surely there were vast swathes of working-class voters ripe for the plucking, ready to desert Labour for a Tory PM determined to implement the Brexit they had voted for a year earlier. It didn’t turn out that way. One political miscalculation followed another. May’s manifesto was toxic, its stand-out pledge a tax on elderly people with dementia. Her campaign was pitched as presidential, organised entirely around her personality – “Theresa May’s Conservatives” was the slogan – but it turned out she didn’t really have one. The Maybot was born. “Strong and stable” turned out not to be an invincible message but, when repeated ad nauseam, a punchline. Put simply, May was the worst political campaigner in living memory, leading one of the worst ever campaigns. Meanwhile, Labour and Jeremy Corbyn were confounding those who had long been gloomy about his electoral prospects (and, yes, I was one of them). The party’s manifesto was chock full of goodies, from nationalised energy and railways to scrapped tuition fees, which, thanks to a canny bit of leaking, were put in front of the electorate twice. Corbyn proved his campaigning zeal worked not only on the hardcore faithful, but on a much wider audience, especially the young. Thanks to May’s manifesto the election was not about Brexit, which allowed Corbyn to turn it into a referendum on austerity. In TV appearances, he seemed a genial idealist rather than the crazed Bolshevik of tabloid rhetoric. Helped by pro-remain former Tories in places such as Kensington and Canterbury, and by a surge in turnout by the young – not for nothing did Oxford Dictionaries declare “youthquake” the word of the year – Corbyn delivered 2017’s most surprising moment. It came as the clock struck 10pm on 8 June. The TV exit poll showed a hung parliament and from that instant, all that had been solid in UK politics melted into air. May was now weak and unstable; Corbyn was immediately entrenched as the Labour leader for as long as he wanted the job. Since then, and for the rest of 2017, both were seen through that new prism: he as a likely future prime minister, she as a dead woman walking, one who went on to lose three cabinet ministers in just the last two months of the year. That 10pm moment proved that 2016 did not enjoy a monopoly on political volatility. On the contrary, uncertainty is the new certainty. That was no less true in the United States, as 2017 saw congeal into hard fact a two-word phrase that had been part joke, part threat in 2016: President Trump. There seemed to be a change in the global circadian rhythm, whereby the people of the world would start their day by checking to see what new outrage the man in the White House had committed, usually via Twitter. They came in such volume, it was impossible to keep up. Threatening a nuclear conflict with North Korea one day, brawling with a newly bereaved war widow the next (her late husband knew what he had signed up for, Trump told her). Any one of Trump’s actions would, if committed by his predecessor, have been the scandal of the year, dominating media coverage of the presidency for months. (Sacking the head of the FBI over “the Russia thing” was, for example, as clear an example of obstruction of justice as any of the similar deeds that triggered the fall of Richard Nixon.) But with Trump, atrocities came too thick and too fast to be processed properly. One thing we learned in 2017 was that politics has a metabolism, and it simply could not digest the level of outrage Trump was generating. Sharing videos disseminated by a far-right group shunned in Britain should have been a lasting blow to the supposedly “special relationship” between London and Washington, but within a day or two, Trump had done something else appalling and so the political class was compelled to move on. And it’s been that way in America too, whether it’s Trump refusing to shake hands with Angela Merkel as she sat next to him during an Oval Office photo-op, declaring that white supremacist marchers in Charlottesville included “some very fine people” or hinting that a female New York senator had once been willing to trade sexual favours for campaign funds. And those are just three acts of disgrace picked almost at random. In 2017, Trump horror became a kind of insistent backbeat to American and global life. But if Trump and Brexit were aftershocks of the earthquakes of 2016, the other defining events of 2017 were the fruit – much of it bitter – of seeds planted many years earlier. For Britons, perhaps the most haunting image of the year was the dark skyscraper that claimed the lives of 71 people in the summer. The charred remains of Grenfell Tower still loom over west London, and the pain of the survivors of that disaster, many of them still without a permanent place to live, remains raw. For them, the tower is no symbol: it’s the home they’ve lost. But for others, Grenfell Tower is a monument to decades of policy choices that had made the country less fair. Whether it was deregulation, privatisation, austerity or plain inequality, that blaze illuminated some of the decisive shifts of the past three decades. It gave us a glimpse of the society we had become. The flood of testimony that came from women, first in the US and then in Britain, describing the sexual harassment, assault and discrimination they had faced was similar only in this sense: what exploded in 2017 had been brewing for many, many years. It started with the women hounded, and sometimes terrorised, by Harvey Weinstein. At first it was tempting to see Weinstein as a singular monster, but the revelations soon spread further into Hollywood, the media and politics. The star names – Kevin Spacey, Louis CK, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer – kept dropping, and with them the realisation dawned on many men (women knew this already) that such behaviour occurred, in one form or other, in almost every workplace, every industry, every woman’s working life. By the end of 2017, it was not clear if #MeToo would be remembered as a short-lived social media phenomenon or a genuine turning point in the relationship between women and men. But in the US, it played a part in denying Republicans what had been a safe Senate seat, when Roy Moore – accused of molesting women and girls as young as 14 – lost in Alabama. Time magazine anointed the women who had spoken out as their collective Person of the Year and, no less telling, Webster’s dictionary decided its word of the year was … feminism. This focus on both the after-effects of 2016 and the legacies of more distant years left little time or space to digest, or even pay attention to, events beyond our own horizon. (The upheavals in Catalonia, and the potential break-up of Spain, got less global coverage than they were surely due.) And yet for some of the world’s most benighted peoples, 2017 was a year of almost biblical horror. It was that way for the (conservatively) estimated 10,000 Rohingya Muslims murdered, and the 645,000 turned into refugees by the government of Myanmar. And for the 1,340 children killed or seriously injured in Yemen, according to a UN report in October, as well as those simply starving to death in a country gripped by what the UN classifies as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, where three-quarters of the population of 28 million is in dire need of help, thanks in large part to a war where much of the firepower belongs to a coalition led by one of Britain’s closest allies, Saudi Arabia. In Syria, the killing continued for a seventh year. Perhaps even more surprising was the relatively phlegmatic response we gave to the acts of domestic terror that scarred the year. The attacks on Westminster Bridge, at Manchester Arena and in Borough Market in London caused deep grief, of course, and consumed our attention in the immediate aftermath. But they didn’t change the course of our national or international conversation. Was that a sign they were becoming absorbed into our understanding of what was now a new normal? Or another consequence of the fact that we had so much on our plate? In this atmosphere, hope became a scarce and precious commodity. Those who feared yet another victory for nativist populism exhaled with deep relief when Marine Le Pen’s Front National was defeated in France. You didn’t have to be in love with Emmanuel Macron to be glad it was him not her taking over at the Élysée Palace. There were other crumbs of comfort too. That Republican defeat in Alabama and a parliamentary rebellion by a few Tory “mutineers” (that phrase coined by the Telegraph) demanding a “meaningful vote” on Brexit came on the same December day. Both those events suggested all was not lost, that it might just be possible to fight back after all. If we’re looking for a story to tell in 2018, let it be that one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/dec/27/uk-metro-mayors-financial-muscle-andy-burnham-andy-street","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T09:23:13Z","webTitle":"UK metro mayors still don't have the financial muscle they need","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/27/uk-metro-mayors-financial-muscle-andy-burnham-andy-street","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/27/uk-metro-mayors-financial-muscle-andy-burnham-andy-street","fields":{"headline":"UK metro mayors still don't have the financial muscle they need","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amid all the political upheavals following the EU referendum, you could be forgiven for having overlooked one of the most significant developments in UK politics in recent decades: the introduction of metro mayors in six of England’s biggest city regions in May. As Tony Travers, professor at LSE London, argues, this is a radical innovation in England’s heavily centralised political system, taking decision-making out of Whitehall and closer to millions of people in cities across the country. And seven months after taking office, the new mayors are already carving out an important role for themselves in the UK’s political landscape. Their influence has been particularly obvious at the local level. The mayors have been quick off the mark in identifying the big issues their city regions face, and setting out plans to address them. Days after taking office in Greater Manchester, for example, Andy Burnham announced a new fund to tackle the region’s homelessness problem (including donating a chunk of his own mayoral salary). Similarly, in the West Midlands – which has one of the highest shares of working age adults with no qualifications – mayor Andy Street quickly set out a number of initiatives to reduce the number of young people not in education, employment or training to zero by 2020. But the impact of the mayors has also been felt on the national stage. Take, for example, the response of Burnham and Steve Rotheram (Liverpool city region mayor) to the government’s decision in July to scrap the electrification of the Manchester to Leeds train line. The mayors played a crucial role in channelling the frustrations of people living in northern cities, and putting them at the top of the national political agenda – forcing the government to subsequently offer new promises to improve train links across the region. This encapsulates what the new mayors bring to their city regions: high-profile leadership and representation on the issues that matter most to people’s day-to-day lives. Moreover, it is mayors who have led the way in offering democratic accountability for their communities in times of crisis and need. That was particularly evident following the Manchester Arena and Borough Market terrorist attacks, and the Grenfell disaster. In each of those terrible incidents, it was city mayors who provided the leadership and visibility which at times was missing from national leaders. However, the challenges that the new metro mayors face in the coming years should not be underestimated. Their good starts have raised expectations considerably, and as their honeymoon period ends they will be expected to deliver tangible projects and outcomes for their communities. They also face tough and imminent decisions about their budgeting priorities for the future, which are likely to prove contentious in some quarters. These challenges are compounded by the biggest issue holding the mayors back – the limited powers and resources at their disposal. As highlighted in the recent international mayoral summit organised by Centre for Cities (in partnership with Citi and Boston University’s Initiative on Cities), England’s mayors are highly constrained in their control over local tax revenue and how it is spent compared to their counterparts in other countries. They have also faced delays in gaining the powers already promised to them by the government in their initial devolution deals. For example, Street has criticised the Department for Education for postponing the devolution of the adult education budget to the mayors, a key policy area they need control of to improve the economic performance of their city regions. In 2018, the metro mayors will need to continue to use their collective influence to keep the pressure up on the government to go faster and further with devolution. But it’s also critical that the government holds its end of the deal, by acting on the pledges set out in the original devolution deal, and by giving the mayors more of the powers and responsibilities they need – especially over fiscal matters. The capacity of the mayors to deliver in the coming years for the people and places they represent depends on it.

Britain’s largest force was reviewing every rape and sexual abuse case in which someone was charged, which could run into the hundreds, Cdr Richard Smith said. The full review was announced on Tuesday evening after it emerged that two cases were dropped after evidence undermining the police and prosecution case was only revealed to defence lawyers late in the day. Student Liam Allan was cleared last week of multiple counts of rape, and Isaac Itiary, who was charged with raping a child, walked free on Tuesday. Smith, who oversees rape investigations for the Metropolitan police, told the Guardian the force was investigating about 30 rape and sexual abuse cases that were about to go to court, and potentially hundreds of others in which someone has been charged. “We are reviewing all our current cases, prioritising those about to go to court,” as well as cases where “someone has been charged and we are progressing through to prosecution”, Smith said. He said the Met had not engaged in the systemic breaking of a key rule meant to ensure a fair trial, known as disclosure. Police and prosecutors who bring the case are supposed to share material they have with the defence team if it can help the suspect’s case. “I don’t think we have a systemic issue around disclosure failures,” said Smith, who added he did not believe those already convicted in Met sexual assault and rape cases would have grounds for appeal. He said the Met drew a distinction between the two cases that collapsed this week. In the Allan case “we feel something has gone badly wrong there,” Smith said. But in the Itiary case, the Met believed the disclosure system worked as it should. Itiary was charged in July, and on 15 December his defence filed their formal statement of their case. Unused material gathered by police from the complainant’s phone was re-examined and handed to the defence on 17 December. It undermined the prosecution case and on 19 December, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to offer no evidence. Smith said: “Once the defence case statement was received, the officer in the case reviewed the unused material, and identified material he felt had become relevant. It was revealed to the CPS, who told the defence.” He said the review would ask whether disclosure could have happened any sooner. The justice minister Dominic Raab argued that the “basic principle of British justice” was at stake. “The proper disclosure obligations in these two cases have not been discharged, and that is deeply worrying,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.“What we need to know now is quite how widespread that is and why. “This is not a new thing. It should be made easy by technology. It’s a very basic thing why it’s not happening. I do think the CPS and the police do need to have a pretty hard long look in the mirror about this.” The prime minister’s spokesman said: “The two cases which came to light over the past week have obviously raised some serious issues which need to be looked at in greater detail. “The Met is carrying out work and it’s important we don’t seek to prejudge those reviews.” The spokesman said the attorney general last week ordered a review to look at disclosure processes – including codes of practice, guidelines and legislation relating to sexual offences and other types of crime. It is expected to report back in 2018. The National Police Chiefs’ Council said it was addressing recommendations that identified the need to improve disclosure. “We are working with the College of Policing and Crown Prosecution Service to resolve the issues raised,” a spokesperson said. “As part of this we will consider the findings of the Metropolitan police’s review of recent cases of disclosure and the impact of the amount of digital material officers now need to analyse, especially in fraud and sex offence cases.” Smith said detectives were struggling to cope with the large increase in digital material they had to analyse in cases, a situation no one had imagined 20 years ago when disclosure laws were made. “There is a significant challenge around managing disclosure in a digital age,” he said. Angela Rafferty QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, suggested “unconscious bias” stopped the police and the CPS “impartially and thoroughly investigating and scrutinising complaints in sexual offence cases”. “It should be remembered that it is not the job of the police or CPS to judge the truthfulness or otherwise of any allegation made,” she said. “The deluge of sexual allegations in the system is well known. If the criminal justice system is to cope properly then funding must be found to ensure that there are proper investigations, a proper filtering system for cases that have no merit and a proper approach by the police and CPS to disclosure issues.” • This article was amended on 21 December 2017 to correct the spelling of Liam Allan’s surname."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/02/guardian-weekly-letters-mission-for-journalism","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T11:59:27Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 5 January 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/02/guardian-weekly-letters-mission-for-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/jan/02/guardian-weekly-letters-mission-for-journalism","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 5 January 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The building of hope Katherine Viner has reaffirmed that the Guardian Weekly’s mission is to “use clarity and imagination to build hope” (22 December). I could not have put it better and look forward to another year of the Guardian doing just that. However, delivering on this splendid mission might just mean that the Guardian has to contemplate crossing a rather risky Rubicon. I refer to the clarity provided by Larry Elliott in the same edition when he described the reality of the last four decades as “a class war between capital and labour, which capital has won hands down”. This insight is the starting point to cutting through the confusion of the weekly flow of events to a clarity that will allow imagination to flourish, hope to arise and change to occur. The question remains: will the Guardian cross such a Rubicon and more fully contribute to a better clarity of understanding and mobilisation for change in the years ahead – for the people, against the few? Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia • Referring to the excellent article on the Guardian’s history, position and future by Katharine Viner, I once more realised why I appreciate the Weekly so much and can’t do without it. My Dutch daily Trouw is much younger but has similar principles. Now let’s all try to practise these in life. Niek de Vries Tiel, the Netherlands The problem isn’t Trump The problem is not Trump’s use of Twitter (cover story, 8 December); it is the media’s use of Trump’s use of Twitter. Journalists have come to rely on tweets as an easy source of news: the more outrageous the better. So much easier than asking awkward questions of power. If journalism is the relaying of information, something has gone badly wrong. Twitter is not information. It is the spontaneous expression of mood, the stuff of gossip, not democratic debate. While the media loves to hate Trump, and Trump is always telling us how much he scorns the media, both know they are in a dysfunctional symbiotic relationship thanks to a profit-making company that has its own agenda. Twitter is a vertical, hierarchical form of communication – and mostly one-way. It facilitates diatribe, not dialogue. Journalists should not allow themselves to become the “followers” of anyone. Social media is a fashion beloved of those who don’t know how to sit still and think for themselves. When we all wake up from up our stupor, maybe the world’s media will lead the way back to real conversation by disconnecting from all social media. We should reserve Twitter et al for banal social intercourse instead of building news stories around it. Nick Inman Larreule, France The dangers of extremism Peter Beaumont’s fine feature focused on Jerusalem makes clear the extensive costly human impact of president Donald Trump’s decision to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel (15 December). As Beaumont implies, that decision means that another Palestinian intifada is now a real possibility. My wife and I were holidaying in Syria and Jordan in 2001. That was at the time of the second Palestinian intifada. We recall how nasty and brutal it was – on all sides. Once, as we taxied from Amman to a Dead Sea resort, the contentious West Bank town of Jericho was clearly visible some 15-20km away. At that distance there was no sign of the dreadful hostilities it was experiencing. But for local Jordanians just across the border, the trauma of that conflict seemed very close to home. Our taxi driver told us with grim humour that at night he and his family looked across in that direction from the Dead Sea border area where they lived to experience the night flashes, explosions and gunfire as a sort of ghoulish after-dinner entertainment. Most Jordanians and Syrians we met, while they strongly favoured the Palestinian cause, were wary of extremism on all sides. As one Jordanian said to me as we came across him watching TV reportage of a recent terrible Jerusalem restaurant bombing: “Israelis – boom, boom, boom. Palestinians – bang, bang, bang. Why?” The Middle East got over that bout of violence. Now the stupidity of Trump threatens it with another. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia • With reference to your 8 December story on the final battle for Mosul: the harrowing endgame shows, as usual, how even one death in the name of religion is always one too many. A second terror is listed at the end of the article – the same politicians who led to the rise of Isis jostle for position as they loot the nation. My take on that is, in summary, the conditions are ripe for it all to happen again. As one learned person said recently “politics is about the past; history concerns the future”. Nothing has been learned.

Unless en route for Mablethorpe (and, let’s face it, most of us aren’t), one rarely passes by Louth. You have to make the effort. Pack sandwiches and a flask. Crawl behind tractors, caravans and lorries laden with potatoes, past squelchy fields and countless villages ending in -by. Twist and turn and rise and fall through the Lincolnshire wolds. And then, just when you have abandoned hope of ever seeing another living soul, there it is: the fabulous spire of St James’ church rising over the dashboard. After all that, you’d fall upon Crawley as if it were Venice. But Louth is worth the slog. It’s one of those just-wonderful places. Trust me. Relative isolation and feisty locals mean many of the ills of modern life have been kept at bay. Eve &amp; Ranshaw department store still sells antimacassars. The Playhouse cinema still has intermissions. Only Aldi has breached their defences. That’s not to say the place is a museum: Louth is beautiful, but it’s a working market town with few airs and graces. And a damn fine cheese shop. Told you it was worth it. The case against All on its lonesome ownsome. The one-way system drives me to insanity each time I come. Well connected? Trains: you’ll be lucky. Driving: half an hour to the coast at Mablethorpe, 45 mins to Lincoln, an hour to the A1. Schools Primaries: St Michael’s CofE and Lacey Gardens are both “good”, says Ofsted, with Kidgate “outstanding”. Secondaries: King Edward VI Grammar is “outstanding”; the new Louth Academy has just opened. Hang out at… A Tipsy Toad by the fire at the Wheatsheaf is what you want. The newly reopened Masons Arms, with its cocktail bar, might shake things up. Where to buy A simply delightful town centre, mostly a conservation area listed up to the hilt with brick Georgian townhouses and cottages its speciality. Some pleasant roads heading out of town, like Horncastle Road. The usual suburbans. Large detacheds and townhouses, £300,000-£800,000. Detacheds and smaller townhouses, £130,000-£300,000. Semis, £130,000-£250,000. Terraces and cottages, £100,000-£250,000. Flats, £70,000-£150,000. Rentals: a one-bed flat, £400pcm; a three-bed house, £550-£650pcm. Bargain of the week Well, it is £450,000. But then it is a five-bedroom Georgian detached with 250 square metres to play with (masons-surveyors.co.uk). From the streets John Cullinane “Great cheese shop, and lots of good pork products (haslet, chine) if that is your thing. Narrow pavements are tricky with a double buggy.

For example, recent analysis of the Times Higher Education’s world rankings data shows that in 2016–17, 36 of the top 200 universities globally – just 18% – have a female leader. A slight increase on the previous year, when only 17% were led by women, it is nonetheless representative of the gender inequality that persists more widely in higher education across the globe. But why does the gender gap continue, and to such a significant degree? While cracks are showing in the glass ceiling, we’re now seeing “the glass slipper effect”, a concept based on it, and developed by US academic Karen Lee Ashcraft. This refers to our tendency to see different personality traits as inherently masculine or feminine, making different genders feel that certain job roles aren’t the right fit. Job adverts which emphasise masculine traits, such as dominance, assertiveness, ambition and competitiveness, can make women believe that they will not fit into the job role and therefore not apply. This does not mean that women do not hold these qualities, but they tend not to view themselves in these terms. Studies from the US, UK and Germany demonstrate that masculine traits are particularly found in job adverts for leadership positions, as well as jobs in engineering and IT, which may explain the difficulty in recruiting women to these fields. Stereotypes about who belongs in a job are in turn perpetuated by recruitment adverts that use traits considered to be predominantly masculine to describe the perfect candidate. My own research [pdf] among Danish women revealed that the majority view top managerial or leadership roles as stereotypically masculine in character. Despite the diversity of the respondents’ own personalities, all were unmotivated to pursue such roles due to the perceived mismatch of identities. This encapsulates the reasons behind the significant lack of female leadership in higher education. My research suggested that women are more interested in male-dominated professions when job adverts reference a combination of (perceived) male and female traits. Women are more likely to identify with traits such as loyalty, conscientiousness, cooperation and responsibility, traits which are vital for success in any job, regardless of industry. Research from Grant Thornton and the United Nations has shown that countries including Russia, Indonesia and the Philippines all have between 40% and 50% of executive positions filled by women. European countries and the US have just 20% to 30%. As for women in science, 47.2% of all researchers in Central Asia were women as of 2014 – but this drops to 32.2% for North America and western Europe. These findings prove that women’s career choices are not influenced by biology, but rather by socially constructed identities varying from culture to culture. Universities have a responsibility to break down these barriers by positively influencing women’s choices to increase their presence in leadership and seemingly “unconventional” roles, by showing them to be viable and realistic choices. There is a pressing need to deconstruct stereotypical occupational identities if we want more women to enter roles considered masculine (and vice versa). One approach would be to think carefully about the role models universities present. There is a tendency to believe that women will appeal to women, and men will appeal to men, when my research has shown that it is much more complex than that. People’s traits resonate much more strongly than appearances alone. The influence of the glass slipper effect starts early, too, when women are choosing their degrees: there is a great deal of gender segregation at undergraduate level in the UK, with far fewer women enrolling in Stem subjects than men. Careers advisers should encourage women to consider degrees and career paths traditionally viewed as male-dominated by more carefully communicating the broader range of traits associated with these options. This will help both men and women understand that there are a variety of paths to success in a given role, some of which will suit them better than others. If recent figures on female leadership in higher education are anything to go by, we have a way to go before the barriers are broken down. But the best start is to acknowledge that the glass slipper effect exists. That way, universities can begin adapting their practices, messages and approaches to career advice to help women see their own personalities as a natural fit for leadership positions.

The elevator pitch would be something like “Middle Earth meets District 9 meets End of Watch”. And if that sounds like an impossible genre clash to reconcile, Netflix’s frenetic sci-fi-buddy-cop-fantasy-comedy-thriller deserves credit for ramming its way through, regardless. The ethnic boundaries of this alternative metropolis are quickly sketched out. Orcs are the underclass – deprived and discriminated against (a reference to “Orc lives matter” drives the point home). Elves are the elite, though we only visit their glitzy, exclusive neighbourhood briefly. Humans are somewhere in the middle, doing the ordinary jobs and directing their prejudices at the other species rather than each other (the cast is commendably multiracial). Quite where the centaur traffic cops fit in is never explained, but it’s a nice detail. One thing that hasn’t changed is the LAPD, which honours the Hollywood tradition of assigning chalk-and-cheese partners to the beat. Thus Will Smith’s Ward – grouchy, sharp-tongued but essentially decent – is paired with Nick Jakoby, the first ever orc cop, who’s ostracised by his own kind but mistrusted by humans, including, of course, his partner. The credits tell you Jakoby is played by Joel Edgerton but you’d never know, under the blotchy face makeup, contact lenses and twitching pointy ears. The plot has grand ambitions in store for the partners. They unintentionally obtain an all-important magic wand, which is “like a nuclear weapon that grants wishes”. They rescue a mysterious elf waif (Lucy Fry), who’s also important, but has very little to do but look waif-life and make the odd acrobatic combat intervention – she’s a little like Milla Jovovich in the Fifth Element, except with fewer lines. In pursuit of them and the wand, across the rainy, gloomy night, are evil elves, corrupt cops, and local gangs both orc and human. There’s mention of “a Dark Lord” and “a prophecy”, not to mention the concept of “brights” themselves. So much to explain; so little time to explain it. Director David Ayer has form in this area, having written Training Day and End of Watch (two buddy cop thrillers), and directed the recent Suicide Squad. He’s fond of macho, hard-hitting action: cartridge-showering shootouts; careering car chases; crunching hand-to-hand combat. Some of it is exhilarating; some of it is borderline incomprehensible owing to mistimed editing and a terminally gloomy palette. The pace barely lets up, but sometimes you wish it would. Having established a world so rich in potential and so full of resonance, Bright backs off from exploring its finer points, or those of its characters. Edgerton gives his orc character a credible blend of timidity, dignity and inner turmoil. Smith, the ostensible star, is often given little to do beyond crack wise and shoot stuff. One of the most satisfying scenes is where the two cops simply banter in their car. Orcs have a tenuous grasp of humour and irony, but can detect “physical tells” humans don’t realise they’re making. Edgerton correctly identifies Smith’s facial expression as “human who needs a lot more conjugal love”. I’d have been happy to ride around with these cops on a day where nothing much happened at all, or to see that centaur traffic cop putting his hooves up at home – maybe next time. And hopefully there will be a next time. For all its flaws, Bright is still a headlong leap into a bracingly different new world. Cinema could do with more of that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/27/sanctuary-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T15:00:20Z","webTitle":"Sanctuary review – care, chaos and comedy in the community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/27/sanctuary-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/27/sanctuary-review","fields":{"headline":"Sanctuary review – care, chaos and comedy in the community","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s a wonderful warmth and directness to this movie, adapted by Galway dramatist Christian O’Reilly from his original stage play, and directed by feature first-timer Len Collin. In the lead roles, non-professionals Charlene Kelly and Kieran Coppinger have a terrific gentleness and honesty. They play Sophie and Larry – one has epilepsy and the other Down’s syndrome. Sophie is cared for in a community facility and Larry is at home with his mum, but they have met in Sophie’s care home and have fallen in love. And care worker Tom (Robert Doherty) has arranged to let them have an afternoon together in a local hotel in town, sneaking them away from a group trip to the cinema. This is against his better judgement, and indeed against the law: Section 5 of Ireland’s Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, which forbids sexual relations between people with developmental disabilities unless they are married – this law was in fact repealed earlier this year. It is a misadventure that has elements of comedy and chaos as all the rest of the group wander away from the cinema, but the scenes between Larry and Sophie themselves have a grownup seriousness and the film itself has a tough, unsentimental ending. A valuable film with honesty and heart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2017/dec/22/north-pole-in-the-spotlight","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T07:30:47Z","webTitle":"North Pole in the spotlight: Alaskan wonderland meets Twin Peaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/22/north-pole-in-the-spotlight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/dec/22/north-pole-in-the-spotlight","fields":{"headline":"North Pole in the spotlight: Alaskan wonderland meets Twin Peaks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Opportunism comes with bells on at this Alaskan commuter town next to the Richardson Highway, south-east of the city of Fairbanks. What was once a nondescript homestead called Davis incorporated itself as North Pole in 1953, becoming an unlikely centre of Christmas-based commerce and tourism despite being 1,700 miles south of the real thing. Letters addressed to “Santa Claus, North Pole” often wind up in this 2,000-strong community, and the streets have names like Santa Claus Lane and Kris Kringle Drive. Paul Brown, who currently manages Santa Claus House, the cavernous red-trimmed gift shop that evolved from a trading post set up by his wife’s grandparents, says living in this fantasia can lead to festive desensitisation: “For ordinary people, there’s more of a sense of emphasis on the holidays that is less so when you live in North Pole, just because we are living Christmas every day.” Yulesploitation Summer is actually peak tourism season in North Pole, driven by cruise-ship arrivals in Alaska and more forgiving weather. But there is a steady flow of visitors in winter, too, who also come to see the aurora borealis. Less manageable is the steadily increasing mountain of children’s letters to Santa that end up in North Pole - currently around 500,000 a year. Some terminate in the local post office, some at Santa Claus House; the Santa’s Mailbag programme was set up, originally by volunteers at nearby Eielson air force base, to make sure they didn’t go unanswered. Unfortunately, the non-profit company that inherited the programme is no longer functioning. Brown admits that there are too many letters to answer, but he insists that every one that arrives at Santa Claus House gets read. Living up to the Christmas fantasy can be tough, says one city councillor, who admits there is something of a Twin Peaks flipside to the candy-cane streetlights. “There used to be a huge oil refinery here, and there’s a big black market for drugs, but it’s kinda covered up by things like the candle-lighting ceremony or Winter on Ice.” The councillor’s name? Santa Claus. Really. North Pole in numbers -19C Average December temperature in the city 99705 Zipcode on Santa Claus’s “official” address 68.21% Republican portion of the vote in the 2016 elections. North Pole is the most Republican-leaning constituency in the Fairbanks area 3,359 Miles between North Pole and Rovaniemi, Lapland, its chief Yulesploitation rival. The competition is “playful”, says Brown: “We have very heavy US visitation, where Rovaniemi is more Euro-centric” History in 100 words The 160-acre Davis homestead was only five years old in 1949 when it was purchased by the Dahl and Gaske Development Company. In an effort to attract a toy manufacturer to the area, it pushed through the 1953 name change that gift-wrapped the North Pole area’s fate. Deterred by transport costs from Alaska, no such company came – but Conrad B Miller’s highway store was already making good on the Xmas association, eventually becoming Santa Claus House, and the Millers a significant Alaskan political dynasty. Eielson air force base, to the south-east, and Fort Wainwright army base, to the north-west, boosted North Pole’s status as a “bedroom community” for the military, while an oil refinery linked to the trans-Alaskan pipeline added a further bauble to North Pole’s tree in 1977. While it was bought by the Koch brothers in 2004, a scandal involving groundwater contamination going back to its previous owners has helped force the refinery’s closure. North Pole in sound and vision The best Alaskan northern lights are between 65° and 70° north latitude. North Pole is at 64.75°, so it gets them sporadically. But there’s always YouTube. The landscape around North Pole was a major source of inspiration for Bob Ross, the TV painter once stationed at Eielson who later became an unlikely internet celebrity. Eco-fitting the city In recent years, Fairbanks and North Pole have logged the worst counts of fine-particulate air pollution in the US: 139 micrograms per cubic metre at the 2015 peak, more than triple that of Los Angeles (38). This is because they are in a valley where temperature inversions trap smoke pollution from the fires everyone relies on to heat their houses in winter. Tougher regulations, including “burn bans” on wood and coal during alerts, have been put in place to curb rising respiratory illnesses. But Brown says the “hot-button” issue is more complicated than it appears. Most Alaskan natural gas is exported, leaving locals to choose between pricey heating oil and cheap but grimy wood and coal. “From a local standpoint, the new regulations are extremely controversial,” says Brown. “You tell us we can’t heat our homes with wood, but you don’t give us an alternative we can afford.” Inside city hall Councillor Claus, who changed his name from Thomas O’Connor in 2005 to help him advocate for child-safety issues, also campaigns on another issue: the cannabis industry. Alaska passed a law in 2014 allowing individual municipalities to permit commercial marijuana concerns; last year, conservative North Pole opted 158-98 to ban it. A blow for Santa Claus, who, as a cancer patient, advocates medical use of the drug. He believes it’s another instance of North Pole being in denial, this time of Alaska’s thriving black-market drugs economy: “People refuse to acknowledge there’s a $1m marijuana economy in their city, because after all the slogan of North Pole is: where the spirit of Christmas lives all year round.” Crucially, he estimates that the city is missing out on a sorely needed annual $50,000 tax windfall; Fairbanks, which has 18 cultivators (the highest in the state), currently rakes in $750,000 in yearly revenues. Claus hasn’t given up, and is planning a website floating a new local slogan: “North Pole: where Alaska’s homegrown spirit thrives all year round.” What’s next for the city? Brown says residents favour North Pole growing “slowly and carefully”, to preserve its small-town ambience: “Our idea of rush-hour is getting stuck behind five cars.” It may be out of their hands, though. The arrival of two squadrons of F-35 stealth jets at Eielson – part of the most expensive programme in US defence history, being deployed to strategically sensitive Alaska at a time of heightened tension with Russia – is estimated to bring 5,000 newcomers to the area soon. “The military’s not planning to build housing for them,” says Claus, “so that’s going to stimulate the economy in this area.” Which could bring a welcome diversification of North Pole’s industries portfolio – though it’ll mean a few more tyre treads churning up the winter wonderland.

But such a combination does not guarantee an artistic slam dunk. Though each boasts technique to die for, Kavakos is essentially an introspective musician, Wang his polar opposite. Neither of these styles is any more valid than the other, but the enticing question in this Wigmore recital was how these musical personalities would combine in some of the most important works in the violin and piano repertoire. The answer was dictated by the programme. Three of the four items – the sonatas by Janáček and Debussy, along with Bartók’s first sonata – were completed within a five-year span at the end of the first world war. The exception, Schubert’s C major Fantasy D934, needs no apology whatsoever and Kavakos and Wang played what is sometimes regarded as a purely lyrical work with considerable interpretative weight. It felt, nevertheless, as if the duo would have made greater impact with a contrasting violin sonata from the same darkly fruitful postwar period for the form (of which there are many, from Fauré to Hindemith) instead. In the Janáček and the Bartók sonatas, the two soloists shared the same musical space rather than combining in anything like the classical manner. By placing himself so squarely in front of Wang, and often playing with his back to her and focused on the score, Kavakos also tended to embody the fact that this was a high-level collaboration rather than a natural synthesis. At times, his playing seemed deeply self-absorbed, though always with engaging results. But it also felt as if he was exploring the range and outer limits of the violin’s sound palette – darkly gritty in the Janáček, mysteriously ethereal in the Bartók – for its own sake, while letting Wang do her thing, which she always did with beauty of tone as well as impeccable accuracy. Debussy’s sonata requires the two to create a more unified or at least more collegiate sound world. There were many amazingly fluent touches and passages of formidable interplay from both artists, including some lovely portamenti from Kavakos. Yet the performance did not quite capture the unique idiom of Debussy’s highly concentrated final score. The Bartók, by contrast, was an irresistible success, a collaboration that matched prodigious technique and a vast range of violin and piano sound with a wholly convincing grasp of the work’s ambition and originality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/britain-first-gab-social-media-twitter-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T11:28:01Z","webTitle":"Britain First signs up to fringe social media site after Twitter ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/britain-first-gab-social-media-twitter-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/britain-first-gab-social-media-twitter-ban","fields":{"headline":"Britain First signs up to fringe social media site after Twitter ban","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The far-right group Britain First is urging its followers to move to a fringe social media site, after a crackdown on the group on Twitter and Facebook. Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, leader and deputy leader of the group, had their Twitter accounts suspended this week, with Facebook saying it was reviewing the future of Britain First’s profile page. In response, Golding has now written to Gab, a networking site based in Texas, saying it has opened an account with them and is urging all their followers to go there. Golding wrote: “Freedom of speech is effectively suspended in Britain … Twitter and YouTube are now openly persecuting patriots and nationalists. Britain First is looking to the future and our top priority is securing our support base and being able to communicate with our followers.” He added: “This is why we are looking further afield now to up-and-coming social networks that are dedicated to free speech. The biggest social media network that prides itself on its commitment to freedom of speech is Gab ... [which is] very similar to Twitter, but their whole ethos is free speech ... It is fast becoming the social network for rightwing, Christian and politically incorrect speech.” The email concluded: “I am proud to say that, finally, Britain First, deputy leader Jayda Fransen and myself have opened verified accounts on Gab and we are strongly urging all of our supporters to get on to this exciting new social network immediately.” While Gab has content guidelines in place, it is widely seen as taking a more hands-off approach than other social media sites. Gab is a private social networking site that requires people to sign up to post and access content. Its guidelines say “the only valid form of censorship is an individual’s own choice to opt out” and that its mission is to put people and free speech first. Gab’s community guidelines stress that users can filter or remove posts they don’t want to see. It says its policy is to follow all applicable laws in the US. The website has courted criticism in the past after it was banned from the Google Play app store for hate speech. Posts on the site today under a topic “Christmas wishlist” include open white supremacist calls for genocide against other races who are referred to by racial slurs, calls to hang members of the US Congress, and an appeal for Synagogues in Europe to be bombed. On Wednesday, the Britain First page on Gab had a post from Fransen that read: “Twitter will no longer provide a platform to those who challenge political correctness, Marxism and Islam. RIP free speech. Cheerio Twitter, hello @Gab.” Prof Matthew Feldman, co-director of the Centre for Fascist, Anti-fascist and Post-fascist Studies at Teesside University, said that a crackdown on mainstream sites was leading to a growing movement of far-right groups on alternative platforms: “The real danger with this is that if these groups move on to these platforms they will have a space to mobilise that is no longer [visible to investigators] in the UK.” Feldman estimated there were dozens of far-right groups in Britain. He said it was a time of unprecedented change in terms of social media and the far right. The far-right movement in Britain is understood to be relatively fragmented. One of the larger groups is Britain First, with nearly 2m likes on Facebook. Vidhya Ramalingam, founder of Moonshot CVE, an organisation using technology to respond to extremism, said: “It’s a worrying moment where we are seeing chatter, planning and movement from far right groups in Britain. Whether they are on Facebook or Twitter, or on dedicated sites like Gab, the openness of these individuals about their beliefs also creates an opportunity to find them online and engage in conversation with them directly there. We have tested receptiveness of far right audiences to online messaging to offer alternative perspectives, and have had positive results to indicate this is a way forward, rather than simply focusing on take downs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/pmqs-verdict-im-still-here-may-taunts-corbyn-as-pair-clash-over-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T13:48:38Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: I'm still here, May taunts Corbyn as pair clash over NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/pmqs-verdict-im-still-here-may-taunts-corbyn-as-pair-clash-over-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/pmqs-verdict-im-still-here-may-taunts-corbyn-as-pair-clash-over-nhs","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: I'm still here, May taunts Corbyn as pair clash over NHS","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Key points The final PMQs of 2017 saw Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn brandishing rival statistics about the NHS. The Labour leader quoted Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, saying that the service needs another £4bn, and that it had received less than half that. The prime minister replied that NHS funding was at record levels and that despite Corbyn’s complaints “week after week”, there were more diagnostic tests than seven years ago, 2.2 million people getting operations, more elderly patients getting hip replacements and nearly 65,000 people who would not be alive had they not had improved cancer care. Corbyn said many patients were kept waiting in the back of ambulances for more than half an hour: if the NHS was properly resourced, why was it not meeting its targets, and could May give a cast iron guarantee that these targets would be met? May said the government’s NHS reforms were delivering results: “We’re proud of NHS and we’ll make it even better.” Corbyn said A&amp;E waiting targets had not been met for two years, and where were the 5,000 GPs the government had promised to recruit by 2020? May retorted that in Wales, where Labour is in government, the standard waiting time in A&amp;E was last met in 2008. That was because Wales depended on block income from the UK, which had been cut by 5%, Corbyn replied. Cancer patients start treatment within 62 days, better than in England. He added that there were fewer GPs than when May became prime minister, £6m cuts had been made to social care budgets, 2 million older people’s care needs had been unmet, and yet the chancellor, Philip Hammond, had failed to put an extra penny in the budget for social care. May said the Tories had put £2bn into social care in the spring budget. Labour’s NHS record was described as a mess – by Corbyn, before he was Labour leader. “When he is running for leader, he denounces Labour’s record. Now he is leader, he tries to defend it,” the prime minister said. Corbyn responded by quoting the Tory leader of Warwickshire country council, who said the government needed to tackle chronic underfunding in the NHS. This winter, the service is in crisis. May finished by taunting Corbyn over his prediction that he would be prime minister by Christmas, saying Labour was “wrong, wrong, wrong” about that, as well as about Brexit and the budget. Verdict May left Tory MPs shouting “more, more, more”, and it was certainly one of her most confident performances in recent weeks, but it was not a particularly illuminating exchange, or even a very decisive one. We end the year where PMQs concludes much of the time, with what’s broadly a stalemate. Corbyn did not have any particularly memorable moments, but his questions were solid and robust, and his performance probably ended up in the “job done” category. Arguments about the NHS at PMQs often just become statistic-slinging sessions, and that is what this felt like. Most of the figures (including the obligatory reference to Wales) sounded familiar, although May did have a new claim about the number of people now apparently alive who would not have been under previous cancer survival rates. It was moderately interesting, but did not clinch the argument. May, though, did beat Corbyn and in the quote swapping challenge towards the end (her Corbyn quote trumped his quote from a Tory council leader) and May’s final soundbite did what was required in the circumstances. Memorable lines Staff numbers are falling. Budgets have been cut. The PM has shown just how out of touch she is. The NHS has been recklesslessly put at risk by her government.

These creatures kill hundreds of children and adults every year. They belch toxic gases that hasten death in many thousands. And yet we genuflect to their shiny bodies – so much so that we ban birds from trees to stop their droppings defacing the skins of the beasts resting below. If the car were an animal, we would have hunted it to extinction shortly after the first Model T Ford rolled off the production line in 1908. But we are the idiots of the Anthropocene: we tolerate all manner of human depredations but exterminate every animal guilty of the slightest inconvenience to our cosseted lives. This week’s Twitter storm over some plastic spikes hammered on to tree branches above private parking for flats in Bristol might appear hysterical. It’s one tree. There are plenty of others. Pigeons are not endangered. Bird poo can damage car paintwork and is a pain to chisel off (I know from tedious experience, although it’s nothing that some hot water can’t sort out.) The spikes are preferable to killing the birds, or the tree (which also happens.) Anyway, the spikes were erected in 2014 and, hooray, they keep people in employment. They’re made in Britain. Another industry to celebrate. Hearteningly, however, this trivial story has gone global because thousands of people have recognised its significance as a symbol of our disastrously dysfunctional relationship with the living planet upon which we ultimately depend. These spikes cut open modern Britain in a myriad of unflattering ways. They are not shocking or unusual, but utterly typical of a society that poisons the air we breathe, has extinguished the stars with artificial light, and builds parking lots on paradise every day of the week. They demonstrate how deaf we are to beauty: that we will sacrifice birdsong (proven to enhance our emotional wellbeing) rather than have to wipe down the Audi once a week. They reveal how intolerant we are of urban nature. We rail against “dirty” urban foxes, rats, gulls and pigeons, when it is our filth that enables them to survive so successfully alongside us in cities. Most of all, they emphasise the extent of Britain’s estrangement from the natural world. We pioneered the Anthropocene before the baton was taken up by larger, more powerful nations. We have led the way in finding novel ways to destroy fellow species. We have purged 97% of our wildflower meadows, up to 90% of marshland, and thousands of miles of hedgerow and ancient woodland. We claim to be a nation of great nature-lovers, but barely 6% of our land is protected as nature reserves, far lower than in most western nations. Most fatally, we barely perceive the great wealth of wildlife we have lost, or its profound benefits for us, to say nothing of its moral right to endure despite us. Instead we focus on nature’s costs. While we do this, British society continues to be built to recognise all the benefits and none of the costs of the car. We’re still spending billions on new roads that rip up hedgerows and ancient woodland, on car parks that cover meadows, and on those spikes (a bargain £4.58 per metre). Hopes that we will liberate ourselves from this monster of our making with the coming era of driverless vehicles and the end of oil look like wishful thinking. I’ve recently read stories lamenting the loss of children’s freedom because of the car, and urging government to change transport policy to help pedestrians and cyclists. They date from 1974. In the decades since, the vast majority of Britain’s new houses and shops have been built around the car. Road traffic continues to rise. We are more dependent upon cars than ever – no wonder they have become physically so much bigger and loom larger than ever as status symbols for many people. Some spikes on a branch in Bristol are one small outrage, but they scream at us – whatever we are doing to our world, we really should stop. • Patrick Barkham is a nature writer for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/20/japan-inaction-on-illegal-ivory-exports-threatens-chinese-ban-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T11:11:02Z","webTitle":"Japan’s inaction on illegal ivory exports threatens Chinese ban, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/20/japan-inaction-on-illegal-ivory-exports-threatens-chinese-ban-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/20/japan-inaction-on-illegal-ivory-exports-threatens-chinese-ban-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Japan’s inaction on illegal ivory exports threatens Chinese ban, report says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Japan’s failure to prevent illegal ivory exports could undermine China’s forthcoming ban on its domestic ivory trade, conservation groups have warned. Inaction by Japan’s government has allowed the smuggling of large quantities of undocumented ivory overseas, mainly to China, according to a report released in Tokyo on Wednesday by the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. The report, compiled with the support of the World Wildlife Fund, says 2.42 tonnes of ivory – including elephant tusks, antiques and jewellery – were illegally exported from Japan between 2011 and 2016. Online sales are a major contributor to the problem, the report says. Last year, Chinese authorities seized 1,639 pieces of worked ivory and carved tusks believed to have been bought in online auctions. Very few illegal consignments are seized in Japan. According to Traffic, an average of 2,447 ivory items worth more than $400,000 were auctioned during a four-week period between May and June 2017 on a major e-commerce site. The report says researchers found antique dealers were buying a large number of elephant tusks in Japan that were not registered, even though owners are required to show proof that the items were not bought after the international ban on the ivory trade came into effect in 1989. “Japan’s domestic ivory market availability is targeted for procuring products from the antiques and tourist markets for illegal ivory exports, as well as through physical and online auctions,” the report says. International pressure has resulted in some progress in Japan, however. In July, the e-commerce company Rakuten said it would ban the sale of ivory products, but Yahoo! Japan and other sites continue to sell the items. Almost 95% of illegal ivory exports from Japan go to China, which is to end its domestic legal trade in ivory at the end of this year, amid concern about the steep decline in the African elephant population caused by poaching. Hong Kong, the world’s largest retail ivory market, plans to follow suit in 2021. But Traffic’s Tomomi Kitade, who co-authored the report, warned that the flow of ivory from Japan could hamper Chinese efforts to stamp out its domestic trade. “Continuing to allow substantial illegal exports to go to China will undermine Chinese attempts to enforce the ban on its domestic ivory trade,” Kitade said. “Our findings show that the Japanese government has a responsibility to act quickly to end illegal exports.” The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) bans the international trade in ivory to protect endangered African elephants, and has called for the closure of domestic ivory markets in all member states. Japan, however, says ivory products traded domestically were not acquired illegally. This year the government approved a proposal to tighten registration requirements and inspections for more than 8,000 ivory retailers and manufacturers in the country – a move described as inadequate by campaigners. “Our findings show without doubt that Japan’s largely unregulated domestic ivory market is contributing to illegal trade,” Kitade said. An estimated 20,000 African elephants are killed every year for their tusks, according to conservation groups. Last year, a record 40 tonnes of ivory were seized worldwide, triple the amount in 2007."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/22/woman-abused-caldey-island-monk-waives-anonymity-joanna-briggs-thaddeus-kotik","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Woman abused as a child by Caldey Island monk waives right to anonymity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/woman-abused-caldey-island-monk-waives-anonymity-joanna-briggs-thaddeus-kotik","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/22/woman-abused-caldey-island-monk-waives-anonymity-joanna-briggs-thaddeus-kotik","fields":{"headline":"Woman abused as a child by Caldey Island monk waives right to anonymity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A woman has waived her right to anonymity to describe how she and her sister were sexually abused as children by a monk on Caldey Island, calling for an inquiry into how offences were covered up for decades. Joanna Biggs also claims that a nun lied about the circumstances surrounding the death of her sister, Theresa, at the age of six in a swimming accident on the island 40 years ago, and wants her inquest reviewed. Biggs is one of a growing number of survivors who have come forward to detail offences committed by Fr Thaddeus Kotik, a member of the Cistercian order of Benedictine monks who lived at Caldey Abbey on the Pembrokeshire island from 1947 until his death in 1992. Since the Guardian exposed the abuse in November there have been calls from victims and politicians for an inquiry. The Guardian has also revealed that two other men who lived and worked on Caldey were subsequently convicted of child sex offences. In addition, police are investigating allegations that a seasonal worker sexually assaulted a girl on the island. Biggs, 48, is the first Kotik victim to be named. She said one of her main motivations was to defend her sister against the accusation that she disobeyed the instructions of a nun and went swimming when she had been told not to go in the water. But Biggs said she and her sister were abused by Kotik, in the dairy on the island, when they were aged six and seven. Kotik’s modus operandi was to befriend families who lived there or who regularly visited. He gave them handmade chocolates and fresh produce, and invited the children to the dairy. He abused children in a room beside the dairy, on walks through the woods, in dens or in isolated rocky coves near the beach. Biggs said that although she was the older sister, it was Theresa who suggested they avoid Kotik. “We were always together,” she said. “We played together and talked about everything together. Although I was older, Theresa was more gregarious and bolder. Theresa suggested we should stick together for protection. “I have a memory of me being in a huddle with her in a garden somewhere by ourselves and her saying that we shouldn’t go to see Fr Thad, even if he gave us sweets, and me nodding in agreement. I knew why she was saying that at the time. I didn’t like what Fr Thad did. “I feel grateful that she was the one who voiced it. This helped me avoid a different paedophile about a year or so later – not on Caldey, on holiday somewhere else – it flashed into my head like a warning and I listened and ran away from him.” Biggs told how she and her sister had once begun to act out the abuse they suffered. “We started to re-enact what happened in the dairy to us, taking our pyjamas off – and then we stopped and decided we didn’t like it and didn’t want to play that story.” Biggs said the Guardian’s original article triggered panic attacks. “It was the picture of Fr Thad holding the two girls – they’re not Theresa and I, but you can see how tightly he held them in his arms. He was very strong and had rough hands. The most bizarre place I had a panic attack was in a supermarket one weekend, next to the freezer section. I was suddenly overwhelmed by the cold, the smell and the noise.” In July 1977 the two sisters were among a group of children at Sandtop Bay beach on Caldey under the supervision of a nun called Sister Sheila Singleton, who was leading an educational course for Catholic children. Theresa went swimming on a windy day unaware there was a dangerous undercurrent and she was swept out to sea. Three boys, 12, 14, and 15, swam out to try to help her but she drowned. During the inquest at Tenby police station, Singleton, who died in 2004, testified in a written statement that Theresa had defied her instructions not to go swimming because the water was too cold. The boys told a different story but the coroner accepted the nun’s version and recorded a verdict of accidental death. Biggs insists that Singleton’s evidence was false because the nun had given her sister permission to swim. “She [the nun] helped me to put Theresa’s armbands on. And then she said, ‘Off you go.’ My sister was not naughty.” Biggs said she and her parents have lived with the nun’s lie for more than 40 years. “It is time for my sister to be released from false blame,” she said. Biggs argued that the story of her sister’s drowning was relevant to the abuse scandal because it showed that children’s voices were often ignored. “The problem with things as they currently are is that everything to do with Caldey has been closed off, unmentioned, swept under the carpet or just whispered about for a very long time.” The abuse on Caldey emerged after the abbey paid modest sums of compensation to six women who had brought a civil claim against the Cistercian order on Caldey for abuse they suffered as children by Kotik in the 70s and 80s. After the Guardian exposed the abuse last month, the abbot, Daniel van Santvoort, apologised via the island’s Facebook page that allegations made against Kotik had not been reported to the authorities and expressed regret for any harm caused. Since then the Guardian has revealed: • A sex offender called Paul Ashton lived on the island for seven years while on the run from the police. It has also now emerged that he ran a cleaning company registered on the island with a convicted fraudster. • A priest, Fr John Shannon, who was subsequently caught on the mainland with pictures of children as young as nine, lived on the island for nine months. • Police are investigating another man over an alleged sexual assault that took place at the same period as the Kotik offences. He was not a member of the abbey or its staff. Adding her voice to calls for an inquiry from other victims and Tory Welsh assembly members, Biggs said: “I feel like it’s just the start, the box is only just being opened. It seems to me that the best people to investigate that box fairly and thoroughly would be people and organisations who have not been previously associated with the island – and also who do not belong to a particular denomination or faith. “I think this would be best for Caldey Abbey as well. If they want to try and win back people’s trust that they are truly interested in safeguarding their visitors in future. “The fact that Fr Thad was left for so many years to continue to do whatever he liked suggests at the very least, tolerance or blindness by Caldey Abbey to that same behaviour in others. These are offenders who understand Catholicism and know how to hide within it and manipulate it.” Biggs added: “There appears to be a firm position taken by the current abbot towards protecting the interests of the monastery, and a distinct lack of openness, clarity and even goodwill when it comes to the dealing with revelations of the abuse that took place. His order is responsible for covering it up and allowing it to continue. Acknowledgment is everything.” It can also be revealed that the abbey’s wealthy “mother house”, Scourmont Abbey near Chimay in Belgium, denied legal liability for the abuse. Caldey’s webpage spells out how the island was sold to the Cistercian order in the 1920s to be occupied by a group of monks from Scourmont and adds that the present monks are the successors of the first Caldey Cistercians. The Guardian has also established that Kotik spent time at Scourmont. But Armand Veilleux, the Scourmont abbot from 1999 until his retirement in November this year, said Caldey was an autonomous house in civil and canon law. Teresa Elwes, a devotee who has maintained a relationship with Caldey and Scourmont for 40 years and knew Kotik, said the mother house – which is known for its brewery – could afford to compensate victims properly. Elwes said: “These young women have been abused by a monk and now that abuse is continuing by the failure of the monastic community to take responsibility and willingly and eagerly pay proper compensation, whilst acknowledging that this alone can never be enough.” The Caldey Abbey abbot has not responded to requests by the Guardian for an interview and has not granted permission for reporters to land on the private island."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/us-take-names-united-nations-vote-to-reject-jerusalem-recognition","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T08:15:52Z","webTitle":"US will 'take names of those who vote to reject Jerusalem recognition'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/us-take-names-united-nations-vote-to-reject-jerusalem-recognition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/us-take-names-united-nations-vote-to-reject-jerusalem-recognition","fields":{"headline":"US will 'take names of those who vote to reject Jerusalem recognition'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has warned UN members she will be “taking names” of countries that vote to reject Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Haley told countries – including European delegations – that she will report back to the US president with the names of those who support a draft resolution rejecting the US move at the UN general assembly on Thursday, adding that Trump took the issue personally. Haley writes: “As you consider your vote, I encourage you to know the president and the US take this vote personally. “The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us,” she continued. Haley followed the letter by tweeting: “At the UN we’re always asked to do more &amp; give more. So, when we make a decision, at the will of the American ppl, abt where to locate OUR embassy, we don’t expect those we’ve helped to target us. On Thurs there’ll be a vote criticizing our choice. The US will be taking names.” The Trump administration’s heavy-handed approach to foreign policy – often in breach of both international consensus and diplomatic niceties – has alienated even close allies. The 193-member UN general assembly – which has no vetoes – will hold an emergency session on Thursday to vote on the proposed measure that the US vetoed at the security council earlier this week. There was fury in Washington over Monday’s vote, in which the US was isolated in a 14-1 vote requesting Trump withdraw his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. According to Haaretz, Israel has sent instructions to its own diplomatic missions ordering ambassadors to seek meetings with officials to persuade them to direct their representatives at the UN to oppose the draft resolution at the general assembly and ask them not to make speeches. A copy of the draft resolution, also seen by the Guardian, calls on the general assembly to declare the US move “null and void”. It also demands that countries avoid “any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem” and calls upon all states to comply with existing security council resolutions. The UN general assembly meeting was requested by Turkey and Yemen on behalf of the Arab group of countries and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The two countries circulated a draft resolution on Tuesday that mirrors the vetoed measure Egypt had put forward at the security council meeting, which was backed by all members apart from the US. The Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said he expected “overwhelming support” for the measure stating that Jerusalem was an issue “to be resolved through negotiations” between Israel and the Palestinians. “The general assembly will say, without the fear of the veto, that the international community is refusing to accept the unilateral position of the United States,” Mansour told reporters. Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital broke with international consensus, triggering protests across the Muslim world and drawing strong condemnation. Key US allies including Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Ukraine were among the 14 countries in the 15-member council that voted in favour of rejecting the move. After that vote, Haley described the 14-1 vote as “an insult” and warned: “It won’t be forgotten.” After the clash at the top UN body, the White House announced that the US vice-president, Mike Pence, was delaying a trip to the Middle East planned for this week. Israel seized control of the eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and regards all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital. The Palestinians view the east as the capital of their future state. Several UN resolutions call on Israel to withdraw from territory seized during the 1967 war. The vote in the emergency session of the general assembly follows an annual vote on Tuesday where members voted 176-7 to affirm the Palestinian right to self-determination, suggesting the level of support the draft resolution could potentially command on Thursday. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman pledged the kingdom’s support for east Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state during talks with Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Wednesday. Abbas has sent delegations to China and Russia to ask them to take a greater role in the peace process with Israel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/24/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman-pt-barnum","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"The Greatest Showman review – roll up, roll up, zone out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/24/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman-pt-barnum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/24/the-greatest-showman-review-hugh-jackman-pt-barnum","fields":{"headline":"The Greatest Showman review – roll up, roll up, zone out","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Imagine Tod Browning’s 1932 pre-Code horror film Freaks asset-stripped by a third-rate Baz Luhrmann wannabe, the chilling refrain “one of us” sanitised into something closer to a soft-drink commercial tagline than a menace.

Imagine a film that replaces an emotional climax with a scene in which the main character rides an enormous CGI elephant covered in glitter. In fact, it doesn’t take a lot of imagination to conjure up a film such as The Greatest Showman, which is an uninspired plod through the life of PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman). For all the skittish, pirouetting camera and sparkles, the characterisation is barely Lycra-deep and the magic that Barnum brought to his shows is lacking. It is not entirely without redeeming features. An aerial song-and-dance sequence between slumming toff Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) and trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya) is a giddy joy. And Hugh Jackman is clearly having an absolute ball in the role.

Of course these days, when weed is legal in a number of US states and even Christopher Biggins is blazing up on ITV, that label no longer feels like such an insult. The band’s third album, Pleasure Suck, takes the lo-fi collage approach of the likes of the Elephant 6 collective – in particular the psych folk of the Olivia Tremor Control – and makes it wilder and weirder, smothering it in layers of distortion, vocal samples and synth smears. Melodies tantalisingly wash in and out of focus, ideas are developed and abandoned at the drop of a hat in favour of something more interesting – a sudden stab of noise rock, say, or a limpid freak-folk interlude. In lesser hands such capriciousness might prove annoying, but here there’s always the thrilling possibility of something new just around the corner.

Noel Brown, 69, was found next to his daughter, Marie Brown, 41, who had also been killed at his home in New Butt Lane, Deptford, on 4 December. Both had been strangled and detectives are hunting a suspect captured on CCTV carrying a large rucksack. Family members have described Marie Brown as a “calm, peaceful person”. DCI Simon Harding revealed that parts of both Noel Brown’s arms and a part of one of his legs had been removed from the scene, and had not been recovered. “In my 27 years of policing, I have not seen anything quite like this,” he said. He added that there was no trace of the missing body parts after police divers searched nearby Deptford Creek, and specialist dogs had scoured the estate. Brown was convicted of a sex offence and jailed in 1999, but has been described as “well-liked and well-respected” in the area, having been released in 2004. Harding said the victim’s criminal past was being treated as a significant line of inquiry and people involved at the time had been questioned by police. He played down earlier speculation that Brown, who gambled regularly, may have been murdered over a big betting win, adding: “It could be a stranger or a failed robbery or burglary.” It is believed Brown’s daughter stumbled across his murderer in his flat and was killed as a result. A neighbour saw Brown at his home at about 8pm on Thursday 30 November, and at about midday on Saturday 2 December his daughter went to his flat out of concern for his welfare. She was not seen again alive. The Metropolitan police believe the suspect visited the flat at least four times between late Thursday evening and when the bodies were found. A series of CCTV clips show the suspect, who appears to be aged in his 20s or 30s, dressed in a hooded top, dark-coloured jacket and trousers or jogging bottoms, dark trainers and carrying a rucksack. He is seen in the footage walking along Deptford Broadway towards the junction with the A2209 and then along Reginald Road at about 5am on 2 December. In one clip, he appears to cross the road to avoid walking straight past a woman in a light-coloured jacket coming in the opposite direction. Police have also released two new images of Noel Brown from the last day that he was known to be alive, taken from Paddy Power bookmakers in Deptford High Street on 30 November. Assisting the appeal, a statement from Marie Brown’s family said: “As a family we are struggling to put together an appeal because we are still in shock and disbelief. Marie was the peacemaker and we cannot understand why this would happen to her. It is obvious that we need to find the person or people who have done this to her, but we have no information and need your help.” They added: “Marie was a calm, peaceful person, slow to anger and quick to forgive. She never got caught up in any sort of fight and avoided feuds with anyone because she didn’t want to be a part of anyone’s upset. To know Marie would be to know how much she loved.

Netflix Netflix is arguably the king of streaming services, with thousands of movies and TV shows, including some very good original content. You can access Netflix in many countries around the world, and the company offers various levels of monthly subscription with no minimum contract. The “basic” plan costs £5.99 ($8) a month for streaming to one screen at any one time in standard definition. The “standard” plan confusingly increases the resolution to HD with two screens at any one time for £7.99 ($11) a month. The top-tier “premium plan” streams to four screens at any one time for £9.99 a month ($14) and adds ultra HD resolution for those new 4K TVs. Gift cards are available from £15 ($15) from PayPal. Amazon Prime Prime is a yearly subscription service for one-day delivery from Amazon, but it also includes access to Prime Video, Prime Music, Twitch Prime, Prime Reading, and photo backup, making it a one-stop-shop for a range of content services. It costs £79 a year, or £7.99 a month, and can be given in three month $33 or 12 month $99 plans only in the US. UK users will have to resort to buying an eGift Voucher for the value, which are delivered instantly with your choice of values from £1 to £1,000. Give a movie It’s not possible to give an individual movie on Google’s Play Store, so Android users are out of luck. But if you want to give an Apple user a film rather than a gift card or a subscription, then its as simple as finding your choice of movie in the iTunes Store and hitting the gift button. Prices depend on the movie, but for example, Christopher Nolan’s World War Two epic Dunkirk costs £13.99 in HD and will play in 4K Dolby Vision on a 4K Apple TV. Give an app Giving apps isn’t possible from the Google Play Store, the Mac App Store or Microsoft’s Store, but is just as easy as buying a movie or game on the iOS App Store. Find the app you’d like to buy in the App Store and hit the gift button under share. Apps start from as little as 99p, with excellent apps such as the brilliant Photoshop replacement for the iPad Affinity Photo costing £14.99 ($14.99). Give a game There are plenty of options for giving the gift of games digitally. For those looking for a one stop shop for computers, Valve’s Steam store is great, allowing you to gift any title in its enormous library. Some games are available across platforms, others only on Windows. Valve’s Steam lets you give any title available in its rather large library, with games compatible with Windows, OS X, Steam Machines and Linux. My choice is Sonic Mania, but you’ll need a Windows PC to play it and it costs £14.99 for all the classic Sega platforming you can handle. Alternatively, the new Bridge Constructor Portal costs £6.99 and runs on Windows, Mac OS and Steam Boxes. Spotify Spotify is free on mobile phones, tablets and computers, but Spotify Premium allows your loved one to listen to any track of their choosing from the 30m-plus library. You can take your music offline, remove ads and enable higher quality audio streams. Gift subscriptions start at £9.99 for one month, with a whole year available for £199.88. Give a song or album If a general music subscription is a bit too much like buying a voucher, you can gift an individual song or album through Apple’s iTunes. Find the track or album you want and hit gift. For those family members you don’t actually like, I suggest Crazy Frog’s Jingle Bells – just 79p. Comics Does your family member or friend have a tablet? Do they love comics? Then perhaps a digital comic ( like ebooks, but with way more pictures) is the perfect present for them . Giving individual comics or graphic novels is easy via Amazon’s Comixology. Just find the issue you’d like to send then hit the Gift in Cart button. Prices start at £1.49. Alternatively, Marvel’s Unlimited service costs $9.99 a month or $69 a year, but giving it as a gift is difficult. Vanity URL Anyone can have their very own space on the internet. Why not treat your loved one to a unique URL of their own. It could be their name, business, something obscure or ironic, maybe even a subtle dig only they would recognise. Hosting services such as Tumblr allow you to use a custom URL for free making www.yournamehere.com an affordable reality. From 99p. This article contains affiliate links to products.

The election was called by the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, at the end of October when the central government took control of Catalonia and sacked the regional government after it staged an illegal independence referendum and made a unilateral declaration of independence. Polls suggest Catalonia is set for a hung parliament, with the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC) vying for first place with the unionist, centre-right Citizens party. With no clear winner in sight, Thursday’s result is likely to lead to coalition negotiations to form a government that will either maintain the drive for independence in some form or defend the constitutional status quo. Tensions remain high in the region following the referendum and the Spanish police’s heavy-handed efforts to stop it. Secessionists believe that Madrid’s imposition of direct rule and the jailing of senior independence leaders could increase support for their cause. Unionists, however, argue that Catalans are sick of the social unrest and economic uncertainty generated by the unilateral actions of the government of deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont. The exceptional circumstances surrounding the election are compounded by the fact that Puigdemont has been campaigning from Belgium. He fled to Brussels hours before Spain’s attorney general asked for charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds to be brought against his cabinet almost two months ago. Puigdemont’s former number two, Oriol Junqueras, has been fighting the election from prison, where he and two prominent independence leaders are being held as part of a judicial investigation into October’s events. “This is not a normal election,” Puigdemont told supporters via video link on Tuesday evening as the campaign drew to a close. “What is at stake is not who gets the most votes, but whether the country [Catalonia] or Rajoy wins.” History, he added, would be watching the Catalan people. Puigdemont has said he will return to Spain if he wins even though he is expected to be arrested as soon as he sets foot in the country again. Although Puigdemont’s party ran on a joint ticket with Junqueras’s ERC in the 2015 regional elections, they are running separately this time and fractures have begun to appear between the two men, with the latter seeming to accuse the former president of hiding from his responsibilities by fleeing to Belgium. Puigdemont dismissed the accusations, saying his actions had been consistent with his mandate from the Catalan electorate. Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the Catalan branch of the national Citizens party, has been forthright in her anti-independence stance, and has vowed to end the secessionist drive and restore social cohesion within 100 days if elected. Speaking to a rally of more than 2,000 supporters in the Catalan capital on Tuesday, she said voters had to choose between continuing in a “Catalonia that is broken and divided or to begin a new era for all Catalans”. She added: “On Thursday, we are going to awaken from this nightmare of the independence push.” Rajoy has also been campaigning in Catalonia even though his party traditionally fares poorly in the region and could also lose unionist votes to Arrimadas’s party. “We have sacked the [Catalan] government because it was seated on a cascade of illegalities,” he told supporters on Tuesday, urging them to vote to heal the regions wounds. “Those of us who defend democracy, the constitution and the law are on the good side of history,” the prime minister said. The Spanish government has rejected calls for international observers to oversee the vote, arguing that it is being conducted under Spanish electoral law, which makes no such provisions. Unlike other autonomous regions, Catalonia has not passed its own electoral legislation. However, the central government has sought to dispel fears of foreign interference in the vote amid suggestions that some beyond Spain’s borders have been seeking to meddle in the Catalan issue by planting fake news stories. Spanish officials say they are monitoring the situation closely and point out that the count in each polling station will be manual rather than electronic. Whatever the elections’s results, which are expected late on Thursday night, they are unlikely to do much to swiftly dispel the fractures, arguments and anxieties that have been thrown up during Spain’s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. Article 155 of the Spanish constitution – which allowed Rajoy to sack the Catalan government and call elections – will remain in force until a new government has been agreed and a new regional president elected by the Catalan parliament. Much will also depend on the attitude of the pro-independence parties, should they enter office, as any further unilateral action will provoke a tough response from Madrid. If the different parties in the region fail to form a coalition over the coming weeks, the parliament will be dissolved and fresh elections called."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/dec/28/end-of-la-zad-frances-utopian-anti-airport-community-faces-bitter-last-stand","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"End of la ZAD?

France’s ‘utopian’ anti-airport community faces bitter last stand","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a cold but sunny December morning, the only sound around the hedgerows of Notre-Dame-des-Landes is the cawing of a horde of squabbling crows. Those asleep in the cabins, caravans and reclaimed farmhouses of Europe’s largest political squat (in terms of area) are awaiting a far ruder awakening. “They could send the gendarmes to evict us at any time,” says Pierre (not his real name; like most of the “resistants”, he prefers to remain anonymous). “But we are ready to defend the area – this is now our home. Besides, they’ve tried in the past and not succeeded.” The story of “la ZAD” in western France began more than half a century ago, when the French government earmarked the site for a new airport as part of a plan to create a transatlantic “Great West” gateway to France and Europe. Years of consultations, arguments and indecision supposedly ended in 2008, when the €580 million project was given official approval. The squatters began arriving the same year, claiming they were responding to an appeal from farmers fighting compulsory purchase orders. No airport-related construction has since taken place on the 1,650-hectare site. Up to 300 squatters – eco-warriors to some, green jihadis to others – now live in the ZAD: officially the Zone d’aménagement différé (zone for future development), renamed by protesters as the Zone à défendre (zone to defend). Some view themselves as political activists, reminiscent of those who protested against military installations such as Greenham Common in the UK and Larzac in southern France in the 1970s and 80s, and the tree protestors who fought the Newbury bypass in Britain in the 90s. Others are inspired by the 2008 Kingsnorth climate camp in Kent and the Christiania commune, the historic self-proclaimed autonomous district in Copenhagen, Denmark. For the majority, the ZAD offers an alternative, simpler and more utopian way of life. “The movement itself is large and has great solidarity, but there’s a great diversity of people and opinions,” says Camille (a favoured alias among the protesters). “From those who’ve got degrees to people from the streets or those who just want to get away from their families ... some are already politically engaged, some just broken by conventional life.” For the squatters, the airport plan – and the methods various governments have used to defend it – have become symbolic of everything a generation of politically, economically and ecologically militant millennials despise: inequality, capitalism, globalisation, the destruction of the environment, intensive farming and, above all, the rise of the individual over society and the collective. Driving through the village of Notre-Dame-des-Landes, the “Non à l’Aéroport” signs planted in the hedgerow and painted on the roads become more frequent. On the fringe of the ZAD, a house is decked with a long banner: “I was born here. I’m staying here.” After years of waiting, the veracity of that statement will soon emerge: French president Emmanuel Macron has pledged to make a final decision on the airport plan by the end of January. Whatever the decision, ministers have said those occupying the ZAD will have to go. The French media has had a field day: Le Journal du Dimanche recently claimed the “Zadists” – a now perjorative term the zone’s occupants dislike – were gearing up for violence, suggesting there are tunnels, watchtowers, firearms even. Standing near the camp’s “lighthouse” – built by squatters with a flashing light and alarm to warn of imminent police action – Camille dismisses the article as “utterly ridiculous”. “It’s just another attempt to make us out to be some kind of extremists. Really, it’s complete nonsense. They said we had dug series of tunnels like the Vietcong; in fact, it was one person who’d dug a well,” she says. Critics of the plan point out there is already an airport at Nantes just 26km away, and that the hedgerows of Notre-Dame-des-Landes have been declared a “zone of natural interest” for their exceptional flora and fauna. The local mayor, Jean-Paul Naud, says 75% of the area’s residents oppose the proposed airport – but above all, they will just be pleased to finally have a decision, oui or non. “It’s been put off time and time again. Local people don’t want the airport, have never wanted the airport, but now people just want a decision. They want it sorted,” Naud says. A successful social experiment Whatever the outcome, the ZAD settlers are not planning on going quietly. An attempt to dislodge them in 2012, named Opération César, resulted in clashes between the squatters and 2,000 gendarmes, and the government backing down in the face of public opposition to the scenes of violence. As their confidence has grown over the past decade, many squatters have abandoned tents and caravans and built wooden shacks and cabins, or occupied empty farms, planting the land around them. Today there is a boulangerie producing bread from wheat and grain grown in the ZAD, a brewery, a pirate radio station, an online newspaper, a weekly vegetable market, and several herds of cows, goats and sheep producing milk and meat. Produce is shared or sold for whatever the buyer can afford. It is a motley group living in around 70 different sites that defies age, class or social generalisations. There are no leaders, but those who speak for the “resistants” describe it as a “successful social experiment”. Marcel Thébault, a 59-year-old cattle farmer, seems an unlikely “eco-warrior” as he pulls off his gloves, sits down on a large sack of cattle feed, and contemplates his cows. He and his wife Sylvie, 52, were supposed to be living their dream: escaping the city to raise their two children in this tranquil corner of western France; tending their small herd, keeping a few sheep, living on the land, keeping it simple. During the last 17 years, however, they have been served with compulsory purchase orders, threats of evictions, and battled with politicians and gendarmes. A few years ago, Thébault resorted to a hunger strike to have his grievances heard. The Thébaults’ farm in the hamlet of Liminbout was not in the ZAD when they bought it in 1999. It is now. Only five of the original farmers remain in the zone; most took the money and disappeared. “I’m a small farmer first and foremost,” Marcel Thébault says. “My priority is to look after my animals, but I’ve also had to become a protestor to defend this land. And I will continue to defend it from a world that has become totally mad with capitalism; where only the strongest win and those with money take everything. “The idea of building an airport here when there is already a working airport nearby is so bizarre, so politically stupid, I’ve convinced myself it will never happen. They gave us money for the farm but we refused it; we’ve not cashed the cheque.” The Thébaults have no issue with the other protesters living in the ZAD. “[The media] make out that people here want to smash everything, defile everything – but I have no problem with them. We are detested by all politicians, to whom we present a real challenge. They don’t like the idea that people can block their decisions, they don’t accept it. But I will fight for everyone who wants to stay.” His neighbours include Sebastian: a biologist in his 40s who was working as an independent project manager when he came to the ZAD “out of curiosity” five years ago, intending to stay a few days. He never left. Today, he spends his day looking after a herd of 20 cows, all loaned by local farmers showing solidarity with the anti-airport movement, collecting the milk and making cheese. “The squatters and the farmers here are building something extraordinary, something that goes back to the simple life of our grandparents,” Sebastian says. “I feel in tune with that ideology. We are able to produce what we need, and we don’t need a lot. Before I’d always lived in towns, but I’m not tempted to go back to that.” New battlegrounds In the nearby village of Notre-Dame-des-Landes, locals have mixed feelings about the ZAD and its occupants – though few wish to be openly critical. There is a certain gratitude for keeping the airport development at bay, but resentment that the squatters are not playing entirely fair in their search for an alternative life. “If they want to live on the land, they will have to pay for it like everyone else,” says one local man. According to Mayor Naud: “People come to me and ask, ‘I have to pay my income tax and apply for planning permission if I want to build something, so why don’t they?’” He suggests if the government abandons the airport project, many of the squatters will simply move on to a new battleground for their ideology. Inside the ZAD, a 28-year-old architect calling himself Yves says if the squatters win the fight against “the social cannibalism of capitalism” at Notre-Dame-des-Landes, he would indeed take the struggle elsewhere. “If they decide to built the airport, it will be a new battle and I want to take part in that. If not, I will probably stay for five or so years and if all is going well, I’ll go somewhere else where we need to fight for our message,” he says. A fast-response system has been set up should word get out that the gendarmerie is on its way. Old tractors and piles of tyres are on hand to blockade roads. “In 2012 when they tried to evict us and the gendarmes came, the first day there were 200-300 of us,” recalls Pierre. “The next there were thousands who heard the rallying cry of our resistance. We proved the government cannot make us leave here.” Pierre points to what looks like a hedge but is actually a collection of sticks, wooden poles and brooms. “We had a ceremony last year and planted them all in the ground here,” he explains. “We said if we needed them again, we would unplant them. “The state institutions have no power here. We have organised our lives without them – that’s what they don’t like. Even if they expel us we’ll come back … After a month, there will be thousands of us.” Some names in this article have been changed at the interviewees’ request If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/21/paul-jacobs-pictures-movies-and-apartments-review-garage-punk","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T14:00:12Z","webTitle":"Paul Jacobs: Pictures, Movies and Apartments review – wild, essential garage punk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/21/paul-jacobs-pictures-movies-and-apartments-review-garage-punk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/21/paul-jacobs-pictures-movies-and-apartments-review-garage-punk","fields":{"headline":"Paul Jacobs: Pictures, Movies and Apartments review – wild, essential garage punk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pictures, Movies and Apartments offers the single most exciting opening to any album this year.

It’s the very essence of garage punk: something so primal you suspect the Sonics might have rejected it for being a little unsophisticated. Jacobs, from Canada, has – in common with so many modern garage rock artists – a bafflingly lengthy discography, full of the same kind of stuff. He’s not a one-note artist, though: he manages two or three. Born in a Zoo is just as fuzzed-up, but manages a sunshine psychedelia hook; the title track is bouncy lo-fi pop. Throughout, there are hooks and melodies – the album positively drips with them – but it’s combined with a singleminded wildness that’s desperately exciting.

Time off work. Gifts to give and receive. Eating and drinking as much as you like. Seeing friends, family, loved ones. The atmosphere of goodwill and cheer. What’s not to like? Quite a lot, actually. Christmas is often a source of great stress for many. At least one study suggests that it can literally give you a heart attack. Obviously, many people have good reason to not like Christmas, be it estrangement or loss of their own family or friends, trauma experienced during the festive period (with all the context cues constantly bringing the unpleasant memories flooding back) and so on. But, if you look at the modern manifestation of Christmas, it turns out there are a surprising number of elements that can, and probably do, lead to an increase in stress, rather than the opposite. Sound and vision Christmas comes with it a particular set of environmental features that could easily combine to tick us off, even if we don’t realise it. For instance, Christmas (in the northern hemisphere) happens in winter, when the days are shorter and the weather is generally poor. There’s a wealth of data to suggest that reduced daylight has a negative effect on our mood, so that’s already an issue. However, consider the following: a 2006 study suggested that mood and wellbeing in the workplace was correlated with exposure to daylight, but also with general illumination and colour. It being too dark, or too bright, caused negative moods, suggesting that an environment that’s generally dark but regularly punctuated with bright lights and garish colours would be the worst option for taxing our brains. Now consider the typical Christmas decorations you encounter everywhere. It’s not just visual either. Many complain about Christmas songs, leading to a surprising amount of coverage. In truth, familiar songs can often be perceived more positively rather than negatively, but some argue this is only true up to a point, after which something becomes annoying and unpleasant. Given how few of them there are and how often they’re played every year, most Christmas songs undoubtedly passed this point long ago. Festive workload While it’s nice to think of all the pleasant aspects of Christmas, they don’t just “happen”, or pop out of nowhere because you wished hard enough (despite what many a Christmas film would suggest). Someone must do the legwork in to put it all together. Traditionally it’s mum, or the family matriarch, but whoever ends up bearing the brunt of it is bound to be at risk of greater stress. Workload and stress are clearly linked, but just because it’s Christmas it doesn’t mean the regular demands of maintaining a household go away. If anything, because of work and school closures and more regular visitors, those demands increase. And heaped on top of this are a number of other duties (decorating, food and gift buying etc), many of which are pretty pricey at a time when money is increasingly tight. All of this would undeniably combine to create a situation where stress is far more common, not less. Great expectations The traditional image of Christmas is, let’s be honest, incredibly optimistic. Nearly every portrayal shows a cosy cheerful, tastefully decorated home, surrounded by pristine snow, in which a happy family gathers to share a large dinner cooked to picture-postcard perfection. Sadly, life is just too complex and messy to ever guarantee the mainstream portrayal of a perfect Christmas. And yet, we still expect it. The human tendency to expect the best is the result of a well-known optimism bias, something seemingly inherent in our brains. This, coupled with the planning fallacy (a related phenomenon where we repeatedly underestimate how much time and effort tasks will take despite previous experiences) would lead to many people expecting a fun, pleasant, relaxing Christmas and ending up with a messy, chaotic, stressful one. Expectations (and the thwarting of them) can cause a lot of stress. And that’s just at the personal level. These days, social media means we can see how great everyone else is at their Christmas efforts, inducing extra pressure to conform, and even do better to maintain your status in your group/community, because losing it is another cause of stress. So not only do people have to do all the extra work required to make Christmas happen, they also have to keep everyone updated as to the antics of their sodding “Elf on the Shelf” too. No pressure, like. Family matters Christmas is a time for families, if you’re lucky enough to still be part of one. However, while family support and involvement can often be an important facet of wellbeing, in the short-term your family can be a cause of stress. The obvious example of this is political or cultural clashes caused by generational or even geographical differences, which result in tense atmospheres or furious rows over the dinner table, particularly in these polarised times of Brexit and Trump. Thing is though, even if there’s no obvious source of disagreement or even conflict, a prolonged period in close quarters with a lot of your family can still be stressful. There’s the relative lack of privacy that comes from having your house full of people, a known cause of stress. There’s also the loss of control as everyone is chipping in or in your face, even if it’s with 100% good intentions. Perceived loss of control is another potent stressor. There’s also the weird aspect of regression. You return to your childhood home and stay with your parents with your siblings around, it seems like your brain “resets” and reverts to the schemas that governed your behaviour and thinking when you were in that context before (which usually bedded in over many years). Trouble is, you’re typically not a teenager any more. You often have your own partner and children with you. So now you’ve got competing perspectives in your head, with your “responsible adult” thinking crashing against the “subservient child” behaviour patterns. This causes confusion and uncertainty, yet another source of stress. Eat, drink and be worried Given how stressful Christmas can be, it’s no wonder people quickly resort to stress-reducing acts, namely eating rich food and drinking alcohol. ‘tis the season, after all. It’s true that high-calorie foods reduce feelings of stress. Ditto alcohol. But in both cases, it’s a very short-term fix. Our bodies seem to actually store more fat when we’re stressed, and alcohol consumption can quickly cross the line from “pleasant” to “not pleasant”, leaving us bloated, hung-over, miserable and with a worse state of overall health than when we started. All things that add up to more stress. This isn’t to say that Christmas is, by default, a hard and stressful time. It can be brilliant, providing all the good things we expect and more. But it’s important to recognise that this isn’t a given, or automatic. It all requires time, effort and investment. Ignoring this will just make it more stressful in the long run. Dean Burnett’s book The Idiot Brain makes an ideal present for someone you don’t like but are obligated to buy for as you can say “I saw this and thought of you”.

So it is that TutorBot heads for Blackburn to help out young Isaac, who needs help with his speech, while FitBot joins the Rocket family in Plymouth as their personal trainer. Experts monitor the results. Jonathan Wright Royal Institution Christmas Lectures 2017: The Language of Life 8pm, BBC Four Prof Sophie Scott uses the latest of her three Christmas lectures to explore and explain how silent messages frequently shape the way we communicate. From contagious yawns to contentious glares, a lot can be expressed without summoning a sound, such actions often playing a key role in social bonding and cohesion. So, nothing to do with switching your mobile to vibrate mode while at the cinema. Mark Gibbings-Jones Alan Partridge: Why, When, Where, How and Whom? 9pm, BBC Two Presumably, Alan Partridge is a fan of Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, who once said: “If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.” So it has proved for Alan, who, in 2018, will finally find himself back on the BBC after years in the wilderness. No doubt he’ll be typically gracious about the whole thing. This doc explores one of the most three-dimensional comedy creations of all time. Phil Harrison Miranda Does Christmas 9pm, Channel 4 It wouldn’t be Christmas without Miranda Hart raising a mince pie and falling over. Here, she harks back to the simple days of childhood when the festive season was fun, and heads out on to the streets to spread joy. Back in the studio, guests including David Tennant, Sam Smith and Prue Leith get the Miranda treatment. If that sounds like hell, don’t wait around for the gospel choir singing a Christmas mashup. Hannah Verdier Agatha Christie vs Hercule Poirot 7.30pm, Sky Arts There’s a classy BBC4 vibe to this enjoyable film. Pierre Bayard – director, literary professor, potential rival to Steven Mackintosh in voiceover ubiquity – is our guide in this investigation of Agatha Christie. Part of it is straight bio, but the lion’s share tells her story by way of Christie’s 1926 novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. “Read my book again,” she instructed her readers, as if encouraging them to look beyond Poirot’s conclusions. John Robinson Williams and Spielberg: The Adventure Continues 8.45pm, Sky Arts Documentary by Laurent Bouzereau examining the extraordinarily fruitful, decades-long collaboration between Steven Spielberg and John Williams. It is a reminder of the undervalued power of a great soundtrack: try to imagine Jaws without the two-note undertow, Close Encounters of the Third Kind without the chirruping alien greeting or Indiana Jones without his swaggering brass fanfare.

Happily, that’s just what Tim Vine – travelling not just in time with this show, but all the way from radioland – has got in store for us.

The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, suggested his decision to use social media to challenge a Labour MP’s claims about universal credit were part of a concerted Tory effort to respond more robustly. He also claimed that “bogus” accusations by Labour and the media had resulted in a spike in the number of claimants turning up to job centres with unfounded anxieties. “I think it is important that we do not desert the battlefield. Social media can at the moment feel dominated by the hard left. I think it is important we engage and make the points,” he said. “I strongly believe we have got a really good policy with this that will transform lives, but there is almost a sort of knee-jerk criticism and a temptation in particular with universal credit that you can almost say anything critical about it and it goes without challenge.” The minister’s ongoing battle with Frank Field (whom he admitted was not someone who could be described as “hard left”) comes after the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became embroiled in a row with the comedy actor Ralf Little over mental health statistics. Meanwhile, the Conservative party has boosted its social media presence and Downing Street has brought in a new social media expert, hoping to tackle some of the party’s weaknesses highlighted in the 2017 election. Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, claimed on Twitter that a mother-of-two was facing Christmas without any payments as a result of being moved onto universal credit, leading the Department for Work and Pensions to look into the case. Gauke hit back at the Labour MP, claiming he was wrong, only for Field to later respond by saying that wasn’t the member of the public he was referring to. Field insisted the woman had not been given an appointment with DWP but eventually admitted that she had later discovered that an advance payment had been made on Monday. Gauke said the money had been handed over before any intervention because the system worked. “If the Labour Party really want to help, they should provide us with the information we would need to act quickly.” The minister said there was a “legitimate debate” to be had about universal credit but claimed that unfounded scare stories were having a negative impact on benefit recipients. “I am concerned that there are vulnerable people who are scared not by actual cases, but by some of the uninformed criticisms of cases that are not as they are first portrayed. We have seen that pretty consistently; there have been many incidents of that.” He insisted that the evidence was showing universal credit was a transformative reform, and said his government had listened to concerns raised by Tory MPs about a six-week waiting period. He revealed that the take-up of advance payments by those having to wait five or six weeks to move onto UC had risen from around a third to 62% – while 80% of people were receiving their full payments within the period – up from half during the summer. Gauke admitted that after a £1.5bn package for universal credit in the budget, he had an ambition to put more money into the system to reduce the taper rate at which people lose the money as they go into work. “Its been brought down to 65 to 63%, the aspiration to bring it down further is one we share,” he said. “What we have got is big and ambitious, but it is something that on the ground is working well.” Gauke was speaking during a briefing at the Centre for Social Justice alongside its founder, the former welfare secretary and architect of the new benefit, Iain Duncan Smith. The former Tory leader also accused Jeremy Corbyn of getting his facts wrong. “The leader of the opposition has got up at the despatch box at prime minister’s questions saying all these people were basically being evicted because of UC in Gloucester. Turned out to be a completely bogus story, not true.” “I think the media has to have a bit of responsibility in dealing with people who are in vulnerable situations. “I do think these facts should be fully checked. The opposition is playing a political game with this, and their game is to try and make things look as bad as possible. But, frankly I think it is pretty cynical to do that and I would suggest people behave a little bit more responsibly because these are people’s lives.” Duncan Smith was particularly angry about a claim by the BBC’s Paul Lewis that 100,000 Britons would miss out on benefits over Christmas – claiming that the initial claim led the bulletins, while a later retraction was not reported so heavily. Gauke’s intervention comes after Hunt took to Twitter again following repeated clashes with Little, an actor in The Royle Family. On Wednesday, Hunt challenged Corbyn’s claims over mental health spending on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/the-appliance-of-science-hope-and-fear-in-tomorrows-world","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"The appliance of science: hope and fear in tomorrow’s world | Jim Al-Khalili","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/the-appliance-of-science-hope-and-fear-in-tomorrows-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/the-appliance-of-science-hope-and-fear-in-tomorrows-world","fields":{"headline":"The appliance of science: hope and fear in tomorrow’s world","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Meteorologists can now reliably tell us if it is going to rain tomorrow, but wouldn’t dream of forecasting rain a year from now. Similarly, scientists find it much easier to predict what the world will look like in the next decade rather than in a century. This is because the technology of tomorrow relies on the science of today – it is only after we have understood a certain concept that we can think about how to put it to use. A famous example is Michael Faraday’s research into electricity and magnetism in the 1830s. It was only decades later that others saw how to use this new knowledge to build electric motors and power generators, inventions that transformed our world. Sometimes, of course, scientific discoveries lead to completely unforeseen applications – the internet is one such example. But what about 2018? Surely the world won’t look too different? All I can say for certain is there are three technologies we’re going hear much more about next year, even more than we have done this year. The first is the incredible opportunities opening up in medicine thanks to advances in gene editing. Just this year, we saw the development of techniques that allow for single molecules on DNA to be tweaked or replaced, with the potential to reverse genetic mutations responsible for a whole host of terrible conditions. Soon we will be able to remove, very precisely, a faulty gene responsible for diseased cells, and replace it with the “healthy”, correctly functioning version, thus treating genetic disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis or Huntington’s disease. The flip side is that this advance opens up the insidious possibility of modifying the genome in an embryo (so-called germline editing) leading, potentially, to designer babies and genetically modified superhumans. Debate about the ethics of such techniques needs to be had, and quickly. We are also going to be hearing more about advances in AI and robotics. One recent development is “machine learning”. By making use of Big Data – huge caches of information that can be analysed for patterns and trends in human behaviour – this AI technology, known as “deep learning”, is really taking off. AI can now look for and find patterns in huge collections of data. These include, for example, the current speed and location of every vehicle on a city’s roads, with the current state of every traffic light; or the medical records from every regional or national hospital, detailing every patient’s symptoms, drug dosages and results. While regulations need to be put in place for this, try not to worry too much – Skynet will not be taking over the world just yet. We’ll also hear more about advances in energy, thanks to continuing plummeting costs of renewables such as solar and wind, and because of advances in energy-storage technologies – basically super-batteries that will be used in everything from our smart phones to our electric cars. Looking further ahead, you can be sure that within a decade or two we will have fridges that will tell the supermarket you’re out of milk, AI-controlled smart cities, fully immersive virtual-reality, augmented reality superimposed directly on to our retinas, even invisibility cloaks. But we cannot allow ourselves to be propelled headlong into an unknown future without carefully exploring the implications, both ethical and practical, of our discoveries and their applications. Scientific knowledge in itself is neither good nor evil – it’s the way we use it that matters. What’s Next?

Michel Barnier, who is negotiating Brexit on behalf of the other 27 member states, said it would be logical for the transition to end then because that was the last day of the EU’s current seven-year budget. “The transition period is useful and it will enable the public administration in Britain to get prepared for the challenges they have to face,” Barnier told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. Theresa May has called for a two-year transition and agreed that the UK will continue to make annual payments into the EU budget until 2021. Barnier confirmed that during the transition the UK would have to apply all EU laws, including new ones agreed after 2019, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. Under the EU’s take-it-or-leave-it offer on transition, the UK would be subject to the enforcement powers of the European commission, EU agencies and the European court of justice. Gibraltar would not automatically be part of the transition, as the UK would have to reach a separate bilateral agreement with Spain. Barnier confirmed that Spain had an effective veto on the future of the British overseas territory. In theory the UK’s withdrawal agreement only needs the approval of a weighted majority of EU member states; in practice, all Brexit decisions, so far, have been taken unanimously. “We have always worked with the view that there has to be consensus and unity and we want to find with all our decisions a common position with consensus and unity,” Barnier said. The question mark over Gibraltar’s place in the transition has angered the British government, which argues Brussels is being inconsistent and contradictory over the territory that Spain and the UK have been arguing over for centuries. Draft negotiating documents published by the European commission on Wednesday showed that during the transition the UK “could be invited to attend” technical committees and expert groups, when the issues under discussion concerned Britain. But voting rights have been ruled out. The EU wants “specific procedural arrangements” on fish quotas. Barnier said British ministers would be excluded from the councils setting annual catch quotas: “When there are discussions, such as [those] establishing the fish quotas, after the UK’s departure, they will no longer be part of the councils.” In a blunt message to the British government, the EU negotiator stressed that the only way to secure the transition deal was to agree the complete withdrawal agreement, including citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border. “If we don’t have an orderly withdrawal, then there won’t be a transition period.” He restated his position that the UK should not expect a special deal on financial services – a view he outlined in an interview earlier this week with the Guardian and other European newspapers. Barnier said the UK’s red lines – rejection of the European court of justice and free movement of people – meant the logical choice was a free-trade agreement in the style of accords struck with Canada, South Korea and Japan. Each agreement was tailor-made to the country, but was underpinned by the same logic, he said. He dismissed suggestions he had been ready to negotiate a deal on financial services with the US when he was the EU commissioner responsible for regulating banks. He said the EU had considered “developing cooperation” with the US through the G20 to ensure a level playing field, but “as far as I am aware there is no free trade agreement that would allow privileged access for financial services”. The EU negotiator also noted Britain would drop out of 750 international agreements on Brexit day on 29 March 2019. These go far beyond the EU’s 34 trade deals covering 60 countries, which Barnier said would have to be renegotiated by the UK. The 750 also cover the bilateral accords Brussels has negotiated with almost every non-EU country on finance, environment, fisheries, transport, data-sharing, agriculture and nuclear fuel. In a dig at Brexiters hoping to reduce “red tape”, Barnier said: “It is always useful to remember that when we talk about the red tape in Brussels this means, for the 28 member states, that they don’t need to have that bureaucracy.” Barnier will now send his draft negotiating guidelines to national capitals, which will sign off the document. The EU will adopt its official position on future relations with the UK in March 2018, with the aim of agreeing a political declaration on trade and the withdrawal treaty by October 2018. The treaty will go to the European parliament for approval before Brexit day. The EU’s strict timetable underscores the stakes for the British parliament, after MPs voted last week for a “meaningful vote” on the final deal. Any attempts to re-open the deal after October 2018 could run into difficulty. Asked whether the British government could return to the negotiating deal after October 2018, Barnier said: “I think that we have to build trust for the right conditions to be in place for ratification and not wait until the end of this process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/catalonias-regional-election-unlikely-to-heal-bitter-divisions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T12:59:04Z","webTitle":"Catalonia's regional election unlikely to heal bitter divisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/catalonias-regional-election-unlikely-to-heal-bitter-divisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/catalonias-regional-election-unlikely-to-heal-bitter-divisions","fields":{"headline":"Catalonia's regional election unlikely to heal bitter divisions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They are known as the silent majority, a multitude of depoliticised, working-class Catalans living in the industrial towns around Barcelona who, when asked, say they want nothing to do with independence. In simple terms, these are the people who will cheer Barcelona football stars such as Andrés Iniesta or Gerard Piqué when they wear the club’s colours, and cheer them just as loudly when they don the red shirt of “la Roja”, Spain’s national team. They are far more likely to do that than enter a voting booth. On Thursday night it will be established whether this social group, whose families mostly migrated to wealthy Catalonia from poorer parts of Spain, really exists – or at least whether its members have shaken off their apathy and voted, as the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will be praying. Only if they turn out in force and help to overturn the parliamentary majority enjoyed by the separatists at elections in 2015 will the government in Madrid be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Even then, it will only be a relative letup in a bruising political conflict that is set to run for years, decades, or generations. Any other result – another separatist victory, or a messy split that fails to provide a working majority – will keep the crisis bubbling. It may also mean Rajoy maintaining direct rule. It would be wrong to see this vote, though, as Catalonia against Spain. Instead, it pits Catalans against Catalans, making the election both starker and more representative than the chaotic and illegal independence vote organised by the separatist government on 1 October – which produced dramatic and disturbing images of police beating their way into voting stations to snatch away ballot boxes. These are extraordinary circumstances, with Catalonia split into two increasingly angry halves and polls showing that those who preach moderation or compromise are the least likely to succeed. A bitter campaign in which the Catalan electorate is being told to punish one side or the other for their behaviour over the past months has done nothing to heal wounds. One side is outraged that police batons were used during the 1 October vote, that some of its leaders are now in jail and that Rajoy later imposed direct rule. This, it says, is the final proof of Madrid’s iniquity. The other side is furious that the separatists used a slim parliamentary majority – backed by less than 50% of Catalan votes – to force a confrontation with Madrid before declaring a muddled form of independence that turned out to have no substance to it. That, they say, has sowed the seeds of division, fractured Catalan society and driven away both money and jobs. And yet both sides must continue living together. “What Catalonia needs is a future, not a settling of scores about the recent past,” wrote Laia Bonet, a Catalan socialist, in La Vanguardia newspaper. That may be true, but it is not how voters are being encouraged to think. A separatist victory would do little to clear things up and may provoke splits in the independence movement’s own ranks. Hardcore separatists want to return to the path of civil disobedience, but the leadership appears to have realised that, with the European Union having turned its back, that route is blocked. Just restoring the self-government that Catalonia usually enjoys and seeking an amnesty for its own leaders may absorb much of the movement’s energy. Apart from that, there is little indication of how it would drive the independence campaign forwards. “Tell us what you plan to so with the road map that you left only half-completed,” said the disillusioned separatist writer Bernat Dedéu in the pro-independence elnacional.cat. “Tell us how you plan to combat the violence of the state against the people.” In this rarified and confrontational atmosphere, with the unpredictable “silent majority” so important, opinion polls cannot be trusted. The latest by the Catalan regional government, for example, had to be statistically adjusted after failing to find a sufficient number of people to answer its questions. The only certainty is that whoever wins on Thursday will face two daunting tasks: mend the divisions between Catalans and make peace with Madrid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/dec/23/magpie-collector-facts-curiosities-secrets-quizmaster-weakest-link-chase","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"'I'm a magpie, a collector of facts and curiosities': secrets of a quizmaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/dec/23/magpie-collector-facts-curiosities-secrets-quizmaster-weakest-link-chase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/dec/23/magpie-collector-facts-curiosities-secrets-quizmaster-weakest-link-chase","fields":{"headline":"'I'm a magpie, a collector of facts and curiosities': secrets of a quizmaster","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I can’t pinpoint the exact moment I realised that quizzes would play a major part in my life, but the Cubs’ Mastermind tournament seems a good place to start. I was 10, and my specialist subject was Lenin. (The irony that the Scout movement had been banned in the USSR was lost on me.) I did, however, win – and from then on was not shy about putting my general knowledge to the test. There are no short cuts to acquiring a quizzer’s general knowledge. Mine came through a lot of reading when I was young – neither structured nor even age-appropriate, but definitely omnivorous. I read children’s encyclopedias, the Guinness Book of Records, Usborne histories and compendiums of facts. Poring over atlases full of now-defunct countries, I savoured names such as Tashkent and Ulan Bator, and began learning that staple of the quiz world: capital cities. Meanwhile, Top Trumps left me able to reel off recherché facts and figures about Olympic athletes, second world war aircraft, footballers of the 70s and diesel locomotives. When I was recovering in hospital after an emergency appendectomy, my parents brought me the Ladybird book on Warwick the King Maker: the ruthless machinations of the Wars of the Roses, they figured, would be the perfect postoperative read. Dad had form in this regard. When I was born, my mother asked him to bring her something on the maternity ward. I think she was expecting Nova magazine, rather than a biography of Stalin. As a sixth-former, I became a contestant on Blockbusters. My classmate and I won our first game, but though I completed a gold run, our reign as champions was brief. Next match we were out, walking away with £120, an embossed dictionary, a sweatshirt (never worn), a digital organiser (never taken out of the box) and a radio cassette player that survived years of student accommodation and shared flats, eventually expiring deep into the 21st century. For the record, the presenter Bob Holness was an absolute gent, taking meals with the contestants and putting them at their ease. Since then, I’ve worked on seven quiz shows and never come across another host mixing with contestants off set. We were also chaperoned by a no-nonsense Scotsman who, since we were all between 16 and 18, laid down the law on alcohol and everything else. When I left university, I wasn’t aware that there was even such a job as quiz writer. (Frustratingly, University Challenge was off air for my entire college career.) But then I saw a job ad in Media Guardian: the Channel 4 quiz show Fifteen to One was looking for writers. The first part of the interview was a 50-question general knowledge test; no problem there. I’d fantasised about a job interview that was simply a list of quiz questions and here it was. The second part was sitting mutely and politely nodding as the host and producer, the late William G Stewart, held forth. He emphasised that this was a serious examination of general knowledge, not a mere gameshow. Anecdotes from a long TV career were mixed with a discussion about the Elgin marbles, which he wanted to see returned to Greece. The interview took place under a portrait of his friend, the Carry On star Sid James. I got the job. The office in Putney, west London, had the forbidding air of a Victorian schoolroom rather than a hip production company. The fledgling internet was mistrusted as a source for questions and instead we consulted an impressive in-house library (I don’t expect many quizzes now have a full 20-volume set of the Oxford English Dictionary). And in other ways, too, it felt like a show apart. Shortly before I joined, Bill, as we knew him, had personally sued a former champion who entered under a false name – to get around the rules against appearing more than once. Fifteen to One was Bill’s fiefdom and he was its (usually) benign dictator. Long after the series was cancelled he remained a generous host, keeping up with former staff at an annual Christmas lunch. After Fifteen to One, I worked on a short-lived quiz called Greed, hosted by Jerry Springer. It was an American format with a top prize of £1m, the largest ever offered by Channel 5, but the initial run was only eight episodes – too few to overcome teething problems and build an audience (it was Channel 5: nobody watched it). I joined the BBC as a writer on the Weakest Link. On that show, certain topics were off limits because the host Anne Robinson struggled with their pronunciation. She couldn’t say “apocalypse” at speed, so there were no questions about the film Apocalypse Now. She also had a problem with Greg Rusedski and Antarctica, although we could use south pole instead. Furthermore. For ease of reading. The questions had to be written. In an odd chopped-up style. Which. Once mastered. Was difficult to stop using. At other times. After so many years working on them, do I have a theory as to why people love quizzes so much? Partly I think it’s an opportunity to show off, a form of intellectual one-upmanship. It can be argued, of course, that it’s just a test of memory, the ability to recall facts; mere trivia, and nothing to do with intelligence. But watching the bespectacled gladiators of general knowledge on TV has a surprisingly enduring appeal. Big cash prizes raise the stakes, notably in the case of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Even when nothing more than prestige is up for grabs, it can be irresistibly compelling: Mastermind created a folk hero when taxi driver Fred Housego won in 1980, answering questions on the Tower of London; the final was watched by 18 million people. Doing this professionally means I tend to see life through a quiz-tinted lens. Can I get a nice question out of this or that fact? Mentally or literally, I’m always noting down nuggets of information – from books, newspapers, conversations, documentaries or the rabbit hole of the internet. Wikipedia may be prone to errors and mischievous editing, but it is a wonderful jumping-off point for ideas; what printed encyclopedia would contain the rules of Deal Or No Deal, or explain the conventions of WWE wrestling? The quiz writer is a magpie by nature, a collector of facts and curiosities. I’m no expert on the composer Delius, but I do know that as a young man he spent time in Florida growing oranges. Doubtless this has no relevance to his music, but it’s the odd details that tend to linger in the memory. Visiting the Indira Gandhi memorial museum in Delhi, I was struck by the fact that she was assassinated while on her way to be interviewed by Peter Ustinov. EM Forster’s epigraph to Howards End inspired the title of the cult BBC quiz Only Connect – but what I mainly recall from the novel is Leonard Bast’s bleakly ironic death; the frustrated literary man crushed by a bookcase. When the Stones’ guitarist Keith Richards hurt himself falling from a library ladder, I saw the kernel of a neat “what links” question. A favourite source is the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, a work that manages to be both authoritative and addictively readable. Answer this: who is listed as “publisher and swindler”? “Art historian and spy”? “Jacobite heroine”? Congratulations if you said Robert Maxwell, Anthony Blunt and Flora MacDonald. In what other reference work would Ethelred the Unready rub shoulders with Jade Goody? The best questions, especially for TV, have the “I should have known that” factor. They might appear tricky or obscure, but the answer has a familiar ring. Writing very difficult questions is all too easy, but they don’t make for an entertaining quiz. Ideally, questions should reward lateral thinking. For example, who said in a 2016 interview that, in his new job, he’d like “a nice corner office or at least an office that has corners in it”? It was Barack Obama, shortly before coming to the end of his eight years in the Oval-shaped Office. An interest in eastern European languages isn’t much use in quiz writing, but it led to one of my favourite questions: which letter worth 10 points in the English version of Scrabble is worth only one in the Polish edition? It’s Z. And for a cricketers’ special of the Weakest Link, commissioned after the 2005 Ashes triumph, I was able to go full-on nerd: which Sri Lankan cricketer has longer initials than his surname? The former bowler WPUJC Vaas. Multiple-choice questions allow contestants to take an educated guess (or just guess) and, depending on the tone of the show, a comedy option will raise a laugh. When the innocuous-looking question, “In what sport does Fanny Chmelar [pronounced Shmeller] compete for Germany?” was asked on ITV’s the Chase in 2011, presenter Bradley Walsh’s fits of giggles went viral. That single question helped establish the show as a ratings winner. How are quiz shows put together? On most, a team of writers will work on a bespoke database. They submit questions, backed up by a couple of reputable sources, having first checked they’re not repeats. Long-running shows are especially hard to write for, as every conceivable question seems to have been asked. This was certainly the case on the Weakest Link and the Chase, where I now work. Question writers have to get creative and think of new ways to ask old questions. It’s now standard practice for questions to be sent out to external verifiers for double-checking, giving producers a fig leaf if a mistake slips through. Outright howlers are mercifully rare. What’s more common is problems with alternative acceptable answers. It may seem straightforward to ask which Italian composer wrote the opera Otello. Verdi, right? Well, his is the more famous, but Rossini also wrote one. In the studio, a contestant once (correctly) guessed “Custer’s last stand” when “the Battle of the Little Bighorn” was the expected correct answer. (The question: at what battle on 25 June 1876 did a Native American force defeat the US 7th Cavalry Regiment?) This is the moment when there’s a sharp intake of breath and heads turn towards the question writer (a member of the questions team sits in the gallery, just in case). It’s also increasingly common for quizzes to have an adjudicator at recordings, who can act as an intermediary in the event of a dispute. The Guardian quiz is a different animal. For a long time, it was written by legal commentator Marcel Berlins; when he took a few months’ break in 2002, I was asked to fill the gap. Eventually this absence became permanent and I have been devising the weekly quiz ever since. Almost. At one point it fell victim to a redesign and was dropped, which prompted a reader to send in a question of her own: what links the crew of the Mary Celeste; Benjamin Bathurst; the Guardian Weekend quiz? Answer: all disappeared without explanation. It was restored the following week. The magazine quiz is a world away from the TV shows. The questions are down in black and white, to be considered at one’s leisure, with none of the time pressure (or the cash prizes: sorry). And, naturally, Guardian readers are a formidable bunch. I receive occasional complaints that it’s too difficult and am told, very rarely, that it’s getting too easy. Any factual errors are politely drawn to my attention. Usually, this happens when I stray too far from my comfort zone, like the time I muddled Transformers, Decepticons and Autobots. As a subeditor reminded me, “That’s what happens when you try and get down with the kids.” But mostly people seem to relish the challenge. The quiz has featured at a reader’s wedding and has even been turned into performance art: as part of Antony Gormley’s One and Other project in 2009, a man called John Major (not that one) read the Weekend questions from the vacant fourth plinth on Trafalgar Square. And even now, after writing quizzes for almost 20 years, it rarely feels like work. I’m still waiting to be tapped on the shoulder, told that the dilettante life is over and it’s time to get a proper job. • Commenting on this piece?

This isn’t funny","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not.” So states the writing guide of the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. As expressly outlined by the leaked guide, the goal is to make the site’s ideas digestible, palatable and visible to those outside its toxic sphere. By muddying the waters of Nazis’ hate, a greater number will drink. While none of this is surprising to those of us who have been targets of Nazis and the alt-right, it’s useful to have their goals so plainly, if disgustingly, outlined. It helps show media sites contemplating profiles of white supremacists – like Mother Jones or the New York Times – that they’re only aiding them by putting forward their unchallenged ideas. And it’s also important as it reveals how Nazis use satire, humour or “lolz” as partial immunity for their hate, allowing them tolerance from those who would (or should) otherwise repudiate it. As the guide states: “Packing our message inside of … humour can be viewed as a delivery method. Something like adding cherry flavour to children’s medicine.” If you’re a person of colour, this might already strike a familiar chord: you’ve no doubt experienced bigotry from supposedly not racist people in the form of “humour” or “satire”. By placing bigotry in such a shell many white people seem to believe they can’t or shouldn’t be criticised. As the Daily Stormer guide says: “When using racial slurs, it should come across as half-joking – like a racist joke that everyone laughs at …” If you’ve ever been the only person of colour at a social gathering, you’ll know what it’s like when a casual racist joke arises. “Everyone” laughs because of power dynamics, not the joke’s genius. People of colour have been told not to be hypersensitive throughout our lives, that it’s just humour, don’t be a wet sock, it’s just words, and so on. When white people wield the conch of humour, people of colour are supposed to just endure the racism that comes out and laugh at the humour encasing it. This is the model neo-Nazis view as fertile ground for spreading hate. Bigotry obtaining immunity under the banner of humour is so widespread, there’s even a popular card game called Cards Against Humanity, centred on that premise. (The company even refers to it as “a party game for horrible people”.) This stepping over lines of decency is boastingly called being “politically incorrect” or “ironic racism”. Too many people have convinced themselves that such humour is daring for targeting marginalised groups, or somehow sending those who “do it for real”. This is exactly what neo-Nazis want. It’s lifted directly from their writing guide to make hatred digestible, to spread it via normalisation and tolerance, via claims of humour’s immunity. Many white people have told me, sometimes proudly, that they mock all races, thus outlining a belief we’ve moved beyond racial inequality. But we haven’t: just ask the neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching openly in America’s streets, calling for the death of a group of people who aren’t like them. Donald Trump built his platform on this idea of stepping on so-called political correctness – without really saying what the term meant. As Adam Serwer writes in a powerful essay for the Atlantic: “What Trump’s supporters refer to as political correctness is largely the result of marginalised communities gaining sufficient political power to project their prerogatives on to society at large. What a society finds offensive is not a function of fact or truth, but of power.” It’s not that these jokes are suddenly offensive, but that marginalised groups have a little more power to be heard. Many would rather complain about “political correctness” than wonder if they might be wrong. Here’s a hint: if your view aligns with a neo-Nazi writing guide, it’s probably wrong. It’s too easy not to care about words, jokes and actions when you’re not the one affected by it. While I’m glad most white people seem to passionately oppose Nazis, that’s not a particularly high moral bar to pass. If you believe that Nazi ideology should be opposed, you can’t just ignore the way this ideology is spread. And normalisation through humour is a key part of that. People cannot get immunity because they couch their slurs in humour or because they believe they’re not racist, sexist or transphobic. Intention doesn’t equal reality, especially when it’s a reality lived by people unlike you. We should all be trying to figure out what counts as hurtful so we can avoid it in ourselves and use our own privilege to call it out when we see it. That’s not oversensitivity, it’s that for far too long marginalised people’s concerns weren’t factored in. Now that our concerns are heard more, it undermines the status quo of whose considerations matter. Privileged people could continue their lives unaffected by whether their jokes hurt others. As Serwer noted in the same essay, this disjunctive alignment of consideration is why Trump is more outraged over kneeling athletes than murdered black children. Only one of those categories affects him and his base. You may not be racist, but attempts to be funny cannot give you permission to say bigoted things for effect. It’s the foot in the door true bigots need to make their hate palatable and widespread. As Louise Mirrer, the president and CEO of the New York Historical Society, noted about Nazis normalising antisemitism in children’s books: “You kind of lose the capacity to feel appalled. And then you just believe it.” There are no such things as monsters, only people who hold monstrous beliefs. They weren’t born with those views. Someone spread them. And now we have access to a modern Nazi playbook on how they do it. Hatred should not be normalised and only we can prevent it. The Daily Stormer uses our complacency as fertile ground to further its agenda. It’s time we learned how the seeds of hatred are spread so we can stop them from blooming. • Tauriq Moosa is a South African writer focusing on ethics, justice, tech and pop culture"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/02/good-to-meet-you-vernon-gibberd","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T11:58:18Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

Let's tackle it in 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last November, the Institute for Fiscal Studies made the staggering assertion that in the next few years, 5.2 million children will be living in poverty in the UK. This is hugely concerning on many fronts. First, poverty damages childhoods and life chances – it is a travesty of social justice that in one of the richest economies in the world, roughly a third of children live in poverty. Second, England is the only country in the UK without a national strategy aimed at tackling child poverty. And third, if some of the recent economic forecasts come to fruition, there is a very real risk this figure will rise further. Poverty permeates every aspect of daily life. Parents are forced to choose between heating their homes or paying their rent. Many go hungry just so their children can eat. More and more families are relying on food banks – many of which are struggling to meet demand. We know that outcomes for children are impacted: they are less able to achieve academically and socially in school and are more likely to suffer from poor health than their wealthier peers. Poverty is setting many children and young people up for a lifetime of disadvantage. So my first, and biggest, hope for the year ahead is that as a country we get serious about tackling child poverty. Reducing deprivation and the resultant child poverty needs to be an overarching policy consideration for government. It is important that Brexit negotiations do not distract from the need for an ambitious and comprehensive child poverty reduction strategy – a truly cross-government approach, backed up by sufficient funding. It’s been 18 months since the country voted to exit the European Union. Little is known yet about the long-term impacts on children and young people; indeed, the government’s Brexit white paper only mentioned them once. In order to create a country that works for all children, one that prioritises supporting them and their families earlier, my second hope for the year is that the government puts children at the centre of these negotiations. How we care for, educate and support the children of today is an indication of how successful our country will be tomorrow. Self-sustaining and strong communities contribute to the economic success of the country. It’s in our best interests to invest in children now; not doing so is a false economy. Now for a prediction. Demand for children’s services has risen significantly over the past decade. Our own research found that, at 31 March 2016, the number of children subject to an initial child protection plan had increased by 78% since 2007-08. Later this year, the Association of Directors of Children’s Services will publish the latest iteration of this research, bringing the evidence-base up to date. It is likely the year ahead will see more families requiring support from children’s services if the government doesn’t reaffirm its commitment to supporting children and families in need. As demand rises, local authorities are forced to focus their limited resources on statutory, high end services that keep children safe from the immediate risk of harm, rather than on the early help services we know make a huge difference in the lives of children and families, such as children’s centres and youth services. As a result, demand for high end statutory services and health and social care will only increase, as will the fiscal and human costs. • Alison Michalska is president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services and corporate director for children and adults at Nottingham city council Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

As Britpop shrivelled, their third album, 1997’s The Fat of the Land, took Howlett’s uncouth youthquake of evil techno and hot-wired breakbeats to the world; an astonishingly successful incursion into the US arguably laid the groundwork for the recent EDM explosion. Two decades on, you could forgive these Essex boys a backward-looking victory lap to fatten the brand. Instead, after yet another year of festival dates across Europe and beyond (judging by their far-flung tour itinerary of the past half-decade, the Prodigy seem to have made it their mission to crack Russia), there is this short UK sprint, culminating in three sold-out nights at Brixton Academy. It may be slap-bang in the middle of panto season but this cacophonous evening of headlong entertainment is not quite Jack and the Glowstick, even if the staging does feel like part of another fine British theatrical tradition: the slightly clapped-out dystopia. A scrawled backdrop of urban blight and barbed wire is illuminated by spinning red police beacons and gigantic roaming searchlights seemingly half-inched from an internment camp. Once he takes the stage, Howlett is barely visible while manning his command centre of laptops and black boxes while a barbed CCTV pole stands sentry nearby. The overall effect is oppressive, like a set for Children of Men: The Musical. Staging aside, everything else is much livelier. The default volume level is air-raid siren, and there is a distinct lack of ballads. They kick off with the angular arcade-game squeals and clattering drums of Omen and neither the racket nor energy levels let up for almost two hours of tooth-rattling pandemonium. The core trio of Howlett, rapper Maxim and aggro jester Keith Flint are now men comfortably into their mid-40s yet they still look as if they could walk straight into a cyberpunk movie. Maxim sports a startling bandit mask seemingly applied using bright spray paint. Flint, his distinctive devil-horn hair still gelled in salute 21 years on from Firestarter, rocks a John McClane vest and hanging braces. Both prowl the stage rolling their shoulders with practised caged-panther menace. On the queasy funhouse blast of Nasty they energetically trade lines and goad each other with grins. While Prodigy records deliver reliably impressive frontloaded sales – if you include a 2005 greatest hits, they have notched up six UK No 1 albums in a row – they have always been live specialists. Older hits are tossed into the setlist like grenades. The toytown techno of Everybody in the Place ignites a rabid wave of raving; a relatively early outing for Firestarter shakes the Academy’s balcony. Newer songs are battered and bolted into more angular shapes to better fit the whole. On record, the title track from their 2015 album The Day Is My Enemy is a domino line of tribal drums with a keening Martina Topley-Bird vocal soaring on top. Live, it is now armour-plated with heavy rock riffs. Maxim leaps up on the drum riser. “This shit’s fucking easy,” he yells, with somehow charming braggadocio: “It’s what I do.” Is there any political message within the delirium, apart from the repeated underlining of one’s right to party? The Prodigy’s origin story will always be associated with the rave-inhibiting Criminal Justice Act and the aggression baked into their music has often felt like protest: hedonistic with a hint of malevolence. In full clattering flow on Get Your Fight On, they vibrate with such combustibility that it feels like two fingers to any kind of regulation. Even after more than 25 years, this is a band you would kettle at your own risk. Before a thrilling final salvo, there is an effort to squeeze in some new material. Need Some 1 slows the BPM but still shuffles with an impressive swagger. Howlett has announced that their seventh album will be released next year, but even if that turns out to be the case – and previously heralded Prodigy records have been entirely scrapped or scuttled – it feels as if perhaps the best way to sample it will be at a dance festival once the highlights have been fully grafted into their live repertoire. That is perhaps the fate of a road band, but it’s remarkable that the Prodigy can still generate and expertly channel this much energy. • At Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, 19 December.

During the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs, a magnificent suite of giant marsupials (mammals who carry their young in a pouch), reptiles and birds roamed Australia, only to meet their demise at the end of the Pleistocene. Why these behemoths disappeared has been, and continues to be, the subject of extensive discussions. Much of the debate revolves around the timings of megafaunal extinctions, the arrival and spread of modern humans in Australia, and the role of climate change. However, as reliable dates for many of the extinct species are lacking and the arrival of modern humans in Australia keeps getting pushed back in time, the debate remains far from being resolved. Therefore, some scientists argue that if we want to know what really happened, we need to step away from the dating game, and start looking more into biological and ecological variables that contributed to the megafaunal demise. If there is one animal that can be considered as the icon of Australia’s marvellous extinct megafauna, it must be Diprotodon. With a shoulder height of 1.7 meters, and weighing close to a whopping three tons, this behemoth was the largest marsupial ever to have lived. As such, these massive herbivores were likely to have been important players in the Australian ecosystem. The first species of fossil mammal described from Australia (by Richard Owen, he of the dinosaurs, in 1838), Diprotodon fossils have been found throughout the continent. Diprotodon was only one species of a superfamily of megamarsupials, the Diprotodontoidae who ruled Australia for nearly 24m years. All of them went extinct in the Pleistocene, but some argue that Diprotodon may have persisted until 25,000 years ago, well after humans arrived on the continent. Paleontologist Gilbert Price, based at the University of Queensland, decided to subject a Diprotodon incisor to a range of geochemical analyses to gain a better understanding of this species life habits. During an animal’s life, chemical elements from its diet are incorporated in its bones and teeth. Ever-growing incisors, such as those in Diprotodon, can therefore be considered an archive of the individual’s life. Teeth are particularly well suited for such analyses, as they are less likely to be chemically altered after death (in contrast to bones, which are more susceptible to chemical components washing in or out, thereby altering the original biochemical composition). One of the main techniques Price and his team used was stable isotope analyses. Isotopes are variants of the same chemical element but differ in the number of neutrons. Stable (non-radioactive) isotopes form after radioactive decay, and measuring the ratios of radioactive vs stable isotopes in biological tissue can reveal important biological information. For instance, the difference in 12C and 13C isotopes, expressed as δ13C, indicates the different carbon sources in the vegetation an organism fed on (different carbon pathways in so-called C3 and C4 plants result in different carbon signatures). Oxygen isotopes derive from water intake and reflect climatic changes (as the oxygen isotope ratio varies with the amount of rain). Strontium (Sr) is released from rocks during the weathering process, which then becomes incorporated in vegetation. By sampling the Diprotodon incisor every 2mm along the entire length of the tooth, Price and his team acquired a good overview of the changes in stable isotope ratios of carbon, oxygen and strontium throughout this individual’s lifetime, and thus a track record of its dietary habits and movements. The incisor itself was dated to around 300,000 years ago. The δ13C values along the incisor suggest that the animal fed on a mix of grasses, shrubs and herbs. This is consistent with interpretations from morphological and micro-wear data, and confirmed by fossil evidence for the presence of extensive tropical rainforest in eastern Australia during the Middle Pleistocene. What is most striking is that the strontium ratios fluctuate along the length of the tooth. Strontium reflects local geology: as different regions may have different local Sr isotope ratios, fluctuation of those ratios through an ever-growing tooth may reflect an organism eating its way through distinct geologic areas. The fluctuations in Sr ratios in Diprotodon thus reflect recurring movement of the animal through the landscape, and suggests that the individual traveled to the same geologic areas several times as the incisor grew. In living mammals this is called migration. The Sr ratios in the sample fall within those reported for the Darling Downs region in central eastern Australia, where the fossil specimen was found, and indicate that the animal likely traveled about 200km annually. Outside of the area, Sr rations are much higher and lower, respectively. Had Diprotodon migrated outside this area, the Sr ratios from the incisor would have been different, depending on which area it had munched on. No other marsupial, living or extinct, is known to migrate. Some species of kangaroos may wander nomadically, but modern marsupials were considered incapable of long-distance dispersal due to their generally smaller body size compared to their migrating placental cousins. However, the repetitive two-way migrations as reflected by the Sr signal in Diprotodon indicates that large-bodied marsupials did migrate. So why did Diprotodon migrate? The δ13C ratio in this Diprotodon sample matches that seen in others (DeSantis et al., 2017), and together, the variation in δ13C in Diprotodon is less than in their closest living modern relatives, the wombats. This suggests that Diprotodon had a relatively strict diet or that there was less variation in available food. Alternatively, migration may have been a way for Diprotodon to keep eating its favourite food. However, as the warm, tropical Middle Pleistocene drew to a close, increasing aridity and habitat change may have been too much for Diprotodon to handle. The evidence for annual migrations in Diprotodon is reminiscent of the annual large mammal migrations in Africa, and it leaves one to question if other extinct marsupials migrated as well. Price states that it would surprise him if there were no other ice age migrants in Australia. Potential migrants include other species of diprotodontoids such as marsupial “rhinos” and “tapirs”, as well as kangaroos. That leaves the question, when humans first arrived in Australia, did they stop and look in awe at the herds of behemoths moving at the horizon? References DeSantis, LRG., et al., 2017.

Some of the carriages from the train – which had been making its first-ever run along a new, faster route – fell on to the highway below, killing at least three people, injuring dozens and crushing two vehicles, authorities said. Federal investigators say the train was travelling at 80mph (129km/h) in a 30mph zone. Bella Dinh-Zarr, a National Transportation Safety Board member, said at a news conference on Monday night that the event data recorder in the rear locomotive provided information about the train’s speed. Dinh-Zarr said it was not yet known what caused the train to derail and that “it’s too early to tell” why it was going so fast. She said it was likely that federal investigators would be on the scene for a week or more. Eighty passengers and five on-duty crew were on board when the train derailed and 13 carriages fell off the tracks. As well as the three confirmed deaths, more than 70 people needed medical care, including 10 with serious injuries. Aleksander Kristiansen, a 24-year-old passenger from Copenhagen, said he had been in the bathroom when the crash occurred and he had been thrown to the ground. When he stood up, the train was shaking, he said. “I didn’t believe it happened when it happened,” he said. Kristiansen, who was in Seattle for an exchange programme, said his train car had stopped on a steep embankment, and that he had got out from the back of the car and helped others out. First responders spent hours searching the train cars, some of which were not safe to enter as they continued to dangle off the overpass. The new route, which was built to speed up local services, launched on Monday “after weeks of inspection and testing”, officials said. A track chart from the Washington state department of transportation shows the maximum speed drops from 79mph to 30mph for passenger trains just before the tracks curve to cross the Interstate 5 highway, which is where the train went off the tracks. The chart, dated 7 February 2017, was submitted to the Federal Railroad Administration in anticipation of the start of passenger services along the new bypass route, which shaves 10 minutes off the trip between Seattle and Portland. The Washington state governor, Jay Inslee, declared a state of emergency and visited the scene on Monday. He emphasised that the cause of the crash remained unknown. “There are four things we need to do: express compassion for these families, respect first responders, stay off [Interstate 5] and suspend judgment. No one knows what happened in this incident.” Amtrak’s co-chief executive, Richard Anderson, told reporters on Monday he would not speculate on the cause of the derailment and said safety was the company’s top priority. However, Anderson acknowledged that a working Positive Train Control (PTC) sysyem, which automatically slows trains if they are going too fast, had not been installed on that stretch of track. PTC also prevents train-on-train collisions and stops a train from passing through misaligned tracks. Last month the NTSB chairman, Robert Sumwalt, issued a scathing critique of Amtrak’s culture, saying a future breakdown was likely. Sumwalt said: “Amtrak’s safety culture is failing and is primed to fail again, until and unless Amtrak changes the way it practices safety management.” Congress had mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 after finding installation was more difficult than anticipated. “Every year we wait in implementing PTC to its full extent, more people are going to be killed,” Dinh-Zarr told CNN on Tuesday. In 2015, the NTSB calculated PTC would have prevented 145 train accidents, saved 300 lives and avoided 6,700 injuries had it been in place since 1969. Investigators have said speeding was to blame, at least in part, for a number of recent crashes, including one in 2015 in Philadelphia that killed eight people. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said on Tuesday that PTC was “needed now”. “Why was Amtrak train traveling at nearly TRIPLE the speed limit before fatal derailment?” Blumenthal asked in a Twitter post. “Positive Train Control might have prevented this disaster and saved lives.” Earlier this year the Trump administration proposed ending subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service, cutting $630m of the $1.4bn in annual government support for passenger rail service. Those cuts were rejected by Congress. “There is a money issue, because while Congress mandated the implementation of PTC on the railroads, they didn’t give any money for it, so it is self-funded,” said Allan Zarembski, an engineering expert at the University of Delaware. He added the caveat that US funding for Amtrak covers its capital programs. “For commuter agencies, it falls on the local governments to fund them,” he said. A few hours after the crash, Donald Trump cited it as a reason to support his infrastructure plan, tweeting: “The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!” Ten minutes later, he tweeted: “Thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/19/michael-gove-haunted-by-plastic-pollution-seen-in-blue-planet-ii","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T09:57:50Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove ‘haunted’ by plastic pollution seen in Blue Planet II","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/19/michael-gove-haunted-by-plastic-pollution-seen-in-blue-planet-ii","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/19/michael-gove-haunted-by-plastic-pollution-seen-in-blue-planet-ii","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove ‘haunted’ by plastic pollution seen in Blue Planet II","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cutting plastic pollution is the focus of a series of proposals being considered by the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, who has said he was “haunted” by images of the damage done to the world’s oceans shown in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II TV series. The government is due to announce a 25-year plan to improve the UK’s environmental record in the new year. Gove is understood to be planning to introduce refundable deposits on plastic drinks bottles, alongside other measures. The environment secretary is also understood to be considering a proposal to encourage retailers to use fewer types of plastic, as well as another to move councils towards a standardised recycling policy. The current patchwork of regimes means many types of plastic are not collected from households, depending on where in the country those households are. Together, the two measures will seek to ensure that a greater proportion of the packaging used in the UK can be recycled. Gove wants an improvement in the rate of recycling, which has reportedly been slipping recently. “The secretary of state wants to make recycling as easy as possible for households. That is why we will look to accelerate making local authority recycling schemes as consistent as possible through the resources and waste strategy,” a spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. The department indicated Gove was planning to overhaul the system of recycling targets to focus more on environmental impact than on the weight of material collected. And the drinks bottle deposit scheme would form part of an expected attack on single-use plastics, such as straws and coffee cups, which will seek to reduce the overall amount of plastic being used. The news came as a coalition of animal welfare and environmental charities warned that more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging would be thrown away and not recycled this Christmas. The charities, which include Friends of the Earth, the RSPCA, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trusts, estimated that the UK would use 300,000 tonnes of card packaging. Gove has told journalists he was moved by the scenes in Blue Planet II, which featured marine life struggling to cope with the amount of plastic litter pumped into the seas and oceans by humans. According to the Times, he is planning to shift the focus of recycling targets towards materials such as plastic and aluminium by moving away from the weight-based measurements favoured by the EU. Those have led to some councils showing more willingness to collect heavier – though not necessarily as environmentally damaging – materials, such as grass clippings. Gove reportedly hopes that, by shifting the focus on to environmental impact, he can convince councils to concentrate on collecting the other materials. Moreover, he plans to encourage councils to standardise what they do and do not collect from households, to end the regional disparities across the UK that are believed to be caused by differing contracts between local authorities and waste firms. The environmental campaign group Greenpeace welcomed the proposals, which are due to be formally set out next year. Its spokeswoman, Louise Edge, said: “It’s a good sign that Michael Gove is thinking about a multi-pronged approach which includes cutting disposable plastic at the source while also making it easier for people to collect and reuse it.” Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association, told BBC News the standardised recycling regulations would not work on their own. “What we need is packaging that is easily recyclable – this would not only make waste disposal easier for our residents, but save considerable amounts of money and energy, while protecting our environment,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/27/county-diary-artists-lines-made-walking-wenlock-edge-","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T05:30:09Z","webTitle":"County diary: lines made by walking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/27/county-diary-artists-lines-made-walking-wenlock-edge-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/27/county-diary-artists-lines-made-walking-wenlock-edge-","fields":{"headline":"County diary: lines made by walking","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A thin white track up the field marked where footsteps of schoolchildren, dog walkers and ramblers had compacted the snow and turned it to ice. When the thaw came only the narrow ice track remained: white, opalescent, slippery and dangerous to walk on. People took to the sides of the path, already claggy from before the snow, making the white line through dark earth even more pronounced. I was reminded of the work of the land artist Richard Long. A Line Made by Walking (1967), Long’s photograph of a simple line that he had walked through short grass, had been really inspiring for me – as enigmatic as a ley line, a ghost image, ephemeral and transient. It had an important influence on how I saw marks in the landscape as a kind of writing. The difference between an artist walking and anyone who walked up the field may have something to do with intention. Being conscious of the pedestrian act turns walking into a performance and is a reminder of how we leave a mark on Earth. Long says: “If you undertake a walk, you are echoing the whole history of mankind” – which may be a gentle reminder of our own responsibility for how devastating that history has been. Footpaths become byways and highways but, in essence, they are ways made through shared intention and passage, which coalesce into a line through the landscape. We share this behaviour with other animals: badgers, deer and rats follow lines centuries old. When I looked at other footprints in the snow I saw foxes and rabbits taking habitual routes across the field, very aware of each other’s. I wondered if birds had similar but invisible lines through the air and how these were linked to the Earth’s magnetic field. A party of jackdaws flew into trees above the sheep on their familiar daily beat; scouts will call the whole clattering down “way lines” through the air when they discover something more exciting. The winter solstice was a moment on our walk, a new ley line through the cosmological landscape, heading who knows where.

China’s top governmental bodies on Tuesday gave their approval to plans for a carbon trading system that will initially cover the country’s heavily polluting power generation plants, then expand to take in most of the economy. “This is a game-changer,” said Nathaniel Keohane, vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, a US-based environmental group. “This shows global leadership on the part of the Chinese government.” China has already set out a target of ensuring its still-growing emissions peak by 2030, a target experts say should be met. Which means the highest point will have been reached and emissions will begin to fall. However Keohane said the new emissions trading system could allow that peaking – essential if the world is to remain within the goals of the Paris agreement, to hold temperature rises to no more than 2 degrees C – to take place years earlier. “That is the key question – can China now peak sooner?” said Keohane. “This process should show us more data [on power plants] and more transparency.” Under the trading system, power plants will be issued with allowances to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. Plants that manage to undershoot their targets, by cleaning up and becoming more efficient, will be able to sell their excess permits to other generators, which will be expected to seek greater efficiency as an alternative to paying for their emissions. China’s power sector is responsible for about 3.3billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually, making this potentially one of the world’s most important mechanisms for reducing greenhouse gases. The move should put an effective national price on carbon emissions across the Chinese power generation sector. It has been many years in the planning, as the outlines of the system were set out in 2015, and that in turn built on years of trials of provincial emissions trading schemes. The concept has been under review by the Chinese government for more than a decade. Putting in place the full structures and regulations necessary for the operation of the system will take several months or possibly a year more. Tuesday’s launch gave the go-ahead for important developments, such as the setting-up of an exchange on which emissions permits can be traded, but the Chinese government stopped short of setting out the allocations of emissions allowances to the relevant power plants. The overall allocation of allowances in the system, across the power sector, is also not yet known, nor is the likely price on carbon that should result. These are likely to become clearer later in 2018. When fully operational, the system will be extended over several years to cover eight sectors in total: power; iron and steel; non-ferrous metals, such as aluminium; chemicals; petro-chemicals; paper; building materials; and civil aviation. The government has not yet released details of how the expansion of the system will work, but the power sector is seen as the first stage because it is the greatest source of emissions, and the easiest to measure and the easiest target for energy efficiency measures. When fully up and running, which could be as soon as 2019, the initial power sector stage of the scheme will already be more than one and a half times bigger than the EU’s emissions trading scheme, currently the world’s largest. Emissions trading as a concept was built into the Kyoto protocol of 1997. The idea is simple: in order to bring down greenhouse gases, a limit is set on the emissions of countries or companies, and within that limit they can choose whether to reduce their emissions, or pay others to do so. For instance, a rich country could choose to fund renewable energy projects in a developing nation, or a large company could buy emissions permits from cleaner rivals. In this way, a notional price on carbon should emerge that gives companies a guide to the environmental costs and benefits of reducing their burden on the planet. Overall, given the limit imposed under the system, the result should be a net reduction in carbon. The US has rejected several attempts to develop such a system as a way of reducing carbon emissions at a national level, though some states have proceeded with their own versions. Paula DiPerna, a special advisor to the Carbon Disclosure Project, who helped set up the Chinese pilot project, said: “The world should welcome the announcement of a national cap-and-trade in China, which will set new standards for global carbon pricing, address climate change head-on, and help integrate environmental finance with general financial best practices.” The emerging Chinese emissions trading system may give other governments a renewed interest in such measures. However, trading systems have been bedevilled with difficulty. The EU’s trading system, the biggest in the world before the Chinese government’s measures, suffered several collapses in the price of carbon even before the financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in a decade-long low in the cost of allowances under the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/19/yemeni-children-starve-britons-saudi-onslaught-government","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T13:21:20Z","webTitle":"As Yemeni children starve, Britons must speak out: ‘Not in our name’ | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/19/yemeni-children-starve-britons-saudi-onslaught-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/19/yemeni-children-starve-britons-saudi-onslaught-government","fields":{"headline":"As Yemeni children starve, Britons must speak out: ‘Not in our name’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is perhaps the world’s most expensive home: a French mansion featuring marble statues and “a 57-acre landscape park” worth more than $300m, snapped up by the heir to the Saudi throne.

Even Samantha Power – Barack Obama’s former ambassador to the UN – has admitted that the US is “wrong (as were we in last admin) to keep supporting Saudi-led coalition as it kills civilians w/ impunity &amp; blocks medicine/food/fuel supplies in face of looming famine.” It is a little late now to admit guilt, and Obama should be troubled by the horror he helped to unleash. But this confession certainly underlines what a catastrophe the western-backed Saudi war represents. Having written about the nightmare of Yemen, and visited a refugee camp across the water in Djibouti, it is deeply dispiriting how ignored it remains. Our continued silence gives carte blanche for our government to maintain its sordid support for the Saudis’ onslaught against civilians and human rights. The children will continue to silently starve, the civilians to silently perish under British-supplied bombs. It is surely time for us all to speak out about what is done in our name. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/19/ralf-little-video-accuses-jeremy-hunt-misleading-public-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T19:13:12Z","webTitle":"Ralf Little video accuses Jeremy Hunt of misleading public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/19/ralf-little-video-accuses-jeremy-hunt-misleading-public-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/19/ralf-little-video-accuses-jeremy-hunt-misleading-public-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Ralf Little video accuses Jeremy Hunt of misleading public","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The actor Ralf Little has escalated his row with Jeremy Hunt by starring in a video in which he accuses the health secretary of misleading the public about services for the mentally ill. The move comes after the pair became embroiled in a Twitter spat in which the Royle Family star disputed Hunt’s claims that the NHS had overseen “the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe” and “double dared” the cabinet member to sue him if he was wrong. Hunt hit back by calling on Little to find another major European country that had done better. “I double dare you,” he wrote. Now the actor has responded by teaming up with the Labour MP Luciana Berger and the Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb to accuse the health secretary of repeatedly using misleading figures. “Watch Jeremy Hunt spin the truth about mental health. He tells us that the Tories have employed thousands more mental health workers,” starts Little, before the video cuts to the health secretary talking in the Commons about “4,300 more people working in mental health trusts”. Berger cuts in with another “watch him spin” before clips of Hunt in front of a select committee and on the Andrew Marr show referencing the same numbers since 2010. The video then shows Hunt’s tweet responding to Little’s original attack, with Hunt claiming 4,300 more people have been employed by mental health trusts since 2010. But it goes on to cite Commons library figures which show the number of mental health workers in both NHS trusts and CCG’s in England has risen from 100,342 to 100,839 since 2010. “The actual increase of staff working in mental health since 2010 is under 500 – it is just 497,” adds Little. The Department of Health said Hunt’s reference was to the change in the number of staff working in mental health and learning disability trusts between July 2013 (not 2010) and July 2017. It said this number rose from 162,611 to 166,905 – an increase of 4,294. Officials said Little’s claim of 497 was about those working in “mental health by their occupation between September 2010 and August 2017” - and so was a different definition and covered a different time period. They argued that while both numbers were correct, they believed the comparison used by Hunt was more meaningful because it captured more people in frontline services. Berger told the Guardian that she helped produce the film to expose what was happening in mental health services. “We consistently hear big numbers from the secretary of state and yet there have been significant cuts in the sector since 2010. Ultimately we are no closer to achieving parity of esteem – real equality – for people suffering with their mental health.” Lamb was mental health minister under the coalition government from 2012-15, during the period that covers the contested figures. “You’d hear that and think there were 4,300 more people working in mental health since 2010 right? The reality is a fraction of what he is saying,” Lamb says in the film. He told the Guardian his experience in government was of a health system biased against the treatment of the mentally ill. Regular meetings with the health secretary at the time involved the “extraordinary micromanagement of data for every hospital” regarding physical health “and nothing in mental health”. He said he spent his time fighting with a shrinking workforce rather than being able to hail an expanding one, and that ministers needed to give an honest picture. “I agreed to take part in the video because I think it is terribly important we take very seriously the actual evidence of what is happening on the ground and avoid claims and counter-claims that often bear little resemblance to the reality,” Lamb said. “I just think we undermine people’s trust in politics and politicians if we say things that don’t sound accurate.” The DoH insisted Hunt had not misused figures and highlighted comments from Little expressing his regret at accusing the minister of having “knowingly lied”. “I was angry and a little bit over-confident. In hindsight, it was a regrettable choice of words,” he told LBC Radio. A spokeswoman for the health secretary said:‎ “It’s no surprise to see politicians and activists from other parties making politically motivated attacks on our ambitious expansion of mental health provision, but the facts as set out by ‎the independent chief executive of NHS England remain that the NHS is undergoing one of the world’s most ambitious efforts to expand mental health services for common mental health problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2017/dec/24/simone-lia-on-christmas-food-traditions","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia on Christmas food traditions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/dec/24/simone-lia-on-christmas-food-traditions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2017/dec/24/simone-lia-on-christmas-food-traditions","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia on Christmas food traditions","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/22/pick-up-bargain-with-guide-uk-winter-sales","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T13:31:22Z","webTitle":"Pick up a bargain with our guide to the UK winter sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/22/pick-up-bargain-with-guide-uk-winter-sales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/22/pick-up-bargain-with-guide-uk-winter-sales","fields":{"headline":"Pick up a bargain with our guide to the UK winter sales","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Many retailers have already begun their winter sales but some stores still save their best bargains until shoppers finish buying Christmas presents.

Barracoon is based on the three months Hurston spent in Plateau, Alabama, in 1931, interviewing Cudjo Lewis, who had been carried on the last recorded slave ship to the US. Lewis, who was then 90, spoke to Hurston about how he was captured and held by American slavers in a barracoon, an enclosure used for slaves, and then transported to the US with more than 100 other people on the Clotilde. HarperCollins, which will release the book in May, described the publication of Barracoon as a major literary event, saying that the book “brilliantly illuminates the horror and injustices of slavery”. “During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly, formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about his past,” said the publisher. “Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the pre-eminent American authors of the 20th century, Barracoon brilliantly illuminates the tragedy of slavery and one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.” According to the Encyclopaedia of Alabama, Cudjo Lewis was born Oluale Kossola in Benin in 1841. He was taken prisoner in 1860 and held in a barracoon for three weeks in Ouidah on the coast, before spending 45 days crossing the Atlantic. In the US, he was enslaved by ship captain James Meaher, until emancipation in 1865. He had wanted to return home, but could not afford it, so he and his fellow former slaves established African Town, north of Mobile, Alabama. He married a woman who had also been on the Clotilde, Abile, and they had six children, but all died young. Lewis died aged 94, and “although he had always wanted to go back home, he was buried among his family in the Africans’ cemetery that opened in 1876”, the encyclopaedia says. A snippet from Hurston’s unpublished book, recorded in Valerie Boyd’s biography of the African American author, Wrapped in Rainbows, says that “tears welled” in Lewis’s eyes as he spoke about the voyage on the Clotilde. Boyd wrote: “But what moved Hurston most about the old man – whom she always called by his African name, Kossola – was how much he continued to miss his people [in what was then] Nigeria. ‘I lonely for my folks,’ he told her. ‘After 75 years, he still had that tragic sense of loss. That yearning for blood and cultural ties. That sense of mutilation. It gave me something to feel about,’ Hurston wrote.” Hurston would go on to publish the novel for which she is best known, Their Eyes Were Watching God, in 1937. A leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, she died in poverty in 1960, and was buried in a grave that was unmarked until the young Alice Walker, who had been inspired by Hurston’s writing, tracked it down in 1973."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/03/readers-travel-photo-competition-january-win-trip-to-greenland","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T06:30:08Z","webTitle":"Readers' travel photography competition – January: win an amazing trip to Greenland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/03/readers-travel-photo-competition-january-win-trip-to-greenland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/03/readers-travel-photo-competition-january-win-trip-to-greenland","fields":{"headline":"Readers' travel photography competition – January: win an amazing trip to Greenland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cityscape or countryside, people, animals or plants … pick your best travel shot and enter it into our monthly competition.

Any idiot can get a degree. Who else has got a Nobel prize? This is a pretty small club, me and Barack Obama, and all he did was get voted for.” That’s what a lesser person would have thought. Malala, with three As at A-level and a place to read PPE at Oxford, chooses greatness every day of her life. A breakthrough in the treatment of Huntington’s disease You get so used to hearing “incurable” and “progressive” attached to this disease that it is almost a surprise to discover that people have carried on looking for a cure. If scientists were anything like the rest of us, they would have given up ages ago and concentrated on whose fault Huntington’s was. However, they are not, and this is good: it could be better than good. It could be a breakthrough in the treatment of all neurodegenerative disease. Thank God they are the way they are. The (very) bad guy lost in Alabama There is a video of two black women dancing their way from the polling station, having played their part in the downfall of the homophobic Republican senate candidate Roy Moore, a man with nostalgic views of the age of slavery who was forced to deny allegations of sexual misconduct during his campaign. The choreography is beautiful; if you arrived in Alabama from a different century, you would know what it meant to be enfranchised and alive in dangerous times riddled with predators. For part of one day, the UK got 70% of its energy from renewables They called it “stunning Sunday”, as the carbon intensity of producing power dropped below 100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour for the first time. Denmark and Norway occasionally produce more wind energy than they can use. In normal politics, we would be talking about creating a European supergrid and ending our reliance on fossil fuels. But this is something to keep us cheerful while we press for normality to resume. Moonlight took the best picture Oscar Every year, people call the Oscars “too white” and are told: “What? We’re doing our best, guys. It’s not our fault all the leads are white,” and the fact that perhaps the problem is that any non-white plot is considered “niche” and so not Oscar-material doesn’t come up. So the situation seems intractable, until one year, it ends. If the Oscar had gone to La La Land – as it nearly did, by mistake – the travesty would not have been that it was saccharine and tuneless, but instead that it wasn’t as good. That exit poll Initially, all the enjoyment in the Conservatives’ execrable performance came from the dissemblance – people who were cock-a-hoop pretending to be sad (George Osborne), people who looked punched in the face pretending to rejoice (Stephen Kinnock). The pleasure deepened as all of Theresa May’s pompous intonations of strength and stability fell away and her every electoral statement became a hubris meme. But it wasn’t until the next day that the meaning dawned: nobody here is stupid, after all. We don’t all agree. But most of us aren’t stupid. Trump’s inauguration being outnumbered by the Women’s March It wasn’t the pink knitted hats or the witty signs. It wasn’t the fact that women marched across the world, in global solidarity the likes of which we haven’t really talked about since the early 90s. It wasn’t even the sense thereafter of a movement growing from that one day. It was mainly how much it irritated the White House manbaby and how many lies with which he has undone himself since to make it not so. Glastonbury was … sunny Unless you are there, fine weather for Glastonbury is a bit disappointing – it ruins the spectacle. How often do you get to see 1350,000 people dissolve into mud, like a cross between an orgy, a Renaissance hellscape and the first world war? Almost never. And yet, and yet … there is something about the sight of people enjoying themselves without adversity that is uplifting. The government lost the vote over a final Brexit deal Disaster, chaos, hypocrisy, incredible lack of foresight, planning, diligence or seriousness, the petrifying dishonesty and palpable panic – parking all that for a second, in this unprecedented phase of parliamentary inadequacy, there is one bit of it that still works: the maths. It only takes a handful of people to be a bit courageous and the uncompromising rhetoric shrinks back down to hot air and bare assertion.

When a non-politician forcibly inserts themselves into the scripted daily action of Westminster or Washington, it tends to expose the chancers and hypocrites who populate our public life. Their fame may last fewer than 15 minutes, but their contribution can have a far more lasting effect on the politicians they target. Theresa May discovered as much during her disastrous general election campaign this year, when she faced an impromptu dressing-down from a voter during a rare public walkabout in Abingdon. Kathy Mohan, who has had mental health problems, chastised the prime minister over cuts to her disability benefits, leaving May struggling to get a word in. When the prime minister was permitted to speak, she didn’t have much to say. Sam Blackledge, the chief reporter for the Plymouth Herald, published the full transcript of an interview with May, describing it as “three minutes of nothing”. After May failed to give him a single substantial answer, Blackledge ruthlessly exposed the arrogance and emptiness of her “strong and steady” campaign. That arrogance turned to humiliation as the results rolled in on election night, when May’s mortification was compounded by the presence of Lord Buckethead, who had campaigned against her in her Maidenhead constituency and won 249 votes. In an interview with the Guardian, Buckethead suggested that “a slightly mouldy pain au chocolat” could negotiate Brexit more effectively. And it was Brexit that gave the hirsute career civil servant Sir Tim Barrow his moment in the sun when – as the UK’s new permanent representative to Brussels – he delivered the government’s formal notice of its intention to exit the EU, under article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, to the European council president, Donald Tusk, in a weathered leather satchel. In the US, the Trump administration had a year of political cameos that were equal parts preposterous and terrifying. In February, Richard DeAgazio, a member of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, raised security questions when he posted images on Facebook of himself posing at the Florida resort with the US army officer who carries the “nuclear football”. In July, the veteran astronaut Buzz Aldrin made the same faces many of us do when watching Trump speak – the difference being that Aldrin was standing next to Trump at the time. Trump’s closing remark may offer a clue to Aldrin’s befuddlement: “This is infinity here. It could be infinity. We don’t really don’t know. But it could be. It has to be something – but it could be infinity, right?” Meanwhile in Alabama, alleged (and denied) child molester and Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore came trailed by grotesques such as Janet Porter, the spokeswoman whose defence of her candidate, after allegations from several women, was to argue that there were many other women – several billion, in fact – who had not accused Moore of groping them when they were teenagers. In Australia, where same-sex marriage was legalised in 2017, MP Bob Katter went viral when he declared himself preoccupied with more pressing matters. “I mean, y’know, people are entitled to their sexual proclivities,” Katter smiled. “Let there be a thousand blossoms bloom, as far as I’m concerned.” Then his tone changed: “But I AIN’T spendin’ any time on it because, in the meantime, every three months a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland.” Alas, the ABC fact-checked Katter’s claim – the whole of Queensland averages one crocodile-related death a year. But it was Brenda from Bristol who summed up the year best, with her reaction when told by a BBC crew that May had called yet another general election. “There’s too much politics going on at the moment,” said Brenda, speaking on behalf of the nation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/women-unhappy-happier-men-blamed-culprits-good","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T13:30:33Z","webTitle":"To be happier, women should try giving up on being good | Tim Lott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/women-unhappy-happier-men-blamed-culprits-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/women-unhappy-happier-men-blamed-culprits-good","fields":{"headline":"To be happier, women should try giving up on being good","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A new NHS survey shows women to be unhappier than men for almost their entire lives – until their mid-80s, by when the men with whom they have often shared those lives have usually dropped dead. It is not an encouraging scenario. That women are unhappy until their partners die is not flattering for men. For the women, it is even worse – they are the miserable ones. Post-Weinstein, we fear that powerful men are toxic. Now it appears that everyday male partners are toxic, too. This must be put into context – men are three times more likely to kill themselves. But for everyday misery, women beat men every time. For anyone of a remotely feminist persuasion, this is unanswerable proof that men are a trial, a burden and selfish to boot. Men make you miserable. Women are unhappiest in the middle years, with 24% aged between 45 and 54 classifiable as mentally ill. Kate Lovett, dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, explains that at this point women “are still more likely to bear the brunt of domestic and caring responsibilities”. The misery levels tail off as old age kicks in and the burdens of children and looking after ageing parents lessen. All women have to make them miserable then is their husbands. Further analysis of the figures supports the case that men are the problem. Above the age of 65, more men than women have mental health problems – 19% against 14% – because men who are single, widowed or divorced are more likely to develop depression. In contrast, married women are the most likely to be miserable. One of the comments following a newspaper article in which this survey is reported talks about a grandmother who hated her husband so much that when he went to the loo, she would get up and punch the chair, pretending it was him. As a man, I feel compelled to offer an alternative explanation for wives’ unhappiness. Psychometric analyses show women, cross-culturally, registering higher levels in four of the “big five” personality matrices: agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and extraversion (the other is openness). Most of these differences are relatively small, if consistent, but the “neurotic” matrix – and this a misleading word, as it does not mean “hysterical” or “hypersensitive”, but something more like “easily hurt” – has the biggest variation by far. Women tend to be higher in negative emotion and more responsive to grief, threat, punishment and isolation, whether they are Swedish, Spanish or Saudi. The phenomenon crosses all cultures, suggesting, heretically, that it is inborn. And conscientiousness, while useful, can lead to unhealthy perfectionism: if you expect things to be perfect you will be disappointed. If you discount psychometrics – some brand it junk science – there are other reasons why women in middle age are likely to be unhappy. The menopause isn’t much fun. And perhaps the fading of physical charm that both genders experience may be taken harder by women, as it is usually so much more powerful for them in the first place. I am not making excuses for men. Well, I am. Perhaps our ability to wriggle off the hook is the other reason why we find more reasons to be cheerful. Maybe women are unhappier than men because they pin themselves to higher moral standards. I think I would rather be happy than good. Women should try it. They might be amazed at how much their partners appreciate it, because it will reduce their burden of male guilt. And, at the same time, it will cheer up the women themselves. Given all the chairs wives will no longer have to punch, there will be a considerable saving on upholstery. timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2017/dec/20/former-yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-leaves-powerful-legacy-milosevic-karadzic-mladic","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T12:01:37Z","webTitle":"Yugoslavia tribunal closes, leaving a powerful legacy of war crimes justice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/20/former-yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-leaves-powerful-legacy-milosevic-karadzic-mladic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/dec/20/former-yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-leaves-powerful-legacy-milosevic-karadzic-mladic","fields":{"headline":"Yugoslavia tribunal closes, leaving a powerful legacy of war crimes justice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After sitting for 10,800 days, hearing 4,650 witnesses and digesting 2.5m pages of transcripts, the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) will be formally dissolved on Thursday. A closing ceremony in The Hague, attended by the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, will mark the end of 24 years of investigations and prosecutions that delivered 161 high-profile indictments. The war crimes tribunal put the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić and Gen Ratko Mladic in the dock. Established in 1993, it was the first tribunal of its kind since hearings in Nuremberg and Tokyo at the end of the second world war. Ninety individuals have been sentenced for genocide, crimes against humanity or other crimes. Politicians and senior military officers, judgment after judgment confirmed, will no longer escape with impunity but be held responsible for their actions, even in wartime. Ultimate success in hunting down fugitives, however, has taken decades and there has been criticism that the tribunal represented victor’s justice: about two-thirds of those charged were Serbs. Supporters of the court countered that the worst atrocities of the conflict were inflicted by Serb forces on Bosnian civilians. Closure of the ICTY highlights a shift in international justice away from discrete tribunals – imposing justice after successive conflicts in the Balkans, Rwanda or Sierra Leone – towards the more ambitious goal of universal jurisdiction under the international criminal court (ICC). The ICTY’s legacy has been pivotal, Philippe Sands QC, professor of international law at University College London, believes, paving the way for a broader international consensus on war crimes justice. “The breakup of Yugoslavia has been a catalyst with very significant consequences,” he said. “The experience has been mixed. It hasn’t brought tranquility and reconciliation to the region but it has delivered ... important judgments on individuals.” Sands, who acted for Croatia against Serbia in proceedings at the international court of justice, added: “The overall record of the ICTY reflects the significant but limited function that international justice can play in resolving longstanding political differences. It’s one tool in an armoury. The ad hoc tribunals have had an easier run than their global counterpart, [the ICC].” Among the ICTY’s achievements was the accumulation of legal expertise and testimony, producing an archive of evidence that will serve future historians well. Prosecutors pioneered the legal concept of “joint criminal enterprise”, a doctrine relied on to tie defendants to a common plan for genocide or crimes against humanity. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who worked at the ICTY between 1998 and 2006 and led the prosecution of Slobodan Milošević, recognises its success but has reservations. “My overall view of the ICTY is much affected by the corruption of history around what happened at Srebrenica [where 8,000 Bosnian men and youths were massacred],” he explained. “Treachery by the US, UK and France, it appears, may have allowed a humanitarian nightmare to develop while Dutch peacekeepers were not told that they had been abandoned. If so, these powerful states must have revealed to Milošević that if the Bosnian Serbs took Srebrenica there would be no air strikes. “At the ICTY, it seemed, non-combatant ‘western’ states, plus the ‘losing’ state of Serbia, were able, on occasions, to interfere with the rule of law – often by withholding evidence – to ‘clean up’ the true historical record, favourably to Serbia and to the west,” said Nice, whose most recent book, Justice for All and How to Achieve It, assesses the records of war tribunals. “We, the trial lawyers, so far as I know, were all doing our imperfect best to keep our cases ‘clean’ and to resist improper interference where we detected it.” Trials went on for far too long, he also accepts, keeping victims waiting for decades before they found out what had happened.” “On the positive side,” Nice added, “all reasonably educated citizens of the world now expect criminal behaviour in war to be subject to international legal accountability. That’s a huge shift in thinking. “And secondly, the ICTY collected a vast quantity of evidence that would not have surfaced for a very long time – or ever. It will be still be there in 500 years’ time.” The courtroom suicide of the Croatian commander Slobodan Praljak, who swallowed potassium cyanide after the court rejected his appeal, ensured the ICTY’s final judgment attracted international attention. There are a few legal loose ends. Outstanding appeals against conviction will be heard by the UN’s residual mechanism for criminal tribunals (MICT). Other war crimes cases have been remitted to national courts in the region. The outgoing chief prosecutor of the ICTY, Serge Brammertz, conceded last month that the tribunal had not achieved reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. “As we have seen … the crimes have left wounds that still have not healed. Convicted war criminals continue to be seen by many as heroes, while victims and survivors are ignored and dismissed.” Ultimately, he said, the ICTY’s legacy would not be measured “by our own work, but by whether the countries of the former Yugoslavia build the rule of law … The truth of what happened has been proved in a public court of law.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/19/rochdale-borough-council-ditch-plans-ban-swearing-greater-manchester","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T13:19:46Z","webTitle":"Thank f%£! for that: council to ditch plans for Rochdale swearing ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/19/rochdale-borough-council-ditch-plans-ban-swearing-greater-manchester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/19/rochdale-borough-council-ditch-plans-ban-swearing-greater-manchester","fields":{"headline":"Thank f%£! for that: council to ditch plans for Rochdale swearing ban","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A council looks likely to abandon plans to ban swearing in a town centre after police warned it was unenforceable. Rochdale borough council in Greater Manchester had proposed a £100 fine for anyone caught swearing in public via the introduction of a public spaces protection order. Earlier this year, the local authority began a consultation on a PSPO for Rochdale town centre, largely designed to cut down on begging and other antisocial behaviour. It included a clause under which a person caught “using foul and abusive language” would be warned, moved on or given an on-the-spot fine. Greater Manchester police said it supported the PSPO, but advised the council to drop the swearing ban “given the issues with enforcement”, according to a report circulated to councillors this week. GMP argued that “there is already legislation in place to deal with people/persons using foul and abusive language in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress”. Councillors will vote on Tuesday evening on whether to take the force’s advice at a full cabinet meeting. They are being asked to vote in an amended PSPO, which drops the swearing prohibition, as well as a proposal to ban under-18s from the town centre between 11pm and 6am. The amended PSPO outlaws begging, loitering, antisocial parking, playing loud music, loudly revving car engines, street drinking, unauthorised charity collections, skateboarding, cycling and scooting within a designated area. An individual caught doing any of these could receive a fine of up to £1,000, or £500 for street drinking. Most locals and town centre businesses that responded to the consultation supported it, according to the report. These included Halifax building society, a jeweller on the high street, Boots, Marks &amp; Spencer, TK Maxx and British Transport Police. The council received 10 comments against the proposal from the Labour Campaign for Human Rights, the human rights organisation Liberty and various members of the public. According to the council report, those opposed criticised the council for not helping the most vulnerable people and argued that the PSPO breaches the European convention on human rights. “The council does acknowledge this is a sensitive issue which needs careful handling. However, evidence held by GMP and the council suggests that the majority of people currently involved in begging in the town centre are not homeless and all are being offered support,” the report said. When the ban was first floated in March, Liberty said the plans would be difficult to enforce and could criminalise vulnerable people. In response, the then council leader Richard Farnell said: “With all the horrific human rights abuses happening around the world right now, I would have thought Liberty had bigger things to worry about. “We are clamping down on a small minority of antisocial ne’er-do-wells who drunkenly shout and swear and harangue shoppers in our town centre.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/christmas-tv-specials-bring-some-much-needed-glad-tidings","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Christmas TV specials bring some much-needed glad tidings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/christmas-tv-specials-bring-some-much-needed-glad-tidings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/25/christmas-tv-specials-bring-some-much-needed-glad-tidings","fields":{"headline":"Christmas TV specials bring some much-needed glad tidings","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The headlines have not provided much in the way of comfort and joy in 2017, but this year’s festive TV shows were determined to compensate for the bleakness. The heartwarming tone was set on Christmas Eve by Mary, Mel and Sue’s Big Christmas Thank You (BBC One). The Bake Off escapees took their three-way teasing to the Rhondda Valley, where they served up a tinsel-laced version of DIY SOS to the village of Pentre, which has lost its banks, library, school and many of its shops. The trio threw a Christmas party for residents and spruced up the volunteer-run community centre. It was an irresistible tale of people power that delivered a tough message about the effects of austerity and the importance of togetherness – despite its cheerful tone, it packed a mighty punch. The showier dramatic centrepieces, such as Maigret in Montmartre (ITV) and Victoria (ITV), were exercises in surprisingly icy and occasionally dreary good taste – and, with both hovering around the two-hour mark, they were ideal for a nap for when it all got too much. But nevertheless the community spirit rolled over into Christmas Day. Paul O’Grady: For the Love of Dogs at Christmas (ITV) took the host to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, where he was so smitten with one stray pooch, Bauble, that he ended up taking her home. Call the Midwife (BBC One) dug its way out of the 1962 big freeze to reflect, again, on how communities break down and what it is that saves them. This continues to be one of the most slyly watchable shows on television, gliding through with grit and grace. There was something about rodents this Christmas, with both David Walliams’ Ratburger (Sky One) and the gorgeous Julia Donaldson story The Highway Rat (BBC One) making the animals the star of the show. The latter was an old-fashioned and elegant morality tale about not taking more than your fair share, ending on a sweetly redemptive note. Even The Great Christmas Bake Off (Channel 4) couldn’t really get on board with its own competitiveness. The former contestants Val, Selasi, Beca and Paul – he of bread lion fame – put on a half-hearted show of rivalry as they made yule logs, mince pies and sugar-based snow globes. One of the nicest things about Bake Off is its lack of cutthroat instinct and nobody seemed to much care who won, instead concentrating on making sure everyone got through it. It was particularly delightful to see the return of the brilliant, cheerleading Val. “It’s a rough old log, a bit like me,” she said, making me wonder if they could offer her a role in next year’s tent, where she could pop in to make tea, calm everyone down and dance. French and Saunders signed off their semi-comeback with a joyous compilation of dance moves and pratfalls. It’s been more than a decade since they last had a festive special, and the celebratory 300 Years of French and Saunders (BBC One) opted to take a “ghost of Christmas past” approach, packing in plenty of archive clips while weaving in a handful of new skits with care. The fresh sketches were sharp and silly: their natural burial service was fantastically daft, the Poldark extras were deliciously awful and it was a thrill to see the white room back in use for their Handmaid’s Tale send-up. It was, in short, a welcome return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/19/liz-brown-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T18:13:18Z","webTitle":"Liz Brown obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/19/liz-brown-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/19/liz-brown-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Liz Brown obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend and colleague Liz Brown, who has died of cancer aged 66, had a long and successful career as a social worker and child protection co-ordinator. She was passionately committed to supporting vulnerable families and an approach that was all about “working with” rather than “doing to”. Liz was born and raised in Bristol, the daughter of Ron Allen, a civil servant, and his wife, Barbara (nee Skuse). After attending the Red Maids’ high school in the city, she studied history and then social work at Exeter University from 1969. She became a social worker, first in Devon, then Bristol, and finally in Gloucestershire, where she was a child protection co-ordinator from 1992 to 2000. I and my colleague Mary Ryan first met Liz in 1997 when we worked with her on a project analysing patterns of need among families in contact with children’s social care in Gloucestershire. This led to our setting up the independent consultancy that we ran together for 15 years. We collaborated on many projects – audits of need, service development, evaluations. Throughout, Liz had a clear vision about the importance of analysis in assessment work, and of clarity and simplicity when making plans for children and families. Her desire to change practice in relation to assessment and planning for children involved her in training social workers, managers and others. She was a brilliant trainer and was interested in everyone she met. Her empathy and passion combined to make her sessions lively opportunities for people to find useful ways of revitalising their practice. She was clear that any restructuring of social work practice required changes in the understanding and attitude of middle and senior managers – not always a popular message in local authorities, but she was prepared to hold her ground, often winning round sceptical managers. Liz worked all over England and Wales and was embarking on a number of projects with Welsh authorities at the time of her diagnosis. Liz married Simon Brown, an architect, in 1980, and they raised two children, Hannah and Will, in the Forest of Dean and Monmouth. She had many friends, was politically engaged, loved reading and the theatre and was an amazing gardener, most recently at the converted barn near Abergavenny, south-east Wales, that the family moved into just before she became ill. She is survived by Simon, Hannah and Will, her mother, her brother, Tim, and her grandchildren, Ella, Max and Lyla."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/resolution-2018-trace-family-white-father-blackness-exist-origins","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T06:44:05Z","webTitle":"My resolution for 2018 is to trace the family who don’t yet know I exist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/resolution-2018-trace-family-white-father-blackness-exist-origins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/resolution-2018-trace-family-white-father-blackness-exist-origins","fields":{"headline":"My resolution for 2018 is to trace the family who don’t yet know I exist","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When it comes to setting new year’s resolutions, I am not that bothered about losing weight, exercising more, or becoming more productive (although it would be good to finally get a grip on all those things). Instead, I have decided to make 2018 the year in which I make a serious, wholehearted attempt to trace a family who don’t yet know I exist, and to find out once and for all, in as much detail as I can, the origins of my blackness. No one realises the difficult nature of this task more than me. As I have previously written, I was raised by two white parents who always assured me that I was related to them both, which led me to identify as white until I was about 15. The nadir of my life came almost two years ago, when my dad died and a subsequent DNA test confirmed my deepest fears, which had wrapped themselves around my life like the tendrils of a poisonous plant. I was not related to my fantastic father; my mother had been unfaithful with a man she knows little about. It had never been spoken about. Although my parents’ choice cushioned me from the more dispiriting realities of being a person of colour (the idea of not belonging in certain spaces, or of being held back by my race never occurred to me while I was at school and university), it also left me underprepared for the harshness of a world beyond my school and family, which often judges by skin colour. The burden of the lie often felt too heavy to bear by myself when I was growing up and I tried hard to overcompensate for sticking out so much; I was temperamental and defensive – but always determined to do well at everything I set my mind to. When I processed the DNA results last year, I finally examined the many ways in which my identity had been constructed for me over the years. And, for the first time, I became more conscious of how I was perceived, the way I had been raised, and of a wider racial narrative of which I was part. This is something I am still learning about from the many others who have contacted me with similar stories of racial displacement and identity confusion. For me, the feelings of shame, awkwardness and guilt in discussing my race have diluted the conviction that might have helped to guide me towards uncovering the truth when my dad was still alive. But since processing the DNA results, these feeling have bubbled to the surface once more, strangling the voice inside me that knows how important it is to find out my racial origins. I have been anxious about fracturing the relationship with my mum, who is reluctant to discuss the details about my conception, unless gently pressed by me and my younger brother. I have agonised over upsetting my dad’s family and friends who, despite reassuring me that I will always be accepted by them as my dad’s daughter, must nonetheless be perturbed by all this. But, most of all, I have been thinking long and hard about destroying the legacy my dad created for me, by simply loving me hard, as his only daughter. Had he always known we weren’t related by blood? What would he think of me attempting to track down a “father” who won’t ever be a family member except on a biological basis? It tears me in two to think of my actions upsetting him. The concept of having a living, breathing set of brown relatives out there is too weird to truly fathom. And the idea of taking a DNA test to allegedly find out the country to which I can attribute my black blood scares me senseless. I have thought about having to create a new narrative for myself with this knowledge and how it will influence the identities of my future children. Perhaps I will feel obliged to learn about a new culture or set of customs. Perhaps I won’t want to do anything at all. This has been a family secret for more than 20 years, but this year I am going to uncover everything that I can. Because if you don’t know where you are from, how can you know where you are going? @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/19/may-putin-brexit-russian-leader-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T18:13:59Z","webTitle":"May can berate Putin.

But Brexit is his dream policy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With lighter diplomatic baggage, Boris Johnson might have been a hit in Moscow. The foreign secretary’s artfully dishevelled, pseudo-Churchillian kitsch is not to everyone’s taste, but it could work in the bombastic idiom of Russian politics. But as Theresa May’s emissary to the court of Vladimir Putin later this week, Johnson faces a tough audience. May has accused the Kremlin of aggressively targeting an international order based on law, open economies and free societies. In a speech last month, the prime minister listed offences including territorial theft from Ukraine, cyber-attacks on ministries and parliaments, meddling in elections, and spreading fake news to sow discord. Russian interference in British democracy is currently being investigated by the Electoral Commission and parliament’s culture, media and sports committee. The latter’s chair, Tory MP Damian Collins, has signalled that he doesn’t believe recent claims by Twitter and Facebook that Kremlin-funded efforts to boost Brexit in 2016 were negligible. He is right to be sceptical. The tech companies have a record of stonewalling any suggestion that their business model has been co-opted for organised malfeasance. They have commercial incentives to duck moral responsibility for the sinister content shared on their networks. It is beyond doubt that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had a hefty Russian boost. Facebook has removed tens of thousands of pages believed to be involved in sabotage of French and German elections. British ballots are unlikely to have escaped dirty money and molestation by troll battalions. That doesn’t mean Brexit is a conspiracy that blew in on the east wind. Mistrust of the EU was not made in a factory outside St Petersburg. To connect tweets in Murmansk to a leave majority in Merthyr Tydfil misses the point about misinformation. The goal is not always to execute a specific outcome but to stoke existing tensions, nurture rage, exacerbate polarisation and shroud everything in such a fog of lies that truth becomes ungraspable. The purpose of fake news is to debase the currency of all news, and so undermine the foundations of pluralistic politics. The advantage to Russia is in weakening western governments and their alliances. Putin despises Nato and EU influence in countries that were, until 1991, Soviet territory. He sees their sovereignty as fictions imposed by enemies. Undermining European and US resolve to uphold their borders is his goal. There is a strain of Brexitism that is complicit in that project, regardless of whether leave campaigns knowingly or unwittingly took laundered roubles. Nigel Farage’s admiration for Putin is no secret: he has pushed the Kremlin line on Ukraine, preposterously depicting Crimea’s annexation as a defensive answer to EU provocation. He has described Russian military support for Syria’s murderous president Bashar al-Assad as a “brilliant” manoeuvre. Putinophilia has the same cause as Farage’s Trump fandom. It is the nationalist’s fetish for a strongman, combined with nostalgia for the days when the world was run as a game between big countries using little countries as chips. It is unresolved grief at the UK’s 20th-century relegation from the ranks of imperial pawn-pushers. That slow-burn trauma is analogous to the more sudden loss of status mourned by Russia, the reversal of which is Putin’s mission in life. During the cold war, British ideologues who swallowed a Kremlin agenda and regurgitated it as their own used to be called “useful idiots”. The difference now is they aren’t confined to the far left. Some of them are in government. The Brexit delusion is that enslavement by Brussels inhibits our promotion back to the global power premier league. Boris Johnson is not immune to this fantasy. He would rather be a foreign secretary in the 19th-century style of Lord Castlereagh, carving out spheres of influence at the Congress of Vienna, than yawn through EU council meetings. It is true that the EU empowers smaller countries. Witness the clout that Ireland has had in Brexit talks. But Britain has also benefited from aggregating its medium-sized might with Germany, France and 25 other nations. That is not a Brussels empire. It is a model of peaceful, collaborative power without historical equal. May once understood this. In the referendum campaign she made a solid case for EU membership on the grounds that it could “maximise Britain’s security, prosperity and influence in the world”. When she now promises a “deep and special partnership”, she is not just talking about trade, she is pledging loyalty to European democracy as one of its few significant military underwriters. When the prime minister berates Putin for undermining institutions that uphold the rule of law, she is signalling strategic solidarity, not economic alignment, with the EU. This is chasing a bolting horse when the stable door hangs off its hinges. We may never know how much influence the Kremlin had in the referendum, but we can be sure its result was popular there. Brexit has already fractured an alliance that will be hard to repair. May will never be a friend of Putin, but he doesn’t need her friendship when she is committed to a policy he would choose for her anyway. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/19/charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-inspired-by-visits-to-cornwall","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T20:05:57Z","webTitle":"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol inspired by visits to Cornwall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/19/charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-inspired-by-visits-to-cornwall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/19/charles-dickens-a-christmas-carol-inspired-by-visits-to-cornwall","fields":{"headline":"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol inspired by visits to Cornwall","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jacob Marley, one of the best-known characters in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, was by all accounts a selfish and greedy man who died with only one friend in the world, his business partner Ebenezer Scrooge. Now a historian has claimed the character, who comes back as a ghost to visit Scrooge and teach him the error of his ways, was actually inspired by a real man whom Dickens had met and had promised to make him a household name. In the fable, which has spawned hundreds of film and stage versions, the central character Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Marley, who is haunted by the way he lived his life. Cornish historian Barry West began researching the inspiration for the character after hearing rumours that there was a connection between Cornwall, Dickens and A Christmas Carol. He discovered a London physician Dr Miles Marley, who died in Port Isaac on 15 November 1854 and who Dickens is thought to have met in London prior to writing A Christmas Carol. West also believes that the novelist’s visits to Cornwall provided further inspiration for some of the scenes in the book. West has spent years carrying out meticulous research to prove the connection between A Christmas Carol and his home county, which Dickens was known to have visited a number of times. West said: “There’s definitely an old forgotten story about Dickens and [Miles] Marley and Cornwall, but I wanted to find out the real facts.” He found out where the real man was buried and discovered he had been a physician in London. After contacting the Dickens Society and a Dickens expert to enquire about the origins of the name Marley in the novel, he received what he believes is confirmation that the two had met. He said: “I was sent a newspaper clipping from the Dickens expert, which said that on St Patrick’s Day, at 11 Cork Street, Westminster, London, a Dr Miles Marley had invited guests over to celebrate – one of those guests was Charles Dickens. “The clipping said that Dickens had started a discussion over unusual names and it was agreed that Marley was indeed an unusual name. It was said that Dickens told Marley, ‘by the end of the year your name will be a household word’.” That same doctor then moved to Cornwall and died shortly afterwards. West added: “I have no doubt that this is the same Dr Miles Marley that Charles Dickens dined with in London and the same Marley that the writer got the name for his character Jacob Marley.” Diana Archibald, secretary-treasurer for the Dickens Society, told the Guardian: “Dickens often used names of people he met or heard about, so it is very much possible that the Marley connection is true. She added: “It is always interesting to see these details come to light.” West also believes some of the places which are vividly described in the book paint the picture of Cornwall’s rough and wild landscape perfectly. When the second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, visits Scrooge, he takes him to a market where cheerful people are buying ingredients for Christmas dinner and “exchanging a facetious snowball”. Afterwards, Scrooge is taken to see how miners, sailors, and lighthouse keepers still have the festive spirit despite living in harsh conditions. West said: “We know that Charles Dickens came to Cornwall a few times. He went to Land’s End, Rock and Tintagel, he wrote letters about it that are now in The Dickensian [journal], he wanted to go to the most remote parts of Cornwall. “If you read A Christmas Carol, some of the passages and descriptions he writes – it’s undoubtedly based on the time he spent in Cornwall.” He also believes that the novel goes into detail about the county’s rugged coastline, raging sea and even possibly one of Cornwall’s most famous lighthouses. He said: “There has been a lot of speculation on what lighthouse Dickens speaks about in the novel. “Many people thought that the lighthouse could be Trevose Head, but because we know where Dickens went when he visited Cornwall, the distance out to sea the lighthouse was and the year the story was written, in my mind, there is no doubt that it was the original Longships Lighthouse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/27/fashions-unlikely-looks-of-2017-triple-shirting-corbyn-tees-and-a-150-paperclip","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Fashion’s unlikely looks of 2017 – triple-shirting, Corbyn tees and a $150 paperclip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/27/fashions-unlikely-looks-of-2017-triple-shirting-corbyn-tees-and-a-150-paperclip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/27/fashions-unlikely-looks-of-2017-triple-shirting-corbyn-tees-and-a-150-paperclip","fields":{"headline":"Fashion’s unlikely looks of 2017 – triple-shirting, Corbyn tees and a $150 paperclip","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The bath towel v the bathrobe It was a terrible year for famous men and bathrobes, but a great year for women and towels. Bathwear – or bath-leisure as one magazine called it – became a gendered battleground. With Rihanna in an Emilio Pucci head-towel on Paris Vogue’s cover and Rita Ora in Palomo Spain bathwear at the MTV Europe Music awards, women and towels tipped it away from the alleged bathrobed misdeeds of Harvey Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman and others. A Doncaster fencing company When the Heras T-shirt, designed and sold by London bootleg streetwear company Sports Banger, appeared online, it took a fair amount of Googling to reveal that it was the logo of a Doncaster-based company that makes the temporary fences seen at festivals. Sports Banger’s Jon Wright designed it because he was feeling nostalgic for his youth. Ugly, expensive trainers It is testament to the creativity of fashion that, in 2017, few could resist the expensive, ugly trainer. The best – and ugliest – were the Balenciaga Triple S trainers. Their appeal proved that fashion likes irony; by wearing them, you got the joke. Plus, in a sickly economy, there’s a certain visual diplomacy that comes with wearing a pair of £595 trainers that look cheap and crap. Theresa May’s necklace Our PM took her look in a new direction, with the almost permanent appearance of her “strong and stable necklace”. Essentially a massive silver chain designed to offset a boring outfit, it appeared whenever she was due to discuss the EU, quickly becoming as stale as the catchphrase. Ivanka Trump’s mismatched earrings Ivanka’s attempt to reclaim feminism hit a low point when she wore mismatched Marni earrings to a state dinner. This could have been stellar optics, were the fashion industry her target rather than the world. The result was simply to prove that she had read Vogue closely enough to heed its advice on how to wear earrings, but not closely enough to read its unanimously negative coverage of her father’s politics. Corbyn T-shirts If Jeremy Corbyn’s silver shell suit caused hysteria in 2016, there was little hope that the fashions of 2017 could resist him. And so it proved as he ended up as the face of the British bootleg industry, appearing on all sorts of DIY T-shirts. The best was probably the Corbyn Nike one (now in the V&amp;A), a mashup that replaced the “Just do it” slogan with the Labour leader’s name. And also worked as a pun on “Corbynite/Nike”. Sort of. Not. A £145 paperclip Prada usually takes a backseat when it comes to self-referential irony. This year, its £145 paperclip changed all that. It was a money-clip that looked like a paperclip. Pointless, weird and geared towards the 1%, it was also symptomatic of fashion finding joy, and profit, in the mundane. As we career towards a cashless economy, a money clip will become positively nostalgic. Spiked Manolos Melania Trump’s wardrobe for the inauguration provided rich pickings for critics. But few pieces raised eyebrows like the Manolo Blahniks she wore to board the plane for Texas following Hurricane Harvey. The look came to symbolise the disconnect between the first lady and the rest of the world. By the time the plane landed, she was in trainers, but by then it was too late. Steve Bannon’s triple-shirting Breitbart may have its own fashion critic, but it was Bannon’s millefeuille of shirts (usually three, according to his spokesperson) that taught us most about far-right style. Theories abounded over the former White House strategist’s look: were they the layers of his nationalist ideology, his winter beach house look, or a cry for help? In the end, it turned out, no one cared. Brand Bernie The year’s biggest curveball came in the form of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign logo, which appeared on Balenciaga’s scarves and padded coats. The Vermont senator wasn’t keen, describing the collection as looking “very ‘wealthiest one-10th of the 1% to me’,” but no matter. Sanders keeping you warm in the impending nuclear winter is an enticing prospect. The Love Island water bottle In the fight against plastic pollution, it is satisfying to think that newly minted ecowarrior Michael Gove will cite Love Island as his ecospiration. Thanks to the show, luxe water bottles (chiefly, S’well bottles – affordable and slick) have gone from stealth symbols of wellness to environmental must-haves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/shamed-review-revenge-dish-best-served-other-dramas-repair-shop-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Shamed review – revenge is a dish best served by other dramas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/shamed-review-revenge-dish-best-served-other-dramas-repair-shop-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/shamed-review-revenge-dish-best-served-other-dramas-repair-shop-christmas","fields":{"headline":"Shamed review – revenge is a dish best served by other dramas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shamed (Channel 4) is your last moment of non-Christmassy telly, the final bulwark against the tide of yuletide offerings already streaming in, flooding the schedules without surcease from tomorrow until the end of the year. Since it is the season of goodwill, and since Shamed’s success as a viewing experience depends on the gradual revelation of the drama’s driving force, let me set out my customarily brief warning in full: THIS IS A REVIEW. IT CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS FROM WHICH THERE IS NO COMING BACK. DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THIS PROGRAMME. GO ABOUT YOUR DAY AS IF THIS ENTIRE PAGE DOES NOT EXIST. THANK YOU. OK. So, Shamed’s opening scenes are impossible to resist. One moment twentysomething Nathan Bowyar (Nick Blood) is a happy, selfie-taking, fiancee-adoring, wedding-planning bloke heading out for his stag do; the next he wakes up locked in a basement with another twentysomething man, Mani Yalla (Ryan McKen). They do not, they feel, know each other. It is eventually revealed to us, and them, that they are acquainted. Ten years ago, Nathan was a holiday rep who – what is the word? Cajoled, coerced, suborned, something else? – an insensibly drunk 17-year-old named Sarah into going down on a queue of men, video footage of which found its way on to the internet and duly sent “Tenerife Girl” viral. Now, Sarah (Faye Marsay) has kidnapped them and is making her revenge. After this promising start, the rest of the drama is a dying fall, with the actors working hard (and Marsay giving a particularly fine performance) to flesh out a slightly thin script. It is never clear why Mani has been picked as a fellow inmate (apart from giving Nathan someone to bounce off – the Wilson basketball to Nathan’s Tom Hanks); the tension fails to build; the issues arising from events clearly drawn from many real-life instances whose survivors do not need me to list them here are barely explored; and Nathan is vouchsafed an unsatisfyingly small amount of enlightenment (Mani none at all). Also, how the men are supposed to earn their release echoes the Black Mirror episode The National Anthem so closely that the shadow of that series – which lurks over the whole thing – finally swallows it whole. What could have been a shatteringly timely piece resonating with the zeitgeist was instead a bit of a damp squib. Let us turn with a sigh of relief and delight equalled only by a woman taking off her bra and sinking into the sofa at the end of a hard day to The Repair Shop at Christmas (BBC Two). I don’t know how I missed the preceding 15 episodes of its run. It is so perfectly tailored to my tastes that I had a momentary panic that I had forgotten I had become a BBC exec and commissioned it. Anyway. It is a programme about a team of craftsmen and women (don’t make me call them craftspeople – it is CHRISTMAS) who work to restore family treasures. It is enough to make you weep in an ordinary week. The Christmas episode involved music box expert Stephen Kember restoring a Polyphon that had been silent for decades; a painting damaged by a boy playing Star Wars being brought in by him 30 years later to have it mended by conservator Lucia Scalisi for his recently widowed mother; and a loved-to-tatters doll – Betty – who was given to 82-year-old Patricia as a Christmas present by the family who took her in as a four-year-old evacuee. “They made such a fuss of me. She’s the only thing I’ve ever kept.” Kember soon has the Polyphon playing Hark! The Herald Angels Sing as beautifully as ever. The sisters who brought it in listen as the sound of their childhood fills the air. Light and life are brought back to the son’s painting, and maybe a little to his mother, too. And Patricia gets Betty back. “Her face is identical!” she says, as the years telescope and vanish. Her own changes slightly when she sees the new cloth limbs under Betty’s old dress. “Did you … try and keep as much original as you could?” she asks hesitantly. They put all of the parts of Betty that they couldn’t use again in a pouch sewn into her tummy, the experts explain gently, “so every bit of her is still there”. It is the kindest thing I have ever seen. I was sobbing long before the secret Santa scarf at the end. I can’t describe that to you with only the paltry resource of the written word at my disposal. You will have to watch it.

He attended Madras college in the town and St Andrews University, graduating with a first-class degree in chemistry, which was followed by a PhD. After university he took up a position as a director of research and development with a chemical company in Steinau, Germany, where he thrived. Returning to the UK in 1975, he was appointed managing director of the chemical firm Dutton &amp; Reinisch in Flimby, Cumbria, and three years later he joined Pentagon Chemicals in Workington. It went into receivership shortly afterwards and Peter secured funding for a management buyout. Over the next decade he was instrumental in making the company highly profitable and when it was sold he formed his own consultancy before retiring. It was then that he threw his considerable ability into the local community, serving as a governor at the local secondary school and as a non-executive director of the Cumbria NHS trust. He was a member of the Workington Playgoers amateur dramatic club, where he was chair for many years. He was also instrumental in securing funding for the refurbishment of the town’s Theatre Royal. Peter acted as a press officer for Workington RNLI and raised money for the Workington Shannon Lifeboat appeal. On hearing that his local pub, the Punch Bowl, was to be sold, Peter again sprang into action, rallying supporters so that it could become a community pub.

The microplate consists of an eight-by-12 plastic grid of 96 small indentations numbered A1 to H12, which enables multiple tests to be carried out at the same time, rapidly and cheaply, using very small volumes of blood or other liquid samples. Research carried out by Dennis and his colleague Alister Voller demonstrated that the Elisa was superior to existing diagnostics for diseases including malaria and rubella. There was no commercial secrecy around the Elisa and so it became the most widely used diagnostic test for infective, immune, endocrine, cancer and haematological disorders, as well as horticultural and agricultural diseases. With the support of the World Health Organisation (WHO), it was adopted internationally in diagnostic and research laboratories. The assay is now used in blood transfusion services to screen for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis viruses. Dennis was born to Herbert Bidwell, a merchant seaman, and his wife, Doris (nee Webster), a seamstress, in Peckham, south London. His father died of cancer when the boy was four. Dennis, who was not selected for grammar school, had to find his own way in the academic world. He eventually achieved a degree and doctorate in immunology by attending night school under the aegis of London University, while working full-time as a lab technician at the Wellcome Institute and bringing up a young family with his wife, Marina, whom he had married in 1955. He was recruited by the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine in 1965 to work on virology, and in 1970 he joined the WHO Collaborating Laboratory on malaria diagnosis, led by Alister. This led to a highly productive collaboration lasting 30 years. In the early 1970s, a system of test analysis named Elisa was developed in Sweden; Dennis and Alister modified this original procedure, which was slow and required large samples, to produce a new version, which in 1976 they called microplate Elisa. Dennis and Alister chose not to patent their pioneering work, preferring to allow their discovery to advance medical procedures the world over. They sought neither riches nor fame, but they did have a very rich working life and friendship together, travelling to Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and South America to lecture on the Elisa microplate and to enable countless numbers of practitioners to improve and accelerate their diagnostic techniques. Dennis was an excellent teacher and went out of his way to help in his supervision of generations of students from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Despite his extraordinary contribution to medical science, he never spoke about his achievements and chose the obscurity and warmth of his home and family. Dennis is survived by Marina, his daughters, Helen and Sarah, his grandchildren, Kate, Joe, Hollie and Alex, and his brother, Terry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/30/university-staff-are-right-to-be-striking","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T18:13:33Z","webTitle":"University staff are right to be striking | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/30/university-staff-are-right-to-be-striking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/30/university-staff-are-right-to-be-striking","fields":{"headline":"University staff are right to be striking","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"University employers have provoked the largest vote for industrial action ever seen in the higher education sector. They have done this by overseeing what they present as a financial crisis for the University Superannuation Scheme (USS), and by threatening enormous cuts to the pensions of hundreds of thousands of university staff. None of this is necessary. It is the result of the misrepresentation of USS finances, and the desire of a new breed of university managements to cut their pension liabilities and thereby ease the financing of new buildings and campuses. Successive Pension Acts have encouraged managers of private sector schemes to exaggerate the risk of default. Combined with quantitative easing, this has led to a headlong abandonment of final salary defined benefit to “defined contribution” schemes, where employees rather than employers bear investment risk. Higher education is shaped by frantic competition for students and huge building projects. Universities can recruit unlimited UK undergraduates paying an annual £9,000+, backed by taxpayer loans. The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 even allows universities to go bankrupt. It is not just students, parents and the taxpayers of the future who are paying for this ultra-competition. Pension cuts are estimated at £200,000, with the worst hit being the youngest. The next generation of university academics, already bearing huge student debts, now face the deepest cut in pensions. There is no justification for this pension attack. By any normal commercial measure, USS’s finances are strong. Assets have grown by an average of 12% a year for the last five years, and it has a record number of staff paying into the scheme. Actuaries report that USS could pay pensioners directly from its income for 40 years without touching its assets. Staff are right to strike to defend their pensions. The government has caused this confected “crisis”, and it is the university employers who are seeking to take advantage of it to get staff pensions off their books.

As the play demonstrates, the asylum interview is an experience nobody would want to endure. Indeed, it was hard persuading our group members, all torture survivors, to revisit it for the audio recordings that audiences can listen to before or after the play, which recall their personal experiences. A male interviewer, for example, repeatedly asking a female survivor how often she was raped, and by how many men, or a translator repeatedly translating “I was not drunk” as “I was drunk”, are not things that should happen in a civilised society. One torture survivor who saw the play said afterwards: “That’s the first time I’ve seen an immigration officer befriending an asylum seeker.” Home Office asylum decision-making is poor. Research by Freedom from Torture shows that medical evidence is routinely mishandled in torture survivors’ asylum claims, and in over three-quarters of the cases we examined, the decision was overturned at appeal and the right to stay in the UK was granted. It’s a scandal that so much public money is wasted, and so much human misery caused, by this broken and brutal introduction to a supposedly welcoming haven. Sheila Hayman Coordinator, Write to Life, Freedom from Torture • The invasive and unfair questioning of a woman who has experienced sexual violence, as outlined in your report of the UK justice system (Calls for reform over use of women’s sex history in rape trials, 29 January), is a worldwide phenomenon and a huge factor in survivors not wishing to take cases forward. Universally, there are numerous barriers in place that prevent women from reporting the sexual violence they have faced. Often, they must relive their trauma time and time again even before they get to the court. They then face evidence being brought on their sexual history – the use of which is a form of victim blaming and judgment on what it means to be a “good woman”. The more difficult it is for women to come forward and seek legal support, the more impunity is promoted. ActionAid works globally to alleviate these universal barriers to justice but there is a need for a more unified approach that includes a universal push for a solution.

A total of 1.67m cars rolled off UK production lines in 2017, down 3% compared with 2016 as demand for British-made cars dropped both at home and abroad, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The number was about 130,000 below the industry’s forecast, largely because of a near 10% fall in domestic buyers as cash-strapped households in Britain were increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. The SMMT also blamed “confusion” over the government’s policy on diesel. The trade body warned 2018 was likely to be another tough year for the UK industry, which is facing the prospect of declining investment and zero growth in production volumes. Companies including Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover, and McLaren last year committed to a total of £1.1bn in future investment in the UK, down 34% compared with the £1.66bn committed in 2016 and below the average over the past few years. “A drop of that magnitude is a concern,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, as he warned the government needed to provide “urgent clarity” on a transitional Brexit deal so that companies could press ahead with crucial spending decisions. “Transitional arrangements must retain all the current benefits or else around 10% of our exports could be threatened overnight,” Hawes said. “We compete in a global race to produce the best cars and must continue to attract investment to remain competitive. Whilst such investment is often cyclical the evidence is that it is now stalling, so we need rapid progress on trade discussions to safeguard jobs and stimulate future growth.” The UK industry has abandoned a target to build more than 2m cars a year by 2020 – breaking a previous record of 1.92m in 1972 – because of the scale of uncertainty posed by Brexit. “It’s hard to see [the industry achieve] that when we have this period of uncertainty. We still hope that we can maintain the inherent strengths that we have, but circumstances have undoubtedly changed,” Hawes said. About 80% of cars made in Britain are destined for export markets. In 2017 vehicles made for overseas markets fell 1.1% to 1.33m, while those made for sale in the UK fell 9.8% to 336,628. The EU is the UK’s biggest export market for cars, with more than half of all exports destined for the single-currency bloc. Hawes said there was a risk that Britain was so distracted by Brexit that it could fall behind other countries focused on the development of electric and driverless technology. “That’s the danger when you’ve got uncertain times. Every company is modelling different scenarios and trying to make sure they’re in the best possible place,” he said. Theresa May met industry leaders in November to discuss their concerns about the sector after Brexit. Andy Barratt, chairman and managing director of Ford in the UK, which employs about 14,000 people, said the government had listened to their concerns. “We have an active voice. Industry has been very clear and consistent about what it needs.” Barratt said Ford was still investing in its engine plants at Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. Mick Flanagan, vice-president at Adient, which makes the seats for one in every three cars produced around the world, said that delays of just two to three hours at a customs border would create a “big problem” because production lines run with “military precision”. Last week Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, announced plans to cut production at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, blaming faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/andrea-waters-sweetcorn-red-pepper-pancake-guacamole-recipe","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Andrea Waters’s sweetcorn and red pepper pancakes with guacamole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/andrea-waters-sweetcorn-red-pepper-pancake-guacamole-recipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/andrea-waters-sweetcorn-red-pepper-pancake-guacamole-recipe","fields":{"headline":"Andrea Waters’s sweetcorn and red pepper pancakes with guacamole","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I wanted to put sweetcorn pancakes on our menu because they remind me of the happy Sundays of my 1970s childhood in New Zealand. As the decade of fondues and flares dawned, stuffy dinners at the table disappeared. We were now permitted to eat supper in front of the TV, my parents in their La-Z-Boy chairs and us kids nestled in the gold shagpile carpet. Sunday suppers – or “cowboy tea” as we called it – became fun, consisting of party food like these sweetcorn pancakes done on a cute, miniature scale. My mother was clever at smuggling extra vegetables into dishes without raising suspicion – often the pancakes would contain peppers, courgettes or leeks and my brother and I would be none the wiser. In the late 80s, sweetcorn pancakes became a brunch hit in New Zealand and Australia, often topped with avocado, grilled tomatoes and crispy bacon. They are still a family favourite, although I’ve altered my mother’s recipe to make them vegan and gluten-free. In fact, they are crispier and tastier (sorry Mum!). Servings: Four portions – serving two per portion (or they can also be made small for canapés) Prep: 20 minutes Cook: 20 minutes Vegan, gluten-free Sweetcorn pancakes 525g frozen sweetcorn kernels (thawed) 240ml cup oat milk 2 tbsp white chia seeds 1 red pepper ½ bunch spring onions ½ bunch of fresh coriander leaves, washed and roughly chopped 60g buckwheat flour 60g polenta 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp rock salt ½ tsp cracked black pepper Coconut oil or olive oil for cooking Guacamole 2 large, ripe avocados, diced or crushed with a fork ½ bunch of coriander leaves, washed and roughly chopped 2 limes, juiced 1 chili, very finely diced ½ bunch spring onions, sliced and washed ½ tsp rock salt ½ tsp black pepper Method Pre-warm oven to 200c. Place half of the corn kernels and the oat milk, salt and pepper in a food processor and blitz until the corn kernels are pureed. Scrape into a mixing bowl. Grind the chia seeds, either by hand in a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder. Wash the red peppers and dice – a ½ cm dice is ideal. Slice the spring onions then wash in a colander. Dirt is often lodged inside the green leaves and this is the most efficient way to remove it. Mix the remaining sweetcorn and all other ingredients into the pureed corn, stirring until just combined. Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Drop two serving spoons of mixture per pancake into the pan. Cook two or three at a time for 1½ minutes each side, or until golden, then transfer to a baking tray. Finish in the oven for 10 minutes till crispy and cooked through. To make the guacamole, combine all ingredients, mix and serve immediately. If not using immediately, press a greaseproof paper cartouche on top of the guacamole to prevent oxidising in the air. Top tip – wetting and wringing out the cartouche makes it more pliable and helps it to stick to the surface. At Redemption, we serve two pancakes with a healthy dollop of guacamole and garnish with cherry tomatoes, and a handful of rocket.

First, has this actually ever happened to anyone? And, if so, surely the obvious answer is just to hoist them back up – and leave, turn around and walk straight out the door, never to return to again to said venue. No, according to Katharine Whitehorn, veteran Observer columnist, this is the worst thing you could do. Self-assurance is the key: ‘If you have confidence anything goes.’ And the way to achieve such levels of confidence? Practice, I’m afraid; practise putting yourself in embarrassing situations, and then styling them out to the best of your ability. ‘Social ease comes from practice,’ she says, ‘from having lived through an increasing number of situations in which, at the time, we wished to drop dead. And I speak as one who first went into a smart hairdresser and knelt at the backwash.’ Katharine’s second tip to swerve awkward scenarios is actually genius: she’s basically advocating for a form of mindfulness – before mindfulness was even a thing. ‘The people who get on are the people who can get their mind off their own predicament and think of someone else. It is a trick like keeping the mind on a fixed point to avoid seasickness, but it is a trick linked to psychology and apparently it works.’ Instead of focusing on your breathing, third eye or chakras just pour all your attention on to the other person, and ‘focus your mind on expanding their ego’. This way, social bloomers aside, they’ll regard you with the fond glow of someone who has been made to feel fascinating. However, if you choose to play this dangerous game Katharine urges us to beware of the cardinal social sin for which there is no forgiveness: ‘Forgetting people’s names.’ If you do they will certainly never let you forget the time your pants fell down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/my-week-bette-davis-fierce-brows-emma-jane-unsworth","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"My week as Bette Davis: 'My fierce brows are begging to be raised'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/my-week-bette-davis-fierce-brows-emma-jane-unsworth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/my-week-bette-davis-fierce-brows-emma-jane-unsworth","fields":{"headline":"My week as Bette Davis: 'My fierce brows are begging to be raised'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I nearly came to blows with a taxi driver last weekend. This isn’t a regular thing for me. I’ll explain: I’d come back from a trip and had a lot of bags. Rushing to get into the cab, to not hold up the queue, I’d forgotten to take my rucksack off my back. I sat down and panted my address. “TAKE THE RUCKSACK OFF!” the driver yelled through the hole in the Perspex. I hurriedly pulled the rucksack off, hot-cheeked. And then I did something I would never normally do. I leaned forward and said: “Listen, you may well have a point, but there are ways to speak to a person, and if you’re going to continue to talk to me like that you can stop right here because I am getting out.” I sat back. We stopped at a red light. We sat in silence. Then, a remarkable thing happened. He apologised. “You’re right,” he said. “There are ways to say it. I was wrong.” I exhaled, and we ended up having a pleasant conversation about the Peak District (where I’d just been). When we reached my flat, he helped me out and I gave him a tip. As I watched him drive away, I felt a sense of success. As I say, this was atypical. I’m more the kind of person who’s afraid to put her seatbelt on once the journey has started, in case the taxi driver takes it as a negative critique of their driving. I have always been a people-pleaser. On a solo trip around New Zealand in my early 20s, I was so afraid of offending a couple who befriended me on a ferry and insisted on giving me a bed for the night (I know, I know) that I ended up back at their house, having dinner next to a stuffed grizzly bear dressed as Elvis. It towered over the table, its claws painted purple with nail polish. “Emma,” I said to myself, quite sure I was going to be murdered in my bed: “You really have to learn how to say ‘No thanks’.” This year, as I approach 40, I’m trying to be more authentic. Braver. Bolder. Less fearful of being judged. I’ve worried so much about people’s opinions of me that I have forgotten who I am beyond who they want me to be. It’s not just how I talk to people in the flesh. It’s the way I send emails. It’s the way I feel on social media. My life has been riddled with self-doubt and a fear of speaking my mind, in case it leads to rejection. I’m calling time on this. This idea came to a head as I watched the TV series Feud (still available on iPlayer), about 1940s screen icons Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, and their fractious relationship. It’s beautifully styled and the acting is phenomenal: Jessica Lange plays Crawford, and Susan Sarandon plays Davis. But I found myself deeply affected by Sarandon’s Davis – the whisky-swigging, foul-mouthed, kick-ass old broad who refuses to kowtow to Hollywood PR sheen or female stereotypes. She is the very opposite of a people-pleaser. She is the archetypal giver-of-zero-fs. She inspired me. What would my life be like if I tried to Be More Bette? I decided to give it a go. That taxi ride was just the start. When I got out, I was snarked at by a pair of men outside my building, who pointed at my bags. “Funny time of year for a holiday in Brighton, isn’t it?” I might normally have laughed that off. Instead I said: “I live here, smart-arse.” I didn’t turn to see their reaction. I did expect them to throw something at my head, but otherwise I was doing well. Part of being Bette is, it seems, not looking back – literally or metaphorically. I have known women, my beloved great-aunt being one, who would go full Bette of an evening – bossing people around, sitting on tables to tell stories, stealing drinks – and then get home, regret it (for which read sober up) and the next morning ring everyone to apologise. You’d have to console her, which was always worse (duller; more time-consuming) than anything she’d said or done. No, the trick to being Bette was to have no regrets, to not succumb to the 3am fear, the social-postmortem anxiety. As Davis wrote in her autobiography, The Lonely Life: “To look back is to relax one’s vigil.” So, eyes on the horizon, the following day I went to a yoga class. I’ve only been twice before and it is a very established group; I feel like an infiltrator (also I’m not very good at yoga). The previous week I took someone else’s mat by mistake and she gave me daggers the whole class. This time, I was ready. I went on the mat again. She came and stood by me. I wish I could tell you I said something whip-smart and ice-cool – but someone beat me to it. Another member of the class, a dazzling woman, 5ft nothing and pushing 70, clad in glittery black Lycra, drawled: “Come on, Julie, let her have that one, life is too short to have your own yoga mat.” Slam dunk; the mat-owner moved away and the class began. I had been out-Bette’d, that much was clear, but I marvelled at the result. As we stretched into the first downward dog, the glittery woman started making cracks about her upcoming hip op and I wondered whether I could ever be like that: speak my mind and then merrily carry on, unfazed. I cannot bear the idea of being disliked, and in this area, Davis has much to teach me. “It is better to be hated for who you are than to be loved for someone you’re not,” she writes. “It’s a sign of your worth sometimes, if you’re hated by the right people.” How liberating is that? To be hated as a goal – a bit like a social version of the TV gameshow Pointless. Easier said than done, though, in the age of social media – that pit of neediness and likability – where the only barometer is the thumbs up or thumbs down from the crowd – or worse, silence. I’ve met some wonderful people on there, but had some grim times, too. I’ve withdrawn from a lot of it in recent years. I couldn’t cope with Facebook (I lost days in there – actual days), and I reached a point on Twitter and Instagram where everything I posted made me anxious. Properly anxious, in a heart-poundy, adrenaline-rush, fight-or-flight kind of way. In a way, it was exciting. Energising, even. (I wondered whether it could somehow count as cardio.) But it was also tiring. And my motivations were off. I wasn’t doing it to connect, to learn, to share, not really. I was doing it to be liked. Realistically, Bette Davis wouldn’t be on social media at all (or wear a rucksack, for that matter), yet she was a massive narcissist, so maybe she wouldn’t be able to resist. Five days into being more Bette, I post a picture of myself on Instagram with what I think is a genius caption. As soon as it is on there, I decide it is stupid. I am filled with self-loathing. Is it too late to take it down? Will anyone notice? People start liking it. I exhale. Then, someone I do not know, a new follower, leaves a comment. It is the emoji of a person walking, with the word “bye”. I am outraged. What’s up with her? I am tempted to click on her avatar and see what she is like, to try to find something to make me feel better about the fact she has unfollowed me. Old me would have gone down that rabbit hole. But Bette says: “Screw that loser. Who kisses off with an emoji, anyway?” I delete the comment because I don’t want it sitting there as a reminder, but I don’t pursue it. When my mind flicks to it, I say: “Don’t go there.” It’s CBT, Bette-style. There is something very indulgent and masochistic about looking to be disliked. And when it comes to the internet: seek self-torture, and ye shall find. But it’s not always easy to be strong; being tough behind the front feels like a lifelong work in progress. I think back to an encounter with an actor I met at a party a few years ago. She spoke to me in a way that wasn’t exactly rude, but let me know that my opinion didn’t matter to her. It was late in the evening, and the karaoke had come out. “So,” I said, good-humouredly. “Are you going to have a go?” She levelled me with a caustic stare. “Darling, I get paid to go onstage. I’m not doing it for free.” She was 100% serious. Wow. So Bette! I was half-horrified, half-awed. If I were being more Bette back then, my retort could have been: “Sweetie, this isn’t a stage; it’s someone’s living room. Wind it in.” But I just marvelled at her gall. I didn’t judge her, just found it fascinating. I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. Our idea of ourselves isn’t always the same thing we project. I have a friend – a very successful, outwardly confident friend – who says she can have a bad day, “if the bus driver looks at her funny”. The brashest person at a party is often the most insecure. Wisecracks can be smoke and mirrors. Still, there is a fine line between having more front and being rude or dismissive. As my friend Dolly says: “What if your authentic self is a dick?” Isn’t there something to be said for tact and reticence, sometimes? I ask my friend Katie – a total Bette, a straight-talker, and definitely not a dick – for her take. She tells me that being badly bullied at school meant she had to learn from an early age to get validation from herself rather than other people. “My confidence comes partly from a bloody-minded solipsism, and having come to terms very early with a number of things. I knew I wasn’t ever going to be liked by everyone – because nobody liked me,” she says. There’s an echo of this in Davis’s autobiography when she writes: “I have always been driven by some distant music – a battle hymn no doubt – for I have been at war since the beginning.” Davis’s father left when she was small and she had a difficult journey to Hollywood – rejected for her own screen tests and used as an extra in others, including one where 15 men lay on top of her, one after the other, to practise their passionate kiss. On Davis’s crypt, at Forest Lawn memorial park in Los Angeles, there is a 6ft tall Roman statue of a woman standing on a marble sarcophagus, above the words: “Bette Davis. She did it the hard way.” After seven days of channelling Bette, I arrive at a photography studio to be transformed into the woman herself. I sit down and look in the mirror. Can I look like her? I don’t even look like me at the moment. I had a baby a year ago and feel as if I haven’t slept properly for 14 months. Morag the makeup artist – a total Bette – works her magic. I stare at my over-drawn red lips, straight across the top with no dip, a slash of attitude, my fierce brows, begging to be raised, sardonically. I understand the meaning of the term warpaint. “Are you allergic to anything?” Morag asks. “No,” I answer instinctively. Then I say: “I’m just trying to think what Bette Davis would say in response to that.” Morag thinks for a moment. Then she says: “Joan Crawford.” Ha! Out-Bette’d again. Throughout the day, I have a few work emails to deal with. I consider my words carefully as I type. I try to be straight up, to not ponder or obsess or agonise. I try to use fewer of those little modifying words, such as “maybe” and “possibly”, that women so often use to make themselves more palatable; less demanding, but also uncertain, apologetic. I feel inspired to own the situation instead of shuffling to fit in to it, to ask for what I want. If you don’t get it, forget it and move on. I send the emails and click my phone to sleep. Every time my mind tries to go to the emails, I tell it: don’t even go there. I relax and get my swagger on. The shoot is a hoot. There are some things I don’t want to do (wear a skirt, for example), and I stand my ground pleasantly and… it’s fine. Everyone is cool. There, see? I tell myself. I realise that the really difficult thing isn’t dealing with people who sling shit; it’s dealing with people I like when they ask me for things I can’t give but feel obliged to. I don’t have the grammar for that. I’m working on this across the board. When I got married recently, my husband and I wrote our own vows. One of them was: “To communicate fully and fearlessly.” It’s an ongoing challenge, but a crucial one. I’m making a few vows to myself this year, too. To always admire kick-ass women, but to love and accept the other side of myself: the oversensitive overthinker who remains porous to the world. Some flaws are strengths in disguise. To feel less, to lose sensitivity, would be to experience only half of life – just as worrying too much eats up precious time. I leave my makeup on to go home on the train. Before the mask slips, I find myself in one last situation to handle, Bette-style. It soon becomes clear that, across the carriage, there is that most challenging of fellow passengers: the interminable sniffer. A man eating a tub of melon is sniffing loudly every five seconds. A guttural sniff. A productive sniff. My face twists into a Bette frown. In the seat opposite me, a woman has stopped reading her book, similarly grossed out. We exchange a look. She puts her headphones in. Alas, I have no such luxuries, and the journey is an hour long. After a few more minutes of the grotesque sniffing, I pull a pack of tissues out of my bag and proffer them in the man’s direction. I say: “Would you like a tissue?” Sure, it’s slightly more passive-aggressive than: “Can you stop sniffing, please?”, but it’s the best I can do. The woman hides her face behind her book. The man declines and looks genuinely sorry (it could have gone either way, let’s face it) and pulls out a blue paper hand towel to blow his nose. He doesn’t sniff again. I try to catch his eye and smile, to let him know I am not a rotter, just someone who spoke her mind and is now getting on with things, but he stares out the window. The woman lowers her book and gives me a secret smile. It is a smile that says: you’re pretty cool. And you know what, for a millisecond, I feel it. Commenting on this piece?

I remember being awestruck that someone would take an interest in me. But you did and we fell in love quickly. We both came from challenging backgrounds, which probably fuelled the intensity of our relationship. What started as a playground romance became more serious – adult, even, when we moved in together. The next two years were spent playing at being grownups – far beyond the emotional capacity of two teenagers – but for a while it worked. I thought it would never end. You got a great job, while I worked in a shop. Your life was broadening, whereas I wanted mine to stay the same. Inevitably, our relationship became strained; my insecurity and jealously became unbearable. And we split up. You met someone else and moved on and away. The pain was unbearable, and I tried to take my own life. I was still in love with you, still broken inside because of you. I tried to move on, but each relationship was a failure as I compared it with ours. Then I met my wife, went back to college, got a serious job. I thought I had finally got over you. And then, through an early social media site, we started chatting and agreed to meet. I wanted to get closure, but seeing you that night made me realise I was still in love with you. We kissed and made wild promises. We met again and I wanted to tell you how I felt, but was unable to. We drifted apart once more and I had to grieve for you all over again. Years passed; I thought of you still. But I had travelled, had children, built a life beyond anything I thought possible. For the first time in my life, I had found peace with myself. Then I saw you on social media again and we spent a Saturday night chatting via WhatsApp. I asked if we were flirting. You said yes, and that you had never really left me. I was confused, excited, happy, scared. We spoke on the phone, and hearing your voice left me close to tears. I know I’m being selfish, but I want more. More of you. You are with someone and I’m married. We both have children. Part of me hopes that time has changed us to the point where we don’t go any further. But those feelings I had for you are back. How do you feel about me? I don’t want to lose you again. I want to love you and be able to love you. I’m all over the place. I don’t know where this is going.

Though Mike Milosh is now the sole member – aided by whoever he managed to herd into the studio – the sound of the second Rhye album is still a particularly sepulchral take on R&amp;B, not entirely unrelated to the xx, and with some of the same nocturnal wooziness of Cigarettes After Sex (though it’s entirely possible neither act would recognise the comparison). Milosh has been talking up the differences between this and Woman, Rhye’s debut – it was built on the time the group spent on the road, rather than being a simple construction; it’s inspired by disintegrating relationships – but all bar the closest listeners will be happy to hear something that could pass for Woman Part II, for all that it’s played on live instruments. That’s perhaps testament to the quality of the songwriting on both albums, and to Milosh’s extraordinary voice – a seductive, sleepy countertenor that leads people to believe they are hearing a woman at first. The detailing throughout is fabulous: the way Phoenix builds almost imperceptibly, introducing the slightest of funk guitar, then sotto stabs of horns; the way Feel Your Weight keeps shifting and building without ever losing direction. Best of all is Sinful, in which a circular folk guitar pattern repeats, kept tense by percussion limited to hi-hat, strings adding layers of urgency: it’s so perfectly judged it sounds as though it has always existed, and was hidden under dust waiting to be uncovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/30/bp-charging-points-electric-cars-uk-petrol-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T15:07:57Z","webTitle":"BP to install charging points for electric cars at UK petrol stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/bp-charging-points-electric-cars-uk-petrol-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/30/bp-charging-points-electric-cars-uk-petrol-stations","fields":{"headline":"BP to install charging points for electric cars at UK petrol stations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"BP will add rapid charging points for electric cars at its UK petrol stations within the next two months, in the latest sign of an oil giant adapting to the dramatic growth of battery-powered cars. The British oil firm’s venture arm has invested $5m (£3.5m) in the US firm Freewire Technologies, which will provide motorbike-sized charging units at forecourts to top up cars in half an hour. The move follows a bigger move by BP’s Anglo-Dutch rival Shell, which has been on a buying spree of electric car infrastructure companies and has already opened charging points at its service stations. While BP would not put a number on how many forecourts would see the chargers, it confirmed the trial would start in the UK during February and March before expanding to European locations later in the year. Tufan Erginbilgic, the chief executive of BP Downstream, said: “EV charging will undoubtedly become an important part of our business, but customer demand and the technologies available are still evolving.” The oil firm recently returned to solar power with the $200m investment in a solar developer, and is due to announce its first overarching carbon target soon, as it plays catch-up with other oil majors such as Shell. But today marks the company’s first step into electric cars, which it expects to rise a hundredfold by 2035 but not to seriously affect oil demand. There are around 130,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the UK, but Britain’s biggest charging point firm predicts that number will grow rapidly. Chargemaster Plc told an audience in London on Tuesday that it projected the nearly 50,000 plug-in car registrations in 2017 would jump to 70,000 new cars sold in 2018, which it said was a conservative estimate. Charging infrastructure falls into three categories: slow (less than 7KW, up to 8 hours to charge a car), fast (7-22KW, 3-4 hours) and rapid (50KW and above, typically 30 minutes or less). Tom Callow, director of strategy at the group, said the sort of rapid chargers that BP plans to install will be a niche market in the UK. “Fast charging is absolutely dominating ... [there is] a smaller circle of people who need rapid charging. The idea you need rapid chargers everywhere, all over the UK, is simply a fallacy... You then have a much much smaller circle of people who need super-rapid charging [350KW],” he said. However, National Grid, which runs the UK’s electricity transmission network, said that it was in talks with BP, Shell, Ford, BMW, Tesla and other companies about building infrastructure for super rapid chargers at motorway service stations. Graeme Cooper, the project director of electric vehicles, said that the company had mapped traffic, population and roads and identified 50 sites to ensure most people are in reach of such chargers. “Fifty strategic locations means to an extent that 96% of UK drivers would be able to drive in any direction from any location in the UK and be in 50 miles of an ultra rapid small charger … To an extent we can probably allay range anxiety,” he said. The grid infrastructure for such a plan would cost £0.5-1bn, or around 60p a driver per year if all motorists shouldered the cost, Cooper said. He was dismissive of “doom-mongers” who suggest the UK energy system cannot cope with the cars. Nissan, whose new longer range Leaf electric car arrives on UK roads in coming months, said on Tuesday that it would fit 1,000 charging points for a trial to test how plug-in cars’ batteries can help power grids, by returning electricity at times of need."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/30/interest-only-borrowers-risk-losing-homes-warns-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T18:17:04Z","webTitle":"Interest-only borrowers risk losing homes, warns watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/30/interest-only-borrowers-risk-losing-homes-warns-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/30/interest-only-borrowers-risk-losing-homes-warns-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Interest-only borrowers risk losing homes, warns watchdog","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The City regulator has sounded an alarm about the “significant numbers” of people with interest-only mortgages who may be in danger of losing their homes. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said many interest-only borrowers could face a shortfall in terms of what they owed, and some were avoiding talking to their mortgage lender because they “didn’t want to confront their situation”. There have been a series of warnings about this type of home loan in recent years, fuelling fears that some of those left with a huge bill could end up being repossessed. In 2013 the FCA - whose former boss previously labelled interest-only mortgages a “ticking timebomb” - revealed that about 1.3m homeowners with such mortgages may not have enough money to pay off their home loan when it is due for repayment and face an average shortfall of more than £71,000. The FCA said good progress had been made since then in reducing the numbers of people with these mortgages, but added: “We are very concerned that a significant number of interest-only customers may not be able to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage and be at risk of losing their homes.” With this type of home loan, the borrower agrees to pay off the interest each month but makes no capital repayments. Borrowers are expected to make sure they have an investment plan in place to pay off the debt at the end of the term. However, some people are facing a shortfall because their investment has underperformed, while others never set anything up. There are currently 1.67m part- and full interest-only mortgages outstanding in the UK, with about 85,000 due for repayment this year. The FCA said the next two maturity “peaks” were in 2027-2028 and 2032, and included less affluent individuals. The regulator said many lenders were reporting that, even though borrowers were being sent letters, “customer engagement rates are low”. It emerged that some lenders have even resorted to sending staff to knock on customers’ doors. However, in some cases the letters sent out by banks and building societies had “a lack of clarity and purpose”, which led to some customers not understanding the importance of the communication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/04/fatberg-museum-london-display-pickling-age-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T09:30:46Z","webTitle":"London’s fatberg on show: ‘We thought of pickling it’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/04/fatberg-museum-london-display-pickling-age-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/04/fatberg-museum-london-display-pickling-age-waste","fields":{"headline":"London’s fatberg on show: ‘We thought of pickling it’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nobody remembers exactly who coined the word, but it started off as a bit of slang used by the Thames Water “flushers” who work to keep the sewers flowing freely beneath London. Their word first surfaced from those Victorian tunnels and into the newspapers in August 2013, when a bus-sized “fatberg” – a solid mass of oil and grease and undisposable disposables – was removed from a sewer in Kingston upon Thames. After that the name caught on in the way that its rival “johnnyberg” (used by the flushers of Anglian Water, who had been struck by the preponderance of condoms in the ossified deposits) did not. “Fatberg” reached the Oxford English Dictionary in 2015 – at the same moment as “manspreading” and “Brexit” and “bantz” – and in the same year in which a record-breaking 10-tonne example broke a sewer in Chelsea costing Thames Water £400,000 to fix. But it wasn’t really until last year that “fatberg” went viral. The Whitechapel fatberg that made headlines in September was among our most infectious social media exports of 2017. The units in which it was routinely measured gave away its birthplace. This being a London phenomenon it was invariably described in local currency: at 820 feet, the fatberg was “longer than Tower Bridge” or “twice as long as Wembley Stadium” and “the weight of 11 double-decker buses”. Having once led the world in sewer engineering with Sir Joseph Bazalgette’s cavernous underground network of marvellous tunnels, London was now the undisputed global leader in sewer blockage. TV crews were dispatched from Moscow and Montreal and Madrid to stand above manhole covers along Whitechapel Road and hold their noses while Thames Water flushers in white protective suits used high-powered jet hoses and picks and shovels and vacuum pipes to break the fatberg up and then remove it in tankers at the rate of 20 to 30 tonnes per day. Ninety three per cent of its complex structure was said to consist of the element “wet wipe”. By the time the clean-up was over, and its notoriety had spread, lesser fatbergs were being unearthed in Belfast and Denver and Melbourne. It was in the first week of the discovery of the Whitechapel Monster (the hyperbole was part of the attraction, no nomenclature for the Subterranean Beast was too extreme) that the Museum of London, halfway through a series of exhibitions about modern city living, decided it must have a slice of it. Sharon Ament, the museum’s director had been thinking about the possibility of displaying a fatberg in the museum – whose collection includes a variety of valuable objects retrieved from drains and cess pits and sewers from Roman times on – since the previous big find in Chinatown in Soho. On that occasion the museum had not acted before the fatberg was destroyed; this time it was ready. (Apparently there was some talk that the Science Museum wanted a chunk of fatberg too, though when it discovered the Museum of London had first dibs there was, by some accounts, a collective sigh of relief among the curators there.) At the end of this week, a representative chunk of the Whitechapel Leviathan will be put on display at the Museum of London. It is likely that no lavatorial exhibit will have caused quite as much a splash since Marcel Duchamp invented conceptual art with his urinal a century ago. The woman charged with curating Fatberg! is Vyki Sparkes, who looks after social and working history at the museum. “It was like the finger of fate pointed at me,” she explains to me in the museum’s cafe, with well-scrubbed hands and a slightly rueful smile. She is unsure yet on how high up her CV “curator of 21st-century sewage” will appear, but she is confident that the exhibition will be a worthy addition to the museum. “If you went up to someone in the street and asked them to talk about what they put down their toilet they would tell you to bog off, basically,” she says. “But this is a way to open that conversation. We are not here to tell people how to behave, I am here to reflect how we live and to raise questions.” Those questions are welcomed above all by Thames Water, some of whose employees have begun to feel fatbergs looming over every part of their life, crowding in on them. Alex Saunders has been working on waste networks for four of his six years with the company, but on the Whitechapel Fatberg, and its ripple effects, for most of the past four months. The East End Mammoth was, he suggests to me, “kind of a perfect fatberg storm”. A fatberg needs two principal elements to evolve. The first is a large and regular amount of oil and grease poured into sewers; the second is a population that flushes wet wipes and tampons and condoms and nappies down the toilet. If you go and stand in Whitechapel Road, Saunders suggests, you could guess it was likely fatberg territory. It is a street lined with cafes and restaurants and takeaway outlets. Then there is the Royal London hospital, “which can lead to the flushing of some sanitary products”, and also a very high density of flats and houses. When you walk along that stretch of road it seems extraordinary that the fatberg could evolve to such a scale beneath your feet without Thames Water noticing it – or without the sewers backing up and flooding. Part of the reason for that is the sheer volume of the London network, Saunders suggests. The pipework is “hundreds of thousands of kilometres long” and “you cannot be sticking your head down the same bit of sewer every week”. The Whitechapel sewer, part of Bazalgette’s original brick-built labyrinth, has an inverted egg-shape cross-section; the bottom is narrower than the top so during a time of low flow there is a thin channel to keep it moving and when it rains the sewer amplifies. The fatberg had formed along the upper part of the tunnel. Below it there was still a good flow and therefore no warning signs. “Then suddenly,” Saunders recalls, “during our normal inspections the guys popped down there and found this thing that turned out to be bigger than Tower Bridge.” The Whitechapel Behemoth had hardened into a kind of concrete. The flusher teams have a variety of high-pressure jets, some revolving, some with chains and drill bits, to break up the bergs, which they try to use like keyhole surgery, careful not to damage the sewer itself. “We have lots of weapons at our disposal,” Saunders says, “but sometimes, as with the Whitechapel one, it is so impacted that a lot of it is the teams going down and chiselling away by hand.” In London, which has a magnified version of a universal problem because the sewers are so large, this work never stops. Thames Water has teams working full time; usually they are aware of five or six fatbergs that are growing. Some cause immediate blockages, others like the one in Whitechapel don’t. Saunders estimates the work costs £1m a month, but that doesn’t include the collateral damage of “sewage flooding living rooms and public spaces cordoned off and out of bounds because they are contaminated”. In many cases the job of flusher in London is a family occupation, the work traditionally passed down from father to son, much like the job of undertaker. Saunders was out with some second- and third-generation sewer flushers, the other evening, men who have been doing the job for 30 years themselves. In the past, they suggested, there was a good deal of job satisfaction in the work; it had a nice psychological trajectory: they started a shift with a blockage, and ended it with the sewer flowing freely. It is only in the last few years that they have found themselves routinely hacking away at fatbergs. When the Museum of London decided to take a chunk of the material the flushers raised an eyebrow, Sparkes recalls. The idea is that the world below street level does not invade the world above. The size of the sample was inevitably limited by what could come up through a manhole. The museum ended up with two sizeable chunks. To give a sense of its original serpentine scale they thought about installing it in a case with Victorian infinity mirrors which would extend it as far as the eye could see, but that idea was eventually abandoned. Because the substance itself is somewhat volatile though, and of an unusual consistency, they still had to rewrite procedure to work out how to deal with it. “We had our head of conservation look at it,” Sparkes says. “We initially thought about pickling it like one of Damien Hirst’s cows. The problem with that, we felt, was that it would likely make it liquid and runny.” What they did instead was to dry the samples. They did this at different rates, uncertain how it would respond. In the event, the one that was dried most quickly has crumbled into pieces; the other remains intact. Health and safety was an inevitable concern. “Worst case scenario if it is handled incorrectly is death,” Sparkes suggests. “It has come out of the sewer so it might contain Weil’s disease.” There was a fear it might also hide disposed needles – another hazard of the modern sewer – so it was x-rayed with that in mind. Museum staff still approach the fatberg with extreme caution, in full body protective suits and masks and disposable gloves, disinfecting as if they are in an operating room. The fatberg remains in quarantine ready to be encapsulated in a specially sealed case. “One of the problems is you get all sorts of things that live inside it,” Sparkes says. “One of our samples unexpectedly hatched loads of flies in store.” As well as breeding maggots, the fatberg breeds metaphors. It is hard not to think of it as a tangible symbol of the way we live now, the ultimate product of our disposable, out of sight, out of mind culture. One of the reasons this feels like a distinctly London story, is the horrible history of the city and its effluent, a history that until recently seemed happily confined to the past. Prior to autumn 2016, the last time we looked so hard at sewage was during the Great Stink of 1858, when a combination of a hot and dry summer and the practice of discharging the raw sewage of a fast-growing population directly into the Thames, turned the river brown and saw sewage 10ft-deep at the river’s margins. MPs were forced to debate in Parliament with handkerchiefs over their faces. Cholera and typhoid were epidemic. Like the burghers of Hamelin menaced by rats, the government charged the director of metropolitan works, Joseph Bazalgette, with solving the problem. With 318 million bricks and over the course of 16 years he did just that. The Observer reported on Bazalgette’s grand plan on 15 April, 1861, suggesting it was “the most extensive and wonderful work of modern times”. The paper noted how the network would carry waste to a cathedral-like treatment plant beyond the city margins, from where “the united sewage of three areas will be conveyed to Mucking Flats in that reach of the Thames called ‘The Lower Hope’.” It also bemoaned the fact that “the inhabitants of this metropolis seem to take little interest in the great undertaking”. It was the genius of Bazalgette to create a system designed to allow for enormous population explosion. His great underground caverns and diverted rivers, were designed to flow as 98% water. From the beginning, some of the city’s residents took advantage of the network as a rubbish disposal system, but it is only in recent years that the throwaway society has routinely clogged the network. Flushers report finds of motorbikes, prams, coins, phones and jewellery – and once a live hand grenade. The toxic nature of some of the industrial waste that finds its way into the sewers means that fewer animals survive than in the past; rats are in decline; beyond that there are occasional terrapins and the odd gasping goldfish. A decade ago the biggest problem facing Thames Water was cotton buds which blocked the mesh of sieving drums at treatment plants. It is only since the advent of the wet wipe that the blockages have consistently advanced upstream. Patented moistened close weave wipes first found a mass market at Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in 1963 to obviate the need for so much finger lickin’. Moistened baby wipes became available in the 1990s, but it wasn’t really until Kimberly-Clark and Proctor and Gamble started marketing adult wipes as an alternative to loo roll in 2005 that sewage systems started to clog. The global sale of moistened wipes is now a $17.5bn (£12.4bn) business, growing globally at around 4% per year. Many “adult” wipes carry the tag “flushable”, a description which means that they will likely get around the U-bend, but not that they will biodegrade in the sewer. “There is not a single wet wipe on sale that has passed the UK standard,” Saunders says. “The companies are marking their own homework when they say they are flushable.” Wipes are particularly resistant to degrading in water, and when after many years they eventually do, their plastic content becomes part of the problem you winced at on Blue Planet II. Thames Water did some research last year with a sample of 2,000 people. A third said they put their wipes in the bin and never put fat down the sink. A third said they used to flush wipes down the loo and pour fat down the plughole but had changed their habits now after understanding the issues. And a third admitted they had no idea that you weren’t supposed to use the drains as a catch-all waste disposal. Thames Water tries to aim its education about the issue at fatberg hotspot areas, which has resulted in 20% fewer blockages. The other part of the great fatberg equation has been the rise and rise of fatty and fast food as part of our diets. In 1884, Nathaniel Whiting of San Francisco patented the first grease trap to catch “substances which would tend to choke and clog the sewers”. His design is still the simple standard model for commercial kitchens: wastewater drains into a box where fat settles out. The problem is that eventually, someone has to clean the box out and dispose of the fat according to guidelines. Increasingly, it appears, this is a practice easily sidestepped and a regulation often ignored. Saunders suggests a simple solution: “I think as well as giving those health ratings on the doors of cafes they need to be inspected for their waste management. If they couldn’t get more than a ‘one out of five’ rating if they had no fat trap under their sink, we could change a lot of this overnight.” With the Whitechapel Colossus, Thames Water tried to show an example of best practice. The tankers of fat and grease were filtered of sanitary products and refined into enough biofuel to power a London bus for a year. But that was an expensive one-off; a better plan is to have a system for recovering the fat before it goes into the sewage. The company is exploring the economics of a collection service. With Bazalgette-style organisation there is much potential. In the United States, there have been stories of gangs blowtorching their way into grease traps to steal used cooking oil that can be made into biofuels. In the meantime, Saunders still exists in a world of fatbergs. Having had a great deal of experience with the substance how would he describe it? He had a big lump in his gloved hands from Whitechapel. “It is browny, yellowy, greeny in colour, a bit slippery to hold but also very heavy and very hard, and when you cut into it you find a stitching of wet wipes holding it together.” He was with a team extracting a big lump the other week; it was like exhibit A: “there was a condom hanging out one side, a wet wipe the other, big globs of fat holding it together.” At the Museum of London, the curatorial challenge has centred on the question of whether the fatberg was more like a soap or more like a candle. On balance, they have decided it is more like a candle. The sample that broke up has been sent to experts at Cranfield University to run a “fatberg autopsy” to discover exactly what it is made of. Having worked with it for a few months, has Sparkes lost any of her sense of disgust? She suggests it has become one of those uncanny objects where it is not immediately apparent whether it is animal, vegetable or mineral. Somewhere between compost and coral and bin juice. “It is really hard to classify,” she says. “Bits of it were wet to start with, now it is more like a crust. It is going slightly mouldy. There is a risk it will deteriorate on display.” The only distinctly synthetic thing you can quickly identify on its surface is, fittingly, the tiny purple and orange of a Double Decker chocolate wrapper. When they first received it, it was hard to get the smell out of your nose. “It has calmed down a bit now,” Sparkes suggests. “It is like a damp basement smell now, like someone has lived in a house for 70 years and done nothing to it.” Though it clearly has some historical value, she views it very much as a one-off. “For us Whitechapel was the key moment in this story. We are not in the market every time there is a blocked pipe.” Why does she think it struck such a chord? “I think it is the grossness, and the size above all,” she says. “I was talking about the display to another curator and she suggested that basically I had designed the perfect exhibition for teenage boys.” The name is also critical; the Museum of London has added an exclamation mark for effect. “If you can’t use an exclamation mark with a fatberg, when can you?” I wonder if she would like to see the fatberg in the permanent collection, taking its place as a defining monument to our age of waste. She suggests it remains to be seen. “If it goes on display and ends up as a pile of dead flies then ultimately it has no display value obviously.” In the meantime, for five months, museum-goers can look on this unnatural wonder and perhaps reflect that a culture is most clearly understood from the things it makes and the traces that it leaves behind.

Mark Ruffalo, Cynthia Nixon and Michael Moore spoke at the event, in a fiery rejection of Trump’s first year in office. On Tuesday night the actor and activist Alyssa Milano is hosting her own response to Trump: a “State of the Dream” initiative which will highlight real people’s hopes and dreams for the US. A further distraction will come after the State of the Union, when Jimmy Kimmel interviews Stormy Daniels, the porn actor who allegedly had an affair with Trump. The People’s State of the Union, at the Town Hall Theater in Manhattan, also featured Common and Rosie Perez. It was organized with key activist organizations including the Women’s March, Planned Parenthood, MoveOn and Indivisible. “We wanted to hear from the people who are actually working really hard for the positive vision of America – marching, rallying, organizing, calling, writing, tweeting, Facebooking, educating and caring for our country,” Ruffalo told the crowd. “I know you haven’t been at a country club for half a year, huffing down cheeseburgers, sitting on a golden toilet waiting for someone to bring you a chocolate cake.” Organizers aimed to celebrate the achievements made by the resistance movement in the past year – and to outline a plan of action for the coming year. “We must fight daily for our democracy, which requires more grunt work from all of us in this auditorium and all of you out there watching online. Because the truth is our democracy is not just under attack from overseas,” Nixon told the audience. “We also need to fight for it here at home against corporate interests and billionaires that hold our democracy in a ferocious death grip.” Many of the progressive speakers linked Trump with the wider issue of money in politics. Moore was among the most vehement. “We must remove and replace the system and the culture that gave us Trump in the first place. He did not just fall out of the sky and land in Queens,” Moore said. “He is the result of a decades-long corporate takeover of our democracy and of us, never correcting the three original sins of America: a nation founded on genocide, built on the backs of slaves, and maintained by the subjugation of women.” On Tuesday night Milano, one of the most prominent figures in the #MeToo movement, will run her own anti-Trump action during the president’s speech to Congress. Milano plans to share short videos submitted by people from across America – focussing on: “What you hope for. What inspires YOU. (We especially encourage those running for office and those already serving to do so!)”. She elaborated her plans in a post on Twitter and in a Google Document. “Our digital #StateOfTheDream address will support our dreamers and immigrants, call for a Dream Act, lean into the Senate, fundraise for United We Dream, and express our vision for a more inclusive, progressive America,” Milano said. Kimmel will sit down with Daniels around an hour after Trump’s speech. InTouch magazine published a 2011 interview with Daniels earlier this month. The interview featured specific claims about the president’s love-making. Melania Trump cancelled a planned trip to Davos with Trump in the wake of the reporting. Her office cited unspecified scheduling and logistical issues. “I got a number of emails from a number of very envious fellow late night hosts about this booking,” Kimmel said of the Daniels interview on Monday. “I have a lot of questions for Stormy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/saturdays-best-tv-spiral-biggie-the-notorious-life-of-big","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Spiral; Biggie: The Notorious Life of BIG","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/saturdays-best-tv-spiral-biggie-the-notorious-life-of-big","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/03/saturdays-best-tv-spiral-biggie-the-notorious-life-of-big","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Spiral; Biggie: The Notorious Life of BIG","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spiral 9pm, BBC Four The sixth series of the French drama concludes with two episodes that dance around a question that’s long lain at the heart of the show: who polices not just the police, but the wider political-judicial system?

But this isn’t a human cry – it’s the voice of a killer whale called Wikie. New research reveals that orcas are able to imitate human speech, in some cases at the first attempt, saying words such as “hello”, “one, two” and “bye bye”. The study also shows that the creatures are able to copy unfamiliar sounds produced by other orcas – including a sound similar to blowing a raspberry. Scientists say the discovery helps to shed light on how different pods of wild killer whales have ended up with distinct dialects, adding weight to the idea that they are the result of imitation between orcas. The creatures are already known for their ability to copy the movements of other orcas, with some reports suggesting they can also mimic the sounds of bottlenose dolphins and sea lions. “We wanted to see how flexible a killer whale can be in copying sounds,” said Josep Call, professor in evolutionary origins of mind at the University of St Andrews and a co-author of the study. “We thought what would be really convincing is to present them with something that is not in their repertoire – and in this case ‘hello’ [is] not what a killer whale would say.” Wikie is not the first animal to have managed the feat of producing human sounds: dolphins, elephants, parrots, orangutans and even beluga whales have all been captured mimicking our utterances, although they use a range of physical mechanisms to us to do so. Noc, the beluga whale, made novel use of his nasal cavities, while Koshik, an Indian elephant jammed his trunk in his mouth, resulting in the pronouncement of Korean words ranging from “hello” to “sit down” and “no”. But researchers say only a fraction of the animal kingdom can mimic human speech, with brain pathways and vocal apparatus both thought to determine whether it is possible. “That is what makes it even more impressive – even though the morphology [of orcas] is so different, they can still produce a sound that comes close to what another species, in this case us, can produce,” said Call. He poured cold water, however, on the idea that orcas might understand the words they mimic. “We have no evidence that they understand what their ‘hello’ stands for,” he said. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, researchers from institutions in Germany, UK, Spain and Chile, describe how they carried out the latest research with Wikie, a 14-year-old female orca living in an aquarium in France. She had previously been trained to copy actions performed by another orca when given a human gesture. After first brushing up Wikie’s grasp of the “copy” command, she was trained to parrot three familiar orca sounds made by her three-year old calf Moana. Wikie was then additionally exposed to five orca sounds she had never heard before, including noises resembling a creaking door and the blowing a raspberry. Finally, Wikie was exposed to a human making three of the orca sounds, as well as six human sounds, including “hello”, “Amy”, “ah ha”, “one, two” and “bye bye”. “You cannot pick a word that is very complicated because then I think you are asking too much – we wanted things that were short but were also distinctive,” said Call. Throughout the study, Wikie’s success was first judged by her two trainers and then confirmed from recordings by six independent adjudicators who compared them to the original sound, without knowing which was which. The team found that Wikie was often quickly able to copy the sounds, whether from an orca or a human, with all of the novel noises mimicked within 17 trials. What’s more, two human utterances and all of the human-produced orca sounds were managed on the first attempt – although only one human sound – “hello” – was correctly produced more than 50% of the time on subsequent trials. The matching was further backed up through an analysis of various acoustic features from the recordings of Wikie’s sounds. While the sounds were all made and copied when the animals’ heads were out of the water, Call said the study shed light on orca behaviour. “I think here we have the first evidence that killer whales may be learning sounds by vocal imitation, and this is something that could be the basis of the dialects we observe in the wild – it is plausible,” said Call, noting that to further test the idea, trials would have to be carried out with wild orcas. Diana Reiss, an expert in dolphin communication and professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York, welcomed the research, noting that it extends our understanding of orcas’ vocal abilities, with Wikie able to apply a “copy” command learned for imitation of actions to imitation of sounds. Dr Irene Pepperberg, an expert in parrot cognition at Harvard University, also described the study as exciting, but said: “A stronger test would have been whether the various sounds produced could be correctly classified by humans without the models present for comparison.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/31/stronger-cannabis-linked-to-rise-in-demand-for-drug-treatment-programmes","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T06:01:59Z","webTitle":"Stronger cannabis linked to rise in demand for drug treatment programmes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/31/stronger-cannabis-linked-to-rise-in-demand-for-drug-treatment-programmes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/31/stronger-cannabis-linked-to-rise-in-demand-for-drug-treatment-programmes","fields":{"headline":"Stronger cannabis linked to rise in demand for drug treatment programmes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Researchers have found fresh evidence to suggest that more potent strains of cannabis are at least partly to blame for the number of people seeking help from drug treatment programmes. Scientists at King’s College London drew on data from the Netherlands to show that admissions to specialist treatment centres rose when coffee shops sold increasingly more potent cannabis, but fell again when the cannabis weakened. The work is the first to investigate how admissions to drug treatment programmes rise and fall in line with the strength of cannabis available to users. It found that changes in demand for treatment typically lagged five to seven years behind changes to cannabis strength. “This is the first study to provide evidence for an association between changes in potency and health-related outcomes,” said Tom Freeman, an addiction scientist at King’s. The demand for specialist treatment among cannabis users has risen steadily in recent years, with more people now citing the drug on admission than any other illicit substance. In Europe, the number of first-time referrals for cannabis rose 53% from 2006 to 2014. Cannabis plants produce more than 100 active compounds called cannabinoids but THC, or delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, is largely responsible for the drug-related high. A second compound called CBD, or cannabidiol, appears to reduce some of the mental health risks linked to heavy cannabis use by counterbalancing the effects of THC. Many countries have seen far stronger cannabis come on to the market in the past few decades. A major survey in the US found that the strength of illicit cannabis rose from an average of 4% THC in 1995 to 12% in 2014. After two years of legal sales in Washington state, cannabis extracts containing nearly 70% THC now make up one-fifth of the market, researchers found last year. In Britain, the Home Office has not recorded cannabis strength since 2008 when high-strength skunk, containing 15% THC, accounted for 80% of the market. In work funded by the Society for the Study of Addiction, Freeman and others studied data gathered by the Trimbos Institute, a non-profit mental health and addiction organisation in the Netherlands. Each year, the institute conducts anonymous tests on cannabis for sale at a random selection of coffee shops in the country. Writing in the journal, Psychological Medicine, the researchers show that THC levels in cannabis soared from an average of 8.6% to 20.4% from 2000 to 2004, then slowly fell to 15.3% by 2015. When the researchers looked at the impact on drug treatment programmes, they found that first-time cannabis admissions nearly quadrupled from seven to 26 per 100,000 inhabitants from 2000 to 2010, and then dropped to less than 20 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. It means that for every 1% increase in THC, about 60 more people entered treatment. “We see a rapid increase in THC between 2000 and 2004 followed by a slower decline, and then you see a very similar profile in drug treatment admissions,” Freeman said. The rise in cannabis potency was one of a number of factors driving admissions to specialist drug services. Val Curran, professor of psychopharmacology at UCL, said: “This adds to a growing number of scientific studies which suggest rising THC potency of cannabis is associated with greater incidence of mental health problems including addiction and possibly psychosis.” But she added that stronger cannabis was not solely responsible for increasing demand for drug treatment. “Other factors include the marked decrease in levels of cannabidiol (CBD) in cannabis. There is evidence that CBD can protect against some mental health harms of THC,” she said. Ian Hamilton, a mental health lecturer at the University of York, agreed that other factors beyond the potency of the drug were important. “It is possible that seeking help for problems with cannabis has become more acceptable by users and treatment providers. Over the same period that cannabis referrals to treatment have been increasing, referrals for problems with opiates such as heroin have been in decline. So although cannabis has traditionally been viewed as relatively benign by treatment workers they may now be more inclined to offer support,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/30/bbc-women-hit-out-equal-pay-review-gender-bias","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T19:06:51Z","webTitle":"'Same old fudge': BBC women hit out at equal pay review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/30/bbc-women-hit-out-equal-pay-review-gender-bias","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/30/bbc-women-hit-out-equal-pay-review-gender-bias","fields":{"headline":"'Same old fudge': BBC women hit out at equal pay review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As word trickled through the BBC that a review of on-air pay commissioned by the corporation had found no evidence of gender bias on Tuesday morning, the WhatsApp groups and email threads of BBC women began to vibrate with increasing urgency. One on-air insider said: “BBC women have zero faith [in the report]. That’s certainly the general mood within the sisterhood this morning.” The BBC Women group, made up of more than 170 presenters and producers including Jane Garvey, Mishal Husain and Victoria Derbyshire, had already rebuked the BBC for not consulting the women involved. But after it dismissed the principal accusation that many women are illegally being paid less than their male counterparts to do the same job, the criticism grew sharper, with key figures suggesting the limited scope of the report rendered its findings meaningless. Garvey, a Woman’s Hour presenter, said: “At the risk of sounding cynical, it’s really hard to not reach the conclusion that they commissioned the report they wanted and it’s provided the result that they wanted.” In a statement, the group criticised the decision to only look at on-air news employees, which excluded many high earners, and stressed the need for “swift and meaningful” change for women in all roles. “The only mention of equal pay in the letter of engagement with PwC refers to an ‘assessment of equal pay risks’,” it said. Others went further, arguing that PricewaterhouseCoopers’ controversial decision to identify 98 men and 90 women who could get a pay rise would only entrench inequality. BBC Women provided 14 examples of women who described frustrating battles with managers over pay discrimination. “I have co-presented with a male colleague for many years ... I estimate he’s paid around double what I earn for doing the same job,” said one of the unnamed women in a typical submission. “I raised the equal pay issue many times over the years, but nothing was done.” One BBC presenter, who called the proposals a “retrofit” for an existing system, told the Guardian: “I think they have scored a massive own goal and it’s going to make it even more difficult for women to unpick the problem … Maybe that’s what they wanted. “It’s the same old bollocks, the same old fudge. I feel more depressed about it than at the start of the day. I feel I have more fighting to do, not less.” Tensions have been simmering at the corporation since the gulf in earnings between male and female top talent was exposed last summer. One woman in a senior off-air role said assurances given by Tony Hall, the director general, on Tuesday that the organisation was “determined to get it right” had left many cold. “It sounded so fantastic at the start […] but if you look at what is underneath that, there is nothing. It is emperor’s new clothes,” she said. Other attempts to tackle inequality and take the sting out of the story, such as a proposed £320,000 cap on news presenters’ salaries and the decision of six high-profile male presenters, including John Humphrys, to take a pay cut, were dismissed as diversionary tactics. Garvey said: “This has never been about men taking pay cuts. It’s about women earning several thousand pounds less than their male colleagues every year for doing exactly the same job. It may not be glamorous, but over a lifetime that makes a colossal difference.” Women within the corporation show little sign of being blown off course. They described formal and informal groups where stories, salaries and tactics were discussed. Female employees are also looking to their male colleagues to improve transparency in the organisation, with female staff looking for a male “buddy” doing the same job who is willing to speak to HR about pay discrepancy. Some women who have been raising issues around equal pay since the 1980s were delighted to have new recruits and new tools to address the problem, said one BBC Women member. “What’s been brilliant over the past year or so is that frankly, social media has allowed us to wage a collective battle, which tactically speaking would have been extraordinarily difficult in the past,” she said. The actions of Carrie Gracie, who resigned as China editor in protest against unequal remuneration after saying she could not collude in unlawful pay discrimination, are hailed as those of a hero, and staff spoke of appreciating high-profile names speaking out. Several also mentioned a solidarity between off-air lower profile employees and on-air household names. One presenter said: “By constantly referring to ‘on-air’ talent, the BBC is gambling that the public has no patience for people who earn large salaries. “But there are hundreds of low-paid producers who are deeply affected, but of course they haven’t been included in [the] PwC audit.” A news producer said: “Management’s focus on on-air is convenient because it makes it about a small group. There is a perception that they are ignoring us because we can’t make the same kind of noise.” Gender equality campaigners also found flaws with the report. “Paying men more than women @BBC is systemic discrimination not an ‘anomaly’. PWC report pointless. Numbers speak for themselves,” tweeted the Labour MP Harriet Harman. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said it left many questions unanswered. “We cannot see how the BBC can conclude that there is ‘no gender bias’ in the face of shocking stories from individual women, and what looks like large pay differences within jobs that the report does not explain,” she said. Many of the women the Guardian spoke to would only speak on condition of anonymity, with the majority unwilling to be seen as “bashing” an organisation they love. “It doesn’t have to be a ‘bash Auntie’ thing to say let’s do better,” said one. Despite reservations, Garvey said women had pulled together and spoken out in the hope that those in other organisations would also take action. “If it’s happening here, it’s happening everywhere, and people need to know that,” she said. “If it’s like this at the BBC, then God help everywhere else.” A senior off-air employee in news said that despite the disappointment, women were still hopeful things would change, and that they would not stop fighting. “If we don’t get a watershed moment we will all just carry on. We’ve done that for years and we’re not going to give up just because the zeitgeist moves on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/08/six-of-the-best-rice-bowls-japanese-tim-anderson-nanban","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T09:00:27Z","webTitle":"Six of the best rice bowl recipes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/08/six-of-the-best-rice-bowls-japanese-tim-anderson-nanban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/08/six-of-the-best-rice-bowls-japanese-tim-anderson-nanban","fields":{"headline":"Six of the best rice bowl recipes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For each recipe, you need 400g Japanese white rice, cooked by the absorption method: rinse the rice until the water runs clear, put in a saucepan with 520ml water, then cover with a lid and bring to a boil on a high heat. Listen to check that it’s boiling – do not remove the lid – then reduce the heat to low and simmer for five minutes, until the water has been absorbed. Remove the pan from the heat and let sit, still covered, for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes is up, gently stir up the rice and serve with your chosen recipe. Beef, onion and sweet soy (main picture) Gyudon – a humble bowl of beef on rice – is a bit like Japan’s answer to a burger. Cooking off the onions releases an irresistible “hotdog stand” aroma, so it’s comforting even before you tuck in. Sweet and beefy and savoury and satisfying. Prep 30 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 500g skirt, hanger or flank steak (or any other cheap and fairly lean cut) 2 tbsp oil 4 small onions, peeled and thinly sliced 2cm piece ginger, peeled and finely julienned 100ml soy sauce 100ml mirin 50g dark brown sugar 150ml beef stock 2 spring onions, sliced 40-50g red pickled ginger Toasted sesame seeds Put the beef in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up, then cut against the grain into very thin strips. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame, then add the onions and sweat, stirring, until they are soft and brown, about 10 minutes. Add the ginger and cook for a few minutes, to soften. Add the soy, mirin, sugar and stock, and cook until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency – about 10 minutes. Stir the beef through the sauce, and cook together for just a few more minutes, until the beef is no longer pink. Scoop the rice into deep bowls, top with the beef mixture, and garnish with spring onions, pickled ginger and sesame seeds. Chicken and egg This comforting recipe has a name (oyakodon) that is kind of cute and kind of disturbing if you translate it directly: “parent-and-child” rice bowl. Which, I suppose, is a little more poetic than chicken and egg. Whatever you call it, it’s very delicious. This doesn’t traditionally contain butter or mushrooms, but I find the combination of butter, eggs, mushrooms and sweet soy irresistible. Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 80g butter 2 onions, peeled and thinly sliced 4 boned and skinned chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces 100g shiitake mushrooms, destemmed and thinly sliced 200ml chicken stock 3 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp mirin 1 tbsp sugar 8 eggs 2 spring onions, thinly sliced 1 pinch chilli powder Melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat, then add the onions and cook until they soften and brown – about 10 minutes. Add the chicken and mushrooms, and cook for another five to 10 minutes, until these brown as well. Pour in the stock, soy, mirin and sugar, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the liquid reduces and coats the chicken. Lower the heat and crack in the eggs. Break the yolks and stir gently. When cooked to a semi-scrambled consistency, take off the heat. Scoop the rice into deep bowls, top with the chicken and egg mixture, and garnish with spring onions and chilli powder. Salmon poké Poké, arguably the state dish of Hawaii, is having a moment in the UK. Although it isn’t a Japanese preparation, the combination of raw fish, soy sauce and sesame oil will please any fans of sushi or sashimi. Prep 15 min Cook 10 min Serves 4 4 limes, zested and juiced 1 small red chilli, thinly sliced 4 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp sesame oil 1 tbsp sugar 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 small onion, peeled and diced Salt 500-600g very fresh boneless salmon 1 ripe avocado ½ cucumber 50g samphire (optional) 100g cherry tomatoes, halved 2 tbsp wakame (or similar dried seaweed), rehydrated 40g macadamia nuts, toasted and roughly chopped Toasted sesame seeds 2 spring onions, finely sliced Make the dressing: stir together the lime juice and zest, chilli, soy, sesame oil, sugar and vinegar. Toss the diced onion with a big pinch of salt and leave to sit while you get on with everything else. Cut the salmon into 2.5cm cubes, and cut the avocado and cucumber into 1cm cubes. Break the samphire (if using) into bite-sized pieces, discarding any woody bits. Rinse the salted onion thoroughly under cold water, then mix with the salmon, vegetables, seaweed and dressing. You can serve it up immediately but, if you have the time, it’s better if left to marinate for at least an hour. To serve, scoop the rice into dishes and top with the salmon mixture. Garnish with the macadamia nuts, sesame seeds and spring onions. Mapo tofu Lately I’ve been obsessed with this dish. It’s a Sichuan classic that marries the silky-soft blandness of tofu with bold, spiky hot-and-numbing Sichuan flavours. Although it is a tofu dish, it isn’t actually vegetarian because of the inclusion of pork mince for flavour and texture, but you can use mushrooms instead and it’s still pretty good. Prep 10 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 700g firm or extra-firm silken tofu, cut into 2.5cm cubes 2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns 2 tbsp oil 2 anchovy fillets (optional) 1 finger or bird’s eye chilli (or more, to taste), finely sliced 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 10g ginger (peeled weight), finely shredded 300g pork mince (or 400g shiitake mushrooms, destemmed and diced) 1 tbsp preserved black beans 80g doubanjiang or gochujang paste (available from many Asian and online supermarkets) 1½ tbsp sugar 500ml chicken or vegetable stock 1½ tbsp corn flour, mixed with a little water Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce, to taste 1 handful coriander leaves, roughly torn Toasted sesame seeds Bring a medium pot of salted water to a simmer, carefully drop in the tofu (it’s very delicate), poach for 10 minutes, then gently lift out with a slotted spoon. Toast the Sichuan peppercorns in a dry frying pan until aromatic, leave to cool, then grind to a coarse powder and set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan, add the anchovy (if using) and chilli, and fry for two or three minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and pork (or mushrooms), and fry until the pork is browned, then add the black beans, gochujang (or doubanjiang)paste, sugar and Sichuan pepper and cook for a few minutes, stirring often, so the flavours meld. Add the stock, bring to a boil, then stir in some of the corn flour mix. Let the sauce boil and thicken (add more corn flour if you want it thicker). Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with Worcestershire or soy, then gently stir in the tofu to coat. To serve, scoop the rice into deep bowls, top with the tofu mixture and garnish with coriander and sesame seeds. Japanese curry gratin This obscure dish of Japanese curry topped with molten cheese is a speciality of the port city of Mojiko, in the south of the country. Nobody really knows how it became so ubiquitous there, but it’s generally believed that one restaurant invented it, and dozens of others simply copied it after seeing how popular it was. Prep 10 min Cook 50 min Serves 4 3-4 carrots, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces ½ cauliflower, broken into bite-sized pieces 500g potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5cm cubes 4 tbsp oil, plus extra to coat the vegetables Salt 250g onion, diced 15g ginger (peeled weight), minced 1 green chilli, finely chopped 6 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped ½ green apple, peeled and grated ½ banana, roughly chopped 30g mild madras curry powder 2 tbsp garam masala 750ml chicken stock 60g butter 6 tbsp plain flour 2 tbsp ketchup 2 tbsp soy sauce 100g cheddar, grated Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Toss the carrots, cauliflower and potatoes in oil and salt, then roast in a casserole for 40 minutes, until soft and brown. Then lift out of the dish and set aside. Heat four tablespoons of oil in a deep saucepan, add the onion, ginger and chilli, and fry until the onions are soft and brown. Add the garlic and cook until it softens, then add the tomatoes, apple and banana, and cook until soft. Add the spices and cook for a few minutes, stirring all the time, until they turn aromatic. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Boil for about 10 minutes, for the flavours to come together, then transfer to a blender and processuntil smooth. In another pan, melt the butter, add the flour and stir until the mixture turns amber in colour. Add the curry sauce and whisk to thicken. Add the ketchup and soy sauce, taste, and adjust the seasoning with more salt, as needed. Scoop the rice into the casserole dish, top with the roasted veg, then the sauce and finally the cheese. Put under a high grill until the cheese melts and starts to brown. Sweet miso-grilled aubergine Nasu dengaku don is one of the most popular of all Japanese dishes. The fudgy texture and earthy flavour of the aubergine is a perfect vehicle for the moreish dengaku (sweet miso) sauce. The pine nuts and pomegranate seeds are not traditional, but they add a lovely, textural contrast to the nutty-sweet flavour of the aubergine. Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 4 aubergines (or 2 if they’re really big) Oil, for shallow frying 150g miso (white or red are both OK, but avoid anything very dark) 3 tbsp mirin 3 tbsp sugar 1 ½ tbsp water ¾ tsp vinegar 30g pine nuts, toasted 40g pomegranate seeds Cut the aubergines in half lengthways and score the flesh in a diamond pattern about 0.5cm deep. Pour enough oil into a deep frying pan to come 1cm up the sides, and heat over a medium flame. Add the aubergines and cook on both sides until the flesh has browned and softened and the skin goes glossy and brittle. Carefully lift out and drain on a plate lined with kitchen towel. Stir together the miso, mirin, sugar, water and vinegar, then spoon this over the scored side of each aubergine half. Put the dressed aubergines under a hot grill for five to 10 minutes, until bubbly and caramelised, then cut into bite-size pieces. Scoop the rice into bowls, top with the aubergines, and garnish with the pine nuts and pomegranate seeds. Tim Anderson is chef/owner of Nanban in Brixton, London SW2.

Bennell has admitted seven offences of sexual abuse but denies another 48 counts relating to 11 boys from 1979 to 1990. He appeared via video link at Liverpool crown court on Tuesday as the latest former player gave evidence, alleging he was raped seven to 10 times. The former player, once affiliated to Crewe Alexandra, where Bennell was also a coach, said he had been one of the six complainants when the accused was convicted of previous sexual offences in 1997, but was too embarrassed to reveal details of the more serious assaults to the police at the time. He changed his mind after Andy Woodward came forward in November 2016 about being another of Bennell’s victims and, now in his 40s, alleges he was abused more than 100 times from the age of 11 to 14 during the 1980s. “I’ve been carrying this around in my head for the last 30 years,” he said. “I had some kind of closure in 1997. But 20 years on, I had the chance [to give the full story]. I wouldn’t have done it if Andy Woodward hadn’t done it. And even when it’s over, it won’t be over because it’s still in my head. “Unless you’ve been raped multiple times, been abused God knows how many times, you can’t stand up there and tell me what I’m thinking or feeling, or how it’s affected my life. And him, smirking on the screen, denying everything – he’s shown no remorse ever. Even the stuff he’s admitted to, he’s never given one apology and he still sits there.” In a statement read to the jury, the player’s father said Bennell had no close adult friends at Crewe. He was seen as a Peter Pan-figure because of the way he made himself attractive to boys, including keeping a spider monkey called Gizmo. The father said he once challenged Bennell about his relationship with the boys. “I heard Barry had an altercation with a group of boys. Someone had accused him of inappropriate behaviour. On hearing this, I wanted to challenge him directly. I recall pulling him to one side and informing him what I had heard. I told him I wanted him to say something to quash my fears and I recall he gave me a reasonable response.” Earlier, the former player told the jury that most of the assaults took place at Bennell’s house, but others were carried out on a trip to Southampton, when the team slept together in a sports hall, and a holiday to the Canary Islands. Bennell, he said, had taken his girlfriend on the holiday but came into the bed he was sharing with another boy while she was in the shower. Describing one of the attacks, he alleged Bennell had found it amusing and “giggled arrogantly” when he saw the boy’s distress. “He just got up and started laughing at me. He cleaned himself up, went downstairs [to the other boys] and said nothing, as if nothing had happened. It was the worst I’ve ever felt in my life.” He said Bennell continued to abuse him until, aged 14, on one overnight stop when his abuser shouted for him to come to his room, he called back that he did not want it happening any more. “He said one line which has lived with me for the rest of my life. He gave me a look and said: ‘You must enjoy it,’ and gave me a smirk as he said it. I said, no, I didn’t enjoy it and turned my back, went into the bunk beds. That’s when I decided: ‘This is it, no more’ and I think he realised it as well.” Bennell, he said, followed him into the room anyway to abuse him. In his police statements, Bennell admitted abusing the boy, along with another young Crewe player, in the same bed but said it stopped when he was challenged by the player giving evidence on Tuesday. “One day he said to me: ‘Is that all you want me for?’ The shock was massive for me. I was totally gobsmacked, really taken aback. I was really scared because I was thinking he might say something. Part of me was scared. It was very hard because I had nobody to talk to.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/01/hookworms-microshift-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"Hookworms: Microshift review – vast leap forward into a psychedelic future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/hookworms-microshift-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/01/hookworms-microshift-review","fields":{"headline":"Hookworms: Microshift review – vast leap forward into a psychedelic future","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Artists often have a tendency to make heavy weather out of recording albums. We’ve all read the features, invariably headlined TO HELL AND BACK, replete with loudly expressed comparisons to “being in the trenches”, “on the last helicopter out of Saigon” or to scenes of unimaginable terror and desperation it usually turns out were provoked by taking some drugs, occasionally arguing over the mixing and overrunning their allotted time in the studio. But by anyone’s standards, the making of Hookworms’ third album was a fraught affair, affected by everything from extreme weather events – their Leeds studio was almost destroyed in a flood – to physical and mental illness: frontman Matthew Johnson has always been open about his struggle with depression. Anyone familiar with Hookworms’ previous releases may think they know what to expect musically from Microshift. A band with modest commercial ambitions – the quintet have no management and have declined to give up their day jobs to pursue music full-time – they have nevertheless attracted critical acclaim by honing a dark, fraught, fuzz-drenched sound, equally rooted in the cyclical repetitions of krautrock and Spacemen 3 as the roaring noise of US post-hardcore punk. It has often attracted the label “psychedelic”, but if it recalls music from the 60s at all, it isn’t the beatific relax-and-float-downstream soundtrack of the Summer of Love, but the more obscure and disturbing stuff that came just before it. Emotionally, at least, their first two albums seemed more in tune with the frenzied, hyper-distorted freakbeat tracks by the Buzz and the Syndicats that Joe Meek produced during his final descent into psychosis. Similarly, the flop singles made by hard-hitting mod bands who responded to LSD not with codified flower-power platitudes, but tumultuous, chaotic music that sounded overwhelmed, even terrified by the experience: the Game’s Help Me, Mummy’s Gone or the Voice’s The Train to Disaster. Given the circumstances of Microshift’s creation, more of the same, only more so, seems a given. But it isn’t. From its opening seconds – when a track called Negative Space kicks into life with a rhythm track influenced by early 80s electro – it becomes clear that Hookworms have done the opposite of what you might reasonably assume. Microshift is a vast and extremely bold sonic leap forward. The thick crust of distortion that coated their earlier releases has been removed, revealing two startling finds previously buried deep within it. The first is that Johnson, an unwilling frontman apparently so underwhelmed by his own vocal abilities that he went out of his way to conceal them, has a fantastic voice, yearning, open, unaffected and really powerful, capable of delivering a succession of starkly affecting lyrical sucker punches. Frequently hemmed in by his own misery – “I’m feeling awful,” he sings on Static Resistance, “I can’t last the distance” – he keeps willing himself to go on nonetheless: “Just let it all out, don’t fall under,” cautions Opener. The second is Hookworms’ melodic facility. Easy to miss amid the tumultuous, echoing din of their debut, Pearl Mystic, and its 2014 successor, The Hum, it suddenly finds itself in the spotlight. Opener is a tight, tough pop song underpinned by a Kraftwerk-ish rhythm track that gradually unfurls into a joyous climax; closer Shortcomings has a fabulous chorus; The Soft Season is beautiful in a way that nothing they’ve recorded before has been: spectral, and spectacular with it. For all the broadening of their sound, not everything has changed. The bass and drums still regularly settle into a forceful, wired, Neu!-like groove, the organ still plays two-chord patterns that recall Suicide by way of Spacemen 3, and something of the ambience of their earlier work hangs over the murky Boxing Day, its monotone vocal interrupted by bursts of noise that sound like samples grabbed at random from a free jazz album. The grasp of dynamics that makes their live shows such powerful, cathartic affairs is still much in evidence: Ullswater’s awkward time signature lends a sense of unease to its epic, sweeping sound; songs elide into each other via passages of shimmering synthesizer tones; Negative Space is gradually lost beneath an electronic swirl. The world is full of noisy left-field art-rock bands grumpily protesting in interviews that of course they could write pop songs if they wanted to: as it turns out, Hookworms genuinely can. Moreover, they can do it without losing any of the potency or essence of their past work. Microshift manages to be both their most accessible work and their most intense: the sound of an already powerful band gaining not just clarity, but focus. This week Alexis listened to … Felt – Vasco Da Gama From the forthcoming reissues of Felt’s peerless 80s catalogue, a beautiful song that captures their expertise at conjuring up an atmosphere of reflective, mid-afternoon melancholy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/31/internet-usage-worrying-hard-to-manage","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T15:00:55Z","webTitle":"My internet usage is getting harder to manage and worrying me.

What should I do?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My online community is bad for me. What can I do? The internet is a blessing and a curse. It allows you to be everywhere, all the time. As one interviewee put it: “My distractions used to be external. Now they’re in my hand.” At the heart of many internet problems is the paralysing effect of too much choice. Constant online interaction may cure loneliness, but can result in an inability to develop relationships offline. I’ve spoken to grown men who watched porn in their teens, in the hope of becoming good lovers, only to find themselves uninterested in the real thing later in life. Young women have spoken to me about searching for motivation in online role models – from fitness gurus to beautiful celebrities – and instead find themselves crippled with insecurities and demotivated. Dr Matt Shorrock, clinical director at the International Centre for Internet Addiction, suggests criteria to identify if your internet behaviour is problematic: if it stops you going about your everyday business; consistently compromises your real-life relationships; or causes you distress, anxiety or irritation, it may be time to cut down. So too, if you find yourself crossing your own ethical boundaries or putting yourself at risk of prosecution – for example by looking at illegal porn, or trolling. These things are not always so clear-cut in real life. Technology exploits our desires for community and status. Professionals can build a following online that enhances their status, even land them a job. Children can be lured in by a basic desire for friendship, like the 10-year-old I spoke to who was scared to go on a camping trip in case she ruined her snapstreak – a score built up from consecutive days spent sending videos between her and her best friend. There are tools to curb your online usage. One interviewee proclaimed she was no millennial, before going through every device she uses to block apps and internet usage on her phone. One shows how many times she has checked her phone, and how many minutes she has spent on it, which she says makes her feel “disgusting” – as did the coveting of brands on Instagram that led her to using the app blockers in the first place. I wondered whether one technology replaced another in driving her self-criticism. Shorrock says some internet usage problems could stem from loneliness, bullying, a lack of fulfilment, or unmet childhood needs. There is another way of saying this: our online problems originate from ourselves, not the internet. So if you are finding your online community hard to manage, start with yourself and work outwards. • What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

On Tuesday morning, the attorney general, Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb , announced the end of a three-month investigation that ensnared some of the kingdom’s best-known figures, who were alleged to have siphoned off billions from state revenues. He said 400bn riyals had been forfeited by as many as 325 people detained in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, where their personal finances were examined by forensic accountants. The figure, which is impossible to verify, included the value of real estate, business, cash, shares and other assets that many of those detained had signed over during negotiations with the state. It is more than double estimates made by senior Saudi officials in the early days of the operation, which was ordered by King Salman and launched by his son and heir, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince. The saga has shaken the establishment of the conservative kingdom, removing protections from powerful figures who had long benefited from systemic corruption that riddled business dealings and all levels of governance for decades. Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men, was released from detention at the weekend after coming to an agreement with state officials. In an interview with Reuters before his release from a hotel suite purported to have been his home for the past three months, the prominent investor in Newscorp, Apple and Twitter described the situation as a “misunderstanding” and denied allegations of corruption. His detention, and that of others including the former head of the Saudi royal court, Khaled al-Tuwaijri, has sorely tested alliances between the ruling Saud family and other powerful clans, who have collectively stewarded the modern kingdom for decades. Dozens of those detained were from some of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent families, who had been considered untouchable during decades flushed with oil revenue, and have been left aggrieved by the arrests. But as the kingdom’s wealth shrank under the strain of structurally lower oil prices and a costly war in Yemen, the country’s powerful heir sought ways to regenerate the moribund economy and shake up a society that had become accustomed to unchecked privilege, with next to no scrutiny. A member of a leading family, whose relative was released from the Ritz Carlton earlier this month, said: “[The crown prince has] been prepared to take on the role of change agent. “He has learned from [Jared] Kushner and [Donald] Trump that if you overwhelm people with change, you will stun them, and therefore be able to get things done.” Two other prominent Saudi figures who spoke to the Guardian said most senior officials would in future need to do business on a more transparent footing. However, a much smaller number of senior figures would be allowed to continue to shield their affairs from public accountability. Two years before the purge, Mohammed, then 29, bought a $500m yacht and a new-build chateau outside Paris for $300m – the world’s most expensive home. In November, he was claimed to be the buyer of a $450.3m Leonardo da Vinci painting. Abu Dhabi’s culture department later said it had made the purchase but the claim was met with scepticism in the kingdom, where a prince with strong connections to the international art world had brokered the sale. His critics have claimed his spending remains extravagant at a time in which other senior officials face relative austerity. Mohammed has at the same time been trying to push through sweeping cultural reforms, removing rigidly conservative social norms that have severely limited women’s role in Saudi society for decades and promoted a hardline version of Sunni Islam, which has been used by extremist groups to underwrite terrorism. The pace of change has shredded the long maintained view that it must be drip-fed to a reluctant Saudi society. Since late last year, concerts – albeit for men only – have been held in Riyadh, and women have been allowed into sports stadiums, and will be allowed to drive cars from this summer. Guardianship laws restricting women’s movements have been weakened and the feared religious police have lost the power to arrest. Laws governing fraternisation between men and women who are not related have also been loosened. The Ritz Carlton is expected to open to tourists in mid-February. While detained, senior figures were given access to dining rooms, gyms, tailors and medics. The world’s most luxurious jail was run in such a way as to not further upset already offended clans, who would not have tolerated their family members being sent to a prison. Claims that detainees had been tortured or shackled were false. The fate of the remaining 56 who did not reach terms with investigators remains unclear. The family member of the former detainee said speculation had been rife inside the Ritz Carlton that those who remained would be transferred to a state-run prison, opening a new phase in the ruling family’s relations with the country’s reluctant elite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/01/den-of-thieves-review-gerard-butler-50-cent","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Den of Thieves review – musclebound cops-and-robbers face-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/01/den-of-thieves-review-gerard-butler-50-cent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/01/den-of-thieves-review-gerard-butler-50-cent","fields":{"headline":"Den of Thieves review – musclebound cops-and-robbers face-off","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s been 23 years since Michael Mann’s landmark LA crime opus Heat alchemised pulp into gleaming screen spectacle, raising the possibility an entire generation has gone unaware of the symbiotic cops-and-robbers trope. Writer-director Christian Gudegast here leaps into that demographic gap with a film that falls somewhere between Mann fan art and an extended upgrade of those late-90s knock-offs with titles such as City of Industry and Body Count. The script, co-credited to Prison Break mastermind Paul Scheuring, outlines yet another mirrored face-off. On one side, jacked and tatted outlaws – headed by Orange is the New Black’s Pablo Schreiber – who have the audacity to steal an empty armoured van for reasons initially unclear; opposite them, jacked and tatted detectives, headed by all-drinkin’, ever-smokin’ bad boy Gerard Butler, some indication of where we are in relation to the film’s obvious inspiration. It has a few new angles (50 Cent uses Schreiber’s heavies to unsettle his daughter’s prom date), and some of its hand-me-downs remain eye-catching: the decision to shoot LA as a living, working environment isn’t remotely original, but appeals nevertheless. Other cribs – such as Butler’s relationship with his soon-to-be-ex (Dawn Olivieri), a flat Xerox of Mann’s Pacino-Diane Venora business – yield chuckles, however, and the generally hopped-up, steroidal approach can be seen in an insistence that its antagonists coincide every quarter-hour, in sushi bars, firing ranges, even a shared lover’s parlour. Analogue in its effects, it’s the kind of throwback that may just win over video-shop nostalgists – though they’ll still have to plough through hunks of unleavened cliche, a dumb-as-nuts final flourish, and so much pec-flexing and armed alpha willy-waggling it often resembles a men’s rights bonding weekend more than it does a movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/04/the-gospel-of-jack-guinness-the-queer-bible","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"Jack Guinness and the queer bible: “If brands have a problem with a gay guy, I don’t want to work with them”","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/04/the-gospel-of-jack-guinness-the-queer-bible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/04/the-gospel-of-jack-guinness-the-queer-bible","fields":{"headline":"Jack Guinness and the queer bible: “If brands have a problem with a gay guy, I don’t want to work with them”","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If your guilty pleasure is scrolling through celebrity party photos, you’ll have seen the model Jack Guinness frowning through an immaculate beard, with one arm around Alexa Chung or Daisy Lowe or Pixie Geldof. And you’ll have expected him, as he so charmingly puts it: “To be a total arsehole.” In the flesh, though, he’s as slapstick as Benny Hill on a milk float. Watch his Instagram stories from backstage at fashion shows in Paris or Milan, where he pretends to be “David Fashionborough”, musing on the zoology of these rare species “without a single thought in their heads”, and you’ll wonder how he gets away with it, or why he doesn’t have his own TV show yet. Yet this is not the biggest disconnect in Guinness’s identity because, after 10 years becoming one of the best-known Brits in fashion (working with brands including Gucci, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Dunhill and Barbour), being described by GQ magazine as “the coolest man in London” and popularising the man bun (“for which I’d like to officially apologise”), he has launched a website called the Queer Bible. At the same time he came out. The Queer Bible is a beautiful online magazine, using mainly queer writers and illustrators to discuss their heroes. “I wanted to honour all the trailblazers who have fought for my rights on my behalf,” says Guinness. “The ones everybody has heard of, but also some of the overlooked characters.” So Robert Mapplethorpe and Oscar Wilde might be covered, but you’ve also got the choreographer Theo Adams discussing why a trans Turkish pop diva is so beloved of men in kebab shops. Guinness unveiled the Queer Bible in December 2017, revealing that, alongside the photoshoots and the parties, he had secretly been working on this project since 2016, when the singer Sam Smith was laughed at for thinking he was the first gay person to win an Oscar. “And he wasn’t even the first gay person to win that Oscar – then he got destroyed online for his ignorance and had to leave Twitter. But I took it as a challenge. I thought, well, it’s tempting to join in mocking the poor bloke, but do I know my own gay history? I looked at the resources online and I felt that there was a gap. And it was this.” You would have thought that, for Guinness, being a gay guy in fashion would hardly be revolutionary. And yet it really is. The advertising of mainstream male fashion, though somewhat homoerotic to some eyes, apparently all hinges on heteronormativity. Models such as Jack must, he says, “represent a certain kind of masculinity” in their private life. Perhaps it’s the facial hair that has led to so many photoshoots where he has to “sail boats, climb mountains, chop wood – basically whatever couldn’t be further from my natural interests”, but this public image has meant he had to keep quiet about having a boyfriend. He won’t name problematic brands, but insists that he was regularly told by agents and bookers “awful things that you wouldn’t believe, and always not to let the clients find out I was gay, not to mention it on a shoot, not to say anything to the press, or this would all end,” he says. “I remember one agent, who used to be a model booker, and she said: ‘Oh, if we found out a model was gay, we’d just drop him straightaway!’ Laughing like I was supposed to say, ‘Haha, great!’ “I just thought: ‘Wow, that’s insane that you think it’s OK to say that to me.’ It made me really angry. “I’ve been so excited by the fact that brands do still want to work with me,” he adds. It’s early days, though, and the backlash was almost immediate. The day after he launched the site and put a video on his own Instagram to tell his 50k followers about it, a client rang him, “and made insinuations that – well, let’s just say that if it was about my ethnic identity, it would definitely have been racist”. He is now represented by the model agency Elite, who are “incredibly supportive”, he says. “Whenever I’m hesitant about something they’re the ones going: ‘No, you have to really go for it.’ I cannot tell you how encouraging that’s been…” He interrupts himself. “This feels so silly to talk about, like we’re in the 1980s and coming out is still a thing. But it is still a thing.” What makes this kind of bible even more poignant to Guinness is that he was raised under the other one, as his dad is a vicar. “So this is also about the idea of gay people being squeezed out of religious spaces,” he says. “This isn’t just a guide to queer life – we’re creating something special.” He had held back on doing something like this publicly because, he says: “I had a lot of stuff to work through with my own family first.” He keeps stressing that he knows he’s a privileged white guy who has nothing to moan about. But he also admits, in a joking voice that belies something more serious, that “I have the weight of generations of priests upon me”. “At the start of my career everyone assumed I was one of the loaded Guinnesses,” he says. “But Arthur Guinness had five or six sons and the three strands of the family came down from there. There’s the brewing side, the banking side who got into trouble in the 1980s, then there’s the religious side. So my dad, my grandad and my great-grandad were all vicars, and all of their brothers were vicars, too.” He grew up first in a flat attached to a vicarage in Brixton, in a “really ethnically diverse church. It was during the Brixton riots. It was like a sitcom in our front room. On Christmas Day we would have 30 people in our house. When the hurricane hit, people lived with us for months after that. We didn’t have much money, but we were middle class, while the kids next door were in serious poverty – Marmite sandwiches for Christmas lunch. And then after that my dad moved to Belgravia and he became Margaret Thatcher’s vicar.” Sorry, what? Thatcher had left Downing Street and she worshipped in your church? “I don’t know if ‘worship’ is the right word,” he says, a wicked glint in his eye. “She stood up and sat down at the right times. Put her hands together.” The youngest of three children and dyslexic, Guinness went to a wide variety of schools and stopped altogether for some months due to anxiety. He failed half of his GCSEs, so his family were completely stunned when he aced his A-Levels and got into Cambridge to read English literature, which he found “pretty stressful, because I was still the same kid who wasn’t robust enough for school. Everyone at Cambridge has a slightly manic episode at some point. I don’t know anyone there who didn’t go a bit weird. But looking on the bright side,” he adds, the glint returning to his eye, “you do get to meet some really incredible people who can make you feel inadequate for the rest of your life!” Back in London, he moved into a shared flat with his friend, Clare. The other occupant was Alexa Chung. “I was the weird new house mate, like Spike in Notting Hill – I slept in the living room. Alexa was doing T4 and her work ethic was insane – people have no idea how hard she works. She’d come home from shooting, take her script up to her bedroom, memorise it and then be up at 5am to shoot again the next day. She’s one of the few people I phone up to ask advice from: she always knows what to do.” Now he lives in another shared flat, “a proper, actual warehouse, not a done-up bachelor pad. It’s a shithole. I’ve had to become amazing at DIY and I don’t mean putting up some nice shelves, I mean fixing boilers, and killing spiders the size of my head.” He’s thrown so many parties there, from behind a second-hand bar he bought from a junk seller he befriended on the street, that his friends have printed up T-shirts saying: “I Lost My Mind At Jack’s Bar.” This morning he bathed in hot water from the kettle, after the heating packed up again. “The flat might look great in photos, but in reality it’s falling apart.” He pauses for comic timing. “A bit like me.” Will the party be over now he’s launched the Queer Bible? He knows it’s all a risk, but remembers the words of George Michael. “His response to all that was: I don’t want anyone who has a problem with gay people buying my records, they can fuck off! If there are brands out there that have a problem with a gay guy, I don’t want to work with them.” thequeerbible.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"games/2018/feb/06/dreams-the-video-game-that-unlocks-creative-genius-littlebigplanet-media-molecules-littlebigplanet","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T16:38:54Z","webTitle":"Dreams: the video game that unlocks the suppressed artist within us all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/06/dreams-the-video-game-that-unlocks-creative-genius-littlebigplanet-media-molecules-littlebigplanet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/feb/06/dreams-the-video-game-that-unlocks-creative-genius-littlebigplanet-media-molecules-littlebigplanet","fields":{"headline":"Dreams: the video game that unlocks the creative genius within us all","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Most homes hide abandoned easels, guitars and origami kits, all bought with good intentions to express the latent creativity that grownup life can easily stifle. You might want to unlock it, but the effort is too intimidating. Media Molecule, a game developer based in Guildford, believes that video games can help. A studio populated by artists, musicians and creatives of all stripes, it is best known for the successful LittleBigPlanet games – cheerful adventures with a hand-crafted look and a novel “play, create, share” philosophy, letting players remix the levels and make their own. Taking this idea further, Media Molecule has spent the past five years working on Dreams, a PlayStation 4 game that lets players create and share little worlds. Due for release later this year, the game offers a potential for creativity beyond what any other video game has attempted. Within a virtual art studio, you can sculpt landscapes, objects or animals, compose music, build houses, train stations or deserts with a PlayStation controller, then drop in to what you’ve just made and walk around in it as though stepping into your own painting. You can create a roaring dinosaur, a game level with moving platforms and monsters, and your own playable characters with which to confront them. An impressionistic art style, which works a little like an Instagram filter on everything you create, makes even the roughest sketches look dreamlike and interesting: a studio maxim during Dreams’ development has been: “think Henson, not Pixar.” It is a little like playing your own thoughts – or, thanks to sharing via the internet, someone else’s. Minecraft, like Lego, lets you assemble things from the building blocks you are given. Dreams lets you create those building blocks. “Children are born free. They don’t have any preconception of what they’re good and bad at,” says Kareem Ettouney, Media Molecule’s art director, who spent his early career bouncing between different art, design and architecture disciplines. “You give them a crayon, they will draw. No child will tell you, ‘Oh no, I am not talented.’ Talent is an adult concept. It came from us measuring and labelling results rather than enjoyment. “The concept in Dreams is to try to rehabilitate people to the fact that all areas of creativity are available to you. Technology has reached a point where we are at a crossroads of self-expression; there might be a renaissance coming, and people are ready. It’s the tools that are not.” If you want to create things digitally using the tools currently on offer, whether it’s a painting, a game or a film, there comes a point where you have to learn complicated software: Illustrator and Photoshop for artists, 3DMax and Maya for 3D artists, Premier for video editing, Logic Pro for music, Unity to make video games. This is where a lot of people hit a wall. The gap between doodling in a school sketchbook and using an expensive tablet to create imagery in Photoshop is just too wide. Dreams aims to narrow the gap between what you do with your hands, or a paintbrush, and what you do with a computer. Sculpting with a PlayStation controller makes intuitive sense, like working with clay in a virtual space. Making music or adding functionality to the game world – such as doors that open when a switch is pressed, or characters that smile and say something when approached – uses the same interface, and it is effortless to switch from one to the other, maintaining a creative flow. Watching Kareem use Dreams to conjure a barren landscape with a gigantic neon city on the edge of it in the space of 20 minutes, I see what Dreams’ tools are capable of in the hands of someone accomplished. Carving a path out of a mountain with a streak of blue, he animates it with a couple of button presses and it becomes a waterfall. The average player won’t be able to create something so convincing so quickly, but crucially, learning how to create things in Dreams is fun in itself. Watching somebody play it, all you want to do is get your hands on the controller and start tinkering away yourself. “I’m one of those people who fell off the wagon creatively after university,” says Siobhan Reddy, Media Molecule’s studio director. “I became a producer, so most of my day I am not building things, I’m managing things. Dreams has given me a way back in. Dreams is very much about your senses, which is what making music and art is about, not battling an interface. We are trying to bring the things that we know about creating with our hands, ears and eyes into the digital world. It has democratised the ability to make little games.” Reddy says she’s started to use Dreams to tell stories: “I don’t even know where they’re coming from. I made a game about having a hangover after our Christmas party – it uses a lot of motion blur, with someone asking if you want a coffee. I’ve made a noir story about a grasshopper; I made a thing about Sydney harbour when I was really homesick. It’s very expressive for me. If that can happen to me, it can happen to others. It’s the least intimidating way to bring back my love of making things, because I’m able to get quite far with just a little knowledge.” Everything created in Dreams can be uploaded to its giant virtual library. Say someone sculpts a particularly beautiful antique table; it might appear in hundreds of other people’s worlds. Dreams encourages collaboration almost by necessity, as nobody but a genius could make everything from animated characters to music to pretty trees from scratch. People building their own games will have a vast pool of inspiration to draw from. Players who don’t want to make their own things can simply play with other people’s, surfing through different worlds on the couch. However, Dreams challenges the idea of a video game as something that is passively consumed. “I don’t think the desire to create goes away. Everyone retains it in some form,” says David Smith, one of the studio’s co-founders and technical director. “When you choose what clothes you wear, what music you listen to, these are creative acts. They are human, important acts. I think we place limitations on ourselves as we get older – we get more scared of failure, or we just have less time to invest 100 hours in something to see if it pays off. To learn to play the violin you need hundreds of hours before you can make a sound that isn’t awful. What you want is a violin that sounds OK to begin with, but you can get better and better at.” Media Molecule’s aim with Dreams is to combine the rewarding, collaborative, sensory experience of offline creativity with the advantages that video game technology offers: sharing, interactivity and the exchange of knowledge. Dreams is designed not only to make people want to create things, but to make them believe that they can. Dreams will be released on Sony’s PlayStation 4 later this year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/02/field-music-open-here-album-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T09:00:46Z","webTitle":"Field Music: Open Here review – grand masterclass in terrific tune-making","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/02/field-music-open-here-album-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/02/field-music-open-here-album-review","fields":{"headline":"Field Music: Open Here review – grand masterclass in terrific tune-making","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If critical acclaim could be exchanged for cash, Field Music would be buying big houses in the country.

Jerky, post-punk rhythms happily coexist with baroque orchestrations, arena drum sounds, flute-like keyboards, jazz chord progressions, gear-changing time signatures and the pastoral gentility of early 1970s folk or the gentler end of prog. The brothers’ lyrical concerns have an equally singular vision. Checking on a Message stays up late for the Brexit referendum result (“wishing it wasn’t true“). Count It Up considers so-called democracy (“power … for the good of somebody else”) and the cost of privilege. Goodbye to the Country is a sweetly vitriolic state of the nation address. Conversely, parenthood looms large in Daylight Saving (a lovely discourse on the romantic impact of exhaustion: “We might get it back … not now, not yet”) and the guitar jangling No King No Princess (how gender division starts with baby clothes). The driving, funky, sax-honking Share a Pillow could even be their belated answer to David Bowie circa Fame, with Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl drumbeat, were it not a touching ode to struggling to get a child to sleep. Everything comes bundled up in sumptuous production, with terrific tunes, and there’s never long to wait for a killer hook. Short of running naked through the streets of Sunderland, it’s hard to know what else they can do to alert a wider public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/31/buy-to-let-mortgage-flat-tenants-lease","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Do I need a buy-to-let mortgage to get a flat with tenants still there?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/31/buy-to-let-mortgage-flat-tenants-lease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/31/buy-to-let-mortgage-flat-tenants-lease","fields":{"headline":"Do I need a buy-to-let mortgage to get a flat with tenants still there?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Q I want to buy a flat, and I am a first- time buyer. The owner put the property on the market in October, but has agreed a new 12-month lease with his tenants, so the tenancy won’t expire until December 2018. I want to buy this flat to live in, but am not sure if, because there are tenants living there, I would have to get a buy-to-let mortgage or my own residential one. Can you help? NG A The easy answer is that if you were to buy the flat with the tenants still there, you would need to take out a buy-to-let mortgage whereas if you would have what’s called “vacant completion” and so could move in to a property empty of other occupiers and call it your home, you would need a standard residential mortgage. The more complicated answer is to do with the fact that you have to be very careful when buying property – whether a house or a flat – that has people other than the legal owner living there. It’s not just tenants that you need to worry about, it is also any occupier over the age of 17 who is not a legal owner of the property which could be a co-habiting partner or just a friend of the legal owner lodging in a spare room. As you want to live in the flat you are thinking of buying, your solicitor needs to pay particular attention to the timing of contracts. This is because if you want the property to be vacated by the time you complete the purchase, the current tenants must be given the correct type of notice (as detailed in the terms of the tenancy agreement that they appear to have renewed recently). The tenants must also be given the correct amount of notice which, under a normal assured shorthold tenancy agreement, is usually one or two months. Your solicitors should not exchange contracts – which is the point where you commit to the purchase of the property and the seller commits to its sale – until they have seen proof that the correct “notice to vacate” has been given to the tenants by the seller. It is not the case that you have to wait until the natural end of the 12-month lease for the tenants to move out. Your solicitors should also check that the tenant is not a sitting tenant or has any other sort of protected tenancy. Once your solicitors have the evidence they need that the tenants will be moving out they will be able to set the completion date which is when, after exchanging contracts, you complete the purchase of a property. They should ensure that the completion date is after the day that the tenants are required to move out so that you don’t find unexpected flatmates still living there when you move in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/31/eu-migrant-visas-should-be-for-those-working-antisocial-hours","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T00:01:12Z","webTitle":"EU migrant visas 'should be for those working antisocial hours'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/31/eu-migrant-visas-should-be-for-those-working-antisocial-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/31/eu-migrant-visas-should-be-for-those-working-antisocial-hours","fields":{"headline":"EU migrant visas 'should be for those working antisocial hours'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A post-Brexit immigration policy should include a deep cut in the number of low-skilled European migrants coming to work in Britain, with the priority given to only those willing to work antisocial hours, a leading centre-right thinktank has urged ministers. A report from Policy Exchange says that Britain needs to “wean itself off low-skilled migration” and suggests that lower-skilled EU nationals who do come to work in Britain should be given temporary two-year work permits, be fingerprinted and issued biometric ID cards, and denied access to housing benefit or tax credits. The author of the report, David Goodhart, claims that since lower-skilled EU migrants are in Britain mainly to earn money and many are without family responsibilities, it makes sense to give work permits to those prepared to work antisocial hours for all or some of their period working in Britain. The proposal for a special “antisocial hours visa” brought immediate criticism from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants whose director, Chai Patel, said it was hard to think of a worse way to achieve integrated and cohesive communities than a “night-time only” visa system. “To make living a parallel life to the rest of Britain a condition of coming here to live and work would be a self-destructive folly and a wasted opportunity to build an immigration system fit for the future,” he said. Goodhart, the thinktank’s head of demography, immigration and integration, suggests there should be a customised “light touch” system of five-year work permits for EU professionals but a high level of continuity for groups such as students and tourists after Brexit. The intervention comes as the home secretary, Amber Rudd, is due to publish her own long-delayed white paper on post-Brexit immigration policy. The Policy Exchange paper carries echoes of the draft Home Office paper leaked to the Guardian in September, including the two-tier temporary work permit system and a rejection of any automatic right of new lower-skilled EU migrants who arrive to settle permanently in Britain. As well as “bearing down” on low-skilled migration, the Policy Exchange paper proposes opening up three new temporary channels. These include extending the youth mobility visa – that allows 18-to-30-year-olds from countries such as Australia and New Zealand to work in the UK for up to two years – to young EU citizens, reviving the seasonal migrant workers’ scheme for agricultural workers, and extending “intra-company transfers”, which see 60,000 skilled staff a year work in Britain for short periods, to EU companies. Goodhart proposes that the creation of this new temporary migrant workforce should be introduced alongside measures to wean British industries off their dependence on low-skilled EU workers. He proposes that the migration advisory committee should publish data showing the proportion of non-UK nationals working in each major sector of the economy as part of moves to persuade British companies to become more attractive to UK workers by investing more in training and offering higher pay. Goodhart said: “A Brexit without a clear end to free movement in its current form is neither possible nor desirable, as it was clearly one of the biggest single factors behind the Brexit vote. “One of the problems with freedom of movement is that it has created a new category of resident: someone who is neither a temporary visitor, such as a tourist, nor someone who is making a permanent commitment to a new country in the manner of the traditional immigrant. Many of those taking advantage of free movement in recent years have enjoyed the rights of the latter with the attitude of the former,” he said. “The government, in partnership with industry and the migration advisory committee, needs to set out how they will gradually reduce low skilled immigration from the EU, whilst maintaining a route for workers coming to do jobs with antisocial hours,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/30/julian-munoz-former-marbella-mayor-sent-back-jail-over-5am-flamenco-video","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T16:02:14Z","webTitle":"Former Marbella mayor sent back to jail over 5am flamenco video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/julian-munoz-former-marbella-mayor-sent-back-jail-over-5am-flamenco-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/30/julian-munoz-former-marbella-mayor-sent-back-jail-over-5am-flamenco-video","fields":{"headline":"Former Marbella mayor sent back to jail over 5am flamenco video","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A former mayor of Marbella who was convicted in one of Spain’s biggest corruption cases but allowed home on health grounds has been sent back to prison after a video emerged of him dancing the flamenco in a bar at 5am. In October 2013 Julián Muñoz was found guilty of fraud and perverting the course of justice in a cash-for-votes scam that saw about €670m paid in bribes from municipal funds in the mid-1990s. He received a 22-year-prison sentence. Last year a judge ruled that Muñoz could serve the remainder of his sentence at home because of a life-limiting cardiovascular and respiratory condition, and the 69-year-old was issued with an electronic tag. Six days ago, however, the news website El Español published footage of Muñoz dancing in a bar outside Marbella. By Monday he was back in prison in the city of Algeciras. Muñoz’s lawyer said he would appeal against the move. “No one’s told him why his liberty’s been taken away,” Antonio José García Cabrera told a press conference in Granada on Tuesday. “You can’t act on the back of the gossipy media or impose a soap opera punishment – you need to explain the reasons and what breach Julián Muñoz has committed.” García Cabrera said the decision was “unjust, disproportionate, motiveless and capricious” and appeared to have been made “probably because of a few simple images”. He suggested the authorities were punishing Muñoz’s celebrity rather than the man himself. Asked about his client’s health, García Cabrera said Muñoz’s return to prison had aggravated his condition and caused his blood pressure to rise. Muñoz is a former boyfriend of the folk singer Isabel Pantoja, the widow of the bullfighter Francisco Rivera, who died in the ring in 1984."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnmeducationcentre/2018/mar/02/rachel-beer-editor-of-the-observer-archive","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-foundation","sectionName":"Guardian Foundation","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:38:36Z","webTitle":"Rachel Beer, editor of the Observer 1891-1901","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/2018/mar/02/rachel-beer-editor-of-the-observer-archive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnmeducationcentre/2018/mar/02/rachel-beer-editor-of-the-observer-archive","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Beer, editor of the Observer 1891-1901","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rachel Sassoon Beer was the first woman to become editor of a national newspaper in Britain. She started editing the Observer in 1891 and took over fully from her husband Frederick Beer in 1896, when he had become too ill to continue working. At this time she was also editor of the Sunday Times, and for several years she continued to edit both papers. Beer was a member of the wealthy Sassoon family (poet Siegfried Sassoon was her nephew). The family was Jewish, originally from Iraq. Beer’s grandfather, David Sassoon, moved to Bombay from Baghdad in the 1830s and Rachel Beer was born there, though her family moved to England when she was a baby. Beer worked as a nurse as a young woman, before marrying Frederick Beer in 1887. Frederick Beer’s family was also wealthy, also Jewish, but had converted to Anglicanism when they moved to England from Frankfurt (his father Julius Beer built a monumental family mausoleum in Highgate Cemetery). Rachel Beer converted the day before their wedding and was rejected by her own family as a result. The GNM Archive holds little about Beer’s tenure as editor of the Observer, but there is a series of correspondence from 1965 between Tristan Jones, Managing director of the Observer, and Stanley Jackson, who was conducting research for his book on the Sassoon family. One of these letters includes queries on a range of subjects including: Julius Beer, who had bought the Observer in 1870 and passed it to his son; a dramatic sounding editorial on cannibalism (of which Jones found no evidence); and obtaining a photo of a portrait of Rachel Beer belonging to Siegfried Sassoon (likely the image that appears above in the Observer’s 1966 175 year anniversary edition). It also includes a reference to one of the most interesting episodes of Beer’s time as editor of the Observer: her involvement in the Dreyfus affair. The case was made famous by Emile Zola’s 1898 open letter J’accuse. Beer was committed to obtaining justice for Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army falsely accused and convicted of passing military secrets to Germany. Beer achieved a scoop for the Observer when she met and obtained a confession from Major Esterhazy, the officer who had produced false documents (a “bordereau”) to aid Dreyfus’s conviction. Esterhazy was in London in secret, hiding from authorities (having disguised himself by shaving off his moustache). Beer had knowledge of his whereabouts because the Observer’s Paris correspondent had already established a relationship with the Major. Amid speculation in the press across Europe about where Esterhazy might be hiding, Beer was able to publish two exclusives “special to the Observer” on the case, first detailing where he had been staying and the following week confirming their meeting and including his own confession to her. In her own leader column on 25 September 1898, Beer accused the French military of antisemitism and called for a retrial for Dreyfus. Beer continued to edit the Observer until 1901.

The Sound of Music, Funny Girl, or indeed The Greatest Showman, whose stealth success at the box office since it opened five weeks ago has quietly become the biggest film story of the new year. The Greatest Showman’s success is not just surprising: it’s bordering on miraculous. The film’s audience has grown week on week, after inauspicious beginnings, to an extent not seen since Titanic or Chicago. This goes against all received wisdom, and runs blithely counter to all current box-office trends. The movie is an original, unfranchisable story with little or no built-in audience, no superheroes, and is a gosh-darn-it musical. Why this not-especially-good film? Why now? First of all, the way The Greatest Showman has built its audience, gradually, shows that word of mouth has played a key role. What’s interesting, and sort of charming, is that it is likely that Showman is drawing in not only new audiences curious to see what all the fuss is about, but repeat viewers who don’t care about the film’s formal problems and who are – presumably – turning up for the hits and the kitsch factor. The film has both in spades: Never Enough, This Is Me or Rewrite the Stars would all win the Eurovision Song Contest, and the film’s turgid story of self-actualisation dips into schmaltz just about every other minute. That tone is crucial – the film offers entertainment, but in an easygoing, Dirty Dancing kind of way. It’s never too sassy, smart, or even particularly camp, making its pleasures relatable and comforting. It isn’t hard to see how the film’s feelgood factor can give audiences a much-needed sense of escape or respite. You could plausibly go further and suggest that the way the film reinvents PT Barnum – by all accounts a nasty, racist piece of work who exploited his workers without any qualms – as a beaming champion of minorities and misfits, might chime with viewers who wish to see good in men, and find precious little of it around in today’s #MeToo landscape. The Greatest Showman offers a hagiographic narrative of financial success, individual self-assertion and togetherness, merrily papering over such small difficulties as patriarchal oppression and systemic structural inequality. Also, while Showman is often ropy in its execution, little of its making has been left down to chance. Its main cast ranges in age from 22 to 49, drawing on Instagram royalty (Zendaya) and old-school stardom (Jackman). There’s eye candy for people of all persuasions, and there’s a winking coming-out duet between Jackman and Efron to court the crucial pink dollar. The film is an old-time musical built on classical lines, but it also pays lip service in its music to current trends. Its slick power-pop soundtrack has found its way to the top of the charts in the US. Perhaps the film’s success shouldn’t be surprising. Like The Sound of Music and Funny Girl, it’s built on a tried and tested formula that, admittedly, hadn’t been used in a while, but reliably hit payola for studios for years and years. Even, more recently, the successes of Frozen, Empire and Hamilton show that there’s a potentially huge audience for musicals, which was going untapped in cinema. The film is testament, in almost every aspect, to old-fashioned values working well, right down to Jackman’s star power in getting the project off the ground and giving it his promotional firepower. It’s a crafty piece of meshing of his image with the film’s brand that fully pays off. Finally, the film – though hokey and trite at its core – offers a genuine rush of spectacle and wonder, which still counts for something on a big screen, perhaps more so in an era of standardised CGI. Where audiences used to marvel at Fred and Ginger hotfooting it on a shiny dancefloor, we get to watch Zendaya whoosh around a circus on a trapeze. To quote the film, “it’s fire, it’s freedom, it’s flooding open”. Have you seen The Greatest Showman? Why do you think the film has proved so popular?

Mature females might now engage with politics, but the “scantily clad, jazzing flapper to whom a dance, a new hat or a man with a car is of more importance than the fate of nations” must never be entrusted with a vote. The fast, frivolous flapper of the 20s was partially a cultural stereotype, but she was also a focus of serious debate. With her short skirts and cigarettes, her cocktails, sexiness and sass, she was not only offensive to the men at the Times, but also a concern to older feminists, who saw in her pleasure-seeking, taboo-breaking ways a younger generation’s disregard of all for which the suffragettes had fought. But if the politics of feminism seemed less important to the “flapper generation”, this was partly because young women were taking the struggle for freedom into their personal lives. Ideas of duty, sacrifice and the greater good had been debunked by the recent war; for this generation, morality resided in being true to one’s self, not to a cause. Towards the end of the decade, some feminists would argue that women’s great achievement in the 20s was learning to value their individuality. Personal freedoms remained dependent on public reform and active UK feminists such as the Six Point Group continued to campaign. Women were given electoral equality with men in 1928; legislation brought equality in inheritance rights and unemployment benefits; and women profited from the Sex Discrimination (Removal) Act, which, in 1919, had given them access to professions such as law. Changes in work patterns were dramatic, with a third of unmarried women moving into paid employment across an expanding range of jobs in medicine, education and industry. Mass employment also made women a consumer power. Fashion was one of several industries that expanded rapidly to meet their demands. While the Times considered clothes a frivolity, for women they were a daily marker of liberation: rising hemlines, sportswear and even trousers made their generation physically freer than any in modern history. Sexual mores were also changing. While double standards persisted, a significant number of women were beginning to claim the same licence as men. There were small steps of encouragement, too, with divorce made easier by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923 and contraception made more readily available by the Marie Stopes mail-order service. The flapper generation may have been comparatively apolitical and self-absorbed, but, as they puzzled out what freedom meant and tested their personal limits, they were broaching issues that would be hotly debated during the 60s and 70s.

Thank goodness, then, for the optimism of the pagans: Imbolc, or St Brigid’s Day, is a Gaelic festival at the start of February, halfway between the winter solstice and spring equinox. It’s a celebration of the first signs of spring, and milk-based dishes traditionally mark the occasion. In keeping with that, here’s a creamy-rich gratin studded with salami. Perfect fodder to spoil yourself, and to welcome the lengthening days. Brussels sprout gratin with finocchiona salami, fennel seeds and breadcrumbs Brussels sprouts as you never knew them: sweet, tender and with a twist of fennel echoed in the delicious Tuscan salami – you should be able to get that in any Italian deli worth its salt. Prep 20-25 min Cook 25 min Serves 4-6 1kg brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half 350ml double cream 3 garlic cloves, peeled 1 bay leaf 30g butter 70g finocchiona salami, slices cut into thick strips Salt and black pepper ½ tbsp fennel seeds 3 tbsp demerara sugar 4 tbsp olive oil 100g soft white breadcrumbs 50g parmesan (or pecorino), grated Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4. Bring a pan of well salted water to a boil and blanch the sprouts for three to four minutes (depending on size), until just tender, then drain. Put the cream, two garlic cloves and the bay leaf in a saucepan on a medium-low heat, bring to a simmer and cook gently for five minutes, until the cream has reduced a little. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the salami for 30 seconds, just until it starts to release its fat. Stir in the sprouts, season and toss in the hot, buttery fat for a minute. Stir in the infused cream (discard the garli, which has now done its job), then tip the lot into a small baking dish into which the mix fits snugly. Put the remaining garlic clove, the fennel seeds, sugar and a couple of pinches of salt in a mortar and grind to a paste. Stir in half the oil, then transfer to a bowl and stir in the breadcrumbs and cheese. Toss to combine, then sprinkle on to the gratin. Drizzle the remaining oil over the top and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the top is golden. Leave to rest and cool slightly before serving. And for the rest of the week... Saute shavings of leftover salami with savoy cabbage, then drizzle with black butter (butter melted and cooked until nutty and brown) and a grating of parmesan for a tasty and quick lunch (the salami also works well with green beans in summer: cut it into batons and dress in a simple vinaigrette). Sprouts are great in veggie curries, whether Indian or Thai: they add real body and keep their shape.

I’ll be off then. Bye! Liverpool scored a slightly fortunate goal at an opportune time – with Huddersfield cramming the penalty area they were finding it impossible to create clear opportunities, and the longer that situation continued the more frustrated they would become, and then perhaps, in time, some degree of desperation would follow, and that’s when the home side might have profited. Instead Can scored with a deflected long-range volley, and Liverpool relaxed and – particularly after they scored another goal at an opportune time – took control. 90+3 mins: And without further drama, it’s over. The managers embrace on the touchline, and Liverpool pocket the points! 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there will be three minutes or so. 89 mins: Liverpool make their final change, bringing Solanke on for Firmino. 89 mins: Van la Parra’s cross from the left should have been cleared, but various red shirts stood still and Ince ran 15 yards to reach it first instead. Nothing comes of it, and Milner is now giving his team-mates a proper dressing down. 87 mins: A shot! Huddersfield have a shot! It’s pathetically weak and easily cleared without getting anywhere near the goalkeeper, but still. It came from Tom Ince, who along with Rajiv van La Parra came on a while back, with Mooy and Lowe going off. 85 mins: A spell of Huddersfield possession ends with Hogg being passed the ball by, I think, Zanka at such pace that he feels compelled to knock it straight out of play and start shouting angrily at people. 82 mins: Liverpool make a double substitution: Salah and Henderson go off, and Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wijnaldum are on. 81 mins: Can lifts the ball into the area and Firmino, from out to the left of goal, attempts a ridiculously optimistic volleyed shot and shanks it wildly, when he might have sidefooted back across goal to Salah. 80 mins: Swansea are now just a point behind Huddersfield, with better goal difference. Liverpool, meanwhile, will be eight points ahead of Arsenal this evening. Lossl dives to his right, and the ball goes to his left! The home fans, unhappy that Liverpool got their penalty when Quaner got nothing at the other end, boo lustily. 77 mins: That is a penalty, I think. There was not only a bit of a nudge from the back, but also an arm and an elbow flailing around Can’s neck. 77 mins: Can feels contact from Billing behind him, and down he goes! 75 mins: Elsewhere, Swansea are now 3-1 up against Arsenal, with less than five minutes to play. 73 mins: Salah should have scored a third! Gomez lifts the ball forward, a defender hopelessly misjudges, he races past the goalkeeper and, from an acute angle, finds the side netting! 72 mins: Huddersfield have the ball inside Liverpool’s penalty area! Mooy lifts it to Quaner, who is so surprised to have a potential goalscoring chance that he falls over! Actually he wants a penalty, but contact from Robertson was minimal, and the referee waves play on. 71 mins: Karius’s clearance lands in the centre circle, where it bounces between a defender’s legs and out the other side, and for a moment it looks like Salah will scamper clear. But then he doesn’t. 70 mins: Huddersfield cross the ball! Lowe gets to the byline, and he crosses it! Into the penalty area! It’s cleared into touch, though, and the resulting long throw is caught by Karius. 69 mins: Another difficult headed chance for Mané. Again Can is the source, curling a fine cross from deep, on the right wing. Mané dives, but heads wide. 67 mins: With absolutely nothing happening on the pitch, BT Sport show us Steve McMahon, who’s in the press box, and Adam Lallana, who is in the stands somewhere with his young son. They spend at least a minute of the match doing this, without risk of missing a major incident. 64 mins: Before that, Huddersfield actually had the ball in Liverpool’s half for a bit. When they gave it away their forwards immediately jogged slowly back towards their own half, allowing Liverpool to calmly tap a few passes around. Zanka finds this so upsetting he rampages to the halfway line and steamrollers Mané, conceding a free-kick. 63 mins: A Huddersfield substitution: Steve Mounie goes off, and Collin Quaner comes on. 62 mins: Liverpool engage in a bit of unchallenged keep-ball. 59 mins: Zanka’s perfectly-judged interception stops Milner skipping clear inside the penalty area. Liverpool win it back straight away, but Mané slips in the act of shooting, and the ball squirms wide. 58 mins: Milner’s 25-yard drive is hard and rising, and though it’s nowhere near the corner Lossl decides he has no chance of catching it and fumbles it over the bar. 57 mins: Robertson benefits from a narrow offside call and puts in a testy cross, and the home fans, glad to have something to respond to, boo a bit. it sounds like they’re making plenty of noise, but largely despite rather than because of what they’re watching. 54 mins: Chance for Liverpool! Can’s long, looping cross from the right is flighted perfectly to land on Mané’s pate, but his header is from a little too far out, and Lossl saves. 53 mins: Huddersfield have so far made 15 passes in the final third of the pitch. 50 mins: The second half has started very much as the first ended. Huddersfield’s best “move” so far was a long punt forward from Lossl, which Karius only just claimed ahead of Mounie. 47 mins: So far this season Huddersfield are 12-11 up (before tonight) in the first half of league matches, and 30-7 down in the second. At home they are (again before tonight) 8-6 up in the first half, but 10-3 down in the second. This is not encouraging. 46 mins: Peeep! They’re back under way. The players are back out! Sadly Robbie Savage has a point, on BT Sport at half-time, when he says that the deflection on Can’s shot wasn’t so much down to luck as to Philip Billing’s weak attempt to close the Liverpool player down. This is I think an issue of technique rather than cowardice: you don’t maximise your chances of blocking a shot by waving a leg at it, you somehow need to put your torso in the way. “Please can you explain how anyone volleys a ball after it’s bounced once (Can’s goal),” asks Geoff Wignall. Well, it was a great big bouncy bounce, and Can hit it with the ball falling, and it thus counts to my mind as a volley rather than a half-volley (hit with the ball rising having recently bounced). 45+2 mins: The first half is over, and Liverpool deservedly lead. 45+1 mins: Mane’s backheel flick releases Firmino into space, on the left side of the area. He takes the ball almost to the byline, waits for support in the middle, and then ignores it and sidefoots off the inside of the near post and in, with Lossl expecting a cross and wrong-footed! How has he squeezed it in from there? 43 mins: Down the other end, Milner pokes the ball through to Firmino, who is also offside. 42 mins: Mooy heads the ball into the area, Mounie taps it across goal and Depoitre rolls it in. Mooy, though, was well offside, and the whistle had gone a long time before the shot was taken. 40 mins: Ooooh! Lowe tries a left-footed curler, and it whistles a yard wide of the far post! 40 mins: There are seven Liverpool players, and three from Huddersfield, in the wall. Surely Karius can’t see a thing. 39 mins: Huddersfield have a chance here, after Mane conceded a free-kick a couple of yards outside the penalty area with a ludicrously clumsy challenge. 37 mins: Robertson gets a lucky bounce over Hadergjonaj and finds himself in space in the penalty area, but though he picks out the right pass he underhits it, and it’s intercepted. 36 mins: Possession stats over the last 20 minutes would be severely lopsided. Huddersfield, after a positive start, have regressed to an almost entirely defensive mindset. 33 mins: You get booked for the mildest shirt-tug these days, but Lowe properly bear-hugs Salah to stop the Egyptian scampering into space and is punished only by the award of a free-kick. 30 mins: Liverpool continue to control proceedings, though there has only been one genuine goalscoring chance, and Huddersfield made it. 27 mins: That was exactly what Liverpool needed – there’s no need to pick out passes in a wildly congested penalty area if you can just blast the ball into the net from outside it. A header out of the area bounces once and is volleyed by Can, 25 yards out, clips the calf of Billing and spins perfectly into the corner! 25 mins: Liverpool work the ball around Huddersfield’s area, but the home side have nine players inside it, and two more within two yards of it, and the visitors can’t find a gap. On the plus side, every clearance inevitably goes straight back to them. 24 mins: Can curls a shot with his left foot that wasn’t very hard but was extremely accurate, forcing Lossl into a diving save. 21 mins: A bright start, full of action, but except for those two Huddersfield raids down the wing it’s all been a little clumsy. “‘We are experiencing some site issues, so if you think updates are coming through a little belatedly, it’s not my fault’ sounds like what someone whose fault it was would say,” notes Mac Millings. Gah, that’s the last time I listen to the guy who told me to write that. 17 mins: Great chance for Huddersfield! Lossl’s long kick if flicked on by Billing to Lowe, who is totally free, bursting forward on the left. His low cross reaches Depoitre just inside the penalty area, and the first-time shot is firm and on target, but Karius saves! 15 mins: Huddersfield get down the right, where Hadergjonaj goes on a barnstorming run and produces a decent cross at the end of it, which is cleared. 12 mins: Liverpool try a long ball of their own, and when it comes down to earth Lossl outjumps Mane with the greatest of ease. “I’m watching the game at West Ham,” writes JR. “Benteke has just given Palace the lead after invisible Hammers defending. But the most entertaining thing so far was in the 14th minute when under no pressure James Collins lost the ball out of play and in a very quiet London stadium and very close to a microphone screamed the C-word for which Bill Leslie immediately apologised.” 10 mins: We are experiencing some site issues, so if you think updates are coming through a little belatedly, it’s not my fault, and it’s being worked on. 8 mins: Huddersfield have control of the ball for a good while, working it down the left, keeping possession, passing back into their own half, and then pumping a long ball forward towards Depoitre and losing it. 6 mins: Huddersfield have come into the game a bit, though their attacking has so far been confined to kicking a few high balls for Mounie to fight for. 3 mins: Firmino chips the ball through to Mane, who might have been clean through but can’t take it in his stride, has to check back, and tees up Firmino for a bobbly low shot that’s easily saved. 2 mins: Huddersfield are yet to touch the ball. Oh, now they have, Zanka kicking it out of play for a throw-in. 1 min: Peeeeep! Liverpool get the game started. The players are on the pitch, and we are just an anthem, some handshakes, a bit of warming-up, a coin toss, perhaps an end-change, maybe a player-huddle, and one small ad break away from kick-off! Some last-minute pre-match reading: “Maybe it’s because I’m American and the lunch hour is approaching here on the west coast, but all this talk about BT got me thinking about a BLT sandwich,” writes Peter Oh. “But then the image of lettuce and the potential of a Liverpool keeper’s hands being compared to said leafy green led me to quickly swat that idea aside. In fact, I punched that idea firmly away with locked wrists and solid fists. No lettuce for lunch! I hope.” Crikey. Klopp has also spoken about his team, confirming that Lovren has come into the team just to give Van Dijk a bit of a breather, and sayin this about the inclusion of Milner and Henderson: Milly is only playing because he’s from Yorkshire. I think at least one from Yorkshire should play tonight. No, both did well when they came on against West Brom. We need physicality, we need to know about the specific challenge at a place like that. Both players bring that in. That’s it, and that’s all. “Simon, instead of just repeating Klopp’s allegation re BT, could you get one of your journalist pals to ask the question why there were only four minutes added on when VAR wasted 10 minutes?” suggests Andrew Champney. I fear it will remain a mystery. PGMOL have released a brief statement, however, which places all the blame upon the VAR of the day, who I believe was Andre Marriner: The VAR official will advise the fourth official on the number of minutes to be included as added time for each half in respect of any time lost through VAR. Broadcasters are not involved in this process. David Wagner speaks: We’ll see if it’s a good time [to play Liverpool] or not. For sure, both teams aren’t having the best run at the minute. It’s up to us to make the best out of it. Will I surprise him? Usually he knows everything about me. Maybe we’ll surprise him, maybe not. We’ll see. [On the changes to his team] Changes are part of the game. Usually we make changes. To be honest I’ve no idea how many. We wanted to have fresh legs. We wanted to have power in the game, pace in the game, and we’ll see. Hopefully there will be a surprise. BT Sport have firmly denied influencing the amount of stoppage time played in the Liverpool v West Brom game, which Jurgen Klopp suggested had been the case: They’ve just spoken to Klopp about the allegation, which he notably failed to retract, saying only that “I know what I heard”: I said how it was. For everybody in the stadium it was clear – there should have been minimum nine minutes and it was only four. So of course you ask the question. Obviously somebody misjudged the situation. We didn’t lose the game [because of it], it had nothing to do with the result, it was only one part of the VAR issues. That was everything I wanted to say, nothing else. I know what I heard. It was obvious that it should have been 10 minutes. If the VAR takes 10 minutes it should take that time. I’ve heard what I’ve heard, that’s it. So six changes for Liverpool from the side that lost to West Brom, the most noticeable of which see Jordan Henderson make his first start of 2018 and Virgil van Dijk drop to the bench. Also coming in: Karius, Gomez, Lovren, Robertson and Milner. Out: Mignolet, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Moreno, Wijnaldum and Oxlade-Chamberlain. The team sheets have been handed in, and the names upon them are these: Huddersfield: Lossl, Hadergjonaj, Kongolo, Schindler, Jorgensen, Lowe, Mooy, Hogg, Billing, Mounie, Depoitre. Subs: Smith, Coleman, van La Parra, Pritchard, Ince, Quaner, Hefele. Liverpool: Karius, Gomez, Matip, Lovren, Robertson, Can, Henderson, Milner, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Van Dijk, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mignolet, Ings, Solanke, Alexander-Arnold. Referee: Kevin Friend. Liverpool beat Huddersfield 3-0 at Anfield back in October, a match that featured Daniel Sturridge’s final domestic goal for the club, to break the deadlock five minutes into the second half. Before that match, talk was of the friendship between Jurgen Klopp and David Wagner, whose relationship goes back a few years. This is what Wagner told the Guardian about their relationship back in 2015: I’ve known Jürgen longer than I’ve known my wife. I know he is living this job 100%. He always thinks about football or his team, always. I think you do this if you are a good head coach. You can never stop your brain from thinking about what could happen tomorrow or next week or the next hour. It is not possible to close your brain to this in football. Now, there are other things to worry about. Huddersfield haven’t won a league game since they gave a comically ragged Watford side a merry tonking at Vicarage Road in mid-December, since when they have taken three points from five league games. The last time they beat Liverpool Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, Cliff Richard was at No1 with Travellin’ Light and Simon Cowell was less than two months old; in their last six encounters Liverpool have scored 12 times and Huddersfield not at all. As for Liverpool, they had gone precisely three months unbeaten when they travelled to Swansea last week, but having lost then and again at home to West Brom in the FA Cup on Saturday, they need to rapidly return to winning ways. Here’s a brief highlight from Klopp’s pre-match press conference, reflecting on his side’s current micro-crisis: It is how football is, how life is. Two weeks ago we had an 18-game unbeaten run and then you lose twice and everything feels different. That’s OK because for us it is important you feel it and don’t think it is not important. We have to make it much better from now on. If you use a defeat to learn from then it is still bad but it is OK. If you don’t learn from it you are silly. Huddersfield is a special place, the whole city fights for the league. They don’t expect brilliant football, they expect a proper fight and that is what Huddersfield Town is ready to deliver. We need to deliver as well. And here’s what Wagner had to say about this game: Liverpool have lost two games in a row. They look vulnerable at the minute,” Wagner said. “Does it mean we will be successful? No. Does it mean we have a chance? Absolutely. We are both in a situation where we need the points. Liverpool can have all the points in the Premier League, but not tomorrow night and for this we will fight for every yard in the stadium to cause them the biggest problem they can ever have. And so, here we are. It should, he said confidently, be a belter.

The Sky Sports News presenters have downed three bottles of Adderall, ready to scream rumours of MK Dons securing a loan deal for a Chelsea academy player you’ve never heard of into our scared little faces. Wednesday is transfer deadline day, the best day of the football calendar: better than the FA Cup final, better than the last day of the season, better than when Gary Lineker has a couple of drinks and goes full “messy bitch” at Piers Morgan on social media. I love it. It’s like a game of grandmother’s footsteps played out on national scale. Certain footballers are identified as being “on the move” by tabloids and from that point on, they are the Hunted: their every movement is watched and tracked on social media. “Fabinho has been spotted at baggage reclaim at Manchester airport.” “Olivier Giroud has been spotted in the King’s Road Waitrose buying an egg salad sandwich.” “Ashley Barnes has been spotted at Canada Water, looking confused at the London Overground timetable, trying to work out which train goes to Thornton Heath (he’s having an absolute ‘mare, everyone knows that’s National Rail).” Fans suddenly know everything there is to know about flight times and immigration control: in 2013, when Gonzalo Higuaín moved from Real Madrid, countless Twitter users claimed every day of that summer that he was on a plane to London and he’d be touching down to sign for Arsenal within the hour. Some Arsenal fans still believe that’s where he is now, having been circling Heathrow airspace for five years, subsisting on small packets of nuts, tiny cans of Diet Coke and moth-eaten copies of High Life. From a business point of view, of course, transfer deadline day is terrible. In January 2008 Steve Coppell, then manager of Reading, said that it encourages clubs to buy too many mediocre players that they don’t really want – an honest enough sentiment, but one that would have been more commendable had he not signed Jimmy Kébé two weeks later. The introduction of the January transfer window – stopping players being able to move all year round – was supposed to encourage stability in clubs. Instead it has just concentrated that instability into a smaller period. It’s like if you had to buy all your electrical appliances in 31 days. Do I buy one toaster? What if that toaster breaks? What if I don’t want to stick to my current breakfast formation? What if I want to eat toast most days but want the option of bringing an espresso off the bench after 70 minutes? On 1 February I’d end up with seven toasters, four coffee machines, one ice-cream maker and no fridge. But as a fan it’s wonderful, purely for that feeling that anything can happen. In an actual game of football, there are a limited number of outcomes – maybe you win, maybe you lose, maybe your goalkeeper scores a last-minute diving header, maybe a chicken wearing a Blackburn kit is released on to the field in protest against the owners. Boring. But on transfer deadline day, it’s all up for grabs – an Abu Dhabi royal can suddenly take over your club and buy you Robinho, Peter Odemwingie can drive to Loftus Road and beg in vain that QPR sign him, Liverpool can think Andy Carroll is good and decide to pay actual, real money – £35m of it – to buy him. What’s more, it can all happen out of nowhere. Rumours that are mere tabloid-fodder at 9am, like Rafael van der Vaart to Tottenham, can be made real by midnight. For an Arsenal fan, it’s the hope that sucks you in – historically, Arsène Wenger has been far too serious to board the transfer merry-go-rounds, preferring instead transfer kiddie-rides you find outside of Asda (better known as Yaya Sanogo). But in the past few years that has changed, with Mesut Özil arriving in a mega-deal on deadline day in 2013. As the minutes count down and the rumours dry up faster than Fernando Llorente’s goals since joining Spurs, you can still cling to that mantra: it’s not over yet. This is what makes deadline day so great. Often football is a disappointment – a drab 0-0 draw, play-acting to get another player sent off, the post-playing career of Michael Owen. But on deadline day none of that matters. It’s not about reality, or results, or trying to work out how a player will fit into a system – it’s about potential. For one glorious night you create a narrative that this last-minute deal will change your club forever – one in which Radamel Falcao scores 40 goals in a season, or Danny Welbeck becomes the new Thierry Henry. When the players are standing there, next to the club fax machine at 11.30pm, holding up the shirt and plastering a smile across their face, they are in their purest form. They are the possibility of success, the dream, the hope, unsullied by actual events. It’s why we put up with the drama, the ITK tweets, the frothing at the mouth of Jim White as he relays another rumour about Pavel Pogrebnyak. In a game which has so frequently breaks our hearts, it’s these little moments that we have to cling to. • Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/02/thrillers-review-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T12:00:28Z","webTitle":"The best recent thrillers  – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/02/thrillers-review-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/02/thrillers-review-roundup","fields":{"headline":"The best recent thrillers  – review roundup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"James Lee Burke is widely considered to be the most significant writer of American crime fiction – which gives his daughter Alafair a hard act to follow in her own books. Both have new titles out, with James Lee’s latest, Robicheaux (Orion, £19.99), featuring his signature protagonist, Dave Robicheaux, and a notably valedictory air – is this the last time we will meet the Cajun detective? The killing of Robicheaux’s wife, Molly, has left him bereft, and he spends his days in the Louisiana bayou drowning his anguish in alcohol. After one blackout, he awakes to find himself with bruises and lacerations but no memory of how he got them. Then he hears that Molly’s murderer has been savagely killed – and Robicheaux himself is in the frame for the crime. Did he do it? This epic investigation has a teeming, vividly drawn cast, with the mortality of the central character casting a dark shadow over the visceral narrative. Alafair Burke’s novels are sharp and concise where her father’s are sprawling and operatic, as well as being notably more plot driven (she’s also – in her books at least – less angered by presidential ineptitude, a recurrent James Lee bugbear). With her latest, The Wife (Faber, £12.99), we are in domestic noir territory. Marriage to the seductive Jason has offered Angela a chance to leave behind a tragic past. But when Jason becomes a celebrated writer and liberal media performer, she receives unwelcome attention – particularly after a series of allegations are made by women against him. With so many novels currently portraying marriage as a hotbed of betrayal and deceit, it’s only a matter of time before readers tire of this relatively restricted genre. Nevertheless, the younger Burke here demonstrates that a writer of psychological veracity can still ring the changes with panache. You may already be tired of the words “The Girl” beginning the title of every other thriller, but that’s the only overfamiliar element in The Girl in the Woods by Camilla Läckberg (HarperCollins, £12.99, translated by Tiina Nunnally). Here the bestselling Swedish writer creates a satisfying and counterintuitive clash between the cosy and gruesome strands of the genre, with her regular duo, writer Erica Falck and Detective Patrik Hedström, trying to discover why a famous female actor once found guilty of the murder of a four-year-old girl has returned to town. Cloistered Fjällbacka, Läckberg’s regular stamping ground, may owe something to Agatha Christie’s St Mary Mead, but this is tougher fare. At nearly 600 pages, The Girl in the Woods is perhaps more for the committed Lackberg aficionado than new readers. Is Seventeen by Hideo Yokoyama (Riverrun, £16.99, translated by Louise Heal Kawai) the “investigative thriller” its publisher promises? After a catastrophic air disaster, veteran Japanese reporter Yuuki has waited 17 years to fulfil a promise he made before the accident: to climb the formidable Tsuitate rockface. A mystery may finally be solved as a result; the past, Yuuki finds, still has the power to alter the present. With its steady pace and large cast of characters, this is a thriller only in the loosest sense and demands patience. As in the earlier Six Four, Yokoyama carefully structures his novel to provide an astringent, unforgiving picture of modern Japanese society. Two very different American thrillers merit attention. Gravesend by William Boyle (No Exit, £8.99) is an adrenaline-charged debut in the Elmore Leonard vein: blue-collar Brooklyn setting, idiomatic dialogue, no detective figure. Ray Boy Calabrese has been released from prison after serving time for a homophobic crime in which a gay teenager died. The teen’s brother wants Ray Boy dead – and Calabrese himself, who has suffered agonies of guilt over the death he was indirectly responsible for, seems to welcome his punishment. Unsuccessful actor Alessandra has combustible encounters with both men. Bristling with energy, Gravesend marks Boyle out as a new name to watch. Hellbent (Michael Joseph, £12.99) is US author Gregg Hurwitz firing on all cylinders. Assassin Evan Smoak (also known as “Orphan X”) has been raised in a top-secret government institution. Now a clandestine fixer who helps the desperate, he has been assigned to handle a surly teenage girl, Joey, but the two are soon on the run from the sinister director of the Orphan programme. Hurwitz works with familiar elements of the thriller genre, but his quiet intelligence singles him out. With the honourable exception of John Buchan, the history of political figures writing thrillers has hardly been a distinguished one, so readers may approach Saturday, Bloody Saturday (Orion, £18.99) by ex-New Labour facilitator Alastair Campbell with some trepidation. And while ex-Burnley footballer Paul Fletcher as co‑author may guarantee sporting authenticity, it hardly adds literary lustre. In fact, this turns out to be a surprisingly adept work. Set in 1974, the book explores elements of IRA terrorism along with political and personal responsibility. An IRA hit squad is planning an assassination during a British general election, while a beleaguered football manager is trying to keep a grip on his team after a series of defeats. When an away game draws them to London, the worlds of football and terrorist ideology are on a collision course. The writing is rarely more than functional, but firmly at the service of the lively narrative.

The prize-winning Nigerian novelist was invited by France’s foreign ministry to appear as guest of honour at the Institut Francais’s cultural event La Nuit des Idées. Interviewed by the French journalist Caroline Broué, Adichie was asked if there were bookshops in Nigeria. “When you talk about Nigeria in France, unfortunately there is not much said about Nigeria, but when people talk about Nigeria it’s about Boko Haram, it’s about violence, it’s about security,” said Broué. “I should like you to tell us something about Nigeria which is different, talk about it differently, and that is why I’m saying are there bookshops? Of course I imagine there are.” In a video of the event, Adichie is shown reacting calmly to the question. “You know I think it reflects very poorly on French people that you’ve had to ask me that question. I really do. Because I think, surely it’s 2018. I mean, come on. My books are read in Nigeria. They’re studied in schools, not just in Nigeria but across Africa and it means a lot to me,” says the author. “Because obviously I’m very grateful to be read everywhere in the world but there’s something about being read by the people about whom you write.” Adichie later took to Facebook to expand further on the incident. “I do not expect a French person to know almost everything about Nigeria. I don’t know almost everything about France. But to be asked to ‘tell French people that you have bookshops in Nigeria because they don’t know’ is to cater to a wilfully retrograde idea – that Africa is so apart, so pathologically ‘different’, that a non-African cannot make reasonable assumptions about life there,” she wrote. “Bookshops are in decline all over the world. And that is worth discussing and mourning and hopefully changing. But the question, ‘Are there bookshops in Nigeria?’ was not about that. It was about giving legitimacy to a deliberate, entitled, tiresome, sweeping, base ignorance about Africa. And I do not have the patience for that. Perhaps French people cannot indeed conceive of Nigeria as a place that might have bookshops. And this, in 2018, in our age of interconnectedness and the internet, is a shame.” Adichie’s popular 2009 TED talk, The Danger of a Single Story, saw the novelist speak about the dangers of reducing a country or a people to a single narrative. “If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa was from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and Aids, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner,” she said in the talk. Adichie wrote on Facebook that she hoped the French journalist “would not be publicly pilloried” for her question. The author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun said she had subsequently learned that Broué “was trying to be ironic, to enlighten by ‘impersonating the ignorant’, but because she had not exhibited any irony until then, I didn’t recognise it”. She added that her favourite bookshop in Lagos was Jazzhole, found on Awolowo Road in Ikoyi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/04/jo-brand-bullies-are-lurking-around-every-corner-","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Jo Brand: ‘Bullies are lurking around every corner'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/04/jo-brand-bullies-are-lurking-around-every-corner-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/04/jo-brand-bullies-are-lurking-around-every-corner-","fields":{"headline":"Jo Brand: ‘Bullies are lurking around every corner'","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Another Friday night, another comedy panel show, another biscuit, maybe two. And then suddenly, we sedentary viewers of Have I Got News For You sat up. It was early in November and, responding to a headline about an MP taking his personal trainer to the cinema, Ian Hislop had chuckled: “Some of this is not ‘high-level’ crime, is it?” But Jo Brand, hosting, didn’t smile. The temperature changed quite suddenly. “If I can just say,” she began, “as the only representative of the female gender here today – I know it’s not high-level, but it doesn’t have to be ‘high-level’ for women to feel under siege in somewhere like the House of Commons. Actually, for women, if you’re constantly being harassed, even in a small way, that builds up, and that wears you down.” There was a pause. Then the audience started cheering. Today, Brand, a woman who refuses to be described as a national treasure, preferring “national disgrace”, says she didn’t plan to say a word. “I’m a real hectorer usually – it was lucky I didn’t shout, because otherwise it wouldn’t have taken the wind out of everyone’s sails in the same way. It had an impact.” She says this as if it was a surprise but, of course, Brand, now 60, has been making an impact for decades, first with her monotone standup about men and weight (“I read that book Fat Is A Feminist Issue, got a bit desperate halfway through and ate it”) and today for her dry contributions to primetime TV where, as well presenting the sister programme to The Great British Bake Off, she is often the lone woman on a panel of men. She is so famous that a doctor asked for her autograph while she was in labour. And quietly, behind the panel shows and programmes about cats, Brand has been creating her own genre of sitcom, one that makes you cry. In an episode of Getting On, her award-winning BBC series set on a hospital ward, Brand (as nurse Kim Wilde) stands by as young doctors are introduced to a homeless patient whose “clothing has fused to the skin” and suffers from a perianal abscess. “Go on, have a root around,” insists the consultant, briskly. Another episode revolved around the hunt for the person who’d pooed on a chair. In its jolly mundanity the programme drew on Brand’s early career as a psychiatric nurse, and read as an unlikely love letter to the NHS. Her new show, Damned (now beginning its second series), has a similar feel, with its palette of mud and beige soundtracked by the endless ringing of phones, but is set in the office of a council’s children’s services department. Damned (as in, “Damned if you do… ”) is similarly respectful of those slogging through bureaucracy and government cuts to help people in need, and similarly happy to chuck a few more poo gags at them, too. Series two begins with Brand’s character hobbling into the office having stepped in a pile of it. There the shitty shoe sits, under her desk, as she squabbles with her fellow social worker Al (played by Alan Davies) who must simultaneously determine whether the children of a sex worker should be taken into care. They try putting the shoe in the freezer; against Al’s recommendation, the kids are taken away. “There are so many clichés about social workers,” Brand explains, “when actually they have these horrendous jobs. At a time when things are getting worse, when so many people are in a bad way, and when that inevitably rebounds on to their children, from housing troubles to drug problems to the huge number of men with undiagnosed depression who take it out on their families with violence, I wanted to show that social workers do their best. That they’re human.” Are things getting worse? “Of course they are,” she says, with some weariness. “Food banks exist. We’re seeing new extremes of poverty – this morning I heard about a woman who could only afford to feed her child, so all she had all day was tea. I mean, choices are made on what the country spends its money on, and I disagree with those choices.” Unexpectedly, she smiles: “But I sometimes feel like I have to make a case for being allowed to care – I can practically see that Rees-Mogg person mouthing ‘champagne socialist’.” That famous cackle. Brand consults a social worker when writing the scripts for Damned, but often they have to water down the horror of his stories; she wants you to have a chuckle while considering human suffering, not hang yourself with the HDMI lead. “There’s never enough sadness in sitcoms,” Brand says. “Which is a shame, because we need to laugh as a defence. Being a nurse you become aware of the extremities of human behaviour, and you need a tasteless and appalling sense of humour sometimes. When you see people at their absolute worst, the only thing you can do is joke.” She looks wistful, suddenly, and sits back. “I miss lots about nursing, actually. Mainly the feeling of being tightly connected to a group, because there’s a fair bit of violence on an emergency unit – I remember machetes, knives, a gun once. So you have to trust everyone completely, which makes for very good friendships. I try to repeat that now by choosing a cast of my mates.” Alan Davies has known Brand for 30 years – he’s seen her mature, he says. “But she’s still very naughty at heart. Her line-learning is hopeless, her continuity all over the shop, her listening is highly selective and she is normally eating sweets at exactly the wrong moment, but all of those cracks and fissures that would get you turfed out of drama school are the things that help her get through long days without feeling too tired and sad to continue.” One of Brand’s small pleasures is an hour on Mumsnet. Partly because of the usernames. “My favourite is ‘EatShitDerek’. I’m dying to know the story behind that one.” Partly because she’s a mother, of two teenage girls. And partly because she feels it’s a good reflection of people’s attitudes to controversial topics. “I understand the generational gap in feminist thinking, but the problem comes when the conversations are shut down – they need to be discussed. As a nurse, for instance, I learned that five times as many black people were diagnosed as schizophrenic than white people, and I wanted to know why. You can’t explore difficult questions without offending some people. So I had to admit I was coming from a point of ignorance, and then start a conversation.” She worries about “no-platforming”. “If older feminists’ opinions are suppressed, where do we go next? They did a lot of work to move women forward, they can’t be forgotten. But the anger that appears when people do try to talk – even around something as gentle as Caroline Criado-Perez’s plan to put a woman on the £10 note. She got death and rape threats. Who are these people threatening her, and why are they so angry?” One evening, she was compering an awards ceremony, and a single advertising agency was winning every prize. When they inevitably won the final award, Brand rolled her eyes into the microphone, and tutted: “Not them again.” The crowd laughed, but when the agency’s CEO arrived on stage to receive his trophy, he whispered in her ear: “I always knew you weren’t funny, but I never realised what a cunt you were.” “He did it to humiliate me, and it worked – I felt like I was shrinking. But then I took the microphone back and told the audience what he’d said. And I’d never heard 1,500 people gasp before. These bullies are lurking around every corner, but it’s worse when they’re anonymous online – at least in print you know where it’s coming from.” When Brand started doing comedy in the 80s, under the stage name The Sea Monster, she became used to sneery hecklers and angry reviews. “In fact, I found it hilarious to stand outside myself, and really see how the press saw me. It was slightly pantomimey, that man-hating lesbian thing, but it was mischievous, and the commentary didn’t always feel abusive.” While she believes it’s easier to be a female comic today than it was 30 years ago – there’s the choice now, she says, to be subtle, to not have to shout over all the blokes – the culture around the jokes is less welcoming. “We’re a crueller society than we were before. I think reality TV helped create this nasty edge, encouraging a Roman colosseum-style judgment.” She smiles almost nostalgically at the good old days, when all the rotten remarks about her talent and appearance would come with a byline. That issue of anonymity, of facelessness compared with openness and robust debate, is one Brand returns to a lot. Often, too, she’s shockingly generous. Where one might expect her to be a bit ranty, she’ll surprise you with quiet thoughtfulness. Perhaps it’s her tired wisdom, perhaps it’s that the Brand we see on telly is still “slightly pantomimey”, but she balances every thought with a care that, in a time of noisy opinion seems almost… radical. Does anything still make her angry? She considers it carefully. “One thing that does drive me mad is when women are called ‘ladies’. It implies a feminine subservience, an obsession with appearance, a waiting to be manoeuvred, a weakness, a quietness. I’ve had to stop myself from shouting, ‘It’s WOMEN!’ many times. It matters to me!” Apart from that, her life, one where her job regularly involves sitting next to a Jeremy Clarkson or Quentin Letts, is full of moments where she chooses to give rightwing men a chance. “Panel shows are not the forum for saying: ‘I hate these people’s values.’ In the long run, more hatred is not a good thing. And I don’t necessarily hate these men. I can’t, I’d spend my whole working life angry.” Though Ian Hislop has some quiet reservations about the editing of that Have I Got News For You moment, commenting on it for the first time, he says he’d been responding to a couple of different questions about the Westminster sexual harassment dossier, “Neither of which were about sexual harassment. I felt slightly miffed at how the story was misrepresented.” He, like many, is a huge fan of Brand’s. “What she said was eloquent and measured, and struck a chord. It was terrific.” He refuses to confirm a rumour he’s agreed to a pay cut for Have I Got News For You in moves for the BBC to try to close the gender gap, instead choosing to focus on Brand. “I do look forward to her hosting. I tease her that when we first met she was this radical feminist Sea Monster, and now she’s the country’s sweetheart, who goes on TV to talk about cakes. And through it all she’s retained a sense of who she is and what she believes in.” When John Humphrys’ conversation with Jon Sopel was leaked, and they appeared to joke about the BBC’s pay gap row, Brand “enjoyed that window into John Humphrys’ mind. Though we all take the piss when we think we’re safe. But it does show what they really think about the pay gap – that they don’t take it seriously. It pisses women off when we feel a genuine cause for anger, and are unsupported by men. Whether it’s something like the pay gap, or someone shouting, ‘Great knockers!’ at a woman in the pub, it’s really common that men will just look away. Things are only going to change when the majority of men step up and support women.” She understands, though, the inclination to stay quiet today, whether about the pay gap or harassment in the film industry. “I presume more people didn’t speak up because they felt ashamed. And now there’s this judgment about how early they spoke up, whether it was after other women had done the hard work, whether they simply turned up in a black dress. This question of guilt, of who’s more guilty than the others. But if there’s not a supportive network then, of course, people aren’t going to risk their careers, their families.” So often, she points out, people are made to choose between “having principles or earning a living”. When she was eight her headmaster in Kent explained politics to them. Conservatives, he said, want to keep everything the same, and Labour want everything to change. When she repeated this at home her parents corrected her, and it seems she’s been engaged ever since. Her mother, now in her 80s, is a social worker. There’s a YouTube clip of her being kicked out of a council meeting in Ludlow. “A minute later she returns, having forgotten her handbag, then on her way out she grabs the microphone and starts shouting into it.” Brand tells the story with pride – the genes are strong. Is she positive about the future? “Well, society goes in cycles, politics goes from left to right then back again, comedy goes from leftwing humour in the 80s to tax-dodging comics in the 90s, so I’m sure everything will turn again soon. Billy Connolly used to say: ‘The desire to be a politician should bar you for life from ever becoming one.’ People who go out to seek power are scary people.” Does that mean Brand has no plans to stand for the Labour party? Her fans will be disappointed. “I’ve spent a long time doing things other people want me to do. Now I’m going to be selfish. All I want to do is read and walk. Besides, I’m too knackered to be prime minister.” She shrugs. “Sorry.” Damned returns to Channel 4 this month"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/30/duncan-steen-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T12:23:51Z","webTitle":"Duncan Steen obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/duncan-steen-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/30/duncan-steen-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Duncan Steen obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My friend Duncan Steen, who has died of cancer aged 65, was perhaps best known as the reader of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations on Naxos AudioBooks, which has sold in the tens of thousands. However, under the name of Jinananda he was also widely recognised as a teacher of, and writer on, Buddhist meditation. Having written some secular books, including The Essential Englishman (1989), and translated Sophocles’ Oedipus the King (recorded with Michael Sheen in the title role for Naxos AudioBooks), he went on to devote his literary skills almost exclusively to Buddhist topics. He produced a string of titles based on the seminars of his teacher, Urgyen Sangharakshita, as well as The 100 Minute Buddha (2009) and Karma and Rebirth in a Nutshell (2009). He used his commanding voice to become an accomplished audiobook reader of Buddhist and philosophy titles – including the Stoic classic of Marcus Aurelius, for which he received a string of plaudits. “Steen sounds like a soldier and a dignified ruler, and it is so easy to imagine Aurelius himself narrating his Meditations,” said one reviewer. Born in Bedford, to Christopher Steen, a classics teacher, and Robin (nee Carson), Duncan went to Bedford school, where his father taught, before disappearing on the hippy trail in the 1970s. After a spell as an antiquarian bookseller back in London, he became involved with the UK-based Triratna Buddhist Community before moving into the men’s community of the West London Buddhist Centre, and he was ordained on a retreat in Italy in 1986 as Jinananda, which means “Bliss of the Conqueror”. He taught meditation at the centre and eventually became its chairman. Although a judo black belt and a member of the famous Budokwai martial arts club in London (he wrote on judo occasionally for the Guardian), he spent most of his time in more sedentary pursuits, mainly on the cushion teaching meditation and aspects of Buddhism. When he became ill with cancer, Duncan would cycle up to the Hampstead ponds in north London and swim in winter; and he must be one of the few people to have cycled to his chemotherapy sessions. In 2017 he married his longtime partner, Claudia de Campos, a psychotherapist whom he met at the West London Buddhist Centre. He is survived by Claudia and by his son, Antoine, from his previous relationship with Dominique Autier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/nhs-hospitals-serious-shortages-vital-equipment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"NHS hospitals facing serious shortages of vital equipment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/nhs-hospitals-serious-shortages-vital-equipment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/nhs-hospitals-serious-shortages-vital-equipment","fields":{"headline":"NHS hospitals facing serious shortages of vital equipment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hospitals are suffering serious shortages of vital medical equipment such as ventilators, pumps to administer drugs, and oxygen cylinders during the NHS’s ongoing winter crisis, the Guardian can reveal. The surge in numbers of people needing care has also led to some hospitals running out of beds for patients to sleep in, mattresses to lie on and trolleys to use while they wait for admission. NHS England has said the service is under the most strain it has faced since the 1990s. Patients have faced long waits for beds on trolleys in overcrowded hospitals, more than 100,000 patients have been stuck in ambulances waiting to get into an A&amp;E unit, and senior doctors have written to Theresa May warning that patients have been “dying prematurely” in hospital corridors. For example, Southmead hospital in Bristol has recently faced shortages of equipment including syringe drivers – which staff use to give drugs to dying patients – drip stands, infusion pumps – which ensure patients receive correct doses of fluids and medication – oxygen cylinders, and pressure-relieving mattresses, which help to prevent bed sores. Internal emails show that supply problems recently prompted the hospital’s chief executive, Andrea Young, to warn staff about a severe shortage of face masks, which help limit the spread of infections such as flu. “Please only issue surgical masks to patients as a flu precaution,” she urged. Staff should also not let patients take a walking frame home with them when they are discharged because “we are running very low on stock levels”. A nurse at the hospital said: “The last few weeks have been ridiculous. At weekends, there is often a waiting list to get a pressure-relieving mattress. Nurses who bring patients up to the wards are taking pillows from under patients’ heads because we literally don’t have a pillow to give them back. Pillows are like gold dust. “Staff can spend ridiculous amounts of time searching for equipment and medication,” the nurse added. “Patient care is undoubtedly affected by all of this.” The NHS’s winter crisis has forced many hospitals to open makeshift extra wards, known as “escalation areas”, leaving some short of equipment. A senior doctor at the Royal Aintree hospital in Liverpool said: “Our main equipment shortages have been physical beds for patients to be cared for on wards, and the trolleys used in A&amp;Es to see and treat patients. We’ve run out of both of these at times recently. “When escalation areas are opened at short notice it literally is a scrabble around to find kit and supplies to open a ‘pop-up’ ward area, so equipment shortages will and do occur.” Staff at Mid Cheshire hospital trust, which runs hospitals in Crewe and Northwich, have disclosed that it has also recently faced acute shortages of beds, lockers, drug trolleys, drip stands and infusion pumps. “Trust bosses have had to take action to get additional supplies in but we’ve not run out of anything yet,” one said. Doctors’ and nurses’ leaders voiced alarm at the revelations. “I’ve heard from several colleagues in acute medicine that their trusts have significant shortages of essential equipment such as bilevel positive airway [BiPaP] ventilators, which are needed in this surge of respiratory illness and IT kit – computers – on extra-capacity wards needed to complete patient records and proceed with [giving] care,” said Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine. “I have also heard about a lack of basic items on extra wards such as blood tubes and cannulae, as well as beds, pillows and bedsheets. When staff have to urgently re-open areas [as temporary wards] and there is literally no kit then there is a panic procurement.” Scriven added that one hospital has had to urgently hire extra ventilators as a result of the recent spike in flu and that another ran out of reagents used for testing flu swabs. The worst flu outbreak since 2010-11 has seen up to 758 Britons a week hospitalised for emergency treatment and as many as 240 people a week admitted to an intensive care or high dependency unit. Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “We know that hospitals are constantly short of beds. But the idea that some are dangerously low, or are even running out of vital medical equipment like ventilators and oxygen cylinders would horrify the public. “At the other end of the scale, hospitals should not be struggling to get hold of enough pillows and face masks, which are hardly luxury items.” Scriven said the “financial pressures” facing hospitals as responsible for the shortages. But some trust managers said that “lean procurement” policies relating to equipment and supplies had left them badly prepared for this winter’s spike in demand. The Department of Health and Social care said that hospitals should be able to cope with the extra demands of winter. A spokesperson said: “As part of its thorough and robust planning for winter, which was supported by an extra £437m in government funding, the NHS should have sufficient supplies to deal with periods of increased demand. If there are shortages, national NHS organisations are ready to work with hospitals to ensure a steady supply as patients would expect.” The Guardian has asked NHS England and NHS Supply Chain to respond to the reports of shortages, but neither had replied by the time of publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/26/ghost-towers-half-of-new-build-luxury-london-flats-fail-to-sell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T15:10:50Z","webTitle":"Ghost towers: half of new-build luxury London flats fail to sell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/26/ghost-towers-half-of-new-build-luxury-london-flats-fail-to-sell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/26/ghost-towers-half-of-new-build-luxury-london-flats-fail-to-sell","fields":{"headline":"Ghost towers: half of new-build luxury London flats fail to sell","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, raising fears that the capital will be left with dozens of “posh ghost towers”. The swanky flats, complete with private gyms, swimming pools and cinema rooms, are lying empty as hundreds of thousands of would-be first-time buyers struggle to find an affordable home. The total number of unsold luxury new-build homes, which are rarely advertised at less than £1m, has now hit a record high of 3,000 units, as the rich overseas investors they were built for turn their backs on the UK due to Brexit uncertainty and the hike in stamp duty on second homes. Builders started work last year on 1,900 apartments priced at more than £1,500 per sq ft, but only 900 have sold, according to property data experts Molior London. A typical high-end three-bedroom apartment consists of around 2,000 sq ft, which works out at a sale price of £3m. There are an extra 14,000 unsold apartments on the market for between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft. The average price per sq ft across the UK is £211. Molior says it would take at least three years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats if sales continue at their current rate and if no further new-builds are started. However, ambitious property developers have a further 420 residential towers (each at least 20 storeys high) in the pipeline, says New London Architecture and GL Hearn. Henry Pryor, a property buying agent, says the London luxury new-build market is “already overstuffed but we’re just building more of them”. “We’re going to have loads of empty and part-built posh ghost towers,” he says. “They were built as gambling chips for rich overseas investors, but they are no longer interested in the London casino and have moved on.” Pryor says developers of luxury blocks lining the Thames have failed to sell homes despite offering discounts, incentives and freebies – including free furniture, carpets and curtains and even cars. He adds that new-build towers are proving hard to sell because while they offer luxuries including concierge, gyms and spas, “they’re all the same”. Some developers have delayed construction of projects, while others have taken properties off the market. All 10 of the apartments at the top of the Shard – priced at up to £50m each – remain unsold more than five years after the Duke of York and the former prime minister of Qatar officially opened “Europe’s first vertical city”. Steven Herd, founder and chief executive of MyLondonHome, an agency that specialises in new-build homes for investment, says his firm is struggling under the weight of overseas investors who bought in the last couple of years and are desperate to sell. He says hundreds of Asian investors who had bought London developments off-plan in 2015-16 in the hope of making a quick profit by selling apartments on closer to completion have instead lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. “They intended to flip [buy and sell on] the apartments and make big profits, but it hasn’t worked out like that, and now they are trying to get out at the smallest possible loss.” He adds that in one case a Russian investor bought an off-plan property in 2014 for £3.1m, but couldn’t afford to complete and sold it for £2.55m. Herd says the Nine Elms development, near the new US embassy in south London, was one of the best redevelopment schemes in Europe but consisted of “the wrong properties that Londoners don’t need”. “We need ‘affordable’ one- or two-bedroom apartments priced at £500,000. We don’t need swimming pools and empty rooftop bars with no one living at home to buy drinks at them. There’s just way too many £1.5m-£2m-£3m flats that all look the same. “We’d be much better off with decent quality but lower-spec homes built for actual Londoners. What’s the point in having private cinema rooms that sit empty and resident’s swimming pools with no one swimming in them; it just seems wrong.” In its report, based on interviews with 684 developers across London, Molior says sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth over the last three months of 2017 compared with the previous quarter. “New starts on site also fell by a fifth, but starts still out-paced sales … so the number of unsold units continues to grow.” The report says many developers face a “gloomy picture of falling sales” and are “perhaps starting to become uncomfortable with the emerging situation”. Molior says some inexperienced developers who hoped to cash-in on demand from overseas investors now find themselves “off-pitch in terms of the location/quality/price equation”. “Experienced players are increasingly rumoured to be resorting to ‘Plan-B’, while the fate of newcomers may depend on whether they can afford to sit-it-out or rent-it-out,” Molior says. The consultancy adds that “plan B” would typically involve a “bulk sale”. Hoping for great profits, developers have continued to build expensive towers, while the greatest demand from Londoners is for more affordable homes. Estate agent Savills estimates that 58% of demand in London is for homes priced below £450 psf, but only 25% of homes being built are at this price. Marcus Dixon, head of research at property data service LonRes, says the very peak of the London prime property market was still selling well but it was proving difficult to sell expensive and well-appointed apartments in big towers. “Lots of schemes started two to three years ago and are now coming to market,” he says. “It’s the big towers with lots and lots of units in them [that are proving hard to sell]. Those in Nine Elms [near Battersea power station] and Earls Court which in the less distant past would have been sold off-plan to overseas investors. But the buyers, for various reasons including Brexit, just aren’t there any more for those sort of properties. “The volumes that are coming out of the ground in Nine Elms are huge, and it’s a lot of flats that are all quite similar in terms of spec and price.” Dixon says he expected developers to “go slow” or halt the later stages of developments until they have managed to sell more of the stock they’ve already built. But he adds that slowing production of flats was a lot harder than building traditional houses. “If you’re building an estate of 100 houses in the countryside, you can stop building when they’re not selling,” he says. “But if you’re building a big tower you can’t have anyone living in them until the whole tower is completed.” He adds that that if a homeowner can’t sell their home at the price they’re aiming for they can withdraw it from the market but “for developer’s that’s not a solution – developers in some ways are forced sellers”. Dixon says developers are switching their marketing efforts from overseas to local owner occupiers, “but they compare the price of new-builds to the secondhand market and find that there’s a high premium on new-build towers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2018/feb/02/want-to-know-if-a-leader-is-good-ask-their-team","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Want to know if a leader is good?

Ask their team","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Leaders are often defined by qualities such as empathy, inspiration, and judgement. The key trait of a great leader is self awareness; the ability to understand their own reaction to a situation, the appropriate response, and to put it into practice under pressure. In a recent survey by Top Employers, which polled more than 200 HR directors, leadership was ranked the number-one HR driver in terms of its importance to their business. Mark Whybrow, founder of leadership development consultancy Engage Technique, believes that measuring an individual leader’s understanding of leadership won’t reveal how good they are at making a difference. In his view, the most effective way of assessing leadership is to look at and measure their team. “If leadership is about altering the natural course of events and taking people with you, the best way to assess leadership capability must be to look at the team capability and assess their sense of ambition, purpose, and leadership.” Strong leadership that delivers results is the goal of every organisation – and to develop the next generation of leaders, some companies, such as PepsiCo, have focused on evaluating effectiveness. “PepsiCo has partnered with some of Europe’s best business schools to design learning programmes that embrace virtual technology and the latest thinking,” says Jesper Petersen, vice-president of human resources for PepsiCo UK &amp; Ireland. “Progress has also been made in improving the assessment of the leadership development programmes, using bespoke compass tools that consolidate feedback from colleagues and stakeholders, together with self-assessment and team assessment data.” This has led to enhanced clarity on strengths and development areas, and, ultimately, a heightened level of that key leadership trait, self-awareness. “Only through developing and maintaining an exceptional talent base will we grow our business and deliver superior long-term performance,” says Petersen.

It felt like a turning point, both locally and nationally, in how social housing tenants were being treated. Theresa May admitted: “The support on the ground for families in the initial hours was not good enough … That was a failure of the state, local and national, to help people when they needed it most.” Yet on Monday the Guardian revealed that tens of thousands of people are still living in unsafe homes across the country, with 312 social and private housing blocks wrapped in flammable cladding seven months after the disaster. That 299 of these blocks are likely to breach building controls reveals the state of inertia gripping this government when it comes to looking after the lives of its citizens. Even after a report confirmed that the current system of building controls was not fit for purpose, the government still refused to commit any additional funding to help cash-strapped councils meet the costs of fire safety works. A Shelter housing commission, launched on Wednesday in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy, shows that almost half of families in social housing who reported issues around poor or unsafe conditions feel ignored or are refused help, and a quarter feel looked down on because of where they live. Edward Daffarn, a Grenfell survivor and member of Shelter’s panel, says change will only ever be achieved when social housing tenants are never again “treated like second-class citizens”. In spite of all the promises made after the fire, this commission is badly needed in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In meeting after meeting, councillors have promised to put the needs of the Grenfell Tower community at the heart of their response. It seemed as though they meant it: they committed £235m of their reserves to procuring homes for those who had been displaced. But we continue to hear stories of failure – not just by accident, but seemingly by design. They say they are listening, but their actions paint a different picture. In spite of some evidence of change – the council has signed up to the principles of candour and nondefensiveness outlined in the Hillsborough charter, and has commissioned a report on cultural change from the Centre for Public Scrutiny – these efforts still feel scattergun, piecemeal, undermined by a failure to listen to what residents want. At a local level, the failures are more specific. Residents in nearby Treadgold House and Frinstead House, where I used to be a neighbourhood officer, can see the ruins of Grenfell from their bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens. Yet they are still not getting the help they are asking for. At last week’s meeting of the Grenfell recovery scrutiny committee, three councillors tabled a call to action saying: “The administration of the recovery is very poor. Residents complain that inquiries go unanswered; they do not know who to contact … ” At a public meeting last week, people from the Lancaster West estate, where Grenfell is located, still complained of issues with rubbish collection, intercoms not working, and problems with heating and hot water. Grenfell and its aftermath was a failure of the state, and our ideas of what civil society is. That failure was met by an outpouring of care and support from volunteers in all walks of life, many of whom made sacrifices to provide essential services for the bereaved, survivors and displaced. About 200 community groups have sprung up in the aftermath – brilliant organisations such as Latimer Community Art Therapy and Kids on the Green, whose initial reactions days after the fire have been matched by a continued commitment to creating safe spaces for adults and children who still face lengthy waiting lists for support. The council has repeatedly promised to work with volunteers and the wider community to design services together. Yet as the local authority gets closer to reaching its target of securing 300 homes, it seems that it is back to business as usual, and Grenfell seems to have fallen not only from the central narrative of the news, but also from the council’s own list of priorities. Promises are made and then broken, and people are getting sick of it. They do not trust the local authority, or the government, to change services for the better. Perhaps the most surprising indication of this failure to listen is the proposed eviction of volunteer complementary therapists from the Curve community centre at a week’s notice. This is a group of committed therapists whom the affected communities trust, operating without payment, motivated by a desire to help people heal. Regardless of the procedural reasons for this, it seems like a move guaranteed to demonstrate only one thing: the local authority still thinks it knows what is best for the community, and does not listen. Those made homeless by the fire were promised, famously, that they would be rehoused within three weeks. Seven months on, according to the North Kensington Law Centre, only 54 households have moved into permanent accommodation, and 98 households remain in emergency accommodation. Those who lost loved ones were promised that “no stone would be left unturned in the public inquiry”. Requests from the bereaved and survivors for a panel-led inquiry to include members with a diversity of experience as well as background were rejected by the prime minister a few days before Christmas. At present there is no one working on the inquiry with housing management experience, so at the last procedural hearing in December barristers asked the chair to make sure he requested disclosure of Grenfell tenants’ housing files – the first step in any local authority housing legal disclosure. It will be interesting to see what happens on Wednesday evening at a full council meeting with a planned protest. Since the establishment of the Grenfell recovery scrutiny committee in September, the response to Grenfell has almost fallen off the council agenda, except for a brief update by the leader at the start of each full council meeting. Residents feel they are being sidelined, and this only increases the sense of distress and trauma. It will be crucial to see how the council plans for the local elections in May, at the same time as taking back control of its housing stock from the tenant management organisation. Another community advocate, who did not wish to be named, told me the local authority was making a concerted effort to ensure that criticism is stifled and dissent is quashed. Despite months of being unable to grasp the magnitude of its failures with the response and recovery, the council wants to pull up the drawbridge. Instead of spending time engaging with the community and learning how to provide effective solutions to residents, it is clear that council officers are instead surveying members of the voluntary community on Twitter and Facebook, all the while focusing more on the council’s image, rather than the suffering still deeply felt throughout the borough. In Zadie Smith’s novel White Teeth there is a character who “learns to hold his life lightly”. By failing to respond properly and sensitively to those affected by the fire at Grenfell, or to a system of building controls that is not fit for purpose, this government shows us that it holds all of our lives lightly. From Ladbroke Grove to Croydon, Camden to Slough, the message is still clear: if you live in social housing, or in a private tower block, your life is held lightly. You do not matter. It is this position we must work against with all our might. • Seraphima Kennedy is a former neighbourhood officer at Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-taxpayers-benefits-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:05:42Z","webTitle":"Universal credit to save taxpayers only 2% in spite of benefit cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-taxpayers-benefits-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-taxpayers-benefits-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Universal credit to save taxpayers only 2% in spite of benefit cuts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Universal credit is on course to deliver only marginal taxpayer savings despite driving through huge cuts in benefit payments to many claimants, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The independent forecaster said that even these relatively slender £1bn savings – amounting to 2% of the social security budget – could be knocked off course if ministers reversed potentially unpopular cuts built into universal credit affecting tax credit recipients, disabled people and self-employed claimants. It said political uncertainties and problems with the design and implementation of the much-delayed project, currently around five years behind schedule, meant universal credit presented a “significant risk” to public spending. The OBR added that it was too early to say whether claims made by ministers that universal credit was working – because it had successfully persuaded claimants to move into work or to work more hours – were correct, saying there was “insufficient evidence to judge”. The report was welcomed by the Resolution Foundation as an “authoritative” account of the pressures affecting universal credit, confirming that the system would be less generous than planned because of cuts. The thinktank estimates that universal credit cuts will leave 1m working households an average of £2,800 a year worse off by 2022. David Finch, Resolution’s senior economic analyst, said: “Today’s report should spur a debate about how to get such a large welfare reform right. Now is the time for reforms to ensure it delivers the labour market and wider living standards boost it was originally designed to provide.” The OBR pointed out that some of the gross savings anticipated from universal credit were predicated on driving through cuts to relatively large numbers of families. Public anger over cuts to tax credits, disability benefits, and changes to national insurance contributions for self-employed workers have driven the most significant government welfare policy U-turns in recent years. “The experience of past – typically smaller – welfare reforms is that they often take longer than expected to deliver, save less than anticipated and create political pressure to compensate losers,” the Welfare Trends report published on Thursday said. Universal credit is expected to consume around £63bn of expenditure by the time its rollout is completed in 2022-23, accounting for around two-thirds of working age welfare spending. Around 660,000 people now claim universal credit, a number expected to rise eventually to 7 million. Although its aim of simplifying social security by rolling up six working-age benefits into one payment – including tax credits, housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance – has attracted wide political support, it has been dogged by design and administrative flaws that have left poorer claimants homeless, hungry and in debt. The OBR report states: “The move to universal credit has been – and remains – an enormous design and delivery challenge for the government, notably the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The rollout has already been delayed repeatedly. Universal credit is now designed to save money, relative to the legacy system it replaces, rather than to cost more, as in the original vision.” It adds: “A welfare reform of this scale and nature is also a huge forecasting challenge and a source of significant risk to the Treasury in terms of public spending control.” The OBR estimates that, based on the current design, universal credit will deliver £1bn of net savings to the social security budget by the time it is fully rolled out in 2022 – equivalent to only 2% of the total amount it would have spent on existing benefits had the new system not been introduced. The system has made an estimated £11bn in savings, mainly through cuts to the generosity of universal credit – most notably through reductions to work allowances, which will save around £3bn, and the removal of £2bn in disability premium payments – but it has also incurred £8.5bn in expenses. These include higher take-up of benefits – the “one-stop shop” nature of universal credit means that £2.5bn currently unclaimed by social security recipients who fail to take up all of the benefits they qualify for will be automatically paid – and £1.5bn in transitional protections for people moving over to the new system. The OBR said shortcomings with tools used to measure and monitor the progress of universal credit were “far from ideal”. Many elements of monitoring architecture were “opaque, poorly integrated and take too long to produce robust results”. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Universal credit is about helping people improve their lives – and it’s working. People on universal credit are finding work faster than those on the old system, staying in it for longer, and keeping more of what they earn. And working parents can get up to 85% of their childcare costs back. “Universal credit also supports people who are out of work and it encourages people to manage their money month-to-month, just like they would in work. In the long-term, it will help deliver a welfare system that is sustainable for those who use it and fair to taxpayers who fund it.” However, the OBR report also questions ministerial claims that universal credit delivers improved job market outcomes. It points out that “modest but positive” effects found by trials were based on older versions of the system, not the more complex full system currently being rolled out. The chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, said: “Despite all the damage and upheaval, and the assurances that the benefit is on track, universal credit is bringing minimal savings to the public purse – just £1bn. It also brings at best a slight improvement in people’s chances of working, despite this being one of the central aims of the programme. “The OBR’s findings raise serious questions about whether universal credit in its current form is viable. Yet half our children will be in a household dependent on it so we have to fix it or set it aside.” ‪"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/24/kyle-edmund-australian-open-andy-murray-shadow","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T22:30:00Z","webTitle":"Kyle Edmund: ‘I don’t awe over how far I’ve come, I just get on with it’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/24/kyle-edmund-australian-open-andy-murray-shadow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/24/kyle-edmund-australian-open-andy-murray-shadow","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Edmund: ‘I don’t awe over how far I’ve come, I just get on with it’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are few more grounded players in the turbulent world of professional tennis than Kyle Edmund. But the boy from Beverley knows the time has come to let loose his inner beast if he is to do what no one except those close to him thought was possible until the past few days: reach the final of the Australian Open on Sunday. Standing in his way in the semi-finals is Marin Cilic, the experienced, sometimes brilliant but often brittle Croatian, who is No 6 in the world and won their only previous match, 6-3, 7-6 (5) in the second round of the Shanghai Masters last year. They are both admired and liked in the locker room but it is Edmund who has intrigued strangers in Melbourne with his impeccable manners and humble demeanour. Those who know him best say what you see is the real Edmund, an understated Yorkshireman who arrived in the county 20 years ago with his South African mother and Welsh father, and set about sating his obvious sporting appetite. Russell Parker, who was his tutor and head of sport at school – where cricket and swimming first caught his attention – told the Hull Daily Mail: “Kyle was, and still is, a lovely young man. He was a natural all-rounder at sport but, what really set him apart, even then, was his tenacity and will to win.” Edmund said of the perception of him, “It’s your job. There are quite a few players, in my opinion, who act one way off the court and act another way on the court. When you are in a competitive environment, you do stuff differently. I don’t know too many players who are exactly the same on and off the court, so I think it’s just how it works.” But he does appreciate the passion of his extrovert Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, who spends most of his matches on his feet screaming his head off. “It’s great to have someone in your corner who is really engaged like that. At the same time it has to come internally from yourself, that drive and that firepower. All the guys in my box, I believe in them. It is good to look over and see they are pumped for you, especially when you get in those close moments at the end of sets – that’s when you can feed off them and become really gritty and tough to beat.” Fame has come gradually to Edmund, who spent years striving in the shadow of Andy Murray – a place he felt perfectly comfortable, by the way. When the former world No 1 invited him to his off-season training camp in Miami, Edmund knew it was akin to an anointment from the best player these islands have produced. But away from even that peripheral glare, Edmund toiled in unglamorous surroundings – and lived for several years in digs at the National Training Centre in Roehampton. “You think about that sometimes,” he says, “how far you’ve come. But you don’t awe over it, you just get on with it. From 16 to 20 I was staying at the NTC. London is an expensive place to live so until I could get my own place that was the option. That’s what you have to do growing up. Then, I guess, the perks come later. But you’ve got to earn it. It’s great for me but also for my family, who are really close to me … all the years they sacrificed to watch, to see me do well, is worth it.” Did he ever feel homesick or lonely on tour? “No. If I didn’t like it, I would stop it straight away. No one forces me to do it. That’s the great thing about my parents: they never forced me to do anything. They were very supportive of me and my decisions. I’ve lived away from home since I was 13. Come 20, you get used to it. “You miss home but that’s why you do these things, because you want to reach the pinnacle of your sport. It doesn’t happen overnight. You have to trust the process and do the best you can.” And the best he could do the past 10 days has landed him up in the semi-final of a grand slam against Cilic, a seasoned campaigner who has won a slam – the US Open in 2014 – and has shown flashes of his pedigree across the tour since 2010, when Murray stopped him in Melbourne at this point of the tournament. Murray, who has slipped to No 20 in his enforced absence and whom Edmund will pass in the rankings if he reaches the final – will be watching his friend and protege again at home in Surrey, no doubt with his finger hovering over his Twitter button. There is at least a decent chance his reaction will be the same thing he tweeted when Edmund outlasted the world No 3, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarter-finals: “Wow!” The boy from Beverley has moved to the Bahamas, where the weather and tax are more amenable, but he surely knows his Yorkshire roots. The last player from Beverley to make a noise in the tennis world was an amateur called Dr John Gregory. In 1929, he made the long boat journey to Melbourne to compete in the Australian Open – and won it"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/27/last-flag-flying-review-bryan-cranston-steve-carell-laurence-fishburne","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T08:00:44Z","webTitle":"Last Flag Flying review – a trio of terrific performances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/27/last-flag-flying-review-bryan-cranston-steve-carell-laurence-fishburne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/27/last-flag-flying-review-bryan-cranston-steve-carell-laurence-fishburne","fields":{"headline":"Last Flag Flying review – a trio of terrific performances","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Three former marines who served together in Vietnam reunite after 30 years to bury the son of one of them – a 21-year-old killed in Iraq in the latest of America’s unwinnable wars. This stirring but slightly overcooked comedy-drama from Richard Linklater is a sequel of sorts. It was based on the novel by Darryl Ponicsan, which itself is a follow-up to The Last Detail (filmed by Hal Ashby in 1973). A trio of terrific performances prevent this road movie from getting bogged down in its wallowing score and on-the-nose message. Bryan Cranston, playing hard-partying reprobate Sal, is the showiest. Cranston attacks his lines with the same gusto with which Sal polishes off the whiskey shots that punctuate his day. Laurence Fishburne has fun as the man of God who has renounced his wild years but not quite let go of his salty language. But Steve Carell, playing grieving father Doc, is the one who resonates. His voice is a wispy husk of a thing, the meat stripped off it by suffering.

The case, Mundy v the Sloane Stanley Estate, involved a small flat in Chelsea where the lease had fallen to less than 23 years and the freeholder was seeking £420,000 to agree an extension. Campaigners had hoped that a ruling could slice as much as half off the cost of extending a lease or buying a freehold. But the court found in favour of the Sloane Stanley Estate, in a major victory for owners of freehold land, such as the Duke of Westminster’s Grosvenor Estate. The challenge had been led by surveyor James Wyatt of Parthenia Valuation, who argued that a system of lease valuation commissioned on behalf of the Duke of Westminster more than 20 years ago was invalid. But lawyers acting on behalf of the Sloane Stanley Estate, which controls land around London’s Sloane Square, King’s Road and Fulham Road, said the Parthenia valuation model proposed by Wyatt was now “consigned to history”. Kerry Glanville, a senior partner at Pemberton Greenish, said: “The court of appeal has today handed down its decision in the Mundy case. Effectively, the Parthenia model deployed on behalf of the tenant ... has been consigned to history, at least in its current form. “This case shows, however, that until the ‘holy grail’ for determining relativity is found, the courts and tribunals will tend to favour a valuation approach which is based as closely as possible on relevant market evidence and the application of valuation judgment and experience in applying appropriate adjustments.” So-called “relativity graphs” are used by property experts to set the value of short leases relative to the freehold, with graphs drawn up by surveying firms Gerald Eve and John D Wood, commissioned by the Grosvenor Estate, currently the standard version in use. But Wyatt said the battle is far from over. Speaking after the ruling, he said: “Now we need the government to act. Sir Peter Bottomley MP said that if the court of appeal did not overturn the decision, parliament will prescribe relativity by statute.” In December the Department for Communities and Local Government said it would be “working with the Law Commission to make the process of purchasing a freehold or extending a lease much easier, faster and cheaper”. The valuation model proposed by Parthenia Valuation is understood to be among those being considered in the department’s reform. John Stephenson of Bircham Dyson Bell, whose firm represented Mundy, said: “For the moment it appears that the Gerald Eve graph will remain in use until a more accurate method of valuation is tested in the tribunal, or the government intercedes with an amendment to the legislation. Unless and until this happens, leaseholders will have to pay a higher price than some of them feel they should for extending their leases or buying their freeholds. In London alone, this means nearly 500,000 flats and houses with leases under 80 years left to run and needing to extend in the near future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/28/documentaries-oscars-baftas-nominees-city-ghosts-matt-heineman-raoul-peck-","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Want to win an Oscar?

Stay on the straight and narrow","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The nominations for best documentary at the Oscars and Baftas are in! Awards season can be a frustrating time for us doc makers: a nomination can send a film into the rarefied club of nonfiction titles that reach a wider audience (in 2016, 108 documentaries were released in UK cinemas, but nearly all at a limited number of sites), so we want to see the films we most admire make the list. But Oscar and Bafta nominees are chosen by the organisations’ members, a pool of voters mainly interested in fiction features. This usually makes for unadventurous lists; rarely do they point you towards the best, most innovative nonfiction films of the year. This year’s Oscars shows some progress. It’s right that Strong Island made the list. Directed by a black, transgender director (Yance Ford), it tells the story of his brother’s murder and unpicks issues of racial discrimination with a passionate fury. The Bafta shortlist includes Raoul Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro (nominated for last year’s Oscars), a grenade thrown into liberal conversations about race that adapts a James Baldwin manuscript and daringly retains his non-linear style of thought. But these films are exceptions. Across both awards, many voters, and some critics, still appear to regard documentaries as information exchange devices rather than actual films. Instead of selecting movies that are visual or emotional triumphs, priority is given to “single idea” documentaries about well-known people or issues or simply those with the biggest marketing spend. An Inconvenient Sequel is on the Bafta list arguably because voters have heard of Al Gore, saw the first film and know that climate change is important. But it’s as conventional in form as documentaries come, with an all-knowing narrator who allows for no doubt or ambiguity in his positive worldview. Sports doping documentary Icarus, which appears on both lists, has achieved a higher profile since its initial release after the Russian Winter Olympic team was banned. But its great scoop comes by accident halfway through, making for an unbalanced film. Of 2017’s highlights, Fred Wiseman’s remarkable Ex Libris didn’t make either list. Three fly-on-the-wall hours inside New York’s public library system, its long observational scenes make it one of the bravest films of the year. (In the case of the Baftas, a documentary needs to have had a UK cinema release to be considered, meaning Ex Libris was not eligible.) Unexpectedly, director Agnes Varda and muralist JR’s delightful Faces Places made the Oscars list. A joyous and mischievous whirlwind, it’s about making “ordinary” faces famous for a day by pasting giant posters of them on remote rural buildings in France. But it’s not on Bafta’s list, which has a diversity problem. Four nominations for male directors and one for a female co-director(for a film about a man) is not an accurate representation of the year in docs. There’s no room, for example, for Carol Salter’s brilliantly deadpan Chinese funeral film Almost Heaven, nor three more formally experimental documentaries: Casting JonBenet, a postmodern hybrid about the nature of truth; All This Panic, an uncomfortably intimate and ambiguous tale told over several years about being a teenager; and Jen Brea’s Unrest, an issue-led film about defying medical and media scepticism that works both as home movie and investigative documentary. So who will win? Bafta has nominated a genuine original in City of Ghosts, Matt Heineman’s love letter to citizen journalism in Syria. Unflinching in investigating masculinity, sadness and violence, it’s a difficult film that offers no answers. It would be a well-deserved winner. And I would love to see Faces Places win the Oscar. In 2017 the documentary form was pushed forward and, in nominating Faces Places and Strong Island, the Oscar list has at least partially acknowledged that.

Do join us tomorrow for coverage of Federer v Chung, when Jacob Steinberg will be back and following proceedings. Thanks for reading/emailing/tweeting etc. Bye! And here’s the match report from our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell: As for Cilic, a repeat of the 2017 Wimbledon final possibly awaits – if the old hand Roger Federer overcomes the challenge of the young upstart Hyeon Chung in tomorrow’s semi-final. Cilic was reduced to tears on Centre Court during his straight-sets defeat last year as he struggled with injury, so he’ll feel he has a point to prove in Melbourne – if indeed it is Federer he faces. Federer would of course be the favourite but Cilic has beaten the GOAT in the crunch moments of a slam before – having swept past Federer in the semi-finals of the 2014 US Open on his way to the title. So Edmund’s surprise and superb Australian Open run comes to an end. But this has still been a coming of age for the 23-year-old. The key is that he now builds on reaching his first grand slam semi-final rather than having a let-up, as Johanna Konta did after reaching the last four at Wimbledon last year. If he does, a place in the top 10 could beckon. He’s going to have to get used to the extra attention on tour and back in Britain; Andy Murray can help him deal with that. Of course Edmund will be sorely disappointed but he does have the welcome distraction of leading Britain in their Davis Cup tie next week against Spain – minus Rafael Nadal – in Marbella. Cilic – who always speaks so well – offers his thoughts: In that second set, I was up and down in my game. He started to serve quite good and release a few of his forehands. I just stayed mentally focused and tried to play every single point. In the third game in the third set when I broke him, he let a couple of balls go. With his movement, he was a bit restricted. Obviously that second break was extremely crucial. He’s playing great tennis and last couple of years, he’s improved a lot. The five-set matches this tournament left some scars on his body. Definitely, he has a bright future ahead of him. Today was a different intensity than my match with Rafa. I think overall I’m feeling really good. Now I have two days off so it’s going to be a nice one on Sunday. So what if Cilic faces Hyeon Chung in the final? He played a few extremely great matches here, a great run. The courts suit him. It’s amazing to watch him and great to see him coming up. And what if it’s a certain Roger Federer? Roger is always looking to play extremely aggressive. But I think with my own game, if I’m playing aggressive, I can match him. Obviously it’s difficult if you’re running around and he’s controlling things. Cilic takes the opening point when Edmund overcooks a forehand. 15-0, which turns into 15-all. Given how Cilic likes to bounce the ball a la Djokovic in the crunch moments, he’s being relatively quick here. He doesn’t seem to be feeling the nerves, he’s well on top. He settles matters at the net to bring up 40-15, two match points. A swinging serve out wide and Edmund can’t return it! Cilic holds his arms aloft because he’s the first Croat – male or female – to reach an Australian Open final! Edmund is clearly spent – but he wastes little time in walking off court, allowing Cilic more time to soak in this straightforward straight-sets victory. Third set: *Cilic 6-2, 7-6 (4), 5-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund prods a tired backhand well long and it’s 30-40, break point. It’s then Cilic’s turn to misfire over the baseline. Deuce. The Croat follows it up with a meek effort into the net. Advantage Edmund. Cilic sprints into the net having hit deep, and Edmund can’t get that back into play. Deuce. Advantage Edmund. Deuce. There was perhaps a pained cry from Edmund after hitting that serve. Cilic then balloons a backhand so high it probably landed halfway to Sydney. Edmund’s advantage. Deuce No4. Advantage Cilic, his second break point. Edmund’s effort it out and surely it’s endgame for Edmund now. Cilic will serve for a place in the Australian Open final. Third set: Cilic 6-2, 7-6 (4), 4-2 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Apologies – score issues – do refresh the page if you haven’t in a while. Cilic charges to 40-0 in the blink of an eye, and is soon swatting the balls back at Edmund to serve after holding to love. Third set: *Cilic 6-2, 7-6 (4), 3-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) The aggression Edmund has on court belies his shyness off it. Woof, a huge forehand gets him to 30-all. At 40-30, a backhand on the run drops just wide. Edmund is almost limping now. He finds enough energy to get to his advantage, but then is down on his haunches after falling back to deuce. It’s Cilic’s advantage for a second break in this set – almost a match point. Cilic skips around the court, is in charge of the point ... but then makes the error! Deuce. Advantage Edmund. And he holds rather fortuitously when his tired effort clips the net before trickling over. He needs all the luck he can get. Third set: Cilic 6-2, 7-6 (4), 3-1 Edmund* (*denotes next server) A rare moment for Edmund to smile as he whips a forehand cross-court winner past Cilic, who’s stranded at the net. Edmund applies more pressure, getting to deuce and then pulling Cilic back to a second deuce. Soon Cilic has advantage again before Edmund batters the sideline to within about a millimetre of its life with a backhand winner. Edmund is hitting out; he doesn’t have the legs to put in the hard yards. A third deuce. But from there Cilic holds to consolidate the break. Third set: *Cilic 6-2, 7-6 (4), 2-1 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund is serving first in the third set. He’s able to put the scoreboard out of his mind to hold to 15. Andy Murray will retain his British No 1 status if Edmund loses this match, though given that Murray is unlikely to return from injury until the British summer, Edmund would still be poised to overtake the Scot in the rankings. Speaking of whom, this is very different to watching a Murray match, isn’t it? Despite a few run-ins with the umpire, Edmund doesn’t display any of the external angst that Murray does. Where’s the chattering and chuntering? I don’t think he’d be called a drama queen. Cilic replies with a smooth hold of his own – before breaking a weary Edmund to 15. The mountain has become even steeper for the Brit. Cilic makes an error on the first set point but isn’t in the mood to do so on the second. He bludgeons a backhand down the line, lets out a huge roar, and strides back to his chair knowing he’s only a set away from his third grand slam final – having won the US Open in 2014 and reached the Wimbledon final last year. It’s looking bleak for Edmund; he’s never won from two sets down and he doesn’t appear to be in the physical condition to do so today. But there’s a first time for everything, right? Second set tie-break: Cilic 6-3 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Some Hawk-Eye drama - they’ll replay the point. Cilic sends down not one but two nerveless overheads for 5-3. And it’s soon 6-3 and three set points for a two-set lead ... Second set tie-break: *Cilic 4-3 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund has the crowd on their feet as he pulls off an improbable backhand winner from a deep return! There’s nothing to pick between them as they switch sides, but Cilic grabs the first mini-break when, after trading backhands, Cilic opts for a smart change of approach and fires a forehand down the line. Second set tie-break: Cilic 3-2 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Edmund chops his return long before slicing another backhand beyond the baseline. All the points have gone to the server so far. Second set tie-break: *Cilic 1-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) Two big serves – one from Cilic and one from Edmund – and the opening two points are shared. The pair rally on the second, and Edmund prevails. Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 6-6 Edmund (*denotes next server) So are we heading for a tie-break? It looks that way as Edmund ekes out a 30-15 advantage, which turns into 40-15 when Cilic misses his return. Cilic goes to Hawk-Eye to challenge Edmund’s serve. It clipped the line. So 40-15 stands. Thwack, Cilic swats down a forehand from up high and Edmund isn’t getting that back. 40-30. Crack, as Cilic rips Edmund to shreds with another forehand for deuce. But Edmund hauls himself up for advantage and then game. It’s tie-break time! Second set: Cilic 6-2, 6-5 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Move on, there’s little to see here. Cilic holds to 15. Back to you, Kyle ... Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 5-5 Edmund (*denotes next server) An inauspicious start as Edmund loses the first point. A longer rally plays out on the second, and Cilic blinks first, prodding long after a deep and probing stroke from Edmund. 15-all. Again, Edmund emerges victorious from a baseline duel – 30-15 – but John McEnroe points out on Eurosport that Edmund could do with venturing to the net a bit more. Edmund’s second double fault of the day makes it 30-all. A crunch moment as Edmund reaches for game point and Cilic for set point. Edmund has a little grumble to the umpire about a light on the camera at the back of the court, which is bothering him, but he regroups for 40-30. And he holds when Cilic clatters beyond the baseline. Second set: Cilic 6-2, 5-4 Edmund* (*denotes next server) A rare double fault from Cilic, in fact his first of the match. 0-15. 0-30, after an excellent Edmund forehand. Cilic goes wide on his first serve – he’s not landed a first serve during this game – but Edmund can’t take advantage on the second serve. 15-30. For a moment it looks like it’ll be 15-40, as Cilic’s backhand clips the top of the net and seems set to skid wide ... but it lands in and Edmund rams into the net. 30-all. 40-30, what a difference a first serve makes. Game. Cilic goes into lockdown mode, winning four points on the spin, and Edmund must hold serve to prevent himself from falling two sets down. Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 4-4 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund’s footwork and body language is so much better than it was a few games ago. Suddenly this is the Edmund of the past few weeks, the Edmund who defeated last year’s US Open runner-up Kevin Anderson in the first round and who downed the world No 3, Grigor Dimitov, in the quarter-finals. He holds to 15. There’s not much giving on serve right now. Second set: Cilic 6-2, 4-3 Edmund* (*denotes next server) But whatever Edmund can do – Cilic holds to love himself, showing wonderful variety on serve. Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 3-3 Edmund (*denotes next server) That run-in with the umpire may be the best thing that’s happened to Edmund in this semi-final. Fired up, he whizzes through his service game 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. The aces are starting to flow and Rosengren – who must have taken leave of his senses before this match because he’s wearing the same pink ensemble as Edmund – is back on his feet clapping. Second set: Cilic 6-2, 3-2 Edmund* (*denotes next server) An uncharacteristic outburst from Edmund, who’s remonstrating with the umpire when Cilic is awarded the opening point after a Hawk-Eye challenge. “Get the referee, I’m not having it,” the usually mild-mannered Edmund says. “I can’t get the referee,” the umpire replies – but then here the referee is. But Edmund’s protests fall on deaf ears. His beef is that Cilic’s serve was called out as he was hitting the return – which he then missed. But Hawk-Eye showed Cilic’s serve was in and the Croat was given the point rather than playing a let. Anyway after all that, it’s 15-0 to Cilic. An angry Edmund lets rip and it’s 15-all. Backhand winner down the line, 30-15. Edmund is swinging and the crowd are screaming. 30-all. 40-30. Cilic does well to hold. Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 2-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) Rosengren is trying to encourage his charge when Edmund slides 15-30 down. Perhaps it does the trick, because Edmund rallies to 30-30. But then he slips to 30-40, break point. He looks flat, there’s very little intensity. Edmund does fire down an ace for deuce – and then Cilic kindly offers his opponent a bit of help with a lolloping forehand. There haven’t been too many of those today. Advantage Edmund. And he holds. He needed that. Second set: Cilic 6-2, 2-1 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Edmund lets rip on the forehand side before crashing down the smash – that will have felt good – but the Brit can’t do any more damage on Cilic’s serve and it’s another comfortable hold. The crowd are rather subdued. They’re with the underdog but he’s only fleetingly giving them something to cheer about. There aren’t any chants of “Yorkshire, Yorkshire!” ringing around Rod Laver as there were during Edmund’s quarter-final victory over Grigor Dimitrov. Second set: *Cilic 6-2, 1-1 Edmund (*denotes next server) Plenty of ooohs and aaaahs on the third point, which Edmund takes with a raking backhand that Cilic can’t get back into play. 40-0. Game. Edmund gets in on the love hold act too. That’ll make him feel a bit better. But we still don’t know what the treatment was for. Edmund must be feeling it physically; of course he’s never been this far at a slam before and he’s played two five-set matches – one in 40C heat – to get here. Second set: Cilic 6-2, 1-0 Edmund* (*denotes next server) Edmund is back, nearly eight minutes after the last point was played. Will the timeout give him the much-needed boost he needs? It certainly doesn’t straight away. Cilic, looking so determined and focused, holds to love. Well Cilic did beat Federer on his way to the US Open title in 2014 – when he finds his form the Croat can be a frightening prospect. But sure, whoever Federer plays in the final – if indeed he makes it there – will be the underdog. And Edmund – not Cilic – is now off court receiving treatment. It’s unclear what the problem is. No Cilic doesn’t, and it’s Edmund who’s slipping and sliding after the second point. 15-all. 30-15. 30-all. Edmund could do with making a few more first serves here, his percentage is below 60. And he hasn’t quite found his aim with his forehand either - a miscued strike on that side and it’s 30-40, set point. And to rub salt in Edmund’s wounds, Cilic wins it with a breathtaking forehand of his own, taking a fairly straightforward first set in 35 minutes. But this was never going to be easy for Edmund, was it? He’s British after all. Meanwhile Richard Woods is claiming the joint win: First set: Cilic 5-2 Edmund* (*denotes next server) There again, perhaps Edmund isn’t dwelling on them. He’s made such improvements in his mental approach over the past few months and seems able to compartmentalise, leaving poor points, games and disappointments behind him. Edmund takes the breath away with one shot early in this game but Cilic appears in control at 40-15. Though the Croat appears in a little bit of pain, and is flexing his right leg. 40-30. Edmund would do well to move Cilic around at the moment. That he does, and it’s deuce. An unreturned first serve gets Cilic to advantage, but there he is bending his leg again. Edmund can’t take advantage and Cilic backs up the break, potentially moving him within a game of taking the first set. Will he call the trainer? First set: *Cilic 4-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund is under a little bit of pressure at 15-30. Cilic then strikes deep to Edmund’s right wing and Edmund call only loop long. 15-40, Cilic’s first break points of the match. Cilic clobbers long with his return and is clearly disgusted with himself. But he gets it right on the second break point and there’s almost a hush around Rod Laver as Cilic breaks. The crowd definitely seem to be on Edmund’s side. But how he must be ruing those missed break points in the opening game. First set: Cilic 3-2 Edmund* (*denotes next server) 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. The most straightforward hold of this match so far. And drumroll please. The non-prize for the trivia challenge goes to ... Richard Hudson. The answer: Andy Murray, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Roger Taylor and John Lloyd. First set: *Cilic 2-2 Edmund (*denotes next server) Edmund’s extrovert coach Fredrik Rosengren is leaping out of his seat after the first point. Expect much of that today. Ivan Lendl he isn’t. 15-0. Cilic is able to absorb Edmund’s stinging serve on the fourth point and it’s 30-all. The pair trade backhand after backhand, before Cilic mixes it up with a forehand down the line. The Croat looks to be choking his opponent, but Edmund finds enough air to scramble around the baseline and Cilic makes the error! 40-30. Game. “Hi Katy, I don’t know the answer but I’m going to guess : Edmund, Murray, Henman, Rusedski, John Lloyd, and either Jeremy Bates or Buster Mottram. Surely not Mottram, so I’m probably one short... Looking forward to following the match as I spend the morning on office work,” writes Lizz Poulter. First set: Cilic 2-1 Edmund* (*denotes next server) This match has been billed as a battle of the forehands – coming into this semi-final, Edmund led the tournament for forehand winners on 127, with Cilic in second place on 115 – but Cilic’s backhand isn’t half bad either. He batters a backhand winner down the line for 30-15 and from there goes on to hold. There’s a little bit of confusion at the end of the game when the umpire thinks Edmund has put his arm up to challenge, but it looks like he was just after his towel. First set: *Cilic 1-1 Edmund (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Edmund is called for a foot fault. He takes his cap off, walks up to the chair and queries it with the umpire. It’s certainly strange to foot fault so early in a match. But he recovers and brings up 30-15. Cilic restores parity at 30-all. But Edmund has a little spring in his step after rattling off the next two points to hold. Meanwhile Shankar Mony emails seemingly while sitting on a fence. “Edmund will win because...the improved game, younger legs, he beat the form player Dimitrov. Cilic will win because...grand slam pedigree, he defeated the world No 1, pretty big game. Remember, you read it here first.” First set: Cilic 1-0 Edmund* (*denotes next server) So are you ready? Let’s play. Cilic opens his first service game by bouncing the ball no fewer than 27 times. That will be something to watch during the match – because it’s a surefire sign he’s feeling the nerves. He’d need not have bothered with the bouncing because his serve goes long. The Croat lands his second serve, but Edmund takes the point after charging to the net to pick up the short ball. 0-15. 15-all. 15-30, as Cilic clunks a tight-looking forehand into the net. 15-40, two break points. Edmund has come out firing. But Cilic finds two huge serves. Edmund can only frame the first – which probably lands in row Z – and can’t get the second back into play either. Deuce. Advantage Cilic. Deuce. Advantage Cilic. And from 15-40 down, Cilic is on the board first with an uncomfortable hold. Tik! Tok! Tikity! Tok! The players are warming up, Edmund once again in his pink and black ensemble, Cilic in a more understated white outfit with a splash of turquoise. While we wait for play to start, some trivia: Edmund is the sixth British man to reach the semi-finals of a grand slam in the Open era. Three of them are easy to remember, right? If you can name all five, I’ll give you a prize. Though said prize may just be the glow of knowing you’re correct. Tactics time with Tim. The coin toss. Edmund calls tails. It’s heads. Cilic will serve first. Here comes Edmund, weaving and winding his way through to corridors of the Rod Laver Arena. He starts as he means to go on by arriving first on to court. Cilic closely follows. I’d say Edmund slightly edged the applause there. The head-to-head. Edmund lost his only previous match against Cilic, the Croat winning in straight sets in Shanghai last year, but the British No 2 is a different proposition three months on. Since adding the Swede Fredrik Rosengren to his coaching team, Edmund – who already had one of the most fearsome forehands in the game – has improved his serve, fitness and mental approach. In many ways, Edmund and Cilic are a mirror image of each other. Their games are based around their big serves and forehands – though expect Cilic to come to the net more. Both are likeable, down to earth characters. Cilic may be a bit louder on court than Edmund, but you’re unlikely to see him chucking his racket around. They both do a pretty good job of keeping their emotions in check – but Cilic can be brittle in big moments. A good omen for Britain. The last player from Edmund’s home town of Beverley to make an impact in the tennis world was the amateur Dr John Gregory. In 1929, he travelled to Melbourne to compete in the Australian Open – and won the whole thing. Another good omen for Britain. Andy Murray played Cilic in the 2010 Australian Open semi-finals and beat him – having faced Kevin Anderson in the first round, the opponent Edmund also opened against this tournament. A bad omen for Britain. Murray then lost the 2010 final to Roger Federer. Bah! Edmund says: “There’s no reason why I can’t go out there and put a good level on the court, enjoy the occasion again. I’ll just try to take it in my stride as best as I can. I am loving it right now, the way I’m playing. I’m 23 years old, my first grand slam semi-final. “You dream of lots of things when you’re young. It’s all a dream. But, until it becomes a reality, then it really hits you. You dream of playing in grand slams, first of all. I’ve done that. You dream of hitting with the top guys. I remember being a practice partner for Andy and Rafa and Roger, to warm then up. Then suddenly you’re playing these guys. At first it’s a bit surreal. Then you take it in your stride. You want to beat them. “A dream was to play for my country. I’ve done that. But again, of course the big one is to be in a grand slam final. And the dream is to win.” Cilic says: “For me, it’s another good opportunity. Obviously on paper it’s probably easier to play him than Rafa. But he still deserves to be here. “A big focus is to continue with my own game. I cannot influence him much across the net but I’m going to try to take care of my things on my part of the court.” And all of this after an enthralling women’s semi-final, in which the world No 1, Simona Halep – who has sometimes snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in grand slam matches – showed her mettle in a 6-3, 4-6, 9-7 win over the 2016 champion, Angelique Kerber, saving two match points in the process. For all the talk of inconsistency in the women’s game, it’ll be a final between the top two players in the world, as Halep faces the No2, Caroline Wozniacki, who ended the run of the unseeded Belgian Elise Mertens 6-3, 7-6 (2). Whatever happens to Kyle Edmund from here on in at the Australian Open, you’ve got to admire his sense of timing. The tournament started with a dark cloud hanging over British tennis – as an absent Andy Murray resorted to hip surgery in a bid to save his career – but nears its end with an optimism that even when Murray’s playing days are over, the outlook is bright on the men’s front in this country. Perhaps it’s too soon to call this a definitive changing of the guard. While the 23-year-old Edmund will replace Murray as the British No 1 if he wins today, few observers would discount the latter from wresting back superiority on his planned return later this year. Hip surgery is notoriously difficult to recover from in tennis but just as stubborn is Murray’s determination to succeed. Nonetheless, this does feel like a significant moment, much like when Murray burst on to the scene in the twilight of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski’s careers. Edmund, the Johannesburg-born, Yorkshire-raised and Bahamas-residing world No49, had been to the fourth round of a grand slam only once before this fortnight. But here he is reaching for the final having taken out the 2017 US Open finalist Kevin Anderson in the first round, survived 40C heat to win in five sets in round three and played the match of his life against the world No 3, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarter-finals. Edmund – and nearly everyone else – would have expected he’d be playing Rafael Nadal today. But Marin Cilic is still a formidable opponent and the overwhelming favourite. The Croatian world No 6 is a grand slam champion, having surged to the 2014 US Open title, and there were signs of that form against Nadal on Tuesday before the suffering Spaniard retired injured. This is the second time Cilic has made the last four in Melbourne – in 2010 he was stopped by a certain Andy Murray. Reminders of Murray are everywhere for Edmund. But this is the younger Briton’s chance to step out of his celebrated compatriot’s shadow. The players will be on court at around: 8.30am GMT/7.30pm in Melbourne.

The crest, the result of a previous consultation involving more than 10,000 people according to the club, is of a man giving a salute. The gesture, with the right hand balled into a fist and placed against the heart, is known as the Leeds salute. It has long been associated with the club, but that has not stopped the crest being widely mocked after it was revealed online. After the petition set up by the Leeds fan Steven Barrett and addressed to the club’s Italian owner, Andrea Radrizzani, had gained more than 50,000 signatures by 7pm on Wednesday, Leeds’ chief executive, Angus Kinnear, confirmed that the club will consult supporters again over the crest, which is due to be introduced on the club’s shirts from next season. “We always knew that the introduction of a crest, particularly one that is so bold and such a break away from the traditional conventions of football club crests, was going to create debate and may be controversial,” Kinnear said. “We had confidence in the process we went through to arrive at the design but today we’ve been overwhelmed by the feedback. From my perspective it’s exactly why I love working for this club because the passion and enthusiasm and the commitment of the fanbase is quite astounding. We put the supporters at the heart of everything we do and we are here to make them proud and so, based on some of the feedback we’ve received, it’s evident that the process wasn’t extensive enough and we need to seek further consultation with our fans as we don’t want to do anything that the majority of the fanbase don’t believe in.” Earlier, the club’s announcement had been greeted with bemusement, with criticism veering from observing a similarity between the crest and both communist and fascist art, to comparisons between the new logo and that used on a football video game when licensing an official crest proves too expensive. Some Leeds fans complained that the crest also looks like the label on a packet of the heartburn medicine Gaviscon. The popular Leeds fanzine Square Ball observed on Twitter: “A big glossy, exercise in branding done by a consultant in Shoreditch. We need to go for a soya milk latte and a lie down.” Leeds have a long tradition of renewing their crest. The new badge is the 11th in the 99-year history of the club. “We are now delighted and proud to reveal a new crest that represents the passion and the unique identity that runs deep through the club,” said a Leeds’ statement to announce its latest incarnation read. “Leeds United owes everything to the supporters who have stood by the club through thick and thin. We are delighted and proud to reveal a new crest that reflects the passion and loyalty that runs deep through the club, and celebrates the fans at the heart of our identity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/24/paul-playle-jailed-for-stalking-wife-by-impersonating-ex-boyfriend","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T13:48:22Z","webTitle":"Man jailed for stalking wife by impersonating ex-boyfriend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/paul-playle-jailed-for-stalking-wife-by-impersonating-ex-boyfriend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/paul-playle-jailed-for-stalking-wife-by-impersonating-ex-boyfriend","fields":{"headline":"Man jailed for stalking wife by impersonating ex-boyfriend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man has been jailed for driving his wife to the brink of suicide by impersonating her school boyfriend and subjecting her to an extended campaign of stalking. Paul Playle, 43, set up email and Facebook accounts in the name of Anthony Reynolds that he used to send messages to his wife, Amanda. In those messages he said he was watching her and had a detailed knowledge of her personal life. At the same time, Playle played the role of a loving husband by comforting his wife while she became a recluse in fear of her stalker. “To think it was the one person I believed I could always trust,” Amanda Playle said after her husband was jailed. “I no longer trust anyone anymore.” Sentencing Playle to three and a half years at Lewes crown court, Judge Christine Henson said the evidence was “overwhelming”, adding: “You are the author of your own fate. You watched your wife effectively crumble before you because of the fear she was experiencing from this online abuse.” His wife, a nursery worker, said she was affected so badly by the “unbelievable” ordeal that she had considered suicide. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said she would never understand why it happened, adding: “I am terrified to leave the house, go to work or the shop across the road. I panic when my phone goes off.” The prosecutor, Gareth Burrows, described the lengths to which Playle went to humiliate and control his wife, while at the same time comforting her, as a “worrying and significant feature” of his offending. In the messages, sent between December 2015 and June 2017, Playle would question his wife about previous sexual encounters, calling her a “slag”. He made comments about being able to see her jogging. He hid her passport to try to stop her going on holiday with friends. In one message, sent when she was out shopping and holding a new bag, he said: “Nice handbag, do you want to meet in Starbucks for a coffee?” Playle would also contact his wife’s parents and colleagues, as well as hack into her own accounts to send similar messages. He was caught after sending an image of the entrance to Gatwick airport. Police tracked his car arriving at the terminal and spotted him on CCTV taking the picture. Some of the emails harassing his wife were found to have been sent through his home internet router. Playle denied the crime, claiming he had been “stitched up”. But a jury took less than 30 minutes to convict him of stalking and coercive and controlling behaviour. Standing in the dock in a blue T-shirt, Playle, of Bexhill, East Sussex, lowered his head and cried. Amanda Playle and her husband met when they were 16. She said she was faithful to him during their marriage. “We had hard times but thought we had a stable family,” she said. “My children are devastated. My eldest daughter is a totally different person since the trial.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/24/an-international-tournament-nobody-cares-about-or-understands-the-fiver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T16:02:45Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | An international tournament nobody cares about or understands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/24/an-international-tournament-nobody-cares-about-or-understands-the-fiver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/24/an-international-tournament-nobody-cares-about-or-understands-the-fiver","fields":{"headline":"An international tournament nobody cares about or understands","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"NATION STATE In January 1982, a groundbreaking new quiz-show debuted to great fanfare on ITV. Top of the World was a joint production between Thames Television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and PBS in America, and its format was simple. Three contestants in London, Sydney and Miami would answer questions by satellite about Britain, Australia and America; in the next round, they would be quizzed on their chosen specialist subject, unless they were that week’s returning champion, in which case general knowledge would do; then there was a buzzer round requiring a time lag to allow signals to get around the world and back. The winner returned the following week, though players also competed against 11 other contestants from their own countries across a number of episodes, and eventually the three most successful qualified for the grand final, with the eventual victor (true story) given the keys to one of the cars used in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Tens of viewers worldwide were glued to their sets, and the show was cancelled after one series. Someone in Switzerland was obviously watching, though, because the format of the new Uefa Nations League is a similarly byzantine international affair. The 55 members of Uefa have been split into four leagues based on their Uefa rankings, A, B, 3 and δ, with each league being further divided into four groups of four, or maybe three, whatever, depends really. The three or four teams in the four groups in the four leagues play each other twice, home and away. Then there’s an obstacle race, and a hot-dog eating competition. The winners of each group are then promoted to the higher league, while the losers are relegated. In addition, each league is guaranteed at least four play-off spots in the Euro 2020 qualification process, although if a group winner has already qualified through the normal channels the spot goes to the next best team. Meanwhile the group winners in League A go through to a Final Four knockout tournament to decide the overall winner, and this is what happens when you put middle management in charge of the creative process. The draw was made on Wednesday morning, and in fairness League A, Group 1 looks quite good fun, containing as it does the world champions Germany alongside arch rivals France and the Netherlands. That should be entertaining, providing the big clubs send all of their big stars, which they won’t. Elsewhere, England face Spain and Croatia in League A, Group 4; Northern Ireland will meet Bosnia &amp; Herzogovina and Austria in League B, Group 3; the Republic of Ireland have the chance to once again irritate Wales and humiliate themselves against Denmark in League B, Group 4; and Scotland are lumped in with Israel and Albania in glamorous League C, Group 1. By being drawn in League C’s only three-team group, the Scots have caught something of a break: there’s a better chance of winning the section! Or they’ll only have to suffer four spirit-sapping defeats instead of six. Depends how you want to look at it. All the group matches will take place between September and November later this year, while the Final Four semis, third-place play-off and final will take place the following June. The winner will receive the newly minted Uefa Nations League Trophy, a curly bit of tin designed by That’ll Do Artisan Panelbeaters Ltd. As prizes go, it’s not quite as aesthetically pleasing as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but probably more practical on a day-to-day basis, if you don’t already have a bowl for loose change, car keys, pills for your nerves, etc. And at least Uefa is trying something new. The whole idea, of course, is to get rid of all those international friendlies nobody cares about. Which to give Uefa credit, they’ve successfully done, replacing them with an international tournament nobody cares about or understands. We give it one series.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 9 January 2018: “We are there to set an example” – Martin Glenn lays out one of the FA’s key roles. 24 January 2018: “Following comments made a number of years ago I would like to clarify that they were not and are not a true and genuine reflection of either my character or beliefs, and would like to apologise” – The FA issues a statement from Phil Neville in response to sexist tweets on his account before he was appointed the new England women’s head coach.

The abbreviation rather than the spelling out of [Nasty] Leeds United contributes to the crest being unrecognisable. It was important for us to achieve the following: • Reflect who we are as a Club and remain authentic • Celebrate the fans • Be bold, brave and innovative • Say who we are with pride: We are [Nasty] Leeds United” – Nasty Leeds marketing gurus give good meeting, explaining in bold, brave and innovative bullet points, the reasoning behind their new antacid-referencing club crest.

This has only happened because they’ve died, which has added to the poignancy of the tributes. I know the Fiver is usually the resting place of the world-weary and cynical, but I also know you’re all lapsed idealists. So, which footballers as well-liked as Cyrille Regis and Jimmy Armfield should we know about, without them having to go and die on us?” Matt Emerson. “Further to Tim Scanlan’s glad tidings (Tuesday’s Fiver Letters), boosting Stoke’s hopes of the title, I should add that we have to play Manchester City at home on 10 March in a game whose goals will count double – each one that we score will simultaneously improve our goal difference and worsen theirs. Should we get double figures we’d scarcely need to average 3.5 goals in all our other matches to be slurping champagne out of the Premier League trophy come May” – David Carr Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

And yet no lie is too big it seems and Johnson endures. Any half-decent journalist would have destroyed Johnson’s moon-swan lies immediately, but his Friday morning interview with Nick Robinson on Radio 4 displayed the feeble indulgence we have come to expect from the gumless Today programme. Johnson told Robinson he was looking forward to meeting the moon king, Irdonozur, who he thought was “exactly the sort of person we should be in business with”, and Robinson didn’t even feel the need to point out that no such lunar monarch exists. Robinson didn’t even intervene when Johnson declared that he wasn’t “the least bit scared of moon-picaninnies or moon-bumboys for that matter”, and that he would be taking his friend the convicted fraudster and gold smuggler Darius Guppy to the moon with him, and that Darius would have any disobedient moon-picaninnies and moon-bumboys “knocked to the ground” and covered in horse manure. Footage on CBBC’s Newsround later, of Johnson standing by a bus emblazoned with the legend “Let’s fly to the moon in a swan-drawn basket and knock the moon-bumboys to the ground and cover them in horse manure”, barely even a raised eyebrow from presenter Ricky Boleto, who seemed stricken with a terrible ennui beyond his years at the very thought of more of Johnson’s colossal and time-consuming lies. Meanwhile, predictable newspaper cartoons slung the familiar image of the crash-helmeted Johnson, waving flags while suspended from a zip wire, beneath a flock of soaring swans. Even seasoned political observers finally find themselves asking: what on earth is Johnson playing at? Some think the answer lies in the Dead Cat Strategy, pioneered by the Tories’ former attack dog Lynton Crosby. Crosby’s main contribution to political discourse has been the idea that a massive distraction, such as throwing a dead cat on a table or announcing your intention to fly to the moon with Darius Guppy in a swan-drawn basket, will divert public attention from some ongoing political disaster, such as the entire last 18 months. Some cynics even suggest that the public disgrace of Johnson’s crony Toby Young was actually dead-cat driven. Did the Conservative media machine maintain Young’s implausible career only so as to have a dead cat ready to fling on the table when they needed one? Was Toby Young the Lee Harvey Oswald of the failing Brexit negotiations? I’m not sure that Johnson’s pathological dishonesty is quite that calculated. I suspect Johnson liked the attention that his lies got him. But suddenly he is being trounced in the funny toff stakes by Jacob Tree-Frog and his Brexit lies – the £350m a week for the NHS, the fabled “cake and eat it” trade deal – are dissolving like David Davis in a hail of hot facts. So Johnson is having to mouth ever more vast lies to get the attention he once earned from lesser falsehoods, like a veteran motorcycle stuntman, long past his peak, incrementally driven towards an audience-maintaining jump over a massive lake of sharks that he knows will finally kill him. On my desk is a stack of commemorative Brexit coins, price £4.99 each. I ordered them from a Brexiter on eBay in a moment of mean-spiritedness, because they are emblazoned with the misspelt slogan “I voted to get back our sovereign independance”. The tragedy of it, the black black comedy of the thing. But the coins made me remember the act I did on the fledgling comedy circuit, back in the 1980s, and how it related to the nuclear escalation of Johnson’s weaponised lies. Older comedy fans may remember the early days of “Alternative” comedy, when bills weren’t simply twentysomething standups in trousers remembering recent cultural ephemera. Back then, those pub back-room bills featured a host of absurd “spesh” acts; the Amazing Mr Smith, who sang satirical songs with his head in a birdcage; Steve Murray, who dismembered teddy bears while doing an impression of Tommy Cooper; the Ice Man, a favourite of mine, who stood on stage with a big block of ice, describing how and why it was melting; and the late Malcolm Hardee who, among other things, could make his testicles look like various British wartime politicians. My own spesh involved me stuffing, or giving the impression of stuffing, a succession of coins of various foreign currencies up my back passage, while dressed in a tutu and playing the bodhrán. “And now ladies and gentlemen, the Icelandic 50 kroner coin, the 50 kroner. Here we go…” I was starting to make a name for myself, although admittedly that name was Roger Rectum Currency. Then suddenly, sometime around 1985, along came the uber-clown Chris Lynam, who launched actual lit fireworks from his actual anus, and now a man pretending to put yen into his wasn’t impressive any more. I soon switched to straight standup, as it happened a more lucrative, but arguably less dignified, art form. Suddenly, his lies no longer igniting the public imagination like they once did, Johnson himself is Roger Rectum Currency in his managed decline, needing to draw the public eye with ever more extravagant lies. And maybe I am facing a similar dilemma. The political situation has been so stupid now, for so long, it seems beyond satire. In print, and on stage, I reach for ever more desperate methods to mock it. And then my eye falls on that pile of commemorative British “independance” coins. And I realise I may have stumbled across the answer. I’m sure I have that tutu somewhere.

To attract the best staff, companies need to make when, where and how we work negotiable. In today’s recruitment environment, flexible working practices and healthcare are not nice-to-have benefits – they are a core part of workers’ expectations. Staff aren’t coming to work just to earn money – they want to be happy and thrive. Unlimited annual leave, golden hello packages and annual travel allowances are just some of the perks introduced in recent years. One big insurance company recently announced six months’ fully paid maternity leave. It’s all about accommodating staff. Sir Cary Cooper, visiting professor at Lancaster University, says the recent changes are linked to the recession. “Out of the ashes has come a culture that says: ‘You work hard for us and we’ll give back to you,’” he says. So what does a good workplace look like in 2018? “It is one where there is clarity of purpose, authentic leadership and an effective two-way dialogue,” says Niall Ryan-Jones, head of employee experience at Harrods. “Employees are valued and that is shown through compensation, reward, recognition and communication.” A workplace that reflects the diversity of the markets the company serves is also important, says Chris Wilcock, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) talent acquisition manager at Canon Europe. “A good workplace is where people know what is expected of them, understand how they can contribute to our business goals and, most importantly, know they are valued and trusted to deliver our outcomes,” he explains. Chris Bruney, EMEA talent acquisition team lead at social media management platform Hootsuite, believes the needs of staff have become more comprehensive over time, and that millennials have brought a different perspective to working life. “I’d say factors like culture and work-life balance are now at least as important as the financial package on offer,” he explains. “Companies need to be aware of this and are increasingly having to incorporate flexibility into their employment offering, to appeal to a wider network of talent.” But it’s not just the younger workers having an effect on the workplace – older workers also look for flexibility and a good work-life balance. “We need to develop flexible work practices and mobile technology, so that staff can essentially work anywhere,” says Zofia Bajorek from the Work Foundation. What else do employees look for in their employer? “Career development and learning opportunities are important to our teams,” says Ryan-Jones at Harrods. The retailer has an extensive learning programme, with initiatives such as a school-leaver programmes and management development programmes. “We pride ourselves on all being teachers and learners,” says Bruney from Hootsuite. “We have extensive learning programmes and a global stretch program, on which people can assume new roles of their choice, part-time, to gain valuable exposure to other areas of the business and develop new skills.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2018/jan/24/from-pudsey-the-dog-to-the-presidents-club-david-walliams-just-cant-say-no","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T15:08:15Z","webTitle":"From Pudsey the Dog to the Presidents Club: David Walliams just can’t say no","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2018/jan/24/from-pudsey-the-dog-to-the-presidents-club-david-walliams-just-cant-say-no","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2018/jan/24/from-pudsey-the-dog-to-the-presidents-club-david-walliams-just-cant-say-no","fields":{"headline":"From Pudsey the Dog to the Presidents Club: David Walliams just can’t say no","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: David Walliams. Age: 46. AKA: David Edward Williams OBE. Appearance: Everywhere you look. His face does ring a bell. You may remember Walliams from such television productions as Little Britain, Come Fly With Me or Walliams &amp; Friend. He was even on EastEnders once. He gets about a bit, then. He does. You might also know him for his work on Britain’s Got Talent, or as the narrator of ITV’s Top Dog Mode, or as the voice of Pudsey in Pudsey the Dog: The Movie. It sounds as if Walliams may find it difficult to say no. A weakness no doubt destined to feature a bit further down. What has he done lately? He was recently named the bestselling author of 2017. Are you sure? Yes. His children’s books, including Bad Dad and The World’s Worst Children, had sales totalling £16.6m last year, knocking JK Rowling into second place. That is pretty bloody impressive. And this week he won best TV judge at the National Television awards. That is slightly less impressive. I didn’t even know there was such an award. It is newish and they don’t present it every year, but Walliams won it in 2015 as well. They should just call it the David Walliams award, and be done with it. He might enjoy that. So he sold a lot of books last year, and he won an award this week. What has he been doing in between? Resting on his laurels? Not at all. Just last Thursday he appeared at a sleazy groping party, according to the Financial Times. What? A report by two undercover investigators alleged that the Presidents Club dinner, an annual, men-only charity event held at the Dorchester hotel, featured widespread sexual harassment of the 130 “hostesses” hired for the evening. What was Walliams doing there? He was the compere. The evening featured a big-money auction, with lots including a night at Soho’s Windmill strip club and a course of plastic surgery billed with the words: “Spice up your wife.” Plus dinner and, reportedly, groping – although Walliams may not have been aware of the latter. It sounds as if he should have turned down that particular gig. He has said he is “appalled” by the claims, so I expect he will turn them down next year. Do say: “I think I might be busy that night.” Don’t say: “Oh, well, it’s all for a good cause.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/29/uber-account-hacked-russia-refund-paypal","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T07:00:41Z","webTitle":"My Uber account was hacked – and I was refunded in rouble credits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/29/uber-account-hacked-russia-refund-paypal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/29/uber-account-hacked-russia-refund-paypal","fields":{"headline":"My Uber account was hacked – and I was refunded in rouble credits","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In September my Uber account was hacked and three trips were taken by the fraudsters in Russia, which resulted in my account being charged 16,000 roubles.

I raised this with my bank, Halifax Bank of Scotland, which applied for a charge-back, but PayPal said this was a legitimate transaction, even though Uber has admitted my account was hacked.

You’re being somewhat unfairly portrayed. Every few weeks since the Weinstein allegations broke, kicking off a movement – #MeToo – against harassment, abuse and sexual violence that shows no sign of abating, some older woman or other is brought in to tell anyone who will listen how stupid the whole endeavour is. The impression building is that women of a certain age – our mothers’ and grandmothers’ generation, and often those younger, too (basically anyone who can’t be dubbed a “millennial”) – think this movement is daft, that we are whiny weaklings complaining about nothing, that we scream harassment and abuse in a hand grazing a knee. But this is patently not the case. There has been cross-generational support for #MeToo; it’s been moving to see. We owe much of today’s feminist work to you, the women who came before us. The latest older women to take issue with #MeToo is Germaine Greer, who can always be relied on for a soundbite on just how badly she feels pathetic younger woman are doing feminism. In the interest of full disclosure, she once wrote a nasty review of The Vagenda, the book I co-wrote, and author Laura Bates’s book, Everyday Sexism. Aside from containing quite a few factual inaccuracies that letter writers to the New Statesman were happy to correct on our behalf, particularly with reference to female biology, it also witheringly dismissed the role of social media in modern feminism. “Unpacking your heart with bitter words to an anonymous blog is no substitute for action,” she wrote, of the Everyday Sexism project. This is almost exactly the same line that she has taken with #MeToo. The words she used to describe me and my fellow young feminists, that we were merely “shrieking” and “bitching” and “whingeing” were revealing. It made me wonder if Greer actually likes women, particularly young women, at all. Greer makes the mistake of viewing the internet and the activism which takes place on it as distinct somehow from real life, when most of us know, regardless of age, that it is not somehow magically separate, but simply one part of it. #MeToo may be an online movement, but it is having real-world consequences, just as in the same way the work of The Vagenda and Everyday Sexism’s was not limited to Twitter. We spent days and days doing outreach in schools and universities, a lot of it unpaid, providing consultancy to a range of organisations, and even meeting with politicians. Similarly, #MeToo has seen women gather the courage to approach their HR departments, setting up their own organisations, joining unions, forming legal funds to help women sue their abusers, taking to the streets in protest, and a hundred other things besides. It has galvanised women across the world. To reduce it to whining is actually rather sexist. It’s sad that women like Greer, Catherine Deneuve, Brigitte Bardot, and Donna Karan do not get it. And it’s sad that the establishment relishes their input to such an extent – for who better to tear down a mass of women in revolt than one of our own? But they should not be taken to be representative. Those women who seek to frame the new feminism as a bunch of clueless snowflakes, offended at every come-on seem to share little in common attitude-wise with so many older women that I have met. Because what some forget is that these generations – these mothers and grandmothers and colleagues and mentors and teachers – well: you raised us. You brought us up to be this way. Whether you mothered us or mentored us or wrote books we read, it is you who passed on to us that hard-learned but fervent hope that we young women deserve to walk through life without fear of abuse, harassment, and discrimination. You taught us that men would try and put their hands on us. You taught us how to fight and to speak up, and not take it lying down. We did not pluck these ideas spontaneously from the ether. #MeToo is merely another kind of consciousness-raising, and you pioneered that decades before we were even born. This is not a case of young versus old, because you women who came before planted the seeds. Some of you have resisted this collective spirit, taken the hardened attitude that you weathered the storm, so why shouldn’t we? But more of you, such as Suzanne Moore writing in the Guardian earlier this week, have been on board. Attitudes have changed, of course, attitudes are changing all the time. But credit where it’s due: women like my grandmother, and like many of you reading this, have always said that sexual harassment was unacceptable. It’s just that no one is interested in putting my grandmother on the Today programme (which is a real shame, she would make short work of John Humphrys). It’s ironic that so many of these supportive women, our feminist forebears, will have been influenced by Greer, who now seems to want to disown my generation’s brand of feminism. It is a shame. #MeToo has had a profound effect on me, has changed my life really, and the same can be said for many others. That’s thanks to our elders and also, regardless of where she’s at now, thanks to Greer’s historic work. Like it or not, Germaine, we are your legacy, and we’ll keep on fighting. It’s a shame you’re not onside but well, thankfully, there are many more where you came from. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/24/europe-now-new-guardian-series-european-diversity-eu-brexit-eurozone","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T13:17:59Z","webTitle":"Europe now – why the Guardian is launching a new series | Natalie Nougayrède","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/europe-now-new-guardian-series-european-diversity-eu-brexit-eurozone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/europe-now-new-guardian-series-european-diversity-eu-brexit-eurozone","fields":{"headline":"Why the Guardian has launched a new series, Europe Now","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Recent years have been a rollercoaster for Europe. Not since the democratic revolutions of 1989 has the continent undergone such profound transformation or experienced so many resounding shocks. The eurozone crisis, the refugee crisis, the rise of populism, the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit, separatism, globalisation, the impact of new technologies, the effect of the Middle East chaos and the election of Donald Trump in the US have all created complex new realities. What was once deemed secure in Europe is now being questioned. Debate has been reawakened on themes such as identity, democracy, minority rights, gender equality, diversity and values. People across Europe are taking part in vivid and fascinating discussions that could shape the future. The Guardian wants to explore and host some of this conversation, which is why we have are launched a new fortnightly series, Europe now. The idea is to offer readers a better understanding of what binds Europeans in all their diversity – but also of what divides them. It will showcase a wide variety of voices in all kinds of fields, from culture to economics through politics and the environment, with a keen focus on grassroots movements and the young people involved in them. Activists, thinkers, artists and members of civil society will all weigh in. We will also be reaching out to cartoonists from across the continent. By Europe, we mean the countries of the European Union, but not exclusively. The series will feature voices from across the Balkans, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Switzerland, plus Russia and its European neighbours. We’ve opened the series with a piece by Lucas Chancel, the Paris-based French economist who worked with Thomas Piketty on the World Inequality Report 2018. He writes that Europe is where social disparities are the lowest in the world and reflects on whether that can be sustained. From Madrid, we’ve asked Lucila Rodriguez-Alarcón, who runs a small foundation, PorCausa, active on migration issues, to describe how Spain has been dealing with refugee arrivals now that the country has again become a gateway to Europe. Also, in a cartoon, Andrzej Krauze, who was born in Poland, gives us his take on the new government policies aimed at restricting Polish women’s abortion rights. Jean Monnet, one of the founders of the European project, once said: “We are not uniting states, we are uniting people.” The Guardian hopes to create a platform for citizens across Europe, one that can help deepen a vivid discussion across borders and cultures, on issues that matter to people’s lives, especially to the younger generation. Europe Now wants to be a space for thought provoking, stimulating views. We want to show Europe’s complexities – its hopeful and less hopeful developments alike, and how people react to and engage with them. We want to inspire curiosity about a region that, in its wider dimension, spans more than 40 countries and includes more than 700 million people – 508 million of them living in the EU. We want to be as close as possible to our readers in Europe, their concerns and their hopes. We believe the debate about Europe should not only revolve around institutions, treaties or government negotiations, however important they may be. We think the conversation can richly benefit from looking into transformations at a grassroots level, and citizens’ initiatives. In these challenging times, values and principles such as tolerance, social justice and openness need defending in new ways. We want to tap into that energy and the search for positive solutions. We’ve already received strong, engaged reactions from readers. Here’s a sample: “Delighted you will have more on Europe”; “Excellent approach. What we have in common. What we have built and can build together”; “It is about time that one of the major British papers starts being more European in its outlook”; “I do hope you illustrate the discontent of citizens across the EU, and not just marvel and provide insight into what you believe to be its greatness”; “If Europe Now presents a high quality debate and analysis with innovative journalism, then great”; “Great idea. How about one step further for a Europe Edition for the Guardian, alongside your UK, US, International and Australian Editions?”; “A wonderful and complex continent. I look forward to reading this series”; “A timely and much needed comprehensive approach”. As Britain prepares to leave the EU, we will seek to build bridges and engage more closely with readers throughout Europe and those in the wider world who want to keep in touch with European concerns. We know people across Europe are eager to share insights about a region whose destiny is being redefined. We want to offer them the space and opportunity to do that. Join us as we explore Europe’s many debates.
