With spring getting into its stride and the outdoors beckoning, surely now would be the perfect time to treat your child to a new bike – and potentially introduce them to a hobby that will last them a lifetime. With kids’ bikes, the first hurdle is always price. Is it really worth spending money on a toy they’ll soon outgrow or lose, or have stolen? Islabikes clearly thinks so. Its Beinn range starts at almost £400. But – and I know that’s a sizable wodge – the money will be well spent. All three of my children learned to ride on the same Islabike. And when we were done with it, we gave it to some friends and their children are now learning on it. So that’s five children so far, and counting. Your child will appreciate the fact that Islabikes are lightweight and ergonomically proportioned. Their seats are lower to the ground and the wheels are larger than usual, which makes the bikes easier to control. Brake levers are smaller to fit little hands. And the bikes are designed and built by nice people in Shropshire. Win, win win… Cool kit This go-anywhere cinch lock is light enough for kids to carry, yet still a tough and durable solution to keep their bike secure.

The MP for Barnsley Central was chosen last month by 58% of party members in Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster to be their candidate in the race. Three days before his selection, the party’s national executive committee had ruled that Jarvis would not be able to stay on as an MP if he was elected, a move described by Labour MPs in Yorkshire as “unfair and undemocratic”. However, Labour announced on Tuesday that it was formally backing Jarvis’s candidacy and a party source said he would be allowed to keep his seat in parliament if elected as Sheffield city region mayor. Responding to the decision, Jarvis said: “I am honoured to be Labour’s candidate for the Sheffield city region mayoral election and I am looking forward to the campaign. “This is an important role at a crucial moment and we must ensure that we elect a Labour mayor who will deliver a bold and radical plan for delivering real change for the people of South Yorkshire.” The role of Sheffield city region mayor comes with no agreed powers and Jarvis has said he will not take a salary in the role. He has pledged to use his position in Westminster to fight for an interim Sheffield city region deal, with a view to eventually joining a devolution agreement for the whole of the county of Yorkshire. Eighteen out of 20 Yorkshire authorities have backed proposals for a One Yorkshire devolution deal, with only Sheffield and Rotherham opting to prioritise a deal for south Yorkshire. Supporters of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on the NEC were criticised locally as “picking an unnecessary fight” with Jarvis after their initial ruling, but the body claimed it was merely formalising a pre-existing convention. Both Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, and Steve Rotherham, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, stood down as MPs when they were elected to their positions. Speaking to the Guardian after announcing his candidacy in February, Jarvis said there were many examples of politicians performing multiple roles, pointing to MPs who chair select committees or hold ministerial briefs. Jarvis is the overwhelming favourite to win the mayoral contest in the region as all of the 14 South Yorkshire constituencies that will take part in the election were won by Labour at the last general election. Nominations for candidates for the 3 May election close on Friday 6 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/brazilians-still-hold-great-affection-for-lula-despite-corruption-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T04:25:53Z","webTitle":"Brazilians still hold great affection for Lula, despite corruption conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/brazilians-still-hold-great-affection-for-lula-despite-corruption-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/brazilians-still-hold-great-affection-for-lula-despite-corruption-conviction","fields":{"headline":"Brazilians still hold great affection for Lula, despite corruption conviction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many Brazilians regard the era of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva with nostalgic warmth, and for strong, practical reasons, even if some argue the changes he wrought in Brazil were not enough to provide lasting growth. Brazil rode a commodities boom during his presidency from 2003 until 2011, which helped its economy grow while poverty and inequality fell. On Thursday, the supreme court rejected the former president’s plea to avoid prison while he appeals a corruption conviction, in a move that likely ends his political career and deepens divisions in Brazil. But many poorer Brazilians argue that if Lula was involved in any graft, it was less than other politicians, and he did more for the least wealthy people than anyone else. Lula has said he is innocent and the charges are politically motivated to prevent him from running for president again. Jucineide de Lima, 46, a maid who lives in a favela in Recife, the capital of Lula’s home state of Pernambuco, said: “Who never did anything wrong? He is the only one I would vote for.” Lula’s governments introduced a series of measures to increase the number of people from Brazil’s badly funded public sector schools studying at universities. The University for Everyone programme, created by a 2005 law, provided scholarships at private universities. New federal universities were opened and admission procedures streamlined. States such as Rio de Janeiro launched programmes of quotas for black and public sector school students, a policy enshrined in a 2012 law by Lula’s chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff, with powerful social impact in a deeply unequal country where more than half the population identifies as black or mixed race. More than half a million more public sector students went to university during his rule. Wesley Andrade, 20, studied at a state-funded school in São Gonçalo, a gritty, working-class neighbourhood near Rio de Janeiro, and his mother, an immigrant from the poorer north-east of Brazil, could not afford private lessons or university fees. He is now studying international relations at Rio de Janeiro State University thanks to a quota law, and said Lula’s policies meant Brazil did not suffer during the 2008 financial crisis, and they still benefit people today. “He did a lot for Brazil, for inequality, for the poor people; he reduced radically inequality and hunger in the country. He was able to stabilise the economy at a time of world economic crisis so that Brazilians did not lose their jobs,” Andrade said. The income of poorer Brazilians outpaced wider economic growth, said Marcelo Neri, an economist who was also a minister in Dilma Rousseff’s government. “People perceived this rise and this was strongest among the poorest,” he said. As wages grew, 37 million Brazilians joined an emergent new lower-middle class, called Class C, which drove a consumer spending boom. A cash transfer scheme called bolsa família (family allowance) benefited tens of millions of poorer Brazilians, provided their children went to school and had vaccinations. A programme called my house, my life provided low-cost apartments on generous financing terms, helping more than 13 million people by last year. “It is not for nothing that he has this popularity, despite the scandals,” Neri said. “There was a process of inclusion.” Despite his conviction on Thursday, and six separate pending corruption trials, Lula leads opinion polls before a presidential election in October. But while Brazil rode the commodities boom, Lula failed to introduce structural changes that could have prolonged the good times, Neri said. Life expectancy in Brazil increased by six years from 2000 to 2016, but Lula failed to introduce pension reform to cut soaring public spending. Education improved, but the productivity of Brazilian workers failed to keep up. In 2014, Brazil fell into a crippling recession and some of those gains were lost. “It was a combination of elements that generated a big social boom. But it did not have the ingredients to maintain it afterwards,” Neri said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/03/tracksmith-people-indulge-in-the-things-they-care-about","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T15:12:43Z","webTitle":"Tracksmith: 'People indulge in the things they care about'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/03/tracksmith-people-indulge-in-the-things-they-care-about","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/apr/03/tracksmith-people-indulge-in-the-things-they-care-about","fields":{"headline":"Tracksmith: 'People indulge in the things they care about'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“When I started looking at running apparel, everything looked exactly the same,” says Matt Taylor. “If you went into a running store and took the brand logos off all the T-shirts, you’d have absolutely no idea what belonged to what brand.” Taylor is the founder and CEO of Tracksmith, which was established in 2014 as the purveyor of running kit that is classic and low key, yet instantly recognisable. The company eschews the eye-watering shades of the big brands – acid yellow, vomit green, sickly pink – for more muted shades and timeless styles, with the same palette for men and women. And while the likes of Nike and Adidas will always dominate market share, smaller premium brands with their own distinct ethos have started to make headway: Tracksmith and Oiselle in the US, Soar and Iffley Road in the UK. One thing these brands have in common is that they seem to “get” running in a way that the big brands, with their huge markets, multiple sports and obsession with fitness influencers, don’t. Their messages are pitched at the enthusiastic regular, perhaps a club runner – certainly someone interested in performance as well as participation. Though if you follow Tracksmith on social media, you could be forgiven for thinking that everyone who works for the company is ridiculously hardcore. Last month, the manager of its Trackhouse store in Boston, Louis Serafini, ran a sub-four-minute mile. Eric Ashe, the head of logistics, is a 2hr 17min marathon runner. Is running, I ask, obligatory for Tracksmith employees? Taylor laughs. “Culturally, there are a lot of nuances in our sport that are important to understand. They can be learned but it does help if you come from that background.” (Taylor himself ran track in college.) “The athletes we use in all our marketing are, for want of a better word, sub-elite,” Taylor says. “They aren’t professional and they don’t have contracts with other brands, but they are competing at a high level. All of them work full-time jobs and it’s a hobby – a passion, not a profession.” Some of these athletes have even gone on to work for the company directly. Until relatively recently, the market for premium running brands was small and faced a backlash from purists who viewed (many still do) paying £50 for leggings as insane, possibly even borderline insulting. Yet where cycling led – with brands such as Rapha going mainstream – running was always bound to follow. “My theory on this,” says Taylor, “is that footwear has always led the industry. And if you look at the price points of shoes over the last 10-15 years, the upper limit of what the market will bear, it’s just gone crazy. Not too long ago, if a shoe was $100, it would be like, “Wow, a hundred dollars for a shoe!”. And now that’s pretty much the entry point, with $150 or $175 the new norm. So what we always assumed was that apparel would follow. Now, that is happening: if you walk into a Nike store they have shorts or a tank top for $80. There’s always been this idea that runners are cheap, but I don’t think that’s a fair assessment.” Indeed, though running can be a cheap sport, there are nevertheless plenty of runners with disposable incomes. But I ask Taylor about the resistance I constantly see to anything perceived as expensive in running – the “all you need is a cheap pair of Green Flash” school of thought. “We make so many of those choices in our everyday lives,” Taylor says. ”If you applied that to everything, everyone would drive the worst car, drink the cheapest coffee. No one would go to yoga classes, they’d do it at home in their living room. People indulge in the things they care about. And lots of people care about running.” Tracksmith’s collections are indeed inspired by people who cared about running. The sash design on its best-selling vest comes from those worn at Cornell University in the late 19th century, when athletes who scored points in the league championship earned a satin sash sewn over their singlets. And the Boston marathon – the world’s oldest annual marathon – is at the heart of what the company does. It was based at the halfway point of the course and is now very near the finish line, and produces kit for the race each year. However, in 2018, it has been expanding to include ranges for other races, including a kit for the Tokyo marathon and now one for London. “We do have a big customer base in the UK and Japan,” says Taylor. “And of course the World Marathon Majors are a moment in time where a lot of people in our sport are paying attention. For London we have created a small capsule collection. We’ve found inspiration can be really simple – in this case it’s the colours of the union jack. It’s a way for us to celebrate one of these major events in our sport. And of course we love the history: few people in the US know this, but London was the birthplace of the 26.2 distance. I love those stories and its fun to dig them up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/wednesdays-best-tv-first-dates-my-dad-the-peace-deal-and-me","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV: First Dates; My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/wednesdays-best-tv-first-dates-my-dad-the-peace-deal-and-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/wednesdays-best-tv-first-dates-my-dad-the-peace-deal-and-me","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV: First Dates; My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"First Dates 10pm, Channel 4 First Dates returns for a 10th series and lands itself a bit of a first.

As they used to say of Sinatra, he could sing the Manhattan phone book and have the audience on the edge of their seats. An Elling song can be a meditation, a demand, a lament, an expression of wonder, but never naive and rarely simple. Among these 10 tracks are elaborate musical and verbal constructions built around existing songs or instrumental pieces, with words by Elling interspersed with extracts from the works of various poets. This, of course, is the kind of thing that can go disastrously wrong, The fact that it doesn’t has a lot to do with the authority conveyed in Elling’s voice. But the arrangements, the instrumental playing and the minute perfection of the whole production demand to be taken seriously. Elling’s co-producer, Branford Marsalis, as well as contributing some gloriously fluid soprano saxophone, is clearly a moving spirit here.

After all, England have lost a series in New Zealand only once before – in 1984. “We could not have done more. I was proud of them. We kept asking questions of New Zealand throughout the day but unfortunately it did not go our way. It’s frustrating. This was a good fifth-day wicket; there was not much deterioration and there was no movement with the second new ball,” he said before acknowledging that the four dropped catches in the innings were critical on such a benign surface. In trying to explain that lack of movement in the final session in a match when the new ball tended to dart around, he pointed out that there were soon chunks out of the ball after hitting the boundary boards at Hagley Oval – but do not worry; there were no suggestions of any antipodean subterfuge here. Root admitted the winter of five defeats and two draws had been “disappointing” but he was determined to be upbeat. “This week we have been more adaptable; we had more options with the ball,” he said. “And after that 58 [in Auckland] we became a better side with the bat. If we keep the mentality of this week we have a chance of winning again. We can get a lot out of this week but we are nowhere near where we want to be as a side.” Root praised the efforts of Jack Leach in what he described as an “encouraging debut”. The England captain said: “He stood up well to all the expectations. Next winter in Sri Lanka and the West Indies spin will play a big part. It was great for us to have Jack come in and perform as he has.” At the other end of the scale in terms of Test experience is Alastair Cook and Root expressed confidence in his predecessor, who had a torrid time against Trent Boult in this series, with only 23 runs in two matches. “I fully expect Alastair to be opening the batting at the start of next summer,” Root said. He was tougher on himself, even though he was, comfortably England’s leading scorer in the winter’s Test matches: “It’s been disappointing personally, not converting all those starts. Now I look forward to a bit of time off and then working at a few things before playing a few county games.” As for the rest of the batting in the upper order he said that England had some “talented players” but he could offer them no guarantees. “Like everyone else they’ll have to prove that at county level at the start of the season.” Perhaps the solitary bonus of playing so much County Championship cricket in early spring is that there are plenty of opportunities for someone to put together a run of eye-catching scores to challenge the incumbents, of whom only Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Root can be sure of a place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/06/revamp-reimagining-elton-john-review-ed-sheeran-lady-gaga","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T09:00:27Z","webTitle":"Revamp: Reimagining Elton John review – Sheeran and Gaga join middling covers rehash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/06/revamp-reimagining-elton-john-review-ed-sheeran-lady-gaga","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/06/revamp-reimagining-elton-john-review-ed-sheeran-lady-gaga","fields":{"headline":"Revamp: Reimagining Elton John review – Sheeran and Gaga join middling covers rehash","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 17 years after Two Rooms, a pair of new albums reinterpret Elt and Bern with a new generation of A-listers.

Tensions are running high with Brazil rocked by the recent killing of a Rio councillor, Marielle Franco, and Wednesday’s judicial decision seems likely to further polarise an already bitterly divided country. If Lula is jailed, his supporters will cry political persecution; if not, his detractors will allege corruption. Lula’s conviction for corruption and money laundering was upheld by an appeals court in January and his sentence increased to 12 years. On Wednesday the supreme court must decide whether to uphold a 2016 ruling that defendants should begin prison sentences after the first appeal is rejected. Lula’s Worker’s party says the conviction was politically motivated to prevent the former president, who remains popular with poorer Brazilians, from running again in October. The case was part of Brazil’s sprawling “Car Wash” investigation that has jailed dozens of top executives and politicians. “I did not accept the military dictatorship and I will not accept this dictatorship of the prosecutors,” Lula said on Monday night to a roaring crowd in Rio de Janeiro. Anti-Lula protests are planned across Brazil on Tuesday, organised by groups that led demonstrations for the 2016 impeachment of Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, which brought in President Michel Temer’s rightwing government. Pro-Lula demonstrations by unions and social movements are planned in the capital, Brasilia, on Wednesday. The supreme court’s president, Cármen Lúcia, made a televised appeal on Monday night for “serenity in times of intolerance” to avoid social disorder. Two Lula-branded buses were shot at last week during a campaign tour of southern Brazil. No one was hurt, and the former president was not in either of the two buses, which were carrying guests and journalists. Prosecutors say Lula was promised a beachfront apartment worth BR$2.2m (£470,000) in a BR$88m graft scheme to help the construction company OAS secure contracts with the state oil firm, Petrobras. Lula’s lawyers have repeatedly protested his innocence and said the prosecution has produced no material evidence for his conviction. The supreme court will decide on Wednesday on a habeas corpus request from Lula to keep him out of jail to pursue further appeals. If denied, Lula could be arrested the same day. “All of the signals from the judiciary so far indicate Lula will be jailed, it’s just a question of time,” said Maurício Santoro, a political scientist and professor of international relations at Rio de Janeiro’s State University. “The Brazilian press would be extremely critical of the supreme court if the request was granted.” While technically barred from the elections because of his conviction, Lula leads opinion polls by a wide margin. Jair Bolsonaro, a hardline rightwing former army captain and military dictatorship revisionist often labelled the “Brazilian Trump”, is second. Born in poverty, Lula became Brazil’s first working-class president and is fondly remembered by poorer sections of the population for his Worker’s party’s social policies. Other supporters say his conviction is an attack on democracy. “We are here, reaffirming that what we want is democracy,” said Marcia Regina Coelho Chalfun, a 55-year-old teacher, at the Lula event in Rio on Monday night. “I have always voted for Lula and would vote for him again. He is an icon, an ex-president who changed the face of this country. It’s really important that Lula is free.” If jailed, it is unlikely that Lula, now 72, would serve a long sentence. Last week the former São Paulo congressman, mayor and governor Paulo Maluf, once wanted by Interpol, was released and transferred to house arrest on health grounds after serving four months for corruption. Lula’s court session might be delayed, buying him more time, but pressure is mounting on the politician. “The change in jurisprudence, in this case, will imply the release of countless convicted persons,” says a petition signed by more than 5,000 Brazilian magistrates. One of the signatories – the lead “Car Wash” prosecutor, Delton Dallaganol – tweeted that he would “fast and pray” for Lula’s detention.

The music streaming business was launched 12 years ago as a free-to-use service, funded by advertising. Spotify now has 157 million customers, and has managed to convert 71 million of those into paying users of its premium subscription service. However, Spotify has never made a profit, making it more tricky for potential investors to value the firm. It also counts the likes of Apple and Amazon as competitors, a daunting prospect given the depth of their pockets. Here are some of the key questions as the Swedish firm prepares to go public. What is different about this flotation? Unlike most companies that float, Spotify is not issuing any new stock, which means it has not set a price for its shares in advance. Instead it is selling shares currently held by its private investors, rather than handling it in the usual way with the process managed by investment bankers. It will save the Swedish company money but it is likely to create volatility when the shares go live on Wall street (14:30 BST) as investors try to settle on a price. The company has made losses of nearly €1bn (£870m) over the past three years, so investors will not be able to rely on a traditional price earnings ratio as a guide. Why does Spotify want to float? Spotify made a commitment to its original investors that they would have the opportunity to cash in their investment, and this is it. The flotation will help to fund expansion of the business, but it will also ramp up pressure on the management. By going public, Spotify’s strategy and performance will come under increased scrutiny, and investors will expect progress, fast. What is it worth? Analysts are predicting Spotify could be valued at $20bn-$25bn on its debut on the New York Stock Exchange but the reality is no one knows. It is more difficult to predict than usual, because no advance price for the shares has been set. Investors will be weighing up the potential for growth against the fact Spotify has failed to turn a profit in its 12-year existence. The company’s costs – including the royalties it pays to record labels and artists – are greater than its revenues, although that gap is narrowing. A successful float will depend on whether or not investors believe Spotify’s claim that it can become profitable and fend off bigger rivals such as Apple and Amazon. What are Spotify’s strengths? Spotify has proved able to drive strong revenue growth, with revenues rising from €746m in 2013 to a predicted range of between €4.9bn and €5.3bn last year. With an estimated 40% share of the global music streaming market, Spotify is the dominant player in the sector, increasing its bargaining power with labels and artists over the royalties it pays them. Meanwhile user numbers are expected to increase to 170 million this year, with paying subscribers expected to rise from 71 million to 90 million. One of the challenges will be persuading more non-paying customers to sign up for paid-for services. What are the threats? Simply put, it’s the potential for competition. Spotify is currently the market leader but tech giants such as Apple and Amazon have deep pockets and could cause some damage should they decide to mount a major challenge. Both companies already provide hardware such as the iPhone and Amazon Echo which are available with their own, pre-loaded music-streaming services. Spotify’s limited supplier base, with just four music companies controlling the rights to 87% of the music streamed on Spotify, is another risk, according to analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown. What will it mean for consumers? The flotation will mark a new era for Spotify but it is not yet clear what changes the firm has planned. Analysts say it will have to diversify over time, to ensure that it stands apart from rival streaming services. One option would to be produce more original content, following the video shot for Spotify by Taylor Swift for her single Delicate. Spotify has already moved into podcasts and producing original music. How have other recent tech floats performed? Recent technology floats have proved volatile and investors have been selling off shares in the wider sector, concerned by the prospect of greater regulation for tech firms such as Facebook. Cloud storage company Dropbox is up 40% since it floated last month, but shares in Snap – the company behind social media app Snapchat – are down 15% compared with their float price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/03/india-backs-down-over-plan-to-ban-journalists-for-fake-news","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T10:22:47Z","webTitle":"India backs down over plan to ban journalists for 'fake news'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/india-backs-down-over-plan-to-ban-journalists-for-fake-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/03/india-backs-down-over-plan-to-ban-journalists-for-fake-news","fields":{"headline":"India backs down over plan to ban journalists for 'fake news'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Indian government has scrapped a plan to blacklist journalists judged to be writing “fake news” less than a day after it was announced to widespread criticism. India’s information and broadcasting ministry said late on Monday that journalists or agencies accused of creating or spreading fake news would be referred to the Press Council of India and another statutory body for broadcast media. The notice, which cited “the increasing instances of fake news” but did not define it, said journalists would have their official accreditation suspended as soon as any complaint was registered even before it was judged whether it was valid. Journalists in India can report and publish without official accreditation but the card is usually required for access to government buildings, events and press conferences. The accreditation of a journalist or agency confirmed to have been producing fake news would have been suspended for six months in the first instance, for a year the second time, and permanently if they were found guilty again by the press council, a body that includes several members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). But in a U-turn on Tuesday, the office of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, withdrew the notice, saying the response to the fake news issue should be dealt with by the press council alone. The announcement had been widely criticised by Indian journalists and opposition figures. Press associations had called an emergency meeting for Tuesday afternoon to coordinate a response. Commentators had argued the press council’s ethics rules already say that journalists should report with “accuracy and fairness” and so any deliberately false reporting was covered by its existing rules. Fake news is generally understood to refer to knowingly false reporting intended to influence and manipulate public sentiment. The term was initially used by critics of Donald Trump to describe outlets accused of spreading misinformation in his favour during the 2016 US presidential election. But Trump and his supporters have since adopted the phrase to attack coverage critical of the president. It has been embraced in the same way in India, with both the BJP and its opponents in the Congress party accusing each other and some media outlets of spreading fake news. Malicious false news reports have become a serious problem in India as smartphone penetration has increased against a backdrop of generally poor information literacy and tension between different castes and religious groups. Police regularly arrest people accused of concocting false stories that might ignite violence, many spread over WhatsApp, which has more than 200 million active users in the country. At the weekend, police in Karnataka state arrested the founder of Postcard News, a website that regularly posts false news stories alleging crimes by Indian Muslims. One recent post showed an injured Jain monk, who the website claimed had been “attacked by a Muslim youth”. In reality, the monk had been in a road accident. Fact-checking websites such as Alt News have become popular in the past two years for debunking false stories in social and mainstream media. Malaysia on Monday approved a law against fake news that permits offenders to be jailed for up to six years. The legislation defines fake news as “news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false”. Critics fear the sanction will be used to further undermine Malaysian media freedom and silence critical coverage of the prime minister, Najib Razak, including of a corruption scandal in which his associates have been accused of stealing at least $4.5bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/03/infowars-alex-jones-sued-marcel-fontaine-florida-shooter-falsely-identified","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T13:58:06Z","webTitle":"InfoWars sued by man Alex Jones falsely identified as Parkland gunman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/infowars-alex-jones-sued-marcel-fontaine-florida-shooter-falsely-identified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/infowars-alex-jones-sued-marcel-fontaine-florida-shooter-falsely-identified","fields":{"headline":"InfoWars sued by man Alex Jones falsely identified as Parkland gunman","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Boston man who was falsely identified as the gunman in the Parkland school shooting by the conspiracy theory website InfoWars has filed a defamation suit against the site and its creator, Alex Jones, contending that the posts have exposed him to damaging volleys of online abuse and threats that show no sign of slowing down. “Many harassers seem to believe my client is part of a false flag operation conducted by ‘the deep state’,” said attorney Mark Bankston, who is representing 24-year-old Marcel Fontaine in the suit filed on Monday in Travis county, Texas, where InfoWars is based. A picture of Fontaine, wearing a “communist party” T-shirt began circulating in certain internet circles, most likely originating on the message board site 4chan, in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The popular T-shirt depicts famous 20th-century communist leaders Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Fidel Castro drinking from red Solo cups and wearing novelty party hats. Karl Marx, author of the Communist Manifesto, is depicted with a lampshade on his head. Despite the shirt’s clearly ironic intent, InfoWars ran a headline that incorrectly identified Fontaine’s image as that of the shooter and said he “dressed as communist”. InfoWars, Bankston noted, boasts an online readership of more than 30m page views a month, which puts it on par with a number of mainstream outlets. MSNBC.com, by comparison, sees about 40m page views. “The total number of people who saw the false accusation as a result of InfoWars’ mass dissemination and endorsement … would be measured in the hundreds of millions,” the suit reads. Jones, a popular internet conspiracy theorist, is especially fond of painting mass casualty events that command public attention as “false flag” operations coordinated by the government or other shadowy power figures. He also often describes elaborate, fanciful conspiracies wherein the families of victims in such events are fake paid “grief actors”. That’s part of the reason, Bankston argues, that the false ID is so insidious in this case, beyond an ordinary reporting error. “Because InfoWars advises its audience to distrust mainstream media sources, the subsequent mainstream news reports,” which identified Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged with murder, as the alleged shooter, “did not remove the threat to Marcel Fontaine”, the suit notes. “It is no exaggeration to say that Plaintiff’s life remains in genuine peril.” The filing is one of at least two active defamation suits pending against Infowars by plaintiffs who say his site has unleashed a barrage of online abuse at them from Jones’s credulous followers. The first, filed just three weeks ago, came from a counter-protester at the 2017 Charlottesville white supremacist rallies who filed and posted video of an attacker barreling through protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring others. A request for comment to InfoWars was not immediately returned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/meera-sodhas-recipe-for-katsu-curry-with-panko-aubergines-and-pickled-radishes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T08:30:07Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for katsu curry with panko aubergines and pickled radishes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/meera-sodhas-recipe-for-katsu-curry-with-panko-aubergines-and-pickled-radishes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/meera-sodhas-recipe-for-katsu-curry-with-panko-aubergines-and-pickled-radishes","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for katsu curry with panko aubergines and pickled radishes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Katsu curry is an unlikely looking heart thief, but this mysterious brown concoction is one of Japan’s favourite dishes. In my take on it, the curry sauce is made using plenty of naturally sweet vegetables, such as carrots and onions, plus a couple of storecupboard essentials. These modest ingredients come together to form a seductive sauce that is much greater than the sum of its parts, especially when slathered over crispy panko aubergines. It’s a message to us all never to judge a dish by its colour. Katsu curry with panko aubergines and pickled radishes Panko breadcrumbs are a cut above normal ones in that they’re much crunchier and flakier. The three elements here could be made independently, but they do cohabit a plate rather nicely. You’ll need a blender for this. Prep 35 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 For the pickled radishes 100g radishes, sliced very thinly ½ tsp salt 3 tbsp rice-wine vinegar 3 tbsp white-wine vinegar For the curry sauce 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 onion, peeled and chopped 2 carrots (about 200g), peeled and cut into 1cm dice 1 sweet potato (about 175g), peeled and cut into 1cm dice 4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced 1.5cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 2 tbsp curry powder 2 tbsp plain flour 500ml vegan vegetable stock (I use Marigold bouillon) 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp tomato ketchup ½ tsp salt (or to taste) For the panko aubergines 2 aubergines (about 600g), cut lengthways into 0.5cm-thick slices 8 tbsp plain flour ½ tsp salt 200g panko breadcrumbs Rapeseed oil, to finish Rice, salad leaves and black sesame seeds, to serve Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Put the radishes in a heatproof bowl, cover with 100ml of just-boiled water, add the salt and both vinegars, then stir and leave to cool. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan for which you have a lid, then fry the onion, carrots and sweet potato for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, fry for two minutes more, cover and leave to steam through for five minutes. Add the curry powder, stir for a couple of minutes, then stir in the flour until the vegetables are coated. Add the stock a little at a time, then bring to a boil. Add the soy, ketchup and salt, then take off the heat. Blend smooth, then return the sauce to the pan. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Put the aubergines on a plate. On a second plate, slowly mix the flour with about 180ml water and the salt to make a thin paste. Put the panko on a third plate. Coat both sides of each aubergine slice in the flour paste, shaking off any excess, then press into the panko to coat. Lay the coated slices on the prepared tray and drizzle both sides with oil. Bake for 15 minutes on each side, turn up the heat to 240C/465F/gas 9 and cook for 10 minutes more, until crisp, then take out of the oven. Just before serving, gently reheat the curry sauce for five minutes, adding more water and salt if need be for taste and consistency. Put three or four aubergine slices on each plate, douse them in the sauce, then serve with some drained pickled radish, rice, salad leaves and a sprinkling of black sesame seeds.

Vittorio! Ferruccio! Marcello! How has it come to this?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"THE WHOLE WORLD’S A PLAYGROUND The national team of the Netherlands finally seem to be getting their act together. It’s been a hell of a struggle for them over the years, as a quick flick through history illustrates: an 8-2 loss to England in 1946, a 4-0 loss to France last year, while roughly in between times they lost a World Cup finals match against Scotland, a result which leads The Fiver to assume they couldn’t have been any good in the seventies either. But on Monday they swatted aside Portugal 3-0 in Geneva. Wow! That result also puts England in a good light, because having beaten the Dutch last Friday, simple playground logic dictates that Gareth Southgate’s side must be at least four times better than the reigning European champions. At least. Stands to reason, don’t it. The World Cup’s pretty much in the bag. England! Give us your bike. But don’t just take The Fiver’s word for it. Nabil Maâloul, manager of Tunisia, also reckons England are one of the favourites. “The English have understood recently that they had to change their ideas and follow the evolution of world football,” he says. “If they continued to play as they did in the past, they could not progress. Their style of play is no longer about hitting the ball long and running after it. Things have progressed enormously.” Maâloul, who is in no way trying to flatter England into a false sense of security before they face his team in Volgograd on 18 June, puts this tactical modernity down to the influence of “great managers” like José Mourinho and Arsène Wenger, two poor saps who can’t lift a trophy these days without copping flak for being old hat. But that’s the internet for you. Nabil knows. Having said that, his assessment will look rather generous should England get turned over by Italy at Wembley. It promises to be a bittersweet occasion, because when the match starts it’ll finally hit home that we won’t be seeing the Azzurri at the World Cup. If that’s a mind-bending state of affairs for us, imagine how weird it must feel for Italy, whose record of reaching at least a final every decade since the 1970s is now kaput. Adding insult to injury, the fathers of catenaccio will have to watch England airily mess about with a defence that hasn’t conceded a goal for five matches – Alfie Mawson and James Tarkowski may even get a run-out – just because they can. Oh Enzo! Vittorio! Ferruccio! Marcello! How has it come to this? Italy may therefore see this as an opportunity to assuage some wounded pride and make a positive statement. Hey, if they could follow up a victory at Wembley with wins in upcoming friendlies against much-fancied France and the Portugal-bothering Netherlands, they might even be able to stake a claim on the Ethics World Cup after all. A moral one, that is, with reference to the aforementioned playground rules. Providing one of France, Portugal or, erm, England go on to actually win the thing. Hmm.

That joke is only 15 years old, but seems as if it is from an entirely different era. Once upon a time the internet was associated with anonymity; today it is synonymous with surveillance. Not only do modern technology companies know full well you’re not a dog (not even an extremely precocious poodle), they know whether you own a dog and what sort of dog it is. And, based on your preferred category of canine, they can go a long way to inferring – and influencing – your political views. Just over a week ago, the Observer broke a story about how Facebook had failed to protect the personal information of tens of millions of its users. The revelations sparked a #DeleteFacebook movement and some people downloaded their Facebook data before removing themselves from the social network. During this process, many of these users were shocked to see just how much intel about them the internet behemoth had accumulated. If you use Facebook apps on Android, for example – and, even inadvertently, gave it permission – it seems the company has been collecting your call and text data for years. It’s not me, it’s you! So Facebook protested, in the wake of widespread anger about its data-collection practices. You acquiesced to our opaque privacy policies. You agreed to let us mine and monetise the minutiae of your existence. Why are you so upset? Facebook’s surprise at our outrage is not unreasonable. For years, technology companies have faced very little scrutiny as they mushroomed in size and power. Finally, however, the tide is turning. We seem to have reached a watershed moment when it comes to public attitudes towards the use of our private information. We are more aware of the implications of our online behaviour than ever before. Awareness of our digital footprint is one thing, but what are we to do about it? In the wake of the Facebook revelations, it’s clear that we can’t all keep clicking as usual if we value our privacy or our democracy. It’s still relatively early in the internet era and we are all still figuring it out as we go along. However, best practices when it comes to security and online etiquette are starting to emerge. Here’s a guide to some of the new rules of the internet. 1. Download all the information Google has on you You may well have downloaded your Facebook data already; it has become something of a trend in recent days. Now take a look at what Google has on you. Go to Google’s “Takeout” tool and download your data from the multiple Google products you probably use, such as Gmail, Maps, Search and Drive. You’ll get sent a few enormous files that contain information about everything from the YouTube videos you have watched, your search history, your location history and so on. Once you’ve seen just how much information about you is in the cloud, you may want to go about deleting it. I highly recommend deleting your Google Maps history, for a start, unless you are particularly eager to have a detailed online record of everywhere you have ever been. You may also want to stop Google from tracking your location history. Sign in to Google, open Maps, then click on “timeline” in the menu. At the bottom, there’s an option to manage your location history. 2. Try not to let your smart toaster take down the internet. These days you can buy a “smart” version of just about anything. There are connected toasters, which let you personalise your toast settings and notify your phone when your breakfast is ready. There are Bluetooth-enabled forks, which vibrate when you are eating too quickly. There are internet-connected umbrellas, which alert you if it looks like it’s going to rain. There are even smart tampons, which let you monitor your flow. Not only are most of these gadgets unnecessary and expensive, most of them have shoddy security and are a liability. In 2016, for example, hackers created a zombie army of internet-connected devices and used them to take down large parts of the internet, including sites such as Netflix, Facebook, Spotify and the Guardian. So think twice about whether you really need to buy that fancy connected gadget. There’s enough to worry about today without having to wonder if your toaster is plotting against you. 3. Ensure your AirDrop settings are dick-pic-proof If you are an iPhone user, turn off your AirDrop function while in a public place or limit it to contacts. This stops strangers on the train from sending you unsolicited dick pics via AirDrop, which is a thing that actually happens because of course it does. 4. Secure your old Yahoo account You may have an old email account you never use any more and can’t be bothered to delete. That email account is a treasure trove of personal information just waiting to be hacked; indeed, if it’s a Yahoo account it was hacked in 2013. You don’t need necessarily to delete your old account but you should secure it. Change the password and turn on two-step verification. Make sure you’ve disconnected any linked services (such as cloud storage) in your settings. 5. 1234 is not an acceptable password Nor is “password”. Nor is “monkey” – which, for some reason, is one of the most popular passwords there is. The most secure passwords are very long ones, so start thinking in terms of “passphrases” instead of password. For example, “nomonkeyisnotagoodpassword” would take a computer 128 undecillion years to crack. 6. Check if you have been pwned “Pwned” is internet-speak for, among other things, having your email account compromised in a data breach. It’s a good idea to check this regularly. Simply go to haveibeenpwned.com, enter your email address, and the website will let you know if and when your details have been compromised so you can take appropriate action such as changing your password. 7. Be aware of personalised pricing We’re all familiar with dynamic pricing – the annoying way in which airline ticket prices fluctuate according to supply and demand. Increasingly, however, we’re seeing the rise of “personalised pricing”, as retailers analyse our data to gauge how much we’re likely to pay and charge us accordingly. Uber, for example, knows that you’re more likely to pay surge pricing if your phone battery is about to die – although they claim not to have acted on this information. And Staples has displayed different prices to customers based on their location. It’s hard to know just how widespread personalised pricing is as retailers are understandably discreet about it. However, you should assume that it’s happening. So, before making a big purchase online you might want to see if using a different device or using the incognito or private mode in your browser has any effect on the price. There are also tools you can download that let you spoof your location. It’s the modern equivalent of haggling. 8. Say hi to the NSA guy spying on you via your webcam Even spooks need a little social interaction. 9. Turn off notifications for anything that’s not another person speaking directly to you Sometimes this will be easy: is it a single-player game? It doesn’t need notifications at all. You can find out if you’ve got more gems, or extra energy – or whatever other fake currency the game hopes you will care about – in your own time, not when it wants to drive your engagement. Other times, this will be harder. Instagram’s rubbish – “a famous dog just posted a picture that received 12 likes” – can be turned off, but you’ll have to dig down in the settings to find it. Are there exceptions? Sure. The odd breaking news alert never hurt anyone, and maybe you really do want to let Duolingo prod you to practise your Spanish. But if you would be annoyed by a robot calling you up to tell you something, why are you letting it interrupt your thought process in another way? 10. Never put your kids on the public internet Maybe it’s fine to upload pics to a shared (private) photo album, or mention their day in a group DM. But if it’s public, Google can find it. And if Google can find it, it’s never going away. How are you going to tell your child in 16 years’ time that they can’t get a drivers’ licence because Daddy put a high-res photo of their iris online when they were two and now they trip alarms from here to Mars? 11. Leave your phone in your pocket or face down on the table when you’re with friends Unless you want to signal, repeatedly and obviously: “I would rather be hanging with someone else than you.” 12. Sometimes it’s worth just wiping everything and starting over Your phone, your tweets, your Facebook account: all of these things are temporary. They will pass. Free yourself from an obsession with digital hoarding. If you wipe your phone every year, you learn which apps you need and which are just sitting in the background hoovering up data. If you wipe your Facebook account every year, you learn which friends you actually like and which are just hanging on to your social life like a barnacle. 13. An Echo is fine, but don’t put a camera in your bedroom Do we really need to break this one down? 14. Have as many social-media-free days in the week as you have alcohol-free days This can be zero if you want, but know that we’re judging you. 15. Retrain your brain to focus Save up your longreads using Instapaper or Pocket and read them without distraction. Don’t dip in and out of that 4,000-word article on turtles: read it in one go. Or maybe even try a book! 16. Don’t let the algorithms pick what you do You are not a robot, you are a human being, and exercising your own free will is the greatest strength you have. When that YouTube video ends, don’t watch the next one that autoplays. When you pick up your phone in the morning, don’t just click on the stories at the top of Apple News or Google Now. Exercise choice! Exercise freedom! Exercise humanity! 17. Do what you want with your data, but guard your friends’ info with your life Yes, you should think twice before granting that fun app you downloaded access to your location or your photo library. Do you trust it not to do weird things with your pictures? Do you know it won’t track your every movement? But ultimately, those are your decisions, and they are for you to make. But your friends’ data isn’t yours, it’s theirs, and you are a trusted custodian. Don’t think twice before authorising access to your address book, or your friends’ profiles: think five or six times, and then don’t do it. 18. Finally, remember your privacy is worth protecting You might not have anything to hide (except your embarrassing Netflix history) but that doesn’t mean you should be blase about your privacy. Increasingly, our inner lives are being reduced to a series of data points; every little thing we do is for sale. As we’re starting to see, this nonstop surveillance changes us. It influences the things we buy and the ideas we buy into. Being more mindful of our online behaviour, then, isn’t just important when it comes to protecting our information, it’s essential to protecting our individuality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/01/amen-dunes-freedom-review-damon-mcmahon","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Amen Dunes: Freedom review – cosmic tilts and baggy beats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/01/amen-dunes-freedom-review-damon-mcmahon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/01/amen-dunes-freedom-review-damon-mcmahon","fields":{"headline":"Amen Dunes: Freedom review – cosmic tilts and baggy beats","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"New York-dwelling troubadour Damon McMahon’s fourth album arrives on a vapour trail of praise for his well-regarded 2014 album, Love. Not one to shy away from a big, loaded title, McMahon follows up Love with Freedom, tackling troubled masculinity through a series of character studies and a mesmerising, still psych-indebted sound that has fleshed out even further. Witness Blue Rose, as close to a pop song as Amen Dunes have come. Miki Dora, meanwhile, takes its name from an infamous pro surfer and con artist, and finds McMahon’s lackadaisical yet intense drawl addressing his younger skater self. Skipping School locates his own father as a kid, “in the alley, sniffing glue”. It’s not always men: McMahon’s mother, diagnosed with terminal cancer during the album’s recording, is the subject of Believe. Songs such as Believe carry on the affinity Amen Dunes’ older music had with early Spiritualized or Mazzy Star. Much of Freedom, by contrast, finds the now close-cropped McMahon channelling Mike Skinner on his cover portrait and sounding more like an American take on Richard Ashcroft, with Blue Rose nearing a baggy beat. You can hear an Ashcroft-like cosmic tilt, too. In interviews, McMahon has said what he’s aiming for on this involving album is “a relinquishing of self through an exploration of self”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/02/forest-schools-grow-in-scotland-as-grasp-of-benefits-takes-root","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T14:10:19Z","webTitle":"Outdoor learning grows in Scotland as grasp of benefits takes root","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/02/forest-schools-grow-in-scotland-as-grasp-of-benefits-takes-root","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/02/forest-schools-grow-in-scotland-as-grasp-of-benefits-takes-root","fields":{"headline":"Outdoor learning grows in Scotland as grasp of benefits takes root","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a bright spring morning, the air is crisp as an apple and the children of Lauriston Castle forest kindergarten are inventing muddy meals at their imaginary cafe. This woodland, north-west of Edinburgh city centre, has become an outdoor classroom for the day, with waterproofs and lunch boxes clustered around the lower branches of the trees. A black labrador liberates himself from his owner and charges through the sunny glade, to the youngsters’ delight. But unexpected connections are all part of outdoor learning, as early-years officer Amanda Patrick explained. “We might pick up pine cones in the morning, and talk about what they are and what we could do with them. Then they make owls with the cones, so we read a story about owls and then learn a big word, ‘nocturnal’. “In the classroom the kids ask permission to do this or that,” said Patrick, “but outside they are much more creative and don’t need an adult to lead them. This is what early-years education should be, child-centred and child-led.” Educators and policymakers across the political spectrum are increasingly convinced by the growing heft of evidence about the exponentially positive impact of learning outdoors on everything from eyesight to risk assessment to resilience. There is particular focus on outdoor, play-based learning for early years, with the entire shortlist for the UK’s best nursery at last years’ Nursery World Awards made up of outdoor operations. In Scotland, this conviction is also propelled by practicalities. Two years ago, a study of 38 nations ranked Scotland joint last for physical activity, while childhood obesity levels continue to rise, with a quarter of five-year-olds deemed to be at risk. As well as schoolchildren’s Daily Mile, a scheme pioneered by a primary school in Stirling, the chief medical officer recommends three hours of activity a day for under-fives, and outdoor experience is already a part of Scotland’s “curriculum for excellence”. Meanwhile, a number of local authorities are making ambitious moves to expand outdoor learning as part of their plans to meet the Scottish government’s commitment to a near-doubling of funded childcare by 2020, providing 1,140 hours a year for all three- and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds. This February, the children’s minister, Maree Todd, announced funding of more than £850,000 to explore how to embed outdoor learning in this expansion, pledging to make it “a defining feature of childhood in Scotland”. The rest of the UK has likewise seen a huge growth in forest nurseries, teacher training and campaigns to celebrate outdoor learning, although there has been no comparable funding from the Welsh Assembly, while England’s national play strategy was halted in 2010. Physical space is an ongoing problem. While nurseries in England must provide daily access to outside play, a 2016 survey by the charity Learning through Landscapes found a wide variation, with many settings struggling with inadequate space and a minority of children not getting this entitlement at all. The Lauriston Castle kindergarten is part of an Edinburgh city council pilot offering 600 hours of nursery and 500 hours of forest annually, with 100 staff undergoing a three-day training course to become forest leaders. Todd said: “Our previous trials have shown that the biggest initial barriers to take-up are staff confidence in how to deliver quality outdoor learning and encouraging parental engagement; however, the trials also show these are very easily overcome, especially when staff and parents see the benefits first-hand.” Rachel Cowper is play programme manager for the social justice organisation Inspiring Scotland, which the Scottish government is funding to work with eight local authorities to develop outdoor learning. This demands a culture change among adults, she explained, not least regarding Scotland’s default weather: rain. “On visiting Laurieston Castle it was bucketing down, but the kids didn’t bat an eyelid. They were using the rainwater to play and learn about volume and displacement. If they were inside it wouldn’t be allowed in case it made the floor slippy and unsafe,” Cowper said. While Argyll and Bute council, with its abundance of accessible coastline, has already committed to 50% outdoor provision by 2020, Cowper remains ambivalent about whether setting targets is profitable: “Currently it’s up to the individual council nursery, so should we work on a culture change or guidelines that they then strain to meet?” She is also adamant that outdoor learning is no middle-class luxury: Inspiring Scotland is partnering Glasgow city council in three of its most deprived areas – Castlemilk, Drumchapel and Tollcross – and she described it as “poverty-proof”. Glasgow city council’s early-years manager, Heather Douglas, agreed: “This absolutely can apply to everyone. If you look at the history of outdoor provision, it has been dominated by articulate middle-class parents who recognise the good it can do, so now we have a job to do with parents, too, especially younger parents who were screen children themselves. But Inspiring Scotland’s work has shown that community engagement works. “These outdoor areas are all within walking distance so there are no transport costs, and there’s no capital cost, because you don’t need big expensive buildings, just a shelter. You do need to invest in warm, waterproof clothing, for children and staff. But there’s no spend on fancy toys or equipment, because the natural world provides all that.” Douglas is well aware of the squeeze on space in a built-up urban environment – she mentions one nursery that is sandwiched between the M8 and the Clydeside Expressway. So the city council is also considering how to use Glasgow’s many magnificent public parks as a base for outdoor nursery shifts, alongside the possibility of registering unused outdoor space close to existing nurseries, and rewilding them on a small scale. “We’re looking at all these spaces around the city: you see bits of scrubby wasteland, but who owns them and can we use them? Why would we not want our parks to be full of little children?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/never-going-to-bed-children-rewrite-house-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T07:59:07Z","webTitle":"‘We’re never going to bed’: children rewrite the house rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/never-going-to-bed-children-rewrite-house-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/never-going-to-bed-children-rewrite-house-rules","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re never going to bed’: children rewrite the house rules","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘The house has the airless discombobulation of a student house in the 90s, the day after a big night out on ecstasy’: Decca Aitkenhead Three hours in, I feel weightless, almost giddy. I’m lying on the sofa with my boys, eating chocolate, watching telly, and it is no exaggeration to say that I am having the time of my life. For the first time in eight and a half years, I am not in charge. This exotic sensation of relaxation is completely unfamiliar – and yet stirs a distant memory of who I used to be. The kids-in-charge experiment began at 1pm, and I can’t believe how well it’s going. In truth I’d been dreading it, braced for carnage, but so far it has been nothing but fun. At 1.01pm the boys had raced to the bakery and spent £10 on cakes, before charging on up the road for lunch in McDonald’s. I’m very much enjoying the absence of washing-up, and curious to see what they will eat next. Jake proposes a trip to the corner shop for provisions. I float along the pavement beside him, laughing at his jokes; his mood is unrecognisably effervescent, fizzing with wit, and I tell him he’s on cracking form. He halts and turns to me, his expression suddenly earnest. “But don’t you see? This is the real me. Your rules make me go,” and he shrinks, hunching his shoulders and drawing his wrists together as if cuffed. “But our rules have unleashed the real me,” and he skips off into the shop. Jake and Joe’s rules Decca isn’t allowed to say no No baths Hourly food fight Unlimited screens No bedtime Decca has to play Laser Tag when we want Unlimited sweets and crisps and chocolates and fizzy drinks Decca has to disco dance when we want Email Donald Trump every 10 hours to insult him We are allowed to get games on Decca’s phone Allowed to swear Unlimited water fights Worst table manners No vegetables Allowed to jump on Decca’s bed, to play on a Wii and to pee on the toilet seat I stare after him, stunned. What if he is right? What have I been thinking all these years, grimly policing bedtimes and broccoli and pee on the toilet seat? By other parents’ standards I’d always considered myself relatively permissive; I’ve neither the time nor energy to be a helicopter/tiger mum. But now, as the tension of everyday parenting melts away, I’m beginning to see the grinding joylessness of family life under my rules. In the shop, I watch Jake’s brain struggle to adjust to the heady concept of limitlessness. He dances up the aisles, dazed by possibilities, turning out of habit to seek permission as he reaches for a sack of crisps. Seeing my smiley shrug, he grabs a chocolate bar next – then, like a prisoner acclimatising to freedom, two great handfuls. The only point at which I intervene is when he asks the shopkeeper for “two cans of Stella Art… Art… Artoize”. We come home with £52-worth of fizzy drinks, sweets, crisps and cookies, which the boys lay out across the kitchen table like a gaudy tablecloth spun from confectionery. Our fruit bowls and jars of lentils and seeds on the shelves now look as if they have been Photoshopped in from somebody else’s house. The kitchen resembles a reality TV set housing two ludicrously incompatible families. While the sugar-rush kicks in, an almighty pillow fight breaks out, and it begins to feel a bit Lord Of The Flies. Jake sets up an old Wii donated by a family friend. Ordinarily, the boys are allowed 15 minutes a day of TV after school, movies at weekends, and no other screens, unless a) at other people’s houses, b) on long-haul flights, or c) on holidays where a luggage allowance can’t accommodate a fortnight’s worth of Lego/books/lightsabers, etc. My iPad will occasionally be deployed in an emergency situation, but that’s the extent of the boys’ access to technology. Having grown up in the 70s without a television, I consider these rules quite generous – but then, the appeal of electronic devices has always been lost on me. Jake and Joe are hoping to use this opportunity to convert me to their charms – and so, at the age of 47, I play my first video game. It is called Bomberman Land. They’re so thrilled to see their mum operate a console, I almost want to enjoy it. Instead, I’m nonplussed, and very quickly bored. They get me to play Lego Batman next, but it makes me feel seasick. Puzzled by my failure to share their enthusiasm, they invite their eight-year-old friend John round. When Joe shrieks at him, “We’re never going to bed!” it strikes me that I might need some company, too. I rustle up some friends, Chinese delivery and wine, and we have the loveliest evening, joyously uninterrupted by the tedium of bedtime rituals. No teeth will be brushed, no toys tidied away. The kids don’t even need to be fed. They work their way through their provisions like locusts, until the house is littered in a confetti of wrappers. By 1.30am, I cannot keep my eyes open, and go to bed with three boys hunched beside me, playing Lego Harry Potter on the Wii. When I awake at 4.50am, I think I must be dreaming. Last New Year’s Eve, Jake stayed up until 3am – but that was at a party, and even then Joe folded by midnight. I would have said it wasn’t physically possible for them to last any longer. But beside me in the bed are three small boys, wide awake, eyes glued to the video game. At 7.30am, I find them asleep, fully dressed, surrounded by cookie crumbs and crumpled Fanta cans. Shortly after 8am, Joe appears downstairs. I ask how he feels. “Good. I nearly just vomited. But yeah, good.” He takes a can of Coke from the fridge, pours himself a bowl full of condensed sweetened milk, and eats it with a spoon. When it’s all gone, he moves on to the Nutella. To watch one’s child shovel spoonfuls from the jar into his mouth and do nothing is a kind of out-of-body experience – like observing a car crash involving your children and simply driving on by. It feels horrifying but oddly liberating. When Jake shambles downstairs – bumping off the walls, all coordination shot – the first words from his mouth are: “Can I have your phone?” And that is how the day proceeds. After John’s dad collects him, Jake and Joe summon a revolving cast of school friends who arrive with eyes like saucers, scarcely able to believe the scenes they find in our house. The curtains remain closed, my phone and laptop are commandeered, and the various devices absorb their unbroken attention. Nobody washes, or dresses, or even says much. By afternoon, I realise what the atmosphere in the house reminds me of: it has the airless discombobulation of a student house in the 90s, the day after a big night out on ecstasy; time has been suspended, sleep forgotten, brain cells impaired. On the plus side, for the first time in about four years I’m left in peace to read not one but two Saturday papers cover to cover. If the boys are in thrall to their new freedom, a bit of me is too. I don’t have to cook, or chivvy, or entertain; I don’t have to do anything. By the evening, I feel rancid and sick. My stomach is in shock, reeling from all the sugar; all I want to do is go to bed. Jake and Joe, on the other hand, are having the time of their lives. “Brilliant!” they exclaim whenever I ask how they’re feeling. “This is the. Best. Weekend. EVER!” At around 10pm, I coax them to watch cartoons with me in my bed, calculating that once untethered from the Wii they must fall asleep, which thank God they do. “So, what do you want to do today?” They wake up with 11 hours left of their rules before we revert to mine. So far we haven’t even left the house. “Trampolining? Go-karting? Anything you want.” These activities are not typical features of our family weekends, but exist only in the prized category of annual birthday treats. “You’re in charge,” I remind them. “What shall we do?” Jake considers his options. “I think I’d just like to stay in and play on devices.” And this is what they do again, all day. All their funny and entertaining rules are forgotten; they don’t want me to do a chicken dance, or pillow fight; they forget all about emailing Donald Trump. They don’t even want KFC or Burger King, but send me back to the shop for another £20-worth of chemically coloured sugar. By now, pancakes are looking like a pretty nutritious food group to me, so while the boys stare at more screens I make some. As I line breakfast trays with colourful napkins, arrange toppings into pretty glass ramekins and serve the boys on the sofa, it dawns on me that I never, ever do this. I tell my kids I love them all the time – but when do I show it? I’m always too busy processing them through the interminable drill of teeth, shoes, PE kit, coats, to think to stop and make a fuss of them. I’d never noticed how often I say no to my kids until they banned it, but now I think about it I can’t remember the last time I said yes when they asked me to play. Mortified, I bound into the living room and challenge the boys to a Laser Tag battle. I might as well have marched into a crack den and proposed a game of croquet. Jake and Joe are dead-eyed and sluggish, stinking of stale sweat, oblivious to anything but the Wii; within 48 hours, technology and sugar have stripped all the vitality of childhood away, and turned them into drug addicts. The analogy sounds melodramatic, but the parallels are unmistakable. I think back to day one, and to Jake’s heady spirits. It had felt delightful. But I fear it was just what’s known as a “We’ve-Called-The-Dealer!” high, the only difference being that the boys’ drugs of choice are both legal and considered perfectly normal. The epiphany of the weekend is my neglect of frivolity, and we revert to my rules with a new resolve to make family life more fun. But if the boys had hoped their rules might relax mine on video games and sweets, the plan has badly backfired. The verdict Jake Wilkinson, eight When our mum told us that we were going to get to set our own rules, we wanted to start straight away. We were looking forward to doing it so much, and it was so exciting. We did the easy ones first, like unlimited screens and sweets, stay up all night; but then we thought of some whackier ones. When our friend John came round for a sleepover, it was more like the longest playdate in the world, because there was no sleep. I learned that no rules is the best thing ever, and I wish it was like that every day. If we did it again, I wouldn’t change a single rule. Joe Wilkinson, six My favourite thing was Mum spending so much money on lots of sweets. On Saturday morning, I felt like I was going to vomit, but I didn’t, so I carried on eating them. Setting our own rules was fun, but it was quite unhealthy for us. By the end of the weekend my tummy stuck out about a metre. I think if we were in charge all the time, we might get ill. But I’d love to do it again. ‘I had hoped there might be a hint of gratitude that we were indulging her every whim. No chance’: Sarfraz Manzoor On the first day of kids’ rules, it was snowing and school was closed. My wife, Bridget, was at work, our one-year old son Ezra was with his childminder, and I was at home with our six-year-old daughter, Laila, who was busy wolfing down a bowl of Coco Pops. When we first told Laila that we were going to consent to her every demand, she started with the food: “I want Coco Pops for breakfast and chips with peas and fish fingers for dinner every day. And I want to eat my pudding before dinner – because pudding is the best part.” No more granola; no more boring old vegetables and grains. Then she got into the swing of things: no more arguments, no phone at dinner time, no set bedtime. Ordinarily, on a day off, Laila would have asked me to read her a book, or she would have drawn pictures or played with her toys. Not today. “I want to watch Ben &amp; Holly’s Magic Kingdom”. Laila’s rules Watch more TV Have Mummy and Daddy both read to me at bedtime No arguing Daddy not to look at his phone at dinnertime Breakfast of Coco Pops Dinner of fish fingers, chips and peas Bedtime when I want Daddy singing songs from Matilda at bedtime No tidying up Bridget grew up in a family that did not own a television until she was 16, and Laila watches less television than many of her friends – about half an hour every other Saturday. And now here she was, still in her pyjamas, watching what turned out to be two hours of television, the equivalent of eight weeks’ worth in her ordinary life. Bridget and I have been together for 10 years and my guess is that we don’t argue any more than other married couples, but we also don’t argue any less. Yet one of Laila’s rules was no more arguing. It didn’t take long after Bridget had returned from work for the first argument to begin brewing, but we had to stop ourselves. We focused on frying Laila’s dinner. When her food was ready, Laila refused to sit down on her chair: she wanted to eat lying flat on the floor. We couldn’t argue with her – or with each other – so we sat there growing silently annoyed. On the first night, Laila asked that Bridget and I put her to bed together – taking it in turns to read a book to her. That was lovely – our little girl snuggled up between us as we read Moominsummer Madness. At bathtime she had asked Bridget to join her in the tub. It was touching how many of her rules were aimed at spending more time with us. I wondered if this was a reaction to the fact that since her brother, Ezra, had been born, the amount of attention we could devote exclusively to her had inevitably been reduced. I had always thought that the greatest gift I could give my daughter was to make her aware of the music of Bruce Springsteen – I had sung his songs to her at bedtime since she was born – so I was a little hurt when she demanded a change the moment she was in charge. “I want something from Matilda,” she said. I dutifully looked up the lyrics to When I Grow Up – which, while lacking the narrative drama of Springsteen’s The River, was not half bad. On the second day, Laila continued with her diet of Coco Pops, chips and television, but decided she didn’t just want us to both read to her: she also wanted to sleep in the same bed as Bridget. I was exiled to the sofa bed. I had hoped, perhaps naively, that there might be the tiniest hint of gratitude for the fact that Bridget and I were indulging her every whim. No chance. That night, neither Bridget nor Laila slept well and the following day the combination of sugar, sleep deprivation and freedom pushed her over the edge. She woke up grumpy and hungry. The Coco Pops may have been delicious but they weren’t filling her up. The hunger mutated to irritability. She refused to put on her coat or wellington boots to go out on to the snowy streets, and insisted on walking outside barefoot in tights and a summer dress. We felt like terrible parents to be allowing it, but each time we suggested anything that seemed like sensible advice, she would start screaming, calling us stupid and telling us to shut up. She screamed on the street and howled and writhed on the London underground as commuters tried to avert their eyes. She screamed her demands to watch her favourite programme in a way that was both terrifying and heart-breaking: “I want Ben &amp; Holly NOW and when I say now I mean NOW!” she shouted. I felt grateful that the man who lived in the flat below us is in his 80s and hard of hearing. We tried to remind her of all the toys and books and crayons and games she had. Laila looked at them and said two words I don’t recall her ever saying: “I’m bored.” We have always tried to offer a united front in the face of challenges, but Bridget and I had very different ideas about how to deal with Laila’s behaviour. I had been raised in a family where I would not have dared to raise my voice to my dad – he was never physical but he exerted such authority that to talk back to him, even in my 20s, was unthinkable. Bridget’s parents encouraged her to show emotion – and as a teenager she threatened to throw a chair at her mother. And so, in the face of Laila’s meltdown, Bridget and I found ourselves arguing about the best course of action, which of course prompted Laila to point out: “You’re not allowed to argue in front of me.” Bridget stormed out of the room, accidentally stepping on a beloved furry rabbit ears headband, which broke, prompting more wails from Laila. Ordinarily, the ears would have not been on the floor because they would have been tidied away, but the Laila rules stipulated that she did not have to do any tidying. “Laila, I don’t like what you’re turning into,” Bridget said plaintively. “I want Ben &amp; Holly!” screamed Laila, and deliberately tipped a glass of water on to the carpet. “That’s it,” said Bridget, “we are abandoning this bloody experiment!” Laila was beside herself. I wondered whether we had ended the experiment or whether the experiment had ended us. A few days later, I was putting Laila to bed and she was being her old self – funny, clever and loving. This transformation back to something close to her old self was, for me, an indication of the dangers in giving children what they want, rather than what they need. That said, being made aware of just how important Laila found spending time with us has led me to try to be more present for her when I am with her – and not to keep using my phone in front of her. The following morning, Laila was digging into a bowl of granola. “I’m wondering how the other families are doing with the children being the boss? I’m guessing it’s going bad.” “Why do you say that?” I asked. Laila looked up at me. “Because it went bad for us,” she replied. The verdict Laila Manzoor, six I came up with the rules by thinking about what my favourite things were and I tried to make them into a list. I also didn’t want Mummy and Daddy to argue because it is a bit annoying because it’s a bit noisy. I liked them both putting me to bed because it was nice to hear both their different voices. It was nice to be between them in bed because I could curl up with both of them. I think grownups should set the rules because it is more healthy. If I just ate chips and Coco Pops I would maybe vomit a hundred times a day. ‘I feel like Theresa May during Brexit negotiations’: Clover Stroud With more than 15 years between my five children, negotiating rules they all agree on turns out to be an immensely complicated process, and is possibly the reason we have so few rules in our house anyway. It’s brought home to me as I herd them around the kitchen table, hoping for a serious and productive discussion. Lester, the youngest at 18 months, swings his bare feet in his highchair, idly tipping a beaker of milk on to the floor. The eldest, Jimmy, 17, slouches at the far end of the table, glowering with a tangible sense that rules are only made to be broken. He only looks from his phone when he actually catches the gist of what I’m proposing. “So, like, we’ll be able to do anything we want and you have to let it go?” he says, pausing mid Snapchat to listen. Patiently, I start explaining that he can dictate certain rules I must obey, until I realise he’s turning my speech into a Snapchat Story, and I hurriedly have to shut the meeting down before I’m shared as a humiliating social media meme. With two distinct age groups in our family – the teenagers, Jimmy and Dolly, 14, and the pre-schoolers, Lester, Dash, three, and Evangeline, five – we create two sets of rules. The smaller children’s demands don’t look too exhausting, as they want to do things like eat more pizza and sweets, and watch more telly. But the teenagers challenge me. I feel like Theresa May during Brexit negotiations, as I start out convinced I can have my cake and eat it, but quickly realise I won’t get what I want and that it’s going to hurt. Jimmy and Dolly’s rules A lift anywhere, any time Weekly family games night Themed dinner every night – Mexican, Indian, etc Constant supply of chocolate cereal We decide bedtime Evangeline, Dash and Lester’s rules Sweets every day Watch telly every day after school Sleep in Mum’s bed To be read to for as long as we want every night Pizza for supper Not all of it’s painful – Dolly wants regular themed cooking evenings and a family games night, which almost breaks my heart – but Jimmy goes for the jugular, demanding a lift anywhere, at any time. This is my achilles heel. We live in rural Oxfordshire, on the edge of a tiny village with no school, shop or pub. It’s not as remote as living in the Brecon Beacons, or the Highlands, but we have to drive absolutely everywhere; by 7.30pm, when the smaller children are in bed, I’ll do anything not to have to run a taxi service for the teenagers. I hope this environment has given Jimmy, whose desire to be as far away as possible from family life is more finely developed than Dolly’s, a more profound relationship with the natural world. I sometimes feel he’s like a character in a Thomas Hardy novel, as he spends a lot of time walking to meet mates across ploughed fields, often by moonlight or in driving rain. I’m under no illusion he’s not up to all the usual teenage tricks, as he’s able to get pizza, and probably all sorts of other things teenagers enjoy, delivered to nearby fields where he meets friends. But I like to think it’s also given him a special appreciation of the eerie shriek of a fox at night, or the strange, blank stare of a swooping barn owl. But under his new rules, I’ll have to drive him everywhere. Despite my impending sense of exhaustion, the rules bring a sense of celebration to the house. Dolly finds the Monopoly and Cluedo sets, which haven’t seen an outing in a while, and several packs of cards appear, as if she’s setting up a casino in the playroom. At the supermarket, Evangeline and Dash are vigilant about picking out packets of pepperoni and mozzarella for pizzas, and add several extra bags of Haribos they’d never usually get past me to the shopping basket. Dolly and Jimmy are also quite demanding about meal planning and want a rolling programme of Mexican, Thai, Lebanese, Chinese and Indian meals cooked for them. I start off with huge culinary enthusiasm, knocking up enchiladas and guacamole, prawn toast and tom yum, fried haloumi and Lebanese salad from scratch every night. In theory, this is great for all of us, but as I’ve promised pizza on demand to the younger children, I’m also dealing with a gang of floury elves at my feet, squabbling over whose turn it is to sprinkle the mozzarella. It’s like running an international all-you-can-eat buffet every evening. By day four, I’ve swapped homemade sourdough pizza dough for ready-rolled, and bought a take-away Chinese for the teenagers. Under their rules, at the end of the evening, when I would usually whip through a single chapter of reading to the younger children, I now have to read “for as long as we want”. When I finally get back downstairs to the kitchen, I’m confronted by Jimmy, on his third bowl of Krave cereal, despite having eaten supper an hour before, demanding a lift to town to meet a friend. Late-night driving is a nightmare in the country, but especially at this point in the winter, when the nights are long, icy and bitterly cold. Under normal circumstances, I would not even consider it. The week is properly draining, and at one point the younger children become slightly deranged by their free-range life, fighting over sweets which seem to be strewn all over the house like sticky confetti. The biggest row of the week is between Dash and Evangeline, who both want credit for having come up with the idea of sweets on tap, and I find Dash screaming at his sister, holding a fistful of her hair, as she stuffs Jelly Babies into her mouth. “I want a rule! Where are my rules? I want some rules!” he wails. There were more surprising results, too. I’d expected the younger kids to be glued to the TV, but they seem to forget about it quite quickly. They love the amount of bedtime reading they get, but even Dash admitted that sleeping in his own bed was better, as there were “too many legs” in mine. On their watch, I feel more playful, and less didactic and shouty than normal. I give in to the chaos more readily, which is a revelation, and certainly more effective at thrusting me into the moment than any amount of meditation and mindfulness. Endless cooking of themed suppers requires careful shopping, but it’s also bonding. Amazingly, once I give in and stop fighting the idea, even the late-night driving has some benefits. Close to midnight, driving through the darkness, Jimmy and I have some of our best conversations. Away from the white noise of the younger children, I nag less and he opens up more, and it gives us precious time together. The verdict Jimmy Hughes, 17 It was good to be the official voice in the way the house is run. I mean, we all do what we want most of the time anyway, but it was nice to actually have it in writing. Some of the rules seemed momentous when we set them, but in reality weren’t that life-changing. Like with sleep: I realised I’m quite responsible about the time I go to bed, as we have to get up really early to get to school in time. It was great being the boss for once, as she’s a massive boss. I’m 17, she’s 42, so we’re living in a constant power struggle anyway. Dolly Hughes, 14 I just enjoyed being more involved with cooking, and making sure we spend time together as a family. Mum’s usually quite tired by the time the kids go to bed, as they’re insanely noisy, but because we’d made a commitment to play games together in the evening, we kept to it. That felt special. • Commenting on this piece?

But in terms of more detailed guidance, your question itself reveals how female authors have come to be seen as a monolith, a cultural entity to be scaled and conquered. Better to ask: What kind of writing do you like? What sort of fiction floats your boat? Perhaps it’s historical (Hilary Mantel, Lissa Evans, Jennifer Egan’s latest, Manhattan Beach, or Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Half of a Yellow Sun). Maybe you’d like to discover some fiction in translation, via novelists such as Han Kang (The White Book, translated by Deborah Smith) or Leila Slimani (Lullaby, translated by Sam Taylor). Would you like to laugh with Nina Stibbe, or to cry with Hanya Yanagihara? You see the issue: the world of books is fantastically plural, and you’ll only find what you like best by dipping a toe in.

The small brown native songbird is endangered, with only about 2,500 left in Australia and 40 in Queensland, but because the bird is so shy, it is difficult for conservationists to monitor them. To make things more difficult when people approach, the bristlebird stops singing. Jessie Oliver, a PhD student at the Queensland University of Technology, is trying to help conservationists look after the bird by figuring out where they are. In 2015 she joined forces with the eastern bristlebird recovery team to set up remote recorders in the Queensland bush. By recording and recognising the birds, conservationists have been able to keep tabs on its small population. It is one of the many examples of environmental scientists turning to citizen scientists to help them with their research, relying on ordinary people to collect information. Citizen science is currently booming in Australia and around the world. As research funding dries up, and technology makes cataloguing and tracking everything easier, citizens are increasingly filling the data collection void. Amateur stargazers create crowdsourced star maps. Gamers with spare CPU capacity link up in mass computing events that model the way protein strands work and CSIRO is calling on householders to track their energy use. But across disciplines, it is environmental science that attracts the most projects and the most dedicated people. The chairwoman of the Australian Citizen Science Association, Erin Roger, says this makes citizen science a crucial part of the evolution of modern science. “Environmental agencies have massive amounts of data requirements and needs,” she says. “Professional science alone cannot provide information at the scales and resolutions necessary to understand environmental change. “For the environmental issues we see today, that traditional ivory tower approach isn’t enough anymore. Citizen science is trying to make science more accessible to everyone and trying to break down those barriers that have existed between scientists and the broader public.” In many ways, she says, it is also a return to science’s roots. After all, Gregor Mendel, who discovered hereditary genetics, was a monk who grew peas. “From everything we’ve heard,” Roger says, “people really respond to the idea of making a contribution and doing something for the greater good. People are realising that their data adds value, and their contribution has value.” ‘We are part of something greater’ As well as studying bristlebirds, Oliver sits as a general member of the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA). In Februrary, the association held its annual citizen science conference, drawing 250 delegates and Australia’s chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel. “We have a long history of great citizen science,” he said in his speech. “And we ought to hear more about it. “We often focus on the ‘science’ part of citizen science. But the ‘citizen’ is important as well. It reminds us that we are part of something greater than ourselves ... On this reading, citizen science has never been more important, or alive. Everything I know about human beings tells me that the golden age of citizen science is still ahead.” Macquarie University’s Dr Emilie Ens also presented on her project, Ngukurr Wi Stadi bla Kantri. The project, which has run for 10 years, brings Western-trained scientists to work with Indigenous residents in the Northern Territory. Ens, her team and the citizen volunteers have preserved cultural wetlands, preserved traditional languages and discovered a new species of skink. “[Citizen science is] about the balancing of knowledge,” Ens says. “It involves people. People take ownership, they’re the ones learning and discovering and maintaining their environment. Their knowledge is valuable and valued as well as Western science.” The longevity of Wi Studi bla Kantri reflects a point raised by many scientists in the citizen scientist field – it taps into something intrinsic to the scientific method. “Birders love to engage with each other and share knowledge and share sightings,” Oliver says. “It’s getting what people are naturally doing and digitising it.” Roger agrees. She says the boom is partly due to technology aligning with the ages-old impulse to help out – smartphones make it so much easier for people to collect data with timestamps, location and metadata. “There have always been these avid naturalists and environmentalists,” she says. “They have been collecting data no matter what name its badged under.” The waterbug census If you sign up to the waterbug census, Yvonne Cabuang will send you a datasheet with 140 species. For the past five years, the Victorian-based project, run by Melbourne Water, has monitored water pollution, river health and, with a few added steps, platypus population by asking citizen scientists to look at bugs. Volunteers are trained over five or six hours, handed a net and asked to report on waterbug diversity in their local waterways. By “waterbugs”, Cabuang means aquatic macro invertebrates – flies, beetles, worms, snails and shrimp. “Something with a backbone that you can see with a magnifying glass or your own eye if it’s good,” she says. Waterbugs are living indicators of a waterway’s health and sensitive to change, the canaries in the coalmine of pollution. Waterbugs are also the main food source for platypuses, and all the data collected by citizens goes into a management plan to increase platypus populations. “When female platypus are pregnant, they can eat their entire body weight in bugs,” Cabuang says. The census is something that Melbourne Water and ecologists have always done, and still do. But the added data from citizen involvement is invaluable. The program draws about 130 people a year – 660 total since it began – and last year, across spring and autumn, citizens identified more than 6,000 waterbugs across 47 different sites. The findings are double checked by researchers and, to guard against inaccuracies, volunteers go through a grading process that is “a bit like karate”. “You start out at a yellow belt and if you get it to a black belt you’re really smashing it,” Cabuang says. The second-highest, a blue belt, requires 60 hours of identifying, conducted across two seasons. For Cabuang, the beauty of the program is that it encourages scientific literacy while also helping scientists collect data. “There was a citizen science conference at the start of the year and they talked about how one of the barriers to science is that people are fearful of science,” she says. “They think it is hard. “For me, someone who didn’t study science in high school and only went back to it at uni, I can really relate to that. When I was young, I thought science was scary and hard. But if you’re just going to look at bugs, that’s not scary. “Stoneflies are really cool – they sit in a stream and to get oxygen they wiggle their bottoms around like a dog wagging its tail. They are charismatic, they have these little things they do. Once you start looking at them, you get really hooked. That barrier disappears.” Mildew mania In Western Australia, schoolchildren from Broome to Esperance plant barley every year in the hope of finding fungus. Mildew Mania is a program run by Curtin University to track the spread and evolution of powdery mildew – a fungal disease that can devastate most agricultural crops. Like the waterbug census, the program teaches scientific principles (it dovetails with most school curricula) and helps scientists achieve what they can’t do alone. Schools receive barley seeds in the mail and grow the plant in a place exposed to the wind. Students watch for the telltale signs of fungus and, after a few months, with a handbook, a magnifying glass and a vial with agar jelly down the bottom, send the cuttings back to researchers. Like the flu, powdery mildew mutates every year, creating a constant agricultural arms race between farmers and the fungus. With the students’ help, researchers can test whether disease-resistant barley strains are holding up or if the fungus is starting to beat it. “You want to be ahead of the game,” researcher Dr Nola D’Souza says. “There are millions and millions of spores, and it just takes one which is virulent on that resistant gene.” Coolbinia primary school in Perth has been involved with Mildew Mania since it began in 2011. It is a school with a big garden area where the children plant their barley on the edge of the school oval. Dr Elaine Lewis is the school’s cross-curriculum leader, and she says the children love the program. It teaches scientific literacy, shows the city kids what it is like to live on a farm and demonstrates that they can take part in environmental and social change. “It becomes quite a meaningful thing,” she says. “It becomes a very personal experience, because it is not an ordinary planting project. There is a big picture behind it. Kids will come in and report whether there is mildew on plants at home.” Over seven years, Mildew Mania has involved 19,000 students across 247 schools. Last year 65 schools and 2,700 students took part and scientists sent out 700 experiment kits. Before the project, scientists had to take samples themselves, based off tips from farmers. They soon realised the distances were too great. “WA is huge,” D’Souza says. “We figured out it’s pretty impossible really. We were thinking what’s a better way?” The process now aims at much more data but is still thorough. Students take two kinds of sample: a live leaf sample with a pustule, inserted into a vial with agar, and put in an ice pack; and a swab. Researchers reculture the sample themselves and test them again in the lab but D’Souza says most of the student samples are “really quite good”. “Sometimes they’re so thorough that they oversample. They send through 10 different samples.” She says the data collected could be used to study whether the disease has been affected or accelerated by climate change. It is a point that is especially important to Lewis. Participating in Mildew Mania, she says, teaches students they have the power to contribute to positive environmental change. “The kids are seeing how they can contribute to the sustainability to our planet,” she says. “We want them to not feel like it’s too hard and there’s nothing we can do. That can sometimes happen when you look at these issues. Whether it’s water or energy or biodiversity, we want them to finish primary school knowing that they are empowered to make a difference in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/huw-richards-19-year-old-youtuber-future-of-gardening","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T12:13:48Z","webTitle":"Move over, Titchmarsh: Why 19 year-old YouTuber Huw Richards is the future of gardening","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/huw-richards-19-year-old-youtuber-future-of-gardening","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/huw-richards-19-year-old-youtuber-future-of-gardening","fields":{"headline":"Move over, Titchmarsh: Why 19 year-old YouTuber Huw Richards is the future of gardening","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Huw Richards.

He’s an ex-public schoolboy turned gardener. Turned what? Gardener. Is that what the kids are calling a practitioner of some disgusting form of nonprocreative sex these days? No. It means someone who gardens. Does gardening. Richards runs a vlog – that means putting homemade videos on a pet subject up on YouTube – about growing things in the ground. Well, I never did! What does he grow? It’s drugs, isn’t it? Or skateboards. No, it’s vegetables mostly. “My passion is food production,” he says. “So if someone had an empty garden or one that was full of junk, and wanted to grow their own food, I would love to go in and transform it.” Does he know enough, at 19? His family runs an 11-acre smallholding that has chickens, pigs, ducks and sheep, and grow their own produce. He posted his first video at 12, “when I was bored after school” and had seen his friend get 200 views from a gaming video. Does he get as many? These days, Richards has 75,000 subscribers to his channel, HuwsNursery, and has amassed millions of views on YouTube and Facebook. He has recently secured sponsorship deals with gardening tool companies and seed suppliers, too. His friend must be gutted. History does not record. So, what spot is he hitting with the public exactly? Basically, demystifying gardening and making it as easy as possible for beginners. Some of his most popular individual videos are “Seven gardening hacks with plastic bottles”, “Growing potatoes the lazy way” and “Ten terrific tomato growing tips”. Cool, daddio. He also suggests growing beans in empty toilet roll tubes before planting them out, soaking dried marrowfat peas for 24 hours to grow pea shoots from them, and – my particular favourite – sowing seeds in guttering filled with compost and, when the seedlings are ready for transplanting outside, sliding the whole thing out of the gutter and into a readymade trench. What’s next for the greenfingered wunderkind? He’s getting a bit of telly work already, but says he would love to present Gardener’s World, or something like it, and bring the joy of sustainably producing your own food to the world.

A note-by-note analysis Readers have been debating the issues in this analysis of whether the “Lana Del Radiohead” nickname is a fair one. Here are some of your thoughts. ‘There seems to be an issue between inspiration and plagiarism’ Just a point. Music, like most arts, have been about borrowing. At some point, due to copyright laws, borrowing became stealing. Disney would be the first to sue you if you appropriated one of their characters into your own art, but Disney has made it’s fortune on stories out of copyright. Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid etc. Toy Story owes a great deal to The Velveteen Rabbit and pop culture. There seems to be an issue between inspiration and plagiarism. Firstly, nothing is original anyway, but a composite of many other texts. Dylan won a Nobel prize for ‘Contributions to Great American Songbook’, but he is no less original (or deserving) than Tupac or Sun House. All borrow to make new. Remember TS Eliot: “Major poets steal. Minor poets borrow.” Lana Del Ray is definitely in the minor key. quickspace Comments have been edited for length.

While the basics of food, shelter and emotional care are obvious, the definition can never be absolute. It means different things in different contexts. David N Jones, trustee, Children and Families Across Borders Equally, poverty does not necessarily equate to neglect. Many children can be raised in secure and loving families, have their basic needs met and be below the breadline, [but] there are some wealthy – often extremely wealthy – parents who neglect their children in significant ways. Abuse and neglect occur across all socio-economic strata. Yvalia Febrer, senior lecturer in social work, Kingston University Statutory services need to be involved where the child-parent relationship has broken down to such an extent that the child is exposed to significant emotional and physical harm. In East Sussex, we have developed the neglect matrix. It gives real, lived experience presentations which help professionals and others understand when intervention is required. Nicola McGeown, principal social worker, East Sussex county council Practice is key for social work students Learn the theory, but then get out there and work with families to see what neglect looks like in different contexts. With abuse and sexual exploitation, it is vital that those in training learn what they are looking for, but there are always emerging abuses and exploitations. Social media and the internet, for example, have added new dimensions that need to be understood. Yvalia Febrer Learn to identify abusive situations and behaviours All too often we offer training around signs and indicators in the individual child, and don’t teach social workers how to identify abusive behaviour and situations. Teaching social workers to identify grooming behaviour within the child’s network, or the needs within families that may be manipulated by those wanting to abuse or exploit children, and then working with them to identify and address those risks can provide more meaningful support. Anna Glinski, practice improvement adviser, Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse Avoid ‘blame and shame’ At St Christopher’s, we’ve been working to nurture a learning culture and have found that this is hard to sustain in the day-to-day reality of inter-agency working. “Blame and shame” permeate child protection work systemically, so it often feels like professionals and systems are working more to manage the risk of being blamed for harm to a child or family, than to tackle the risk of harm itself. Blame and shame are toxic for learning and trusting relationships, which we know are crucial for good practice and outcomes. Nicola Boyce, social pedagogy trainer, St Christopher’s Collaboration can have more impact than training Training is important, but the way agencies work together is most important. Austerity is having a massive impact, but there is still scope to improve and work more preventatively. If we listen to local people, they can tell us how we can do things better in their community. John Brownlow, project lead, Together for Childhood, NSPCC Place-based approaches connect resources No response is in the hands of a single practitioner. The system is much more effective where we connect, recognising that prevention and responding to abuse is everybody’s business. Working and recognising issues systematically is much more helpful than traditional service-centric or organisationally focused ways. Steve Kay, director of children’s services, North East Lincolnshire council Develop positive professional relationships Some of the most effective casework I’ve been involved in takes place where there are good relationships between individual practitioners across different services. Having procedures and policies is one thing, but to make these meaningful in practice there needs to be opportunities for practitioners to know the challenges, legal frameworks, capacities and limitations of each other’s roles. Anna Glinski Excellent practice can help weather the challenges of austerity Cuts have had a real impact on the additional services – such as weekend clubs, holiday provision, youth centres – that cushioned the blow into statutory involvement. The difficulty is that the landscape is changing all the time which is why excellent practice by social workers, and also those in the voluntary sector, is so important. Sometimes you’re practising under a government that funds many things – sometimes you’re not – so you need to be excellent at what you do and know how to adapt and be creative in all climates. Yvalia Febrer Reinforce relationships with families One constant challenge is how national guidance can easily become distorted in practice. All legislation aims to work with parents – but be ready to step in when it proves impossible and ensure the child is protected. If agency managers do not constantly reinforce that “relationship-based” approach and, in effect, become more concerned about risk assessment and management, then a more punitive approach emerges and becomes what everybody does. David N Jones Create a safe space for people to report abuse and neglect Introducing legal sanctions for failure to report [child abuse and neglect] is likely to lead to anxiety and defensive practice for many professionals, continuing the blame/shame cycle. It would be more constructive to shift the status quo by changing the culture: make it easier for people to report confidentially, and create avenues to discuss whether a concern needs to be reported. This comes down to trusting relationships. Confidential helplines have a role to play, but young people, families, members of the public and professionals are all more likely to discuss a concern with someone they know and trust. In every setting where children and families are present, having someone with a clear lead responsibility for safeguarding to build trust is critical.

But any old shade of sunshine will not do. This is Gen Z yellow – as worn by card-carrying members of said generation including Gigi Hadid and Hailey Baldwin. For your yellow to be the correct shade, it needs to have a bit of a fizz. Think more mango sorbet than DHL van, more ripe banana than a daffodil, more couscous than buttercup. And, whatever you do, don’t mix it with pink. Frills? Go hard or go home In the new series of Love, the episode where Mickey and Gus go to a wedding is a perfect example of awkward TV, 2018 style. It involves meeting an ex, squabbles about carpooling and uncalled-for toasts. It’s all saved, however, by one look at Mickey’s dress, a midi-length black number with frills from the hip down. This is the kind of frill game that you need this summer when picking the dress to take you through wedding season – it is fun and keeps things light. Self-Portrait has cornered the market in this look with dresses around the £300 mark, and now has a new store in London. Similar ideas can also be found on the high street at &amp; Other Stories and Warehouse. Buy one, wear for all the dates in your diary and let your dress do your talking. Your footwear should pay tribute to Phoebe Philo at Céline Fashion people shed tears – or at least wrote totes emosh social media posts – when it was announced that Philo would be leaving Céline after nearly 10 years. You are welcome to join in with the outpouring of grief, or at least use it as an excuse to buy some woven shoes this spring. The designer had the detail on slingbacks in her final collection, and you can find similar looks at Topshop and Next. Not only will a pair allow you to mourn Philo’s departure, but they happily hail the start of summer. After all, shoes with holes in them aren’t exactly fit for snow days, are they? Give in to the trench hype OK, hands up – we have been here before. Anyone with half an eye on fashion will know that the trench is a thing this season. It has been favourited by street-style stars and revived on catwalks including Céline, Loewe and – of course – Burberry. But don’t let that put you off, even if you’re the contrary type. Buy yours for a sensible price at Marks &amp; Spencer and resist the urge to belt it. This is the kind of item that is future-proof. You will wear it now and still be pulling it on when we are all getting into driverless cars and asking robots to make us a cuppa. Wear suits at the weekend Corporate dress codes are supposedly on their way out, with even the most buttoned-up employers, such as JP Morgan, instigating a business casual approach. But fashion likes nothing better than embracing the thing that the wider world has discarded as irrelevant. This might explain the rise of the trouser suit on the catwalk, and on purposeful influencers on Instagram. A trouser suit now is not what it was in the 80s – the attire of a woman out to nail that boardroom deal. Instead, this is slouchy, oversized and worn with trainers. A bit 90s, a bit Bowie in the video for Life on Mars, not at all watercooler gossip. Basically, think Not Suitable for Work and you will be on the right track. The hoodie is the new blazer It was announced this week that Virgil Abloh, the designer behind Off White and former Kanye West collaborator, would be the new creative director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, becoming the first designer of colour to hold such a high-profile position. We will have to wait until June to see his first show, but the news has already had an impact on your wardrobe. Abloh is a big fan of the hoodie – wearing a black one almost as a uniform and selling them by the bucketload for Off White. His entry into the establishment means the item is officially allowed anywhere, surely. Garden party? Wedding? It’s all fair game for the hoodie now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/27/elephant-smoking-footage-baffles-experts-india","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T09:41:49Z","webTitle":"Elephant 'smoking' footage baffles experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/27/elephant-smoking-footage-baffles-experts-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/27/elephant-smoking-footage-baffles-experts-india","fields":{"headline":"Elephant 'smoking' footage baffles experts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Footage of an Asian elephant “smoking” in a forest in southern India has baffled wildlife experts, who say the behaviour has never before been observed. Vinay Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) India programme, captured the puffing pachyderm while visiting camera traps in the Nagarahole national park in Karnataka state. The 48-second video shows the elephant picking up something with its trunk and putting it in its mouth, then blowing out a gust of smoke. Biologists from the WCS said the footage, shot in April 2016 but only recently posted online, was “the first known video documentation of a wild elephant exhibiting such behaviour, and has scientists and experts puzzled”. He said charcoal had toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a laxative and is plentiful in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes or controlled burns. Though elephants have not previously been observed blowing ash, animal self-medication – zoopharmacognosy – is relatively common, according to the Smithsonian website. It cites studies that observed red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar eating charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food. Another survey found bonobos swallow leaves with rough surfaces to scour parasites from their systems. Red and green macaws have been known to eat clay to kill bacteria in their systems, and pregnant elephants in Kenya are believed to eat leaves that may speed up the delivery process. India is home to more than 27,000 Asian elephants that make up about 60% of the global population, according to a 2017 census. The number was 10% down on the 2012 census, but the government has attributed the drop to more accurate counting methods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/spanish-spies-tracked-carles-puigdemont-via-friends-phone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T11:30:46Z","webTitle":"Spanish spies 'tracked Carles Puigdemont via friend's phone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/spanish-spies-tracked-carles-puigdemont-via-friends-phone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/spanish-spies-tracked-carles-puigdemont-via-friends-phone","fields":{"headline":"Spanish spies 'tracked Carles Puigdemont via friend's phone'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spanish intelligence agents had been tracking the movements of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont using the geolocation service on his friend’s mobile phone before he was detained in Germany at the weekend, according to reports. Puigdemont was detained under a European arrest warrant in the northern German province of Schleswig-Holstein on Sunday morning as he journeyed by car from Helsinki to Brussels, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia’s unilateral declaration of independence last October. Sources in Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) told Spanish media outlets that the surveillance team had used the geolocation service on the mobile phone of at least one of Puigdemont’s companions to monitor his movements, as well as fitting a tracking device to the Renault Espace the group had been travelling in. Twelve CNI agents were involved in the operation. Puigdemont was remanded in custody in Germany on Monday. The German authorities have 60 days in which to reach a decision on the extradition request, which Puigdemont opposed during a hearing. Spain wants to extradite him on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds in relation to that declaration. The Madrid government, irked that Puigdemont was using his freedom of movement to address meetings about Catalan independence in Denmark, Switzerland and Finland, had hinted at plans to revoke Puigdemont’s passport when on Friday the Spanish supreme court judge Pablo Llarena revived the international warrant for his arrest that had been rescinded in December. The tracking device on the Espace, which had Belgian number plates, was fitted in Waterloo, the small Belgian town where the former president had installed himself in self-imposed exile, Spanish media reported. Puigdemont had been visiting Finland since Thursday for talks with lawmakers, but when the car left Waterloo on Friday morning and began travelling north, they suspected that Puigdemont was planning to return to Belgium by car. It appears that he took the ferry from Helsinki to Stockholm from where he began the car journey to the border between Denmark and Germany. Ernst Walter, president of the German police union, said on Bayern 2 radio that he was surprised that Puigdemont was not detained in Denmark under the international arrest warrant, suggesting that the Madrid authorities had preferred to wait until he was on German soil. Security sources told Spanish media there were four other people in the car with Puigdemont when it was stopped at a petrol station in Schleswig-Holstein. One was the businessman Josep María Matamala Alsina, a close confidant of the former president who is said to be one of the people bankrolling Puigdemont’s life abroad. The second was Josep Lluis Alay Rodríguez, a specialist in contemporary Tibetan and Mongolian history at the University of Barcelona who is also commissioner for international relations in the city’s provincial government, which claims he was he was there on official business. Police sources told Spanish media that the other two, an off-duty member of the Catalan Mossos d’Esquadra police force, Xabier Goicoechea Fernández, and Carlos de Pedro López, were the drivers who had made the trip from Waterloo to Stockholm, a 995-mile (1,600km) journey that they covered in just over 24 hours. Spain’s national court on Tuesday opened an investigation into whether the four people accompanying Puigdemont on his journey might be guilty of concealment. The Mossos d’Esquadra are also investigating the role of the two off-duty officers involved. Lluís Escolà, another off-duty Mossos officer who has been with Puigdemont since he fled to Belgium, claims he discovered the tracking device on the car two months ago and reported it to Belgian police. Escolà also claimed Puigdemont was aware that he was being tracked but thought he could still make it back to Brussels before he was detained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/30/the-voidz-virtue-review-julian-casablancas-growls-but-doesnt-bite","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T09:30:17Z","webTitle":"The Voidz: Virtue review – Julian Casablancas growls but doesn't bite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/30/the-voidz-virtue-review-julian-casablancas-growls-but-doesnt-bite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/30/the-voidz-virtue-review-julian-casablancas-growls-but-doesnt-bite","fields":{"headline":"The Voidz: Virtue review – Julian Casablancas growls but doesn't bite","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Julian Casablancas warmed up for the release of the second album by the Voidz – they’ve dropped their frontman’s name as part of the band identity since their 2013 debut, Tyranny – with a wildly entertaining and enormously confused interview, during the course of which he asserted that the world had not appreciated Jimi Hendrix or David Bowie during their lifetimes, and that the internet had killed truth but people are also much more informed than they were in 2004. Virtue is just as confused, but rarely so entertaining. It is, apparently, a political album, but you’d only know that from searching the lyrics out online. Casablancas’s exquisite drawl – one of the most appealing sounds in rock – is at times here somewhere at the level of Leslie Phillips after an especially heavy night on the martinis, rendering whatever he’s actually singing into a warm and smoky “nyurrgh, rrrruuuurrrr, hrrrrrrr”. You tell ’em, Julian! Musically, Casablancas has said Virtue is “futuristic prison jazz”, whatever that’s supposed to mean. It’s certainly neither futuristic nor jazz; if anything it’s a less finessed version of the way 80s mainstream pop has been twisted and reshaped by groups like the 1975. There are great moments: the opening Leave It in My Dreams is the kind of streamlined, insidiously melodic new wave that was once Casablancas’s default position; QYURRYUS – complete with scratching, screeching guitars, Auto-Tuned voices and a Middle Eastern modal melody – ought to be a mess, but is genuinely fantastic. When you can hear the words, things get more troublesome: Think Before You Drink is an acoustic protest ballad of such horrific obviousness – in which 39-year-old Casablancas complains about the poison he was fed by teachers – that you want to check it’s not actually Reeves and Mortimer offering the world The Freewheelin’ Mulligan and O’Hare. There’s enough about Virtue to keep it interesting. There’s not enough to make it genuinely good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/27/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-make-bumper-bid-for-timo-werner","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T08:26:02Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to make bumper bid for Timo Werner?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/27/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-make-bumper-bid-for-timo-werner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/27/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-make-bumper-bid-for-timo-werner","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to make bumper bid for Timo Werner?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Mill, it must be admitted, has occasional self-esteem issues as it sifts through its daily fluff. So it feels some empathy with Luke Shaw, whose own self-esteem must have taken a confusing buffeting at the hands of José Mourinho. However, it might perk him up to know that Barcelona are thought to be sniffing around him. The Mirror reports that the Spanish league leaders have him firmly in their sights to duke it out for the left-back role with Jordi Alba, who has two years left on his contract, and Lucas Digne, who has made only 13 starts this season. Another player set to be out the door at Old Trafford this summer is doughty old Marouane Fellaini, with Monaco the latest club to show interest in the 30-year-old Belgian. Passing him as he leaves might be Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney, who it is thought might prove better value than United’s other target in that role, Danny Rose. Eden Hazard hasn’t been the happiest of bunnies this season, and it’s made Pep Guardiola wonder whether it might be worth throwing some Abu Dhabi cash his way to lure him to Manchester City in the summer. Spain’s Don Balón reports that the Belgian playmaker is up front and centre (though not up front and alone, as he has been on the pitch occasionally lately) on Pep’s radar after City failed to lure Alexis Sánchez to the Etihad in January. Hazard’s people have already been talking to City’s people. Jürgen Klopp, meanwhile, is keen to drink at the Red Bull fountain once again. Having already secured a summer move to Anfield for Leipzig’s Naby Keïta, the Liverpool manager is thought to be planning an £87.5m raid for forward Timo Werner, scorer of 11 Bundesliga goals this season. Liverpool’s Emre Can, meanwhile, is on Juventus’s target-list, along with Lorenzo Pellegrini, Atalanta’s Bryan Cristante and Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey, though their hopes of securing the latter are fading. In hotseat news, West Ham are thought to be lining up an approach to Marco Silva to see if he fancies taking over from David Moyes and savouring the unique London Stadium atmosphere. Marca reports Moyes won’t last the summer and Silva, unemployed since being ditched by Watford last autumn, could be the man to take over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/premier-league-team-of-the-season-ederson-firmino-manchester-city-burnley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T10:18:00Z","webTitle":"From Ederson to Firmino: Premier League team of the season so far | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/premier-league-team-of-the-season-ederson-firmino-manchester-city-burnley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/premier-league-team-of-the-season-ederson-firmino-manchester-city-burnley","fields":{"headline":"From Ederson to Firmino: Premier League team of the season so far","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hard to believe but the Premier League season is almost over. Where has the time gone? Feels like only yesterday José Mourinho was happy. Anyway, with the home stretch in sight, I’ve picked a Premier League XI of the season so far. My choices are sure to cause shock, horror and outrage but before the frothing commences let me make something clear: the team below are not made up of the 11 best players in their respective positions. Some are but others are players who have performed notably above expectation – individually or within a partnership/unit – and therefore are worthy of recognition. This also means there is a whacking great omission, one bordering on a national scandal, but I don’t care – I stand by my choices. Goalkeeper: Ederson (Manchester City) David de Gea has kept the most clean sheets. David de Gea has made the most eye-catching saves. David de Gea is the best goalkeeper in the Premier League, if not the world. But David de Gea doesn’t make this team because, across town, a 24-year-old Brazilian has made an incredible impact. Not much was known about Ederson when he arrived at Manchester City in June but he has gone on to impress with his shot stopping, decision making and unreal distribution. And anyone who says it is easy being City’s goalkeeper, I have two words for you: Claudio Bravo. Right back: Kyle Walker (Manchester City) There’s no escaping it: £53m is a jaw-dropping amount to pay for a full-back. Equally, there’s no doubt Walker has proven to be a worthwhile acquisition for City, providing the width and penetration Pep Guardiola demands from his wide defenders, as well as being better defensively than his critics suggest. He is England’s best right-back and probably the Premier League’s too. Centre back: James Tarkowski (Burnley) Patience is a virtue and, in some cases, the way you break into the England squad a few months before the World Cup. This time last year no one would have predicted Tarkowski would be in Gareth Southgate’s plans but that is where the 25-year-old finds himself having bided his time at Burnley and, following Michael Keane’s move to Everton, taken his chance, impressing with his distribution and defensive capabilities. Yes, Tarkowski performed nervously in midweek, and gave away the penalty that led to Italy’s equaliser, but it was his debut and at club level he has been consistently excellent. His inclusion in this team should also be viewed within the context of the person he is deployed alongside … Centre back: Ben Mee (Burnley) Only three players have made more clearances this season than Mee and, at Burnley, only one player has completed more minutes. The 28-year-old has been a model of consistent excellence and, alongside Tarkowski, the bedrock of a side who have conceded a measly 26 goals in 30 games. As a centre-back partnership, Tarkowski and Mee are hard to beat and the latter’s presence also provides the giggling joy of hearing commentators say things like: “Great header by Mee.” Left back: Andrew Robertson (Liverpool) Any Liverpool supporter who says they weren’t underwhelmed by the club’s £8m purchase of Robertson from Hull in July is a liar. Fast forward eight months and most of them are singing his praises as well as his name. Robertson has been a revelation since stepping in for the injured Alberto Moreno in December, catching the eye with his crossing ability as well as with his work rate and defensive skills. The 24-year-old has been one of the bargains of the season and ended Liverpool’s decades-long problems at left-back. Defensive midfield: Abdoulaye Doucouré (Watford) If you haven’t seen Doucouré play in the flesh, you should. He’s excellent. A marauding, hard-working and clever presence who is the main reason Watford have avoided sliding into relegation trouble. Oh, and he is also their top scorer with seven goals. The Frenchman is the full package and, aged 25, young enough to get even better. Watford supporters won’t want to hear it but Doucouré is unlikely to remain at Vicarage Road for much longer; sooner rather than later the big boys will come calling. Centre midfield: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) No player has provided more assists this season and when City wrap up the title it will be De Bruyne who, Guardiola aside, receives the most individual recognition for the success. Quite rightly too: the Belgian has been supreme, featuring in every one of City’s 30 fixtures so far and, in practically every one, bamboozling the opposition with skill, strength and imagination. The 26-year-old is a Ballon d’Or winner in the making. Centre midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) Alongside De Bruyne, Silva has formed an irresistible inside-forward partnership. One minute they’re there, the next they’re not; one minute they’re passing the ball side to side, the next they’re threading it into the heart of danger. Nobody had been able to tame the City duo and while De Bruyne has grabbed more headlines it is arguably Silva who has drawn more appreciation. Aged 32 and in his eight season at City, the Spaniard remains a gorgeous blend of composure and devastation. We’ll miss him when he’s gone. Right-sided forward: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) Never has spending £36.9m on a footballer looked such good business. Frankly it’s peanuts when you consider what Salah has achieved at Anfield since arriving from Roma in June – 28 goals and 10 assists in 30 games, with some of his best moments breathtaking. The goals against Everton and Manchester City at home, the volley at Stoke and, most recently, the four-goal demolition of Watford that Miguel Britos may never recover from. Salah is not just the signing of the season; he is the player of the season, too. Left-sided forward: Son Heung-min (Tottenham) This selection came down to a straight fight between Leroy Sané and Son – and Son won because, quite simply, I love him. That smile, that chuckle, that positive style of play – it’s all there and, having scored 12 goals and provided four assists in 29 appearances, the South Korean is arguably the most improved player in the Premier League. It say much that Son’s place in Tottenham’s starting lineup is pretty much nailed-on and in this tightest of battles for a top-four place, he could well end up making the difference. Centre forward: Roberto Firmino (Liverpool) Cue the fury, especially around Wembley Way. No Tottenham fans, I haven’t forgotten about Harry Kane, and with 24 goals in 29 appearances he is an obvious candidate for the centre-forward role. But here’s the thing; the best frontline in the Premier League this season has been Liverpool’s – in term of goals, combination and spectacle – and fundamental to that has been Firmino. The Brazilian is redefining the No9 position with his combination of movement, work rate, link play, assists and goals, and he would be an undoubted asset to this side. He’d also get the best out of Salah, and Son would enjoy playing alongside him, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/27/cutting-eu-migration-very-likely-to-hit-growth-official-advisers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T09:39:51Z","webTitle":"Cutting EU migration very likely to hit growth – official advisers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/27/cutting-eu-migration-very-likely-to-hit-growth-official-advisers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/27/cutting-eu-migration-very-likely-to-hit-growth-official-advisers","fields":{"headline":"Cutting EU migration very likely to hit growth – official advisers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Restricting immigration from Europe after Brexit is very likely to lead to lower growth in total jobs and in the output of the UK economy, the government’s official migration advisers have said. The labour market experts even cite official projections that zero net EU migration post-Brexit could not merely halt population growth in parts of northern England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but actually lead to falls in the next 20 years. However, the migration advisory committee (MAC), whose members are appointed by the home secretary, says cutting EU migration will “not necessarily mean lower growth in output per head, which is most closely connected to living standards”. The economists challenge employers over the role of wages in their decision to hire migrant workers, saying they are too reluctant to discuss the issue and some deny that low wages were part of their “image problem” among UK-born workers. The MAC’s interim report on the impact of EU migration on the British labour market was commissioned by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, who has made clear that its final report this autumn will be used to design the government’s post-Brexit immigration policy. The report provides strong evidence that many employers, particularly in lower-skilled sectors, greatly fear new post-Brexit restrictions to recruit EU migrants, saying it will “make a hard job harder”. The MAC says businesses employ EU migrants not because they are prepared to accept lower pay and conditions but because they are prepared to do work that British workers won’t. The vast majority do not deliberately seek to fill vacancies with migrant workers. “Why does business employ EEA migrants? The simple answer is because they are the best available candidates. Understandably, employers are unenthusiastic about the prospect of restrictions on the pool of possible workers,” concludes the report, which cites 40% lower absenteeism rates for EU migrants compared with UK-born workers in some lower-skilled sectors. However, the committee says employers are too reluctant to discuss the role of wages when explaining why they employ EU migrants. The MAC report points to a big pay differential between western European migrants who are paid on average 12% more than UK-born workers and eastern European workers who are paid, on average, 27% less. But the labour market experts say the differences can be largely explained by differences in age, region and industry. They do, however, add that they do not think it credible for some employers to argue that they couldnot increase the number of UK-born workers they employ by offering higher wages. “Individual employers would almost always be able to recruit resident workers if they paid wages sufficiently above the going rate,” they say before adding that it is more credible for employers to argue that higher wages were unaffordable because of small margins and other cost pressures. The labour economists are quite firm that the financial crisis and not EU migration has been the principle reason for the fall in real wages for UK-born workers since 2004. They note that the fall in real wages has not been confined to the low-skilled where the rise in EU migration has been the most marked. The MAC says migrants from new member states since 2004, such as Poland and Romania, seem to be lower paid than UK-born workers, but that does not imply EEA migration has suppressed the wages of UK-born workers. “Some employers, mostly in lower-skilled sectors, felt they had an image problem among the UK-born with jobs in their sector being viewed as an unattractive career. Employers denied that low wages were part of the image problem but when, for example, 95% of jobs in hospitality pay below average hourly earnings, we were not always convinced by this argument.” The MAC’s conclusion that lower EU migration will “very likely lead to lower growth in total employment and lower output growth” contradicts statements made by Andrew Green, the chair of Migration Watch, on Monday that there was “simply no evidence” to support employers’ claims that a reduction in immigration, particularly among low-paid workers, would harm the economy. The MAC’s chair, Prof Alan Manning, saidnothing in the interim report should be used to pre-judge the committee’s conclusions on the impact of EU migration on wages, unemployment, prices or the provision of public services. “Some think a greater sense of urgency is needed, that action is needed now,” said Manning. “We do understand the importance of migration policy, but coming to the right, rather than a rushed conclusion is what matters. Our work is for a system coming into force in 2021.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/austrian-full-face-veil-ban-condemned-failure-police-integration-smog-marks-animal-costumes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T11:49:48Z","webTitle":"Austrian full-face veil ban condemned as a failure by police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/austrian-full-face-veil-ban-condemned-failure-police-integration-smog-marks-animal-costumes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/austrian-full-face-veil-ban-condemned-failure-police-integration-smog-marks-animal-costumes","fields":{"headline":"Austrian full-face veil ban condemned as a failure by police","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An Austrian ban on full-face coverings introduced as part of an “integration” policy aimed at limiting the visibility of orthodox Islam in public life has been criticised by police after it emerged that the law has mainly resulted in the issuing of warnings against people wearing smog masks, skiing gear and animal costumes. Figures published by the weekly news magazine Profil on Monday show that 29 charges citing the “anti-face-veiling act” have been filed with police since the law came into force last October. Research shows that only four of these charges concerned a face being covered by a veil – all of which were levelled at the same woman. In other instances, police issued warnings against people covering their faces with scarves, skiing masks or animal costumes. In the Tyrol, six charges were filed because of people wearing “winter clothing”, while a number of Asian tourists were requested to remove their smog masks at Vienna’s Schwechat airport. In late October, police in Vienna interrupted a camera crew filming outside the Austrian parliament and forced a man dressed as the rabbit Lesko, the official mascot of the parliament’s youth outreach scheme, to remove his bright-blue mask with furry ears. The same month, a man dressed as a shark to promote the opening of a branch of the Apple retailer McShark was also forced to remove his headgear. “If this law was intended as a contribution in the fight against conservative Islam, then I can only say: it’s gone belly up,” Hermann Greylinger of the Austrian police union told Profil, adding that many police officers were declining to actively enforce the law. In January, the Austrian interior minister, Herbert Kickl, the creator of numerous anti-Islam campaign slogans for his rightwing populist Freedom party, confirmed that only two arrests had been carried out under the legislation. He declined to release further statistics on the impact of the law. The two coalition parties of Austria’s previous, social-democrat-led government had in 2017 voted in a ban on full-face veils such as the niqab in courts and schools, as part of a raft of “integration” measures. At the time, Muslim associations criticised the ban, suggesting that no more than about 150 women in Austria wore full veils. A similar ban has been place in France and Belgium since 2011, the Netherlands introduced a partial ban in 2015, and the German parliament voted last September to ban face coverings while driving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T10:55:48Z","webTitle":"Seo Minwoo, member of K-pop boyband 100%, dies aged 33","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33","fields":{"headline":"Seo Minwoo, member of K-pop boyband 100%, dies aged 33","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Seo Minwoo of K-pop boyband 100% has died aged 33. The Korean singer, who performed as Minwoo, was found without a pulse at his home in Seoul on the evening of 25 March, and was pronounced dead by first responders. The cause of death is reportedly cardiac arrest. The band’s label, Top Media, paid tribute to the artist on its website: “His family, the 100% members, and the Top Media artists and staff members are all grief-stricken and in mourning from the unexpected, sad news.” Minwoo’s family have requested a private funeral. His former bandmate Woo Changbum paid tribute to Minwoo in an Instagram post, captioning a photo of them together (translated from Korean): “May the souls of the deceased refrain. I hope you are comfortable in the sky. I want you to be a bright star and shine this world.” One fan paid tribute to Minwoo’s support for LGBTQ rights. The boyband 100% debuted in 2012 as a seven-piece in the K-pop genre, a highly visual form of Korean pop that incorporates elements of western music. The group were the second boyband created by Andy Lee of the K-pop group Shinhwa. They also have a smaller group comprising members of the main band – called 100% V – of which Minwoo was not a member. Minwoo was the band’s lead vocalist, but took a sabbatical from the band to complete mandatory military service in 2014. Minwoo had also worked as an actor, appearing in dramas such as Sharp 3 and The King and I, and making cameos in the TV series New Tales of Gisaeng and movies including Where Are You Going? 100% had made their Japanese debut in January 2017, breaking through with this year’s Top 10 single Song for You, released last month. They are due to perform in Tokyo and Osaka at the end of April. Top Media has not confirmed if the shows will go ahead. Minwoo is the second high-profile K-pop death in recent months; SHINee lead singer Kim Jong-hyun died in December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/27/cricket-australia-set-to-wield-axe-over-ball-tampering-scandal-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T18:09:21Z","webTitle":"Cricket ball-tampering row: Australian trio sent home – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/27/cricket-australia-set-to-wield-axe-over-ball-tampering-scandal-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/27/cricket-australia-set-to-wield-axe-over-ball-tampering-scandal-live","fields":{"headline":"Cricket ball-tampering row: Australian trio sent home – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m signing off now, but keep your eyes on Guardian Cricket for the latest from Ali Martin and Adam Collins in Johannesburg, comment from Geoff Lemon and much more from our writers in Australia. Thanks for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Some former players aren’t entirely convinced … One of the few straight answers we did get from Sutherland in the Q&amp;A was when he was asked if Lehmann had offered to resign … “Darren Lehmann has not offered to resign as far as I’m aware, certainly not to me.” Plenty of emails from you lot dismayed at Bancroft leaving whilst Lehman stays. Here is just one, from Rajindar Parhar. “Surely as Chief Coach, Darren Lehman must go as well. He was seen talking on his walkie talkie obviously giving instructions to be passed on to Bancroft that Bancroft had been caught on camera? Even if Lehman didn’t have any prior knowledge of what was going on (which I personally doubt), he is guilty of instigating the attempted cover up in Bancroft trying to hide the yellow tape down his trousers.” There are also plenty of emails and tweets attacking Sutherland for not being direct enough. I certainly agree with the below. Remember, there may well be considerable bans for Smith, Warner and Bancroft and Sutherland is quite right that the investigation must be completed before those can be handed out. Still, he needs to be much more straight-forward when he is off-script. Read our latest news story here: Sutherland say that initial findings in the investigation (in which two ICC officials are present) are that just three players, and three players alone, were involved: Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft. No other persons had prior knowledge of the intention to tamper with the ball, including Darren Lehmann, who will remain as head coach of the Australian team. Tim Paine has been officially appointed the new captain of Australia. Smith, Warner and Bancroft will leave South Africa on Wednesday, with replacements set to be drafted in for the remainder of the series. Cricket Australia “considering significant sanctions” pending the finalisation of the investigation. Sutherland says he expects more on this “in the next 24 hours.” Sutherland has now finished his press conference, after a few more comments about Australian cricket not doing “the kids” justice, and the incident “not being in the spirit of the game.” Yep, interesting that the “leadership group” is apparently just Smith and Warner. Sutherland is very keen to stress that more sanctions may well follow for the players involved, pending the finalisation of the investigation. Sutherland is now taking questions, but dodging them. When asked directly if they cheated, he is damning of the incident but doesn’t answer the question directly, even when asked on a number of occasions. “It’s a dark day,” he says. “Winning is important, but not at the expense of the game. This is a serious issue. We will complete the process and will be in a position to finalise more sanctions once the investigation is complete.” Sutherland adds that should be in the next 24 hours. Sutherland looks close to tears. Replacements will be called up immediately. Tim Paine will be appointed captain of the team for the remainder of the series in South Africa. “The key finding is that prior knowledge was limited to three players, Steve Smith, David Warner, Cameron Bancroft. No other support players has prior knowledge. This also includes Darren Lehmann, who will continue to coach the team.” James Sutherland has just sat down in the press conference. Here we go! Here is the latest from Vic Marks on what England head coach Trevor Bayliss’s latest comments. Umesh Sinari has a prediction: Steve Smith – 6 Months ban Warner – 1 year ban Bancroft - 6 months ban Richard Horrocks has some more thoughts: “CA to be tactical. Smith et al banned for five years - send out the strong message, BUT, let Smith et al appeal, and in 6-9 months when all is becalmed, reduce bans to 18 months, and everyone wins.” I suspect the punishments might be more lenient. Ultimately one of the biggest reasons for these punishments is to act as a deterrent for others in the future. There has already been enough embarrassment here to last a very long time. I’d like to see lenient bans. I’m very interested to see what happens to Darren Lehmann. He is reportedly ready to hand in his resignation, but I don’t think anything is clearcut. Bob Willis is on Sky Sports News, and says he hopes that the punishments aren’t too harsh, and that Smith or Warner aren’t lost completely from Test cricket. “The walkie-talkie thing makes the notion that this was an ‘on the hoof’ decision ludicrous,” emails David J. Govantes-Edwards. “There was some infrastructure behind it. Personally, I also find this being the first time quite hard to swallow. As Broad said yesterday, why did they do the tape thing this time, instead of doing whatever they were doing during the Ashes, when they were getting reverse-swing in conditions that would not make that sort of movement likely...?” Hello, Michael Butler here, taking over from Will. Send me your thoughts/predictions. You can email me via michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet me @michaelbutler18. As mentioned the press conference has been delayed, but we should be underway in a few minutes. Sounds like a brief delay … Robert in Glasgow has his view on the leadership group, he says: “Surely all that funny business with the walkie talkie suggests that the leadership group is pretty extensive. Seems unlikely that it was masterminded by just one or two people. I mean Warner’s not Goldfinger is he (maybe Tapefinger though!)“ How deep does the cheating go? That’s the question we all want to find out. As we get closer to the press conference, Gregory asks whether the bowlers really could not know what was going on during the recent Test (and potentially beyond). He ponders: “I find it hard to believe that the Australian bowlers were not involved. How could a team member do anything to the ball without the bowlers being aware?” Daniel Faine explains that I am behind the times as this is the leadership group details: “The strong mail is that the “leadership group” as Smith referred to it meant, actually, just he and Warner. (IE The three bowlers who actually make up the balance of the leadership group - Starc, Hazlewood and Lyon - are enraged at having been implicated because they knew nothing.) “You will almost certainly find that Warner cooked this up and Bancroft agreed because openers are thick like that (pun intended). Smith has looked tired all series, and I think he had another brain fade by saying “yeah, whatever” on the way out the door. “What no one is focussing on is the fact that it was de Kock who, at the fall of lunch, was the man batting Australia out of the Test and out of the series. Warner’s motivation to do anything to dismiss his chief antagonist is easy to adduce. No excuse, but surely a relevant consideration. And it has to be said that Bancroft, for all the talk that he is the “kid put in a terrible situation”, has form. Maybe he learnt the ropes in the county game, which has been leading the way when it comes to relatively benign (but effective) ball whispering for quite some time.” I would argue there could be more than two in the leadership group, maybe even those who are not playing... We have found out that they have cheated and how they did it but I really want to know how many people are in this “leadership group”. A group would imply it is more than two and surely Cameron Bancroft was not in it as he has barely played Test cricket, so I think quite a few could be named and shamed in around an hour. Darren Lehmann could be set to lose his job but he did deny cheating against England, which is nice of him. He did seem to do it, however, after pretending to be on the phone in order to avoid journalists. It is a good trick if you can pull it off, sadly Darren cannot. The Spin is in...Andy Bull has decided against previewing the County Championship season and is instead, unsurprisingly, discussing the matter we are all here to talk about. Some reader speculation from Tom, who is in Oldham, so probably gets to enjoy some cricket in Saddleworth, Greenfield or Uppermill during the summer months, says: “As an Englishman who’s spent two winters down under – 06/07 and 13/14 - I am very much enjoying all of this unravel. “I think Warner and Lehman will be shown the door – all the snippets that are coming out is that this senior leadership group was basically Warner on his own. Whether or not Lehmann knew anything doesn’t matter: he either knew and condoned it or he didn’t know and he’s not doing his job properly by letting this happen on his watch. “I think no matter how much CA are worried about sponsorship losses/PR, they won’t jettison their star asset completely. Probably strip him of the captaincy with 6 month ban (missing Zimbabwe and Bangladesh) and he’ll be playing at the World Cup and Ashes next year. “Think CA will be happy to get rid of Lehmann and Warner – they’ve served them well but are both very brash voices in a team which really isn’t that ‘Aussie’ compared to sides of the recent past!” Hello...Will here Thanks to Tom for doing the hard grind today. I am very briefly going to be the man for speculating about what will be announced in just under two hours. As is the norm with this sort of thing, stuff will leak out prior to the proclamation from James Sutherland in Johannesburg. What are you expecting from this announcement? Will heads roll or just the confirmation of a long investigation into what has gone on and how long it’s been going on? Right, so as the dayshift logs off, here’s where we are: Cricket Australia announcement is now expected at 6pm BST Players reportedly turned on David Warner on Monday night as the atmosphere “turned nuclear” and the deposed Australia vice-captain removing himself from the team’s What’sApp group Matt Renshaw has been called into the squad for the fourth Test as a replacement. The England coach Trevor Bayliss said, “As an Australian I’m embarrassed” by the ball-tampering revelations, while former Australia captain Steve Waugh said he was “deeply troubled” by events in Cape Town The ICC will not look into claims of ball-tampering during the Ashes And that’s what has and hasn’t happened. I’m going to hand you over now and perhaps, just as a trip to the bar when you’re at the cricket inevitably heralds a wicket when you’re not looking, we’ll get news on the fate of Smith, Warner, Lehmann et al imminently. Thanks for all your many thoughtful emails and tweets, and don’t go anywhere! Some more musings on the Laws, from Tim Sanders: “In response to Rob Taylor – Law 41 allows fielders to “dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires”. Players routinely use towels and have them tucked into their waistbands, so I don’t think an ordinary towel would require a change in the Laws. “My favourite, entirely legitimate method that England have used to help with reverse swing, is the hard-spun ‘arm ball’ from the finger spinner. The bowler holds the ball with the seam horizontal and the side to be roughened pointing downwards. They deliver the ball spinning in the horizontal plane, so as it lands the rough side abrades against the dry pitch. The side-spin also produces a handy little arm ball – just as a tennis player or a footballer uses side-spin to make the ball swerve – which can take wickets in its own right. From an off-spinner, this curves the ball away from the right-handed batter. Consider this from Mike Selvey, reporting on the 2016 Edgbaston Test: ‘Cook had turned to Moeen’s off spin, though, and he responded with some good controlled bowling that also served to help get the ball into a condition for reverse swing. Having posted himself at second slip Cook was able to take a sharp catch as Azhar drove outside off stump.’ It would seem a step too far for the Laws to clamp down on how a bowler bowls, especially when it’s effective in its own right…” Harkarn Sumal, meanwhile, is thinking a little closer to home: “We have to be circumspect about making the laws too stringent. They do apply to all levels of the game lest we forget. If we’re not careful, every old boy who can’t break out his “long barrier” anymore due to decades of cake and ale abuse and therefore instead takes the option of sticking out the sole of his size 10 cricket spike to stop the ball, is leaving himself open to a twelve month ban, removal of his right to his own keys for the bar, heckling from the tea committee, and of course withdrawal from the next IPL auction. In my experience, despite the ball regularly getting the treatment from cricket spikes and the brambles at cow corner, the only things that reverse at village level are the roller and the gang mowers as they trundle out of the groundsman’s shed. Well, that and anyone who walks into the changing rooms as the subs and fines are being collected. Can you tell I’m ready for my season to start? Rollers? Gang mowers? Luxury … In the meantime, why not subscribe to The Spin, our weekly cricketing email, if for some reason you haven’t done so already? This week’s missive will be due shortly.

Just to update, we’re still expecting a decision around late afternoon/early evening UK and South Africa time, very early morning Australia time. Meanwhile, PA has sifted through some more reaction from within the game. Andrew Flintoff is the latest former Ashes star to have his two pennorth, and he’s had a bit of a pop. “Australia attempted a lot of times to be ‘poor us, we’re fine, we don’t cross the mark’,” Flintoff said on his BBC podcast. “But you do lads, to be honest, you’ve done it for years and years and years, and now you’re getting found out. “I probably have not got as big a problem with it as a lot of people ... I’m torn a little bit. I think it’s very thick, it’s embarrassing for the people involved. The debate is to what extent are you cheating? You’ve heard all sorts of stories about ball tampering; all these things have gone on over time and now is the time to draw a line. What we’ve seen is cheating, there’s no two ways about it.” Nasser Hussain has said it was “inconceivable” that Darren Lehmann did not know of the plot. He told Sky Sports: “It doesn’t look good on Lehmann either way, really. If he did know then he’s in a whole heap of trouble and will not be able to hold his job down if he is condoning cheating and (the) scratching of a cricket ball. “If he didn’t know, then questions will be asked as to why senior players are going round not telling the coach exactly what is going on. In the dressing rooms I’ve played in, it is inconceivable that the coach wouldn’t know something like this was being dreamt up.” And Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has devoted more vital prime ministerial time to informing a rapt nation that Cricket Australia “now have to make sure that this great, national game, this great international game that is synonymous with fair play, is once again a game that is played by champions, that everybody can look up to. “Cricket Australia is dealing with it, they have to investigate it and they have to act, continue to act decisively and emphatically. We want to get to the point where we can all say once again, not rhetorically but heartfelt and with sincerity, that cricket is a fair game, cricket is a game that is synonymous with a fair go and fair play, that is what has to happen.” The BBC reports that the ICC will not look into claims Australia players tampered with the ball during the recent Ashes series. The time limit the ICC has for reporting any such offence has passed. The ICC’s code of conduct says complaints for offences such as ball-tampering must be lodged “within 18 hours of the close of the day’s play, or prior to the start of the following day’s play or the start of the next relevant international match, whichever is the sooner”. No real surprise there, given that no firm allegations came from any current England player, Joe Root saying he “personally wasn’t aware of anything going on throughout that series”. While we continue to wait for figurative white smoke to emerge from Cricket Australia’s mobile chimney (or should it be black smoke, given that we’re anticipating sackings rather than appointments?), some interesting thoughts emailed in from Ian Forth on cricket as religion, and its symbolism in Australian life: Cricket has turned from a sport to a ritual in Australia. The team song with the wattle, visiting the graveyards in France, and of course the Legend Of the Baggy Green. This coincided with a time that the team were all but invincible, so, practices became sanctified, and indelibly associated with outcomes. (Hint: note how monotheism emerged in the Old Testament). So when Michael Clarke tried to head off before singing the song he was nearly throttled. The Baggy Green became a sacred item - literally; Steve Waugh wore one that was battered beyond recognition. It was a holy relic. The G was referred to as ‘sacred turf’. That’s right cricket became, to all extents and purposes, a cult. Or a religion, if you prefer. Trouble is that if rituals are transgressed condemnation is wild and fierce. To Australians cheating at cricket became blasphemous. The only fitting punishment for such impiety becomes excommunication. It was easier when cricket was cricket. Not forced to do double duty in binding a fragile society, forever unsure of its place in the world, together. Smith, Warner and Bancroft are now going to be taken to a place outside the city walls and ritually stoned. I’ve often idly wondered whether calling one cricket stadium among many “The G” contributes to that mythology, but probably not worth getting into a barney with Melbourne folk about. It’s a grand old ground after all. Matt Renshaw, pitched into the lion’s den as a late call-up, has spoken. He wants to focus on the cricket, unsurprisingly: The Australian team have arrived in Johannesburg ahead of the fourth Test and are looking to sidestep the attendant media scrum: Meanwhile, South Africa got problems of their own: A couple of dissenting views. Rob Taylor writes: “I’d like to address the ball tampering laws. We need swing and reverse swing in the game. It’s vital on these batsman friendly wickets (especially if we continue using these rubbish, soft, seamless Kookaburra balls). We’ve let reverse swing become a vital part of cricket without addressing or adjusting the laws that currently make it borderline impossible to obtain entirely legally. If no-one adheres to a law, then it’s a bad law. Currently, every side in the world uses doctored saliva (via mints or gum or whatever) to try and keep the shiny side shiny and teams will deliberately throw the ball in on the bounce to rough up the ball. By the letter of the law both of these common practises are illegally changing the condition of the ball. This is part of the reason why the standard ICC punishment for ball tampering, from a mint in the mouth all the way up to what Smith and co were up to, is so light. I say, relax the letter of the law. Allow teams to bounce the ball in, allow them to sweets or mints, allow them to use cloths or powders to dry their hands and therefore keep the ball drier and more likely to reverse. Maybe even allow certain very slightly abrasive and/or absorbent materials be used directly on the ball (not sandpaper or a zipper, but not silk, somewhere in between? I’m thinking towel maybe?). Make the offence of ball tampering specifically about applying illegitimate foreign objects, teeth or nails to the ball.” To which Peter Mackelworth adds: “Back in my club playing days we used to use the spike key to ‘clean’ the seam, and nothing was ever thought of this. In many ways I think the offense is being blow out of proportion, the most negative thing in my mind is if Bancroft has been ‘forced’ to play the role. Rather more darkly, Phil Withall wonders: “I’m sure I’m the first person to point this out but it’s to much of a coincidence that this scandal happened just as Queensland were closing in on the Sheffield Shield title. The Sydneycentric cricket Australia board will go to great lengths to keep Queensland out of the spotlight...” An Anglo-centric observation is that Smith and Co couldn’t have timed this worse – if you want to bury bad deeds, don’t do it on an international football break weekend. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the crisis “turned nuclear on Tuesday night with players turning on David Warner amid claims that the deposed vice-captain may never play for his country again”: The deposed vice-captain removed himself from the team’s WhatsApp group in the midst of the unprecedented drama. Warner and Steve Smith, who were both facing losing their leadership roles as well as having bans imposed for their part in the cheating plot, walked through Cape Town airport surrounded by hordes of television cameras and reporters. You can read the full report from Chris Barrett here. There’s always an Ashes angle. And here’s a recap, from PA, on what Michael Vaughan said about the likelihood of ball-tampering in the recent series: The former England captain told BBC Sport: “I can’t believe that this hasn’t happened before. I look at the amount of tape some of the fielders have worn, particularly during the Ashes series, mid-on, mid-off. (You) don’t have to name names but they know who they are. I’m pretty sure that it was going on during the Ashes series. But it wasn’t the reason why England lost 4-0. They still would have lost that series …” The former batsman, who led England to Ashes success in 2005, said: “I played for 17 years and there wasn’t a team that I played in that didn’t get close to the line. “There was many, you would say tricks, that many teams would use out in the middle. You’d see the ball get bounced into the rough to create reverse swing, you’d see sweets in the mouth, you’d see saliva put on the ball to try and keep that shine for longer. “Is that right? Many will say not, but that’s what has happened in the game of cricket for many, many years and will continue to happen, because it’s very hard to control. One unwritten rule in the game is that you don’t take a piece or an object out there to tamper with the ball, and I’m pretty sure the Australians and the players involved in that leadership group will face the consequences.” Vaughan does not agree with suggestions that Smith should be handed a life ban but believes the legacy of this Australia side will be forever tainted by the scandal. He said: “It doesn’t really matter what they achieve in their careers. They’re going be known as a team that cheated.” We’re now firmly into the ‘reaction to the reaction’ phase, upon which Scott Probst writes: “Although the episode of planned ball tampering, involving as it does a bunch of senior players - the “leadership” group - is astounding, some of the santimonious commentary from past players is a little hard to stomach. “The Australian (and world) cricketing public has been treated to years - decades - of ‘mental disintegration’ theory, ‘hard but fair’ mythos, players being found to have contact with bookies on the subcontinent, etc etc, but now the very players who carried on this way are shocked and disturbed by this development. Perhaps they are more shocked than anything by the fact that Smith admitted his mistake – surely this is the really exceptional part of the whole affair, that he owned up to it rather than attempt the usual machismo-fuelled self-justifications that we hear year in, year out.” Julian, meanwhile, adds: “Have we all missed the point that nine times out of ten ball tampering doesn’t work? From the time in under 10s to senior grade cricket there has always been the premeditated team call to shine or not shine the kookaburra side. Sometimes this worked but the impact of the wicket surface, the humidity, the wind, the quality of the batsmen, a harsh outfield etc all conspired against the best laid plans to try and get an advantage and swing the ball. Let’s face it, even with a bit of stray tape it didn’t make a difference to the variability of the balls bowled in this most recent test. “Again, let’s remember, the sole goal of a batsmen is to keep his eye on the ball wherever it goes and not get out. So let’s all think back over recent history and apart from the two Waqar’s and some magic with duke balls by English swing bowlers, how many times has attempted ball tampering worked against the bowling team and helped the batting team by stopping it from moving much at all! The trouble is we don’t know because it is not known what experiments various teams have undertaken to try to gain a bowling advantage as no post game analysis is possible because ball tampering is not an exact science not unlike management in general. Can’t we just say ‘well played South Africa’ you were the better team despite this unhealthy side show and move on.” That seems unlikely. Trevor Bayliss speaks. England’s Australian coach said: “As an Australian I’m embarrassed. Steve is a lovely young bloke who has made a terrible mistake, and I’m sure Cricket Australia will work out the course of action required.” Full story here: More from you the public. “Sure Smith should lose captaincy (and a ban is probably in order too) but this has got a bit daft now,” says Phil Harrison. “Now that my English schadenfreude at an Aussie cricketer in trouble has faded. I just feel a bit sad. Silly sod had it all and binned the lot.” I think more of those emotions will come in time when the schadenfraude and outrage have dampened down a little, though it’s unlikely Smith (or Cameron Bancroft) will ever receive the same doleful sympathy that, say, Mohammad Amir got. Nonetheless we were all likening Smith to Bradman a few months ago, and liveblog regular Gary Naylor was penning stuff such as this, with good reason. A word from Australia’s current opponents: South Africa’s coach Ottis Gibson has had his say on the tourists’ “win at all costs” mentality. “The Aussies have said it themselves, the brand of cricket they play is win-at-all-costs,” Gibson said on Tuesday, wondering whether the relative ease of Australia’s Ashes win might have played a part. “When you look at the Ashes, they were never really behind in any of the games, they won quite comfortably. Here they have been behind a couple of times and perhaps that desperation came into it. It’s a shame that something like this had to happen for them to have to have a look at themselves. “Every team, since the beginning of reverse swing, tries to get the ball to reverse. They skim it in, they bounce it in, they try and get it rough. The spinner gets his hand in the dirt and rubs it on the ball. Everybody has got a way of getting the ball to go a little bit further. The ball will reverse naturally, but everybody has a way of getting it to go a little bit further. Perhaps the desperation that they were behind in the game meant they took it that step further. It’s unfortunate.” Gibson expressed surprise at how big the story has become globally, but believes this is because of the spectacular fall-from-grace for a side that has been such a power in the game. “When you see such a deliberate act, then people will become very interested in it,” he said. “Especially with what Steve Smith said, that it was planned by a few of them, makes it an even bigger topic for people to talk about. “Cricket Australia is a hundred-year-old organisation and they have been the envy of the world in terms of winning World Cup and so on. They have had great teams and great players for a long time. Those great players from the past will now feel like their good name has been tarnished a bit, so people have a right to be upset about it.” Though even the most cricket-obsessed of us might have been surprised at it leading the BBC’s 10 o’clock news the other night. I wondered whether the comments from Australia’s erstwhile master of mental disintegration would get a reaction, and sho’ enough: Steve Waugh is the latest former Australia player to air his thoughts on it all. The former captain says he is “deeply troubled” by the ball-tampering row but has called for a “focused and balanced perspective” in the condemnation of those involved. Waugh, quoted on Cricket Australia’s website, said: “Like many, I’m deeply troubled by the events in Cape Town this last week, and acknowledge the thousands of messages I have received, mostly from heartbroken cricket followers worldwide. “The Australian cricket team has always believed it could win in any situation against any opposition, by playing combative, skillful and fair cricket, driven by our pride in the fabled Baggy Green. “I have no doubt the current Australian team continues to believe in this mantra, however some have now failed our culture, making a serious error of judgement in the Cape Town Test match. “In 2003, we modified the Spirit of Cricket document originally created by the MCC, to empower our players to set their own standards and commit to play the Australian way. We must urgently revisit this document, re-bind our players to it and ensure the spirit in which we play is safeguarded for the future of the sport, and to continue to inspire the dreams of every young kid picking up a bat and ball and for every fan who lives and breathes the game.” He added: “A focused and balanced perspective is needed in the condemnation on those involved in this, with a clear and critical consideration to the social impact and mental health of all players. I will support all positive action to ensure an outcome for the betterment of the game, regaining the trust and faith of every fan of cricket.” Morning/evening everyone. It’s likely d-day for Steve Smith, Darren Lehmann and others, as Cricket Australia’s chief executive, James Sutherland, joins the team in South Africa to investigate the ball-tampering scandal. Reports suggest Smith could be facing a year’s ban. Sutherland will hear the outcome of an investigation into Saturday’s incident from the team performance head Pat Howard and integrity chief Iain Roy after the pair spent Monday in Cape Town interviewing the players. CA is expected to announces its punishments early this evening South Africa-time. Darren Lehmann’s position as coach also hangs in the balance with reports that he will pre-empt the investigation by stepping down more than a year ahead of his planned exit after next year’s Ashes. In what might be seen as more parochial, mere-cricketing news, Matt Renshaw has been called into the squad for the fourth Test, a match that may well have an odd England v Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010 kind of vibe to it, though the enthusiasm with which South Africa greeted their victory at Cape Town on Sunday suggests perhaps not. Anyway, stay with us as we log all the latest news and reaction. And you could do worse than start with a read of Matthew Engel, on why the buck has to stop with the captain, and Paul Connolly, on what this might all mean for Australian fans already weary of the way the team conducts itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/31/shooter-drills-high-school-shooting-new-normal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T11:00:12Z","webTitle":"'Haunting' school shooter drills become the new normal in US schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/31/shooter-drills-high-school-shooting-new-normal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/31/shooter-drills-high-school-shooting-new-normal","fields":{"headline":"'Haunting' school shooter drills become the new normal in US schools","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The gunshots came from upstairs, pop-pop-pop, and Lindsay Aikman’s heart thumped faster and faster. The school’s public address system announced an active shooter. The teacher dashed for the nearest hiding place – the boys’ bathroom. She regretted it when the automated lights flicked on. Her thoughts raced: “Should I have gone to the girls’ bathroom? Farther away. Library? Too open. A classroom? Sitting duck.” As a tense voice over the loudspeaker described the shooter’s movements, Aikman wondered to herself: “Why is it an office assistant’s responsibility to deliver life-or-death information?” The bathroom stank of urine. She was wearing a smart outfit for a meeting. She crouched on the toilet, keeping her feet off the floor in an effort to preserve both her shoes and her hiding place. Why won’t the lights turn off? Silence. Then, again, pop-pop-pop. Footsteps – how distant? Aikman wept in dread and frustration. More head spinning. “Man, I’m so stupid for going into the bathroom, I should have just gone outside … I’ve got kids to raise, I hope they’re safe at their school. Why am I doing this job? Isn’t there a different way to handle this issue? I don’t know how to explain this to my husband.” Then it was over. It was “just” a drill. Aikman splashed her face with cold water and went back to work. Unlike at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, last month, there had been no shooter and not even any kids to deal with. It was a teachers-only drill at her high school in Illinois. Versions of this ritual are now stitched into the fabric of the American educational system, from kindergarten to university. But teachers are starting to question it. “The drills are hard emotionally for some kids. Certainly they’re difficult for me as a teacher. There’s a little piece of heartbreak in every drill,” Corey Thornblad, a history teacher in Virginia, told the Guardian. “Every time something like this happens – Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Parkland – and then we do a drill you can see it in their faces,” she said of her students. A chime then a code over the intercom system lets teachers at her school know if the lockdown is a drill or a real emergency. “It’s eerie … you’re all business but it’s a little bit haunting,” she said. Classroom doors are locked at all times in her school. During a drill, Thornblad opens the door and quickly looks for any children in the hallway. Once the door is locked again and, with the blinds down and computers turned off and her students, aged 12 to 14, huddled on the floor in the dimness, she is not allowed to reopen it. Even if a child is begging to come in. At the Parkland massacre, the school fire alarm was activated by the suspect, which brought students pouring into the corridors, causing enormous confusion when the shooting began. Teachers told the Guardian last weekend of their excruciating decisions whether to follow protocols adapted since 2012’s Sandy Hook massacre and keep doors closed no matter what. Or open them to let in kids who were defenseless in the corridors. Some who followed orders to keep doors closed have since been called cowards by children who were shut out. Aikman teaches English, social justice and college readiness at a large public high school. “This is a very heavy time to be an American school teacher,” she said. Staff and students are jumpy. “Whatever classroom I’m in I’m looking at how to exit in an emergency. That’s how we’re thinking now as teachers. What I could use to break a window, what I would use to barricade a door, how I would keep people quiet.” Aikman said a colleague gets texts at work from her husband, checking to make sure she is OK, saying things like: “I just had a weird feeling, I wondered if today was the day.” She spends extra time hugging her own kids goodbye in the mornings, wondering: “is this the day I’ll end up having to remember everything about this morning?” Teachers report having panic attacks during drills, taking anxiety pills beforehand. Aikman said a married couple at her school plan to flee from different exits so at least one will survive to raise their children. Drills for tiny children at some schools are presented as a game called “hibernation” where they take a stuffed animal into the bathroom or closet and hide. One teacher tweeted, after a recent drill, about watching her 10-year-old students glancing anxiously at her, at the floor or at the door of the closet where the whole class was crammed, pretending a shooter was outside. After the exercise, she recalled: “10-year-old eyes darted to see if peers were equally frightened, 10-year-old hands shook slightly.” She handed out good behavior points, praised the children for staying calm, told them they were safe. “The watery smiles and minuscule nods I was given were wrenching agony. They smelled the lie. They are 10, they know closet doors won’t save them.” The teacher then went and cried in the bathroom. She later deleted the tweets and the Guardian is withholding her identity. Meanwhile, during an exercise for teachers in Massachusetts, 10 staff were told to line up in the corner of a room. A man in a hood went one by one, pointing a gun at their heads and saying “bang”. It was too much for participant Kathleen Moylan, who walked out, sobbing. “I was too upset to continue with the training,” said the history teacher at the high school in Worcester. “How is this something that is going to help us?” she asked in an interview with the Worcester Telegram. She had once taught Dan O’Neil, who was 22 when he was among the 32 people killed in the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007. “Some of this training really does feel like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic if we don’t want to deal as a country with the larger issue of assault weapons and background checks and all of that. It feels like we’re avoiding the major issue,” Moylan told the Guardian. Thornblad, a member of the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America advocacy group, is, however, encouraged by the youth movement ignited by Parkland. Massive crowds inspired by the survivors turned activists took part in the March for Our Lives last weekend. Thornblad reminded her students that they would be able to vote one day. “You can be part of the solution,” she told them. “I wanted them not to feel hopeless.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/china-and-russia-accused-of-waging-war-on-human-rights-at-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T17:31:00Z","webTitle":"China and Russia accused of waging 'war on human rights' at UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/china-and-russia-accused-of-waging-war-on-human-rights-at-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/china-and-russia-accused-of-waging-war-on-human-rights-at-un","fields":{"headline":"China and Russia accused of waging 'war on human rights' at UN","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"China and Russia are leading a stealthy and increasingly successful effort at the United Nations to weaken UN efforts to protect human rights around the world, according to diplomats and activists. The two countries have used the UN budget panel, known as the fifth committee, to cut funding for human rights monitors and for a senior post in the secretary general’s office which is supposed to ensure that human rights – one of three pillars of the UN’s function – are not forgotten in its day-to-day work. The UN Human Rights Up Front initiative was established in 2014, after a series of UN failures in preventing or sounding the alarm over atrocities, culminating in mass killings in Sri Lanka in 2009. A senior official in the secretary general’s office was appointed to ensure that progress was made on the issue throughout the organisation, but funding for that post has been cut this year by the fifth committee, as a result of lobbying by China and Russia. The cut, first reported in Foreign Policy, means that the human rights work that was the responsibility of that official will be spread around other posts with other priorities. The funding of the office of the high commissioner for human rights in Geneva has also been cut. The current high commissioner, Zeid Ra’ad Hussein, has announced that he will be stepping down this year and not seeking another term in the post, explaining to his staff that the lack of global support for protecting human rights made his job untenable. Last week, Zeid was due to address the UN security council on plight of civilians in Syria but before he began, Russia called a procedural vote to stop him speaking on the grounds that the council was not the proper forum for discussing human rights. “The fifth committee has become a battleground for human rights,” Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch, said. “Russia and China and others have launched a war on things that have human rights in their name.” “You can get a mandate for human rights work in the security council, but then Russia and China go behind the scenes to defund it,” Charbonneau said. “And the countries that pay lip service to human rights are not pushing back. But the question is are we going to let them win?” “China has real political momentum at the UN now,” Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council for Foreign Relations, said. “It is now the second biggest contributor the UN budget after the US, and is increasingly confident in its efforts to roll back UN human rights activities. It is also pushing its own agenda – with an emphasis on ‘harmony’ rather than individual rights in UN forums. And a lot of countries like what they hear.” A western diplomat at the UN conceded that human rights were losing ground at the UN, in part because China had become a more assertive voice, prepared to lead lobbying campaigns, and because Beijing is increasingly leveraging its vast and growing investments in the developing world to win votes for its agenda at the UN. “The fifth committee is a very important battleground,” the diplomat said. “Our team is fighting in the trenches very hard on this. We want to get the best value for the taxpayer, but also to make sure that something as important and central as human rights in the work of the UN is not defunded.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/28/angels-shohei-ohtani-future-of-baseball-or-empty-hype","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Shohei Ohtani: the future of baseball or empty hype?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/angels-shohei-ohtani-future-of-baseball-or-empty-hype","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/28/angels-shohei-ohtani-future-of-baseball-or-empty-hype","fields":{"headline":"Shohei Ohtani: the future of baseball or empty hype?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"He is a particular species of baseball flower that’s never been known before, at least not in the last century: a right-handed pitcher endowed with breathtaking 103mph heat and a left-handed hitter who sprays balls into both gaps when he’s not tattooing them into the seats, all in one baby-faced, freakishly athletic 6ft 4in, 215lb package. Meet Shohei Ohtani, the 23-year-old Japanese polymath whose childhood dream of testing himself against the world’s best will be realized this week as he makes his long-awaited Major League Baseball debut with the Los Angeles Angels amid deafening hype from both sides of the Pacific. The expectations for Ohtani, whose two-way prowess years ago earned him the heady billing of Japan’s Babe Ruth, have been tempered somewhat after a rocky spring training that augurs a steep learning curve to success in the American major leagues. He surrendered nine runs and nine hits in a combined two and two-thirds innings – more runs allowed than outs recorded – over a pair of starts against lineups dotted with minor-league hitters. He hasn’t fared much better at the plate with three hits in 28 at-bats: a frigid .108 average. But wherever the forecasts for Ohtani may fall – and they run the gamut – there’s no question he remains the most compelling prospect in Major League Baseball as the season kicks off on Thursday. Angels manager Mike Scioscia announced Tuesday night that Ohtani will make his regular-season pitching debut in Sunday’s game against the Oakland Athletics, while indicating he could appear in the batting lineup even sooner. It’s been a long time coming for the prodigy from the rural city of Oshu, a few hundred miles north of Tokyo. A national sensation as a high-schooler, Ohtani initially expressed a desire to bypass Japanese baseball altogether and move straight to America, immediately drawing interest from a gaggle of MLB’s richest clubs including the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball, the world’s top league outside of North America, drafted him despite the disclaimer and persuaded him to play domestically with a rare offer: he could remain in the everyday lineup as a hitter on the days he wasn’t scheduled to pitch. A recounting of Ohtani’s exploits from his five seasons with the Fighters reads like plot points from a tall tale. There was his second professional season with the Sapporo club when Ohtani, a teenager only two years removed from Hanamaki Higashi High School, won 11 games as a starter while hitting 10 home runs as an outfielder, becoming the first player in either the Japanese or American major leagues to reach double figures in both categories in a single campaign since Ruth in 1918. There was the 2016 season when he was tabbed Most Valuable Player of the Pacific League in addition to being named the league’s best pitcher and designated hitter – winning the Home Run Derby for good measure. There was the time later that same year when he made a rare appearance in relief to lock down a crucial game against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in the Climax Series, twice hitting an NPB-record 165kph (103mph) during a perfect ninth and lifting the Fighters to the Pacific League pennant. There were the countless exhibitions of power, none more eye-popping than the day he sent a ball clear through the roof of the Tokyo Dome. Ohtani’s numbers during a half-decade with the Fighters speak for themselves: a career earned run average of 2.52 with 654 strikeouts in 85 appearances as a pitcher, with a batting average of .286 with 48 home runs in 403 games played as a hitter. “He’s so talented,” Hideki Kuriyama, Ohtani’s manager with the Fighters, told CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes last year. “It’s really tough to use him the right way, with the right balances.” Now the biggest challenge of all looms: following in the footsteps of Japanese exports like Hideki Matsui and Ichiro Suzuki, who made good on their dizzying hype on American soil. Perhaps the most encouraging telltale of Ohtani’s inner drive is his decision to join the Angels this year, when he was still hamstrung by rules under MLB’s collective bargaining agreement that cap spending on prospects under the age of 25 with unresolved commitments to professional teams in international leagues. Consider that Ohtani will earn the major league minimum salary of $545,000 this season in addition to a $2.32m signing bonus from the Angels, who control his rights for the next six years, and won’t be eligible for free agency until 2023 – the same as any rank-and-file prospect – after paying the Fighters a posting fee of $20m. Had he spent two more seasons picking his teeth on Japanese pitchers (and hitters) while only redoubling his mystique, Ohtani could have commanded as much as $200m on the open market. Instead, the desire to test himself against the world’s best competition prevailed, which speaks to the depth of Ohtani’s character and self-belief – and limits the Angels’ vulnerability if he fails to deliver on expectations. Whether the gamble on himself will pay off remains to be seen, but there’s no doubt the eyes of two baseball-mad countries will be hanging on every pitch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/27/itv-racing-audience-figures-cheltenham-festival-dip-four-per-cent-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T16:26:40Z","webTitle":"ITV Racing audience figures for Cheltenham Festival take a dip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/27/itv-racing-audience-figures-cheltenham-festival-dip-four-per-cent-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/27/itv-racing-audience-figures-cheltenham-festival-dip-four-per-cent-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"ITV Racing audience figures for Cheltenham Festival take a dip","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"ITV Racing’s second year of covering the Cheltenham Festival saw a 4% drop in viewing figures overall and a 14% drop in the peak audience for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the meeting’s feature event, according to figures released by the broadcaster on Tuesday. However, ITV’s total audience was over a quarter more than that attracted by the final year of Channel 4’s coverage in 2016. The total audience across the four afternoons of this year’s Festival was 3.423m and the daily total was down on Tuesday, Thursday and for Friday’s coverage of the meeting’s showpiece race in particular. The peak audience as Native River defeated Might Bite after a thrilling head-to-head between the two chasers from the off was 1.635m – a drop of 268,000 on 2017’s figure of 1.903m. Wednesday’s card, which featured Altior’s defeat of Min in the Champion Chase, was the only afternoon to show an increase in viewers, with an average figure of 864,000, up 114,000 (15.2%) on the 2017 average of 750,000. While ITV was keen to point ouday that 11 of the 20 races shown live during the week attracted a seven-figure peak, the decline in the Festival’s overall audience is likely to be a cause of some concern both forthe broadcaster and for the sport, which sold ITV a £30m, four-year monopoly on all terrestrial coverage of racing from the start of 2017. ITV will have been hoping to build audiences for the meeting throughout the duration of its contract and started to promote its Festival coverage several weeks in advance. Cheltenham and Royal Ascot are the two most important meetings of the year from a broadcaster’s point of view and a similar decline in the audience either for this year’s Royal meeting or for next year’s Festival could set alarm bells ringing over the value of the contract before renewal talks begin next year. Footpad, who was one of the biggest stars of the Festival when he eased to victory in the Arkle Trophy Novice Chase, has been taken out of the Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse this weekend and is now expected to line up for a Grade One contest at Aintree’s Grand National meeting next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/03/country-diary-springs-dramatic-upwelling-of-life","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T04:30:06Z","webTitle":"Country diary: spring's dramatic upwelling of life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/03/country-diary-springs-dramatic-upwelling-of-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/03/country-diary-springs-dramatic-upwelling-of-life","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: spring's dramatic upwelling of life","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At last those winter rains have ended and the sun shone here for two full days. Suddenly it is time for cock pheasants, flushed crimson with testosterone, to fight long tail-twisting battles; for wild violets to flower quietly over our meadow-lawn; for goldfinches to strip spider thread from the back wall to bind their nests; for hairy-footed summer-bees to zip among the rosemary blooms, and for buff-tailed and early bumblebee queens to truffle the green hellebore heads in a last garden before the marsh. They’re all part of that dramatic upwelling of life which Roger Deakin once called “opening time in nature’s great saloon”. It is also a moment for the first solitary bees and I climbed the gate and lay on the rabbit-warrened south-facing bank to luxuriate in their brief presence. So many people are exercised these days by the plight of the honeybee, but, as Steven Falk and Richard Lewington’s fabulous Field Guide to the Bees of Britain and Ireland makes plain, there are 274 other species in our islands. My local population is probably of Clark’s mining bee in the genus Andrena, which alone holds about 70 species, many of them identifiable by the tiniest structural differences. Mining bees are unobtrusive extras of early spring but this species has a habit of nesting in large colonies and once you key into their 1-cm-long presence they become commonplace. Females are a fraction more conspicuous, with black velvet bodies and a thoracic plush of gorgeous chestnut. A favoured spot in our parish is on bramble, where they rest on the leaves between feeding bouts. Willow blossom seems a food of choice and sometimes they are so smothered in pollen they resemble sugared yellow bonbons. Clark’s bees may breed in colonies but each underground nest is a separate chamber and accessed by a burrow ringed by a minuscule circlet of spoil. The benefit of communal breeding sites is that the bees can jointly defend their brood. A drawback is that it attracts the parasitic attentions of the wasp-like early nomad bee Nomada leucophthalma, which lays its eggs on those of the mining bee, with the usual horror-story consequences."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/27/meps-raise-cronyism-concerns-at-hiring-of-jean-claude-juncker-successor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T17:42:57Z","webTitle":"MEPs raise cronyism concerns at hiring of Juncker successor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/meps-raise-cronyism-concerns-at-hiring-of-jean-claude-juncker-successor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/27/meps-raise-cronyism-concerns-at-hiring-of-jean-claude-juncker-successor","fields":{"headline":"MEPs raise cronyism concerns at hiring of Juncker successor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The European parliament has stepped up criticism of the process that propelled Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man into the top job at the European commission. During a 150-minute hearing, MEPs raised concerns about cronyism and conflicts of interest over the appointment of Martin Selmayr to the post of secretary general, making him the commission’s most senior civil servant, managing 32,000 EU officials. Selmayr, a workaholic German lawyer, had been the European commission president’s chief of staff, having enjoyed a meteoric rise since joining the commission 14 years ago. In a series of testy exchanges, the European commissioner in charge of human resources, Günther Oettinger, said he did not know of Juncker’s plan to give the job to his protege until the night before it was announced. But Oettinger dismissed one MEP’s charge that the appointment amounted to a coup, while insisting rules had not been broken. “Did the commission follow the rules? My answer to that question is an unconditional yes,” Oettinger told MEPs, while suggesting the commission could have acted differently. “Whether the procedure went wrong I think that is more of a political assessment … I think we all have to think about whether something could have been done better.” The furore started when Selmayr was given two jobs in one day. On 21 February he was appointed deputy secretary general, then immediately promoted to the top job, when Dutch national Alexander Italianer announced his sudden retirement. The job hopscotch was rubber-stamped at the weekly meeting of EU commissioners, after Juncker said he would like Selmayr to take Italianer’s place. More than one month after the administrative reshuffle, questions remain. Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron addressed the topic at a press conference after last week’s EU summit in Brussels. The German chancellor said she esteemed Selmayr’s work but rejected suggestions of national bias. “Just because he is German does not mean that he does everything the German government wants. It is not at all the impression that we have. He is someone who takes decisions in a very professional manner.” Eurosceptics have seized on the affair. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, said he wanted Selmayr to become “the most famous person in the whole of Europe”. After hearing testimony from a parliament lawyer on Tuesday, the chair of the European parliament’s budgetary control committee, Ingeborg Grässle, said the commission ought to have published the vacancy to allow competition for the job. The European parliament is due to adopt a resolution on Selmayr’s appointment next month. But there are signs that cross-party unity on the issue – evident at an earlier debate – is beginning to fray. The commission denies the move was a promotion, saying Selmayr’s salary and benefits would be slightly reduced as a result of the move. Officials issued an 80-page defence of Selmayr’s appointment at 3am on Sunday morning, in response to 134 questions from MEPs. Prof Dr Martin Selmayr, his preferred CV title, worked at the German media group Bertelsmann before joining the commission in 2004 as a spokesman on media and telecoms. From this mid-ranking position he has climbed to the apex of the EU bureaucracy, in less than half the time it took his predecessor to make the same ascent. Picked to run Juncker’s 2014 campaign to become European commission president, Selmayr has been at the forefront of his boss’s stated intention to run “a more political commission”, an EU executive that sets an agenda, rather than one that bends to the wishes of national leaders. A fierce defender of the European cause, he takes unusually public positions for a civil servant, for example, sharing his delight on Twitter when Macron won the French presidential election last year: But as Juncker’s chief of staff, he has been dogged by accusations of high-handed behaviour and bossing around commissioners. Selmayr was also behind the plan for refugee quotas that infuriated Hungary and other central European states, and was at Juncker’s side during David Cameron’s mini renegotiation of Britain’s EU membership. Selmayr and his boss were exasperated that the former British prime minister hardly mentioned the deal during the failed referendum campaign. More recently, he is widely suspected of leaking an unflattering account of a Brexit dinner at Downing Street with Theresa May. He has always denied being behind the leak."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/28/van-gogh-and-japan-review-amsterdam-the-painter-as-tortured-apprentice-hiroshige","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T14:31:24Z","webTitle":"Van Gogh and Japan review – the painter as tortured apprentice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/28/van-gogh-and-japan-review-amsterdam-the-painter-as-tortured-apprentice-hiroshige","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/28/van-gogh-and-japan-review-amsterdam-the-painter-as-tortured-apprentice-hiroshige","fields":{"headline":"Van Gogh and Japan review – the painter as tortured apprentice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Art history has gone global. Gone are the days when the likes of EH Gombrich and Kenneth Clark could tell the story of art as if it was exclusively European. The BBC’s new series Civilisations is merely following today’s museums and academics in insisting instead that western art is just one part of a world history in which the most dynamic forces are exchanges, influences and sometimes acts of daylight robbery linking one part of the world with another. The artistic relationship between the European avant garde and Japan in the 19th century is one such cross-cultural flow. There’s plenty of evidence that the (mostly French) artists who laid the foundations of modernism were obsessed with the images of Hokusai, Hiroshige, Utagawa Kuniyoshi and other masters who took popular, brightly coloured woodblock printmaking to a zenith of sophistication in 18th and early 19th-century Japan. In Édouard Manet’s 1868 portrait of the radical novelist Émile Zola, a picture of a wrestler by Utagawa Kuniaki II is pinned up on his study. Manet’s associate Whistler brought the cult to Britain in paintings like Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge that are manifestly inspired by Japanese prints. Perhaps the most spectacular evidence of all can be seen at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Its unique collection of Vincent van Gogh’s art includes two direct copies of Hiroshige prints that he painted in 1887. One depicts the white flowers of plum trees against a scintillating pink sky, the other a curvy wooden bridge seen through driving rain that’s represented as sharp black lines against varying shades of atmospheric blue. The intense passion and fervour with which Van Gogh copied Hiroshige leaves no doubt of his reverence for Japanese art. At the beginning of the Van Gogh Museum’s typically thorough, scholarly survey of how that enthusiasm helped shape his vision, these two paintings are hung beside Hiroshige’s originals, The Residence with Plum Trees and Sudden Evening Shower on the Great Bridge near Atake. And this is where my doubts began. Even when he is slavishly copying Japanese art, Van Gogh looks nothing like a Japanese artist. You’d have to stand very, very far back and squint to think his versions of Hiroshige resemble the originals – even though they duplicate their imagery. Every impulse of Van Gogh’s brush adds something of his own. A smooth, dark silhouette of trees by Hiroshige becomes, when repainted by Van Gogh, a raw, rough, blobby blue cloud whose every touch looks hard won and difficult. The black lines of rain that form a cool curtain across Hiroshige’s picture become, in Van Gogh’s vision of it, violent, sinister, oppressive slashes. Van Gogh’s identification with Japanese artists was utterly sincere – what about the poor bastard wasn’t? – yet as doomed as an uptight western hippy reading eastern religious texts outside an Amsterdam cafe. One of the most tragic exhibits here is an 1888 self-portrait in which he tries to make himself look like a Japanese priest with shaven head. What comes through is not the spiritual calm he was aiming for but his desperate, troubled forehead and piercing eyes. They communicate the depth of his loneliness and agitation and desire to find a worthwhile place in the world. His angst is exhibited in a formidable row of self-portraits that also includes Self-Portrait with a Bandaged Ear, painted in 1889 after he mutilated himself. Here the contrast between the graceful ideals Van Gogh saw in Japanese art and his own tortured reality is even more painful. On the wall behind him hangs a print of Mount Fuji by Sato Torakiyo. Yet the man staring at us from behind blue eyes is as far from the calm that landscape projects as can be. He is a harrowed modern saint, a Dostoyevskyan character on the edge of society and fighting to stay sane. In a very curious way this exhibition reveals the essence of Van Gogh. It makes clear that his interest in Japanese art went beyond cold issues of aesthetics. Sure, he learnt from the way the woodblock artists framed their scenes in daring, proto-cinematic sweeps free from western convention. Beyond that, however, Van Gogh saw them as monk-like eastern visionaries whose art espoused a philosophy of Buddhist calm. Compared with his paintings, the many woodblock prints here do indeed appear at one with nature, reconciled with life. There’s a fundamental contrast between their laid back composure and Van Gogh’s turbulence. This is most pitiable in the show’s last juxtaposition of west and east. The curators suggest that one of Van Gogh’s very last works, Rain at Auvers, painted shortly before his suicide in 1890 and lent by the National Museum of Wales, is actually his final interpretaion of the graphic way rain is shown in prints like Hiroshige’s Night Rain at Karasaki. Well, perhaps – in the same way a drunken rendition of Mozart on a broken bar piano by a man at the end of his tether is still, technically, Mozart. Van Gogh’s last rain has nothing in common with Hiroshige’s or anyone else’s. Rain at Auvers is a terrifying postcard from the abyss. It is a landscape slashed, a world seen through bitter tears. This painting is practically a suicide note. Yet I have to confess that by the time I got to this point I had long since stopped giving the Japanese prints much attention. The claim that Van Gogh was deeply influenced by Japanese art simply does not hold up. Did he need to see Hokusai to paint his lovelym all-embracing 1888 vista The Harvest, as the exhibition suggests? To me it looks much more like the epic panoramas painted by his Netherlandish predecessor Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Similarly, it seems odd that the curators trace his close-up drawings of insects and flowers to Japan’s influence when still life has been a Dutch specialism since the 17th century and plenty of homegrown models for his art can be found next door in the Rijksmuseum. Worse, I stopped caring. Even if the fine works by Hiroshige and his peers that are shown here really were a key influence for Van Gogh, his art simply blasts them out of the gallery. Their precise, ironic panoramas just look flat and repetitive compared with the visionary splendour of his art. Vincent’s Bedroom glows and sways, rocks and rolls with intimacy and passion. No one had ever painted anything like this before, anywhere. Van Gogh’s art is self-expressive in a way inconceivable to Hokusai or, for that matter, Raphael. An honest multicultural history of art has to acknowledge that the raw individualism of Van Gogh is as European as his unhappiness. That’s why so many people from everywhere on earth make the trek to this Amsterdam museum, to revere a modern soul without equal. Van Gogh and Japan is at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, until 24 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/29/nearly-100-london-councillors-have-links-to-property-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nearly 100 London councillors have links to property industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/nearly-100-london-councillors-have-links-to-property-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/29/nearly-100-london-councillors-have-links-to-property-industry","fields":{"headline":"Nearly 100 London councillors have links to property industry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Almost one in 10 councillors in London either work for property businesses or have received gifts or hospitality from them, a Guardian investigation into the depth of links between town halls and the property industry has revealed. Nearly 100 councillors in the capital work for property companies or lobbying and communications consultancies involved in planning, according to declarations of interest made by elected representatives. Some of them also sit on planning committees making decisions over major developments, including volumes of affordable housing. In Thursday’s local elections, housing is expected to be the second-biggest issue for voters behind health, according to polling by Lord Ashcroft. Campaigns in boroughs including Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Wandsworth have been dominated by housing issues. In Westminster, where former deputy leader Robert Davis is under investigation for his links to the property sector exposed by the Guardian, Labour has pledged to accept no hospitality from developers or their agents and that all meetings will have a council officer present and will be minuted. The Guardian found that 43 councillors work for communications consultancies specialising in planning, which are appointed by developers to communicate with local residents, pressure groups and councillors before planning hearings. A total of 48 others either own or work for property companies. Just over 100 councillors received hospitality from property companies including lunches and dinners at top Mayfair restaurants, tickets to Premier League football matches, seats at Proms concerts and bottles of fine wine. The figures are drawn from members’ latest hospitality registers that date back between one and seven years. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, claimed the extent of the overlap between the property industry and councillors “undermines trust” and potentially “the important national objective of increasing affordable housing”. “These networks have the capacity to help property companies default on their responsibility to build affordable housing,” he said. “We should place restrictions on council members who are also employed by property companies and make it a legal requirement that they must stand down when decisions on planning issues are discussed which they may have an issue in.” Councillors with dual interests include Andrew Smith, the Conservative chairman of one of Westminster’s planning committees who works for Westbourne Communications – whose services include “delivery of planning approvals” – and Alex Karmel, a Conservative member of the planning committee at Hammersmith and Fulham who works for Thorncliffe, a consultancy that has a button on its website labelled: “Get me planning approval please!” Taking hospitality and working for outside organisations is permitted by councillors as long as it is declared. Typically, in council codes of conduct, members only need to withdraw from participating in any matter if they have a “disposable pecuniary interest”, which can include employment. Some of the councils with the highest levels of hospitality or declared interests in property companies are producing levels of affordable housing that fall short of the London mayor’s 35% target in the capital. In Wandsworth, where 17 councillors declared interests or entertainment with property companies, 19% of new homes built between 2013 and 2016 were affordable. In the City of London, where 12 councillors declared interests, only 3% were affordable. Ravi Govindia, the leader of Wandsworth, strongly denied any link, stating that 1,700 affordable homes will be completed in the next three years and that “to suggest that we are not playing our part in delivering the low-cost housing London needs is complete and utter fallacy”. Govindia, who is director of a gorilla safari business, was entertained by property companies 11 times in 2016 and the first half of 2017 including at Simpsons in the Strand and the Ned. He said: “It is important that we engage with property companies, housing associations and senior government officials so that they better understand our housing needs and priorities.” Govindia said he was “wholly open and transparent in my dealings”. Councillors working for planning consultancies have denied any conflict of interest and say they do not lobby on applications in their own boroughs. Smith said: “It would be a breach of the councillor’s code of conduct if there were any conflict of interest between my role as a councillor and my occupation … As a consultant I have never worked to promote planning applications in Westminster.” Karmel said: “I fully comply with my council’s own code of conduct. It is unacceptable for councillors, of any party, to accept any form of payment to lobby their own council.” Almost a third of councillors who registered hospitality from property companies only reported one instance of entertainment or gifts. The rest recorded at least two meetings and in many cases several more. The research comes in the wake of outrage at the conduct of Davis, who stood down after the Guardian revealed he had been entertained by property industry figures 150 times in three years while in his previous role as chairman of the planning committee. The council’s leader, Nickie Aiken, launched an inquiry into the borough’s planning process to reassure residents it is “not only impartial, but is seen to be impartial”. Davis said any suggestion he did “anything other than to further the interests of the city and its residents are baseless and strenuously denied”. An internal inquiry into Davis is continuing and he is standing again in Westminster. One of Labour’s candidates is David Boothroyd, who sits on Westminster’s main planning committee and also works for Thorncliffe, which offers “lobbying and committee success” services. Boothroyd said the firm “expressly prohibits any of its employees from any form of engagement, on behalf of a client, of a local authority area of which they are an elected member”. Other councils received repeated entertainment. Darren Rodwell, the Labour leader of Barking and Dagenham, received free tickets to watch West Ham six times in 2016 and 2017 including from construction company Mullaley and a £3,680 four-day trip to China paid for by Chinese property investor PGC Capital. Peter John, the leader of Southwark council, recorded 18 occasions of hospitality with property developers and their agents between 2015 and 2017 including Berkeley Homes, which invited him to a party, a ball and a test match at Lords. John did not respond to request for comment. A spokesman for Rodwell said: “There is no conflict of interest.” The China trip, he said, “was part of the leader’s role as London councils’ city development representative to bring in investment in all 32 London boroughs”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/trans-young-people-suicide-support-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Too many of us young trans people are crying out for help.

Will you listen?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Paris Lees appeared on Question Time last week, I and many other trans people sat at home cheering her on. When she brought up the fact that 45% of trans young people have attempted suicide the clip was shared widely online, with overwhelmingly positive reactions. This wasn’t the first time the statistic had been brought up on the programme, yet it was dispiriting, to say the least, that most of the panel seemed more concerned about the persistent myth that kids are being sent for genital surgery. Why is this crisis of mental health within the trans community not the main source of concern? These statistics reveal a deep, systemic problem, and shed light on the way trans people are mistreated in society. We’re failing trans kids, and we need to talk about why. Virtually every single study on trans adults and children arrives at a similar, alarmingly high, percentage figure for attempted suicides. In 2014, the Williams Institute and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention published research that showed that 46% of trans men and 42% of trans women had attempted suicide. One of its major findings was that trans people across all demographics and ranges of experience have very high levels of attempted suicide. A British study from 2012 showed that 84% of respondents had contemplated suicide, 35% had attempted it, and 25% had done so more than once. An Irish study from 2012 showed that 63% had considered taking their own lives and 40% of respondents had attempted it. Another study conducted in Ontario, Canada, in 2015 found that 43% had attempted suicide. Two studies that specifically focus on trans youth also showed alarming figures. A study conducted in Australia in 2017 showed that up to 79% of respondents had self-harmed and up to 48% had attempted suicide. In a similar 2012 study in New Zealand, 20% of respondents had attempted suicide. And there is more. A lot more. Looking beyond that, studies on the wellbeing of trans kids who are supported in their identities show that they have the same levels of depression and anxiety as their peers. This all leads to the same conclusion: we must support trans children. Trans people are too often bullied, stigmatised, denied access to services and mistreated by society. Yet so much of the media coverage seems concerned with trans issues only when it’s about the alleged “problems” we cause. Why aren’t we talking about the fact that up to 45% of young trans people are trying to kill themselves? Why aren’t we talking about the long waiting times that trans people have to endure in order to get access to medical services? Why aren’t we talking about Naomi, who was stabbed to death last week near Hounslow? As a trans person I am no stranger to abuse. I know the feeling of being so miserable because of the way people treated me and so full of shame about myself that taking my own life seemed like the only option. I’m fortunate to still be here, and that is why I find it shameful to see certain prominent figures such as Jenni Murray only bring up the suicide statistics in order to place doubt on their validity. It’s a pattern too often repeated on social media, and it’s heartbreaking. Even when suffering of this magnitude is revealed, there will always be people out there who say: I don’t believe you. We need to accept that there is a problem. We need to accept that we as a society have a collective responsibility to react to these studies, and really take a hard look at what is causing it. Research clearly shows that trans children who are supported are much happier. I would love to read research that shows that trans people and trans children don’t face any stigma or obstacles at all, so there is no problem. That would be fantastic. But can anyone actually show me a single study that concludes this? We need to listen to, and learn from, the multitude of experiences of trans people out there. We need to eradicate the root of the problem. We need to combat stigma, discrimination and hate. We need to elevate the voices of trans people and stop giving platform to false narratives and hateful individuals. The best way to do so is to support organisations and campaigners fighting for trans rights. Be angry for us. Speak up for us. Question false narratives that demonise trans people. Share films about our lives. Support life-saving organisations such as Mermaids, that offer help to trans youth and their families. Be an ally. Because behind all those statistics, there are actual human beings. What you’ll find is that trans people are simply people, wanting to live their lives and do all the same things as other people. They pose no threat to anyone else’s rights or safety. We need your support. Are you listening? • In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

If you’re out to impress, however, turn those eggs into a chocolate souffle instead: richly flavoured, yet featherlight, it’s the perfect end to an Easter feast and, crucially, far easier to pull off than its fearsome reputation suggests. Not that your guests need to know that, of course. The base Souffles are, essentially, a meringue mixture folded into a flavoured base and baked so that the air bubbles trapped in the meringue expand, causing the souffle to rise. Many sweet souffle recipes start with either a crème pâtissière (an egg custard thickened with flour, favoured by chefs Daniel Clifford, Rowley Leigh and Gordon Ramsay) or a béchamel (a butter-based white sauce, also thickened with flour and used in Mary Berry’s Complete Cookbook), to give them more substance. Martha Stewart, Delia Smith and the folks at the US magazine Cook’s Illustrated prefer a flour-free recipe, relying on the thickening power of eggs alone, in a style sometimes known as a souffle à la minute. The problem I have with the flour-based souffles is not that they tend towards the slightly cakey in texture (though there is a good argument to say that: we already have chocolate fondant and countless other chocolate puddings, so have no need of a hybrid souffle version). Instead, it’s the dairy used to make the bechamel or crème pâtissière that dilutes the flavour of the chocolate: as Harold McGee notes in On Food and Cooking, “the base must be over-flavoured to compensate for its dilution by tasteless egg white and air”. Milk, or milk and cream in Ramsay’s case, takes the edge off the bittersweet flavour of the cocoa, leaving the souffles rather bland. The more intense flavour of the flour-free versions appeals more to testers, and the simpler recipe to me. If you’d like to make a slightly denser dessert, but would prefer to keep it gluten free, you may be as interested to know that Leigh specifies that his crème pat can be thickened with arrowroot, potato flour or cornflour, all of which are coeliac-friendly. The chocolate That said, even the flour-free versions don’t deliver quite the chocolate hit I want in a dessert, so I’m going to up the chocolate content and add a generous spoonful of cocoa powder, which will help to boost the flavour without adding too much extra weight in the form of cocoa butter. Berry, Stewart and Cook’s Illustrated put vanilla essence into their batter, and the last of those adds Grand Marnier for good measure. If chocolate isn’t enough for you, feel free to add other flavourings as suits your fancy: Smith’s rum, Fine Cooking’s coffee or Gourmet’s salted caramel all tickle my fancy. The eggs Because I’m not adding any extra fat in the form of dairy, my recipe will include as many egg yolks to thicken and enrich the base as egg whites to lighten it – beaten with sugar, they will help add volume, too. As I find to my cost, it’s imperative the egg whites are whipped properly: too soft, and the souffle will be runny; too dry and grainy, and they’ll be hard to mix properly with the base, and a chocolate-coloured batter is very unforgiving of white streaks. A pinch of cream of tartar will help stabilise the mixture, though a squeeze of lemon juice will perform the same function. The rise It’s vital to invest in proper straight-sided souffle dishes for a decent rise (you’ll get a better rise on individual portions than one big sharing ramekin). McGee reckons the common claim that buttering (preferably with “upward strokes”) and sugaring the ramekins before filling will give the mixture “a kind of lattice to climb while baking”, as the New York Times puts it, is rubbish: “Souffles made in unbuttered or uncrumbed dishes rise just as high,” he writes. McGee does, however, concede that this does make them easier to get out of the dish – and, I’d suggest, adds a delicious crunch. Nigel Slater’s version of Leigh’s recipe in Real Food suggests chilling the prepared dishes while you make the batter, which is a clever way of ensuring they stay buttered once the warm filling is added. Many recipes also claim that, for a restaurant-style flat top, you should fill the dishes, pull a palette knife across the top, then run a fingertip around the side to create a trench. In fact, there’s a wealth of helpful advice out there on how to guarantee a neat rise, from hot baking sheets to banging the dish against a hard surface before baking. My best advice is to leave about 1cm space to the top, and don’t worry too much about a rustic rise; they’ll still look impressive. Bake at in a very hot oven: the hotter, the faster the mix will rise before the inside has a chance to overcook, and, as eggs have a tendency to be dull when served as hot as a souffle requires, we conclude it’s important to leave the interior molten, rather than baking it solid. Souffles keep surprisingly well in the fridge uncooked, but once they are baked, they need to be served immediately, preferably with a spoonful of nutty ice-cream: as Slater writes, “the marriage of chocolate and pistachio – especially in this case when the chocolate is hot and the pistachio cold – is one made in heaven.” Perfect chocolate souffle For all of the scare stories, the mixture below can be made several hours in advance – I’ve even left it overnight without much loss of volume – but if you’re super well organised, I cannot recommend Cook’s Illustrated’s make-ahead chocolate souffle highly enough. It employs an Italian meringue, and I can confirm that it bakes perfectly straight from the freezer. Prep 15 min Cook 45 min Serves 6 Softened butter and 4 tbsp sugar, to coat 125g dark chocolate, broken into pieces 2 tbsp cocoa 6 medium eggs, separated 50g caster sugar 1 good pinch of salt ¼ tsp cream of tartar Heat the oven, and a baking tray, to 210C/410F/gas 6½. Generously butter six 9cm ramekins with upward strokes, then coat the insides with caster sugar. Put in the fridge while you make the batter. Melt the chocolate and cocoa in a heatproof bowl set above, but not touching, a pan of simmering water, stirring to combine. Remove and leave to cool slightly, stirring occasionally. Separate the eggs, being careful no trace of yolk creeps into the whites. Beat the yolks with 40g of the sugar until very thick and pale. Wash the beaters well, then whisk the whites with a good pinch of salt until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and whip to soft peaks. Add the remaining sugar and beat until just stiff, but still glossy: make sure you don’t overdo it. Stir the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, then add a spoonful of egg whites and stir well to loosen the mixture before gently folding in the rest with slow strokes, trying to keep as much air in there as possible. Spoon the souffle mix into the prepared dishes, leaving a 1cm gap at the top. Bang on a work surface to level the mixture, then clean the sides well. At this point, you can either chill until ready to bake, or put them in the oven straight away. Run the tip of a knife around the side of mixture, put on the hot baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes, until well risen but still molten inside. Serve at once. • Chocolate souffle: the perfect featherlight chocolate dessert, or style over substance? And what are your tips for achieving the perfect restaurant-style rise?

That’s 21 games every single day. (For context, in 2013 that number was 565.) As of January 2018, if you filter out the dross, the average Steam game sells about 1,000 copies, according to independent data-crunching by publisher No More Robots. This is the dispiriting reality that independent game developers are working with: at this month’s Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, there were queues up and down the hallway for a talk entitled “Making indie games that sell”. Patrick Söderlund is the executive vice-president of one of the biggest game publishers in the world, EA – a company far removed from these problems, making multimillion-dollar games with studios that employ hundreds of people. Twenty years ago, though, he was part of a three-person team working out of an apartment in Sweden, making the original Battlefield games that have since become one of EA’s largest money-makers. It’s partly this experience that has led him to believe that big publishers such as EA should help independent games get made. “It actually is important to me. When I started my own company, we had the same passion and conviction that I know a lot of smaller developers have today,” he says. “We had an idea for a game that we believed should be made, one that we were building because we wanted to play it ourselves and there was nothing out there like it. That became the foundation of our business. It took me years and years, struggling with budgets, recognition and being seen. I’ve been through it all. And I can also say that when I did it 20 years ago, I think it was actually easier than it is today. Today’s developers are in a very different, more difficult world. I figured I could help – that we should help, as a company. I believe that we should be able to afford to support the development community.” Last year, EA started a programme called EA Originals to partner with a lucky few independent developers each year, helping to fund and market their games. Uniquely, EA does not take a cut of the profits from those games: after its costs have been met, the profits go straight back to the developer. This is an unusually generous arrangement in the video games industry, so much so that it seems difficult to believe – but Söderlund takes a long-term view of the return on investment. “It’s a way for us to get in touch with developers who we might not normally talk to. It’s also a way for us to broaden our overall portfolio with games that are different from what we can develop on our own,” he says. “The most successful scenario is if the game sells like crazy and people love it, but also, we can establish a relationship with that developer and they work with us long-term … [These games] don’t have to sell loads. If we can help a studio to achieve financial stability, that’s a great result.” Like Söderlund, the EA Originals games that have been released so far are all from Sweden. Coldwood Interactive’s Unravel, a sweet puzzle game with an affecting environmental message, was the first unofficial test run of this strategy; when its developer appeared on stage at a huge EA press conference in 2015, shaking with nerves and clutching a little character made of yarn, it was such an endearing change in tone from the usual sports and shooting of EA’s bigger games that he became instantly internet-famous. Fe, released earlier this year, is a visually striking game about a little creature in a forest. A Way Out, which came out last week, is a B-movie-style prison-escape action game that can only be played by two people at the same time. They’re very far removed from EA’s own games – Fifa, Star Wars Battlefront, UFC, Need for Speed – but then, that’s rather the point. “We look for things that are unique and that complement our own development porfolio – that deserve to be made and played,” says Söderlund. “Unfortunately a lot of the games coming out now are just more of the same, and if I were to give any recommendation to creatives, it would be to think about what you’re building and why you’re building it, and understand that it has to be something different.” EA’s own studios are facing down different threats. When a game costs tens of millions to make, the stakes are extremely high, creative risks become intimidatingly expensive, and the price of failure can be devastating. This all contributes to a sense of ennui with the world’s most successful video game series: typically, only small changes are made year on year. “If you’re working on a large AAA game with a lot of money at stake, you have to always balance how much risk you’re willing to take on the concept and execution, versus staying in a familiar zone,” Söderlund acknowledges. “My job is to challenge our teams, dare them to be innovative, to come up with viable, smart ideas. That’s the challenge: how do you balance innovation versus falling back to old habits. We must constantly retrain our brains to think forward … If we don’t do it, someone else is going to do it.” EA has also struggled recently to balance the need to monetise its games with players’ experiences. Star Wars Battlefront II attracted immense ire from players and industry commentators last year when it emerged that people would have to play for 40 hours to unlock the best characters – or throw money at loot boxes that might unlock them at random. The backlash was so severe that EA removed the paid-for elements from the game entirely. Last week, it was overhauled in an attempt to win back some goodwill, but video game fans can be slow to forgive when they feel that someone has tried to exploit them. “I think as with any creative form where you run a large team, such as in games or film, you have to realise that not everything you do will be successful. Every developer on the planet can attest to that,” says Söderlund. “When things don’t go as you thought they would, you have to be very humble towards what happened, take an honest approach with yourself and with the result, and try to do better next time. This was an example of change that didn’t work. There’s no getting away from the fact that we made some decisions that I think in hindsight we shouldn’t have made. Neither the developer nor [EA] intended to create a slot machine or take money from people, though that was the perception.” In a way, EA Originals is a way for the company to spread its bets: it can continue to direct its resources towards Fifa, Madden, Battlefield and its other safe series, while supporting more unusual games at smaller studios. There is a moral element to the way Söderlund talks about this: if the biggest companies in games won’t support independent developers, who will? But it’s a business imperative, too: if game-makers are allowed to slide towards creative bankruptcy, real bankruptcy is never far behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/vive-lindifference-why-rude-french-waiters-should-be-celebrated-vancouver","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T14:47:58Z","webTitle":"Vive l’indifférence: why rude French waiters should be celebrated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/vive-lindifference-why-rude-french-waiters-should-be-celebrated-vancouver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/27/vive-lindifference-why-rude-french-waiters-should-be-celebrated-vancouver","fields":{"headline":"Vive l’indifférence: why rude French waiters should be celebrated","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are, famously, many intonations an English speaker can use when saying sorry, and only one of them means that they actually are sorry. Navigating the subtleties of the English language when you are foreign is a near full-time job; after almost a decade of doing it, I am yet to fully grasp all the complex vagaries. I have, as a result, some sympathy for Guillaume Rey, the French waiter who got fired from a restaurant in Vancouver for being rude. He is now trying to argue that he is not rude – he’s just, well, French, and French culture “tends to be more direct and expressive”. Although there isn’t quite enough information out there yet about the case to decide if his defence is outrageously cocky or simply a bit bold, Rey’s argument does highlight some important cultural differences. Language is, of course, one of them, but expectation is another: when going to a restaurant in France, getting barked at by a sour waiter is part of the experience – if you are acknowledged by staff at all – as is being terrified by the possibility of a knowing frown when ordering the wrong wine with the wrong course. This doesn’t mean it always happens – some hospitality staff are capable of being perfectly pleasant – but if it does, there’s no point in batting an eyelid: waiters are there to bring you food, not become your best friend. France is hardly an exception, of course: the Asian writer Ash Sarkar recently complained about having to take her white friends out for dinner. “They’ve not been raised knowing that how good the food is in a restaurant is always inversely proportional to how polite the service is,” she tweeted. Besides, overfriendliness in waiting staff only ends up being painful for all involved. Customers presumably go to restaurants to talk to the people they are having a meal with and no one else, while waiters already have a knackering job running around carrying hot, heavy plates, and so aren’t dying to make conversation for the sake of it. Well, that and the ones like Rey, who are working with English as a second language and can never be sure what their customers truly mean when they say sorry – or possibly much else besides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/extra-time-no-end-worlds-longest-match-stockport-doncaster","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T11:00:12Z","webTitle":"When extra time had no end: how one match lasted 3hrs and 23mins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/extra-time-no-end-worlds-longest-match-stockport-doncaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/extra-time-no-end-worlds-longest-match-stockport-doncaster","fields":{"headline":"When extra time had no end: how one match lasted 3hrs and 23mins","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"During the second world war competitive football continued in an irregular, somewhat confused manner, organisation being considerably more difficult when every able-bodied man of fighting – and therefore playing – age was in the armed forces or, at the very least, full-time employment. All unnecessary complications were avoided; tournaments were played regionally and quickly. In 1940 West Ham won the Football League War Cup, a tournament of some 137 games played in the space of only nine weeks. But replays, officials decided, had complicated matters unnecessarily. The following year drawn ties were awarded to the team with the superior league record, but this too caused unhappiness. Meanwhile the Lancashire Cup experimented with a new method of settling contests: simply not stopping them until somebody scored. The first time this was tried Burnley beat Everton without an enormous amount of additional time or effort, and the experiment was considered a success. In 1942 the Play to a Finish rule was adopted by the War Cup, and over the following few years it was also taken up – though not often actually used – by a variety of knockout competitions in England and Scotland. Occasionally, wacky variations were proposed: in the 1942-43 League South Cup, after 20 minutes’ extra time the match would be won by the first team to either score a goal or win a corner. There was, however, a problem inherent in the system. “There was always a danger,” the Liverpool Echo reported in April 1944, “that two sides some time would find that the finish wouldn’t come, not even by the time the cows came home.” Another Lancashire Cup match, between Liverpool and Everton this time, had gone to not-so-sudden death. “The longer it went on the less likely did a decision appear to be,” the Echo wrote. “After 130 minutes we had the remarkable sight of directors and managers of both sides confabbing with the players and referee on the sideline in search of a solution. Liverpool suggested tossing, but the Everton players, who seemed slightly less exhausted by the ordeal, voted for carrying on. To keep things within reasonable bounds, however, Mr Walter Cartwright representing the Lancashire FA instructed the referee to abandon the game if there was no further score in the next five minutes. There wasn’t, and the players trooped wearily off.” This was complete lawlessness, a game played to a soundtrack of discussions on the sidelines between people attempting to improvise a way of finishing it and which ended only when a local FA official took it upon himself to change the rules of the competition to make them less inconvenient. “We’ve got to remember that all the players are either in the forces or working. There’s no ‘laying in’ until midday. Lots of the civilian players put in a good morning’s work before the match, while service men frequently have to do morning duty before leaving camp,” the Echo complained. “I know many instances where service players have done heavy cross-country exercises with full pack on Saturday mornings, stood up most of the way by train or bus to the match, often with nothing to eat, and have then been criticised by those who didn’t know for being ‘out of condition’. They’re not out of condition. On the contrary, they must be in tip-top trim to stand what they do, but there are limits to everything.” Players continued to strain them. In the following season’s War Cup, a match between Cardiff City and Bristol City continued for – excluding intervals – three hours and 20 minutes before Bill Rees capitalised on a goalkeeping error to head in a winner. “Pandemonium broke out,” reported the Western Mail. “The big crowd of more than 20,000, the excitement and tension over, invaded the field and carried shoulder-high those young City players eager hands could grasp. “As the marathon unfolded itself both sides suffered. Would it never end, we thought as each side became more exhausted, and yet like super-humans contrived to put as much energy into their football as the human body would permit. I am certain that after this experience administrators will be wary about perpetuating a rule which makes such a physical and mental strain on players and public. I know the ‘play to a finish’ rule is only a war-time measure, but in the interests of the game it should be scrapped immediately.” Perhaps it was the conviction that this would indeed happen that encouraged the Western Mail’s reporter to insist that this game was “an endurance test which will for ever hold a place in the records”. In fact, its place was taken within 12 months. On 30 March 1946 Stockport County hosted Doncaster Rovers in the second leg of a League III North Cup match. The first game had finished 2-2, as did the second. So they played out extra time and, with no further goals having been scored, continued. And continued. After a little under three hours Les Cocker, the Stockport striker, turned the ball into the net. The crowd spilled on to the pitch and headed for the delirious scorer – and then they heard the whistle. The referee, a Mr Baker from Crewe, had spotted a handball, disallowed the goal and waved play on. “In the final minutes the players were collapsing with exhaustion and the crowd was calling upon the referee to stop the game,” wrote the Yorkshire Post. Eventually the sunlight, like everybody’s enthusiasm, faded. “Finally in the dusk and with a haze of smoke from the railway settling over the ground, Mr Baker decided that light was too bad to continue, and 22 weary players and three tired officials hobbled off the field,” wrote the Post. At 203 minutes, excluding intervals, the match had pipped the Cardiff game by three minutes. The teams were instructed to toss a coin for the right to host a replay; Doncaster won, and four days later they met again. After nearly 400 minutes the sides were finally – and emphatically – separated. Ralph Maddison scored a hat-trick as Doncaster romped to a 4-0 win, and amid widespread criticism – “Nothing,” the Guardian concluded in their report of the game, “could be more absurd” – the Play to a Finish rule lasted only a few months longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/brexit-britain-beware-europeans-migration-report-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T15:12:47Z","webTitle":"Brexit Britain, beware: the supply of Europeans is drying up | Jonathan Portes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/brexit-britain-beware-europeans-migration-report-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/brexit-britain-beware-europeans-migration-report-uk","fields":{"headline":"Brexit Britain, beware: the supply of Europeans is drying up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Back in 2007, Liam Byrne, then minister for immigration, decided to create a new, independent advisory committee to help the government set migration policy. He told me at the time that he hoped it would – as the monetary policy committee had done for interest rates – depoliticise the issue. Things didn’t work out quite the way he planned. Immigration continues to be at the centre of the political debate. And that means the work of the labour market economists who make up the migration advisory committee (Mac) is not just technical economic analysis, but has important political implications. Indeed, the government’s inability to take decisions on what the post-Brexit migration system would look like has meant that the Mac has, by default, become the only game in town. Originally the government planned to publish a white paper on the post-Brexit immigration system last summer. That’s now been postponed until the end of this year. The Mac has been commissioned to analyse the impacts of migration from the EU, with a report to be published in September. That will inevitably play a major role in shaping the future system. So what does today’s “interim report”, based mostly on evidence submitted by employers, tell us? First, that employers are very worried about the potential impact of ending free movement. This perhaps is no surprise. But it’s worth noting that this extends across a wide range of sectors and ranges far beyond the stereotype of EU migrants filling low-skilled, low-paid jobs. For example, the Mac discussion of the media and communications sector notes that it has much higher than average wages, that productivity has “soared” recently, and that migration has been the “driving force behind the sector’s recent growth”. Employers in the sector, for their part, say that without access to European workers, they would struggle to maintain this growth. Second, the report debunks a number of myths, in particular the claim that employers deliberately choose to recruit migrants rather than natives. The Mac says: “The vast majority of employers do not deliberately seek to fill vacancies with migrant workers. They seek the best available candidate. When a European Economic Area (EEA) migrant worker gets a job, it is because the employer thinks they are the best, sometimes the only, qualified applicant.” Nor, taking into account occupation and so on, are there big wage gaps – even workers from new EU member states earn only about 4% less, while other EU migrants are paid much the same as UK-born workers. The Mac has no time at all for claims that immigration has had much to do with the abysmal performance of UK real wage growth since the financial crisis. And while there is significant concern about exploitation and unfair treatment of migrant workers, it is notable that the MAC concludes that EU migrants are, if anything, less likely to be paid less than the minimum wage than UK-born workers; migrants from outside the EEA are significantly more likely to be underpaid. It’s not hard to work out why this might be the case – non-EEA migrants, particularly if their right to be here is tied to their job, or if their immigration status is questionable, may not be able push back against bad employers. EEA workers can just walk. Free movement is good for workers’ rights – an often unappreciated point. But while there’s no evidence here of widespread undercutting of wages, the report also pushes back against claims by some employers that increasing wages wouldn’t make it easier to recruit British-born workers. Of course it would, and some people would be better off. But it also notes that doesn’t mean making it harder for employers to recruit workers by reducing immigration would necessarily increase wages or living standards for the rest of us. Some firms would simply shrink or go out of business, and prices might rise. So what does all this tell us about a post-Brexit immigration system? Much will depend on the new evidence the Mac has commissioned to underpin its final report in September. And the fact that the Mac has been given the time and space to do its job properly is welcome. But this is still a damage limitation exercise. Free movement has been good for the UK economy and public finances, and when it ends there will be consequences. But perhaps the most important point – often ignored in this debate, but made by Alan Manning, the Mac’s chairman, in his foreword to this report: “Migrants have a choice and it cannot be taken for granted they will choose to come to the UK.” Migration from Europe fell sharply after the Brexit vote – even though nothing has changed yet. As the consequences for employers and public services become increasingly apparent, politicians should remember that immigration may be just as big a problem when it is falling as when it is rising. • Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, and a senior fellow of the UK in a Changing Europe programme"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/08/un-sexual-misconduct-chief-was-promoted-while-facing-harassment-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"UN sexual misconduct chief was promoted while facing harassment claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/08/un-sexual-misconduct-chief-was-promoted-while-facing-harassment-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/08/un-sexual-misconduct-chief-was-promoted-while-facing-harassment-claims","fields":{"headline":"UN sexual misconduct chief was promoted while facing harassment claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The official tasked with tackling sexual misconduct within the United Nations was promoted to her position as undersecretary general for management while subject to a harassment investigation. Jan Beagle, who now leads the UN’s special taskforce on sexual harassment, was investigated over harassment claims last year while working as deputy executive director of UNAids, which spearheads the global fight against HIV and Aids. In September 2017 the UNAids’ executive director, Michel Sidibé, recommended the case be closed following an internal investigation that found the allegations were unsubstantiated. However, the complainant involved in the case, Sima Newell, a former director at UNAids, said her claims had not been properly investigated. Newell has written to the chair of the UNAids programme coordinating board to request that the inquiry be reopened by an external, independent body. Last month it was announced that a separate investigation into sexual harassment and assault claims against another UNAids deputy executive director, Luiz Loures, would be reopened. The investigation into Loures has been widely criticised, with campaigners calling for the resignation of Sidibé over his handling of the case. Though subject to an investigation at the time, Beagle was promoted in June by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, leaving UNAids to become undersecretary general for management across the UN. In November it was announced Beagle would lead the organisation’s high level task-force on sexual harassment, which is charged with improving support for sexual harassment victims and strengthening internal investigations. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, said in a statement that Beagle was fully vetted before her appointment as undersecretary-general for management. “She has the full backing of the secretary general, who very much appreciates her work, especially her leadership of the UN system-wide task force on combating sexual harassment,” he said. While working for UNAids, Beagle led a programme to increase the number of women working in senior positions across the agency. Newell alleges that she was isolated and bullied by Beagle between September 2012 and August 2015. She claims that she was instructed by Beagle not to talk to colleagues, given extreme workloads that set her up to fail, expected to work during leave, and says responsibility for her performance management was delegated to a more junior colleague. Newell said she was subsequently signed off work for burn-out due to professional stress, for the first time in her 18-year career at the UN. Beagle vigorously denied that she had harassed or acted unfairly towards Newell. She said in a statement that that the investigation had been thorough and had found all the allegations to be unsubstantiated. “These allegations … have all been found to be unsubstantiated, as is clearly indicated in the confidential report from the external investigation concerning the case. This investigation included review of hundreds of pages of documentation and extensive interviews of a wide range of individuals, on which basis the investigation determined unequivocally that Ms Newell’s claims against me and other colleagues were unfounded,” she said. In a letter to the UNAids programme coordinating board, Newell, who worked for UNAids for almost a decade, said her allegations had not been fairly investigated and that she had lost her job after submitting a complaint. Newell claimed her contract was terminated with two working days’ notice, while she was on sick leave with work-related stress. The inquiry, and her subsequent treatment by UNAids, was marked by numerous failings, said Newell, including: “Sidibé’s and the senior ethics officer’s failure to recuse themselves when they had conflicts of interest in my case.” She added that a witness statement supporting her allegation had been ignored, and that not all witnesses she suggested had been interviewed, nor all allegations investigated. Newell is appealing against the investigation’s findings, and its handling, in a case before the administrative tribunal of the International Labour Organization. She has put a case to the global board of appeals at the World Health Organization and also to the WHO’s administrative committee on compensation claims. In documents related to the appeal cases, Newell said the UNAids ethics officer, who is tasked with offering protection to people for reporting misconduct, could not make an unbiased decision about her case because he reported to Beagle. She argued that Sidibé’s position as the final decision-maker in her inquiry was also compromised because he had been wrongly informed by the UNAids senior ethics officer that Newell had also made a complaint about him. In her letter to the chair of the UNAids programme coordinating board, Newell wrote: “following nearly a decade of exemplary performance at UNAids, UNAids executive director Michel Sidibé summarily demoted me into a position with a lower reporting line and no responsibility; this new post was then abolished nine months later”. She added that Sidibé later overruled the recommendations of an internal UNAids panel, which suggested Newell be posted to an alternative position in Geneva. Newell said she was instead instructed to relocate to Johannesburg, even though Sidibé knew such a move was impossible for her and her family. Sidibé has also faced criticism over his role in a recent investigation into Loures. The complainant in the case, Martina Brostrom, has alleged that Sidibé attempted to bribe her to drop her complaint by offering a promotion. Sidibé has denied the claim, but admitted to WHO investigators that he had met with Brostrom to suggest they “see how we can really find a way out without making it a big problem for all the organisation and for the credibility of the organisation, for yourself”. In her letter to the UNAids programme coordinating board, Newell asked for her claims she that has been retaliated against by the UNAids leadership to be investigated by an independent, external body. She has asked to know whether the secretary general was informed that there was a pending harassment complaint against Beagle at the time he agreed to her promotion. “If the secretary general is sincere in his position of zero tolerance, he will also suspend Ms Beagle from leading any functions in this regard; and he should suspend Ms Beagle during the course of the external investigation,” she added. UNAids declined to comment on the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/27/broken-record-rees-mogg-brexit-get-thee-to-that-monastery","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T16:59:30Z","webTitle":"You're a broken record, Rees-Mogg.

Get thee to that monastery","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At the very end of his central London speech to mark a year to go till Brexit day, Jacob Rees-Mogg mentioned that he’d considered going to a Trappist monastery in Leicestershire if the UK had voted to stay in the European Union. If only he’d told us that before the referendum, the outcome might have been very different. Anything to shut him up. Even if it was only for half an hour or so. The Tory MP and chair of the European Research Group is rapidly becoming a broken record. An increasingly isolated figure talking to fewer and fewer people about exactly the same things. For his latest outing there were just a handful of Brexit survivalists and his mother. Before long, he’ll be talking to himself in an empty room. Rees-Mogg puts a lot of work into being Rees-Mogg. No one presents themselves as a relic from the 18th century by accident. His trademark pin-striped suits, his neatly combed, schoolboy haircut and his unfailing good manners are all part of a carefully cultivated image. One designed to draw attention to himself. Behind the fogeyish carapace is a thoroughly modern politician on the make. What’s missing is any real sense of self-awareness. He can give the performance and he can deliver the expected soundbites. He is nothing if not an entertainer. His tragedy is that the joke increasingly looks as if it might be on him. While he contentedly draws a few laughs by referring to remainers as cave dwellers, he is apparently oblivious to the fact that it is him who is getting left behind. His red, white and blue Brexit is slipping away from him and there’s nothing he can do about it. Rather, he prefers to exist in a state of denial. One where memories are reshaped to fit his own narrative. Joining the Common Market was a momentary act of weakness prompted by our feelings of inadequacy over Suez. The fact that the country finally voted to leave the EU was a sign that Britain’s “indigenous people” had finally cast aside their sense of inferiority. Global Britain had seldom been made to sound more like Little Britain. Everything is recast as a triumph of taking back control. That Britain was able to make a strong response to Russia over the attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal was purely down to the fact that we had had the courage to leave the EU. Had we voted to remain, then we’d merely have invited the Kremlin to come on over and knock off as many of their expats as they wanted. Come to think of it, we’d have probably saved them the bother and got one of our own spooks to do their dirty work for them. Just send us a list. Wet Jobs R Us. And the only reason, other EU countries had chosen to back us was because they were in awe of our newfound independence. The idea of international cooperation, of achieving something through membership of the EU, was dismissed out of hand. Yet for someone so sure of Britain’s natural place at the head of the world order, Rees-Mogg was surprisingly reluctant to put it to the test. He enthused about the glories of the British bicameral legislature but didn’t sound at all keen that parliament might be given a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. Similarly, though he was certain that a second referendum would result in leave “winning by a mile”, he was in no hurry for that to happen. In case, we looked a bit like Ireland or Denmark. Towards the end there was just a hint that the mask had slipped and shards of reality were allowed to surface. He admitted all his red lines had been ignored in the transitional Brexit deal, offered no solution to the Northern Ireland border, and only had empty threats for Theresa May if she failed to deliver a final deal that was to his liking. His mouth opened and shut but no meaningful words came out. Perhaps that Trappist monastery was still a viable option after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/a-letter-to-a-husbands-girlfriend","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T05:45:05Z","webTitle":"A letter to... my husband’s girlfriend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/a-letter-to-a-husbands-girlfriend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/a-letter-to-a-husbands-girlfriend","fields":{"headline":"A letter to... my husband’s girlfriend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I hope this doesn’t come as too much of a shock, this letter from your boyfriend’s wife.

Set boundaries – dogs are pack animals and need to know who’s in charge. So, if you don’t want a dog on the furniture, or in your bed, never allow the puppy upstairs or on the sofa. Nip behaviours you don’t want in the bud – fast. Teach your puppy to play the games you want, when you want, and with toys that you control. Raising a pup requires work and time – it’s not only throwing balls on a walk – but it’s fantastically rewarding when you end up with a beautifully behaved and much-loved dog.

Wylie told a select committee that the pro-Brexit campaign had a “common plan” to use the network of companies to get around election spending laws and said he thought there “could have been a different outcome had there not been, in my view, cheating”. “It makes me so angry, because a lot of people supported leave because they believe in the application of British law and British sovereignty. And to irrevocably alter the constitutional settlement of this country on fraud is a mutilation of the constitutional settlement of this country.” Vote Leave has repeatedly denied allegations of collusion or deliberate overspending. When they first surfaced over the weekend, Boris Johnson, who fronted the campaign, said: “Vote Leave won fair and square – and legally. We are leaving the EU in a year and going global.” Wylie, who used to work for Cambridge Analytica, gave evidence in a nearly four-hour session before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. He made a string of remarkable claims about Brexit and Cambridge Analytica, including that his predecessor, Dan Mursean, died mysteriously in a Kenyan hotel room in 2012 after a contract in the company turned sour. Wylie said it was striking that Vote Leave and three other pro-Brexit groups – BeLeave, which targeted students; Veterans for Britain, and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party – all used the services of the little-known firm Aggregate IQ (AIQ) to help target voters online. He told MPs that AIQ was effectively the Canadian arm of Cambridge Analytica/SCL, deriving the majority of its income by acting as a sub-contractor. He said AIQ had also worked with Cambridge Analytica on a failed campaign to discredit Muhammadu Buhari in the Nigerian presidential election, which included hacking into his emails and spreading disinformation via Islamophobic videos that showed people “with their throats being cut”. “So, the first question that I have is: why?,” Wylie said. “Why is it that all of a sudden this company, that has never worked on anything but Cambridge Analytica projects, that had no public presence, somehow became the primary service provider to all of these supposedly independent and different campaign groups. “When you look at the accumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to come to any other conclusion: this must be coordination, this must be a common purpose plan.” Wylie was speaking after it was alleged that Vote Leave had broken electoral law by donating £625,000 to BeLeave, which in turn spent the money on Aggregate IQ. Vote Leave officially spent £6.77m, just below the £7m limit, but if BeLeave’s spending was taken into account it would breach that limit. The allegations of collusion and overspending were also discussed by MPs in the Commons during an emergency debate attended by only a few Conservative MPs. Having secured the debate, the Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake asked in his opening speech whether the government could be confident that nobody from Vote Leave who now worked for the Conservatives was going to be charged with electoral offences. Tory MPs interjected to ask him whether he could be sure the remain campaign had not overspent. Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, said the Electoral Commission needed to have all the resources and power available to complete its inquiry into spending by Vote Leave, and referenced the roles of Johnson and Michael Gove in its campaign. “It’s because the government is in it up to its neck,” he said. “Two cabinet ministers fronted the organisation. There they sit, week after week, the Bonnie and Clyde of Brexit.” Trickett said that, if necessary, the police should also investigate the allegations. Chloe Smith, the minister with responsibility for electoral law, said she would not comment on the allegations while they were under investigation. She said, however, that the Electoral Commission had the resources it needed, and was set to underspend on its budget this year. AIQ has denied it is linked to Cambridge Analytica. Jeff Silvester, its chief operating officer, told the Times Colonist, that “AggregateIQ has never been, and is not a part of, Cambridge Analytica or [its parent firm] SCL. AggregateIQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.” However, Wylie told MPs that, while technically true, the corporate structures were designed to be confusing and ensure that regulators could not always keep up with what was going on. Wylie said he was surprised that Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, had discovered AIQ, which did not have its own website. He said he had one meeting with Cummings in late 2015, when he made an unsuccesful pitch for work. “Data was really important for Dom,” Wylie said, noting that Cummings was aware of both Cambridge Analytica and its principal backer, Robert Mercer, a rightwing US hedge fund billionaire and Donald Trump supporter. Cummings responded during the hearing by writing in a blogpost that Wylie was a “fantasist-charlatan”. When put to Wylie by a member of the committee, Chris Matheson, Wylie said his evidence had been “fact checked by the Guardian, the Observer, the New York Times, Channel 4 News and the ICO [the Information Commissioner’s Office]”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/29/the-titan-review-unexciting-netflix-sci-fi-squanders-its-premise","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T00:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Titan review – unexciting Netflix sci-fi squanders its premise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/29/the-titan-review-unexciting-netflix-sci-fi-squanders-its-premise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/29/the-titan-review-unexciting-netflix-sci-fi-squanders-its-premise","fields":{"headline":"The Titan review – unexciting Netflix sci-fi squanders its premise","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sam Worthington, the 41-year-old Australian actor, has become something of a sci-fi mainstay. And despite his unimpeachably good looks, directors keep turning him into aliens, or quasi-human hybrids, or terminators. Most recently, in the new Netflix release The Titan, Worthington plays a military man who’s subject to an insane government-funded genetic experiment, causing him to lose his hair, shed his skin, and acquire, among other strange metamorphoses, bat DNA. By the end of the film, he looks a lot like his character in Avatar, in other words far from the chiseled handsome actor he actually is. I have an idea why he seems to constantly be utilized – effaced, really – in such a way, and it’s because Sam Worthington is perhaps the blandest actor alive. This isn’t an undiscovered thesis. A Google search for “Sam Worthington Boring” fetches some 250,000 results. But Worthington’s staleness, his mesmerizing aversion to evincing even the slightest interest in the script at hand or his fellow actors in frame, is especially startling in The Titan, directed by Lennart Ruff (his first feature) and co-starring Taylor Schilling of Orange is the New Black. Worthington and Schilling are Rick and Abigail Janssen, a husband and wife with a young son. The year is 2048, and due to overpopulation and an unexplained nuclear event that leaves Los Angeles uninhabitable, the family is relocated to a large, seaside Nato base, where Rick and other servicemen and women become the unassuming lab rats in an elaborate, $300m research experiment headed by a state-sanctioned quack scientist (the menacing Tom Wilkinson). The plan, the Janssens believe, is to administer various injections that will allow the subjects to populate Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a nitrogen-heavy atmosphere sufficient to accommodate humans. Instead of “trying to shape climate in our image”, says the scientist, they are “evolving humanity into the stars”. What the subjects don’t know is that these experiments, which include military-style training overseen by the Department of Defense, will soon cause them to sprout gills, go blind, and, in some cases, barbarically kill their spouses in a kind of steroidal rage. Schilling, consigned to the role of Concerned and Suspicious Wife, watches fearfully as her husband mutates. “There is something alive inside of him,” she says. “He is changing.” In one clumsily symbolic shot, his fingers grow so large and deformed that his wedding ring no longer fits. All the while, the two are living in the super-modern, coastal mansion the DoD put them up in, fraternizing with the other test subjects who are experiencing similar bodily horror. What exactly they’re turning into – a new species called Homo titanians – is mostly concealed until Schilling’s Dr Janssen breaks into the laboratory and finds out for herself. The cat, or rather the alien-amphibian crossbreed, is out of the bag! Imagining The Titan with a lead other than Worthington conjures up only a marginally more compelling film. After all, Janssen is silent for the second half of the movie, so it’s hard to see a Chris Evans or a Michael Fassbender or a Henry Cavill salvaging a film that so spectacularly squanders its premise. The choice of actor wouldn’t fix a tired screenplay (“The last people to try this were the Nazis,” yells one incredulous potential whistleblower) and a series of missed opportunities, including an utterly unexciting climax and far too much fidelity to genre tropes (a looming apocalypse; a eugenics experiment gone awry; the fate of the world resting on the shoulders of one intrepid, happily married man). A more interesting film might focus on how one actually goes about colonizing a moon, instead of ducking its premise for more hackneyed government corruption fodder. A more interesting film might also not star Sam Worthington, who was on the money when he offered this assessment of his performance in Clash of the Titans: “I think I can act fucking better, to be honest.” I hope he’s right, but in view of The Titan, I’m hedging my bets. The Titan is on Netflix from 30 March in most territories and will be released in cinemas in the UK from 13 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/30/between-land-and-sea-review-surfing-documentary-county-clare-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T10:00:18Z","webTitle":"Between Land and Sea review – the brutal beauty of a surfers' paradise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/30/between-land-and-sea-review-surfing-documentary-county-clare-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/30/between-land-and-sea-review-surfing-documentary-county-clare-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Between Land and Sea review – the brutal beauty of a surfers' paradise","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have to admit there is footage in this Irish surfing documentary that gave me a major attack of the collywobbles. One aerial shot of a wetsuit-clad doodle paddling out into an Atlantic wave as tall as a cliff had the same effect on my guts as a decent horror film. Directed by Ross Whitaker, the film charts a year in the life of Lahinch, a surfers’ paradise town on the craggy coastline of County Clare. About a decade ago, big-wave surfers discovered the west coast of Ireland. Lahinch’s waves are particularly ferocious and bring out the poetic streak in surfers. “If you’re in the right spot it feels as still, as calm and as right as anything else,” murmurs one guy, lost in the memory. The film follows a handful of characters. There’s Fergal Smith, a hippy-ish ex-pro who got sick of chasing energy drink sponsors and is now having a crack at organic farming. “I’m mad about growing spuds,” he says cheerfully. Then there are the guys who run surf schools, whose precarious livelihoods depend on the 10-week summer season not being rained off. I would like to have heard more from Lahinch’s non-surfers, who talk about the sudden influx of “big hairy devils” with suntans and surfboards. Back when surfing in Ireland was virtually unheard of, says one, surfers had to scrape the wax off blocks of cheese and melt it down to rub on their boards. But the big draw here for fans is the phenomenal surfing footage, which captures the brutal beauty of the landscape and surfers gliding through waves so powerful they look as if they could snap a person in half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/01/royal-air-force-raf-centenary-born-1918","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T08:15:13Z","webTitle":"Royal Air Force centenary: born amid the thunders of battle - archive, 1918","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/01/royal-air-force-raf-centenary-born-1918","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/01/royal-air-force-raf-centenary-born-1918","fields":{"headline":"Royal Air Force centenary: born amid the thunders of battle - archive, 1918","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 1 April 1918, the RAF was formed, becoming a new branch of the British military. It was created by the merging of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps, ending an old rivalry. Editorial: The Fusion of the Air Services Manchester Guardian, 1 April 1918 To-day the two wings of our Air Service, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service, become one, and an old rivalry, which perhaps was not without its value as a stimulus to both sections, but which lost in confusion much more than it achieved by healthy competition, is ended in a single control and an identity of uniform. The Royal Air Force takes the place of the two branches of the service to which we have been accustomed, and air is represented by a single arm, as land and sea have been. An Air Minister is now responsible for the whole of our offence and defence in one element, as the War Secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty are in the other two. Apart from the use made of aircraft, a great gain should result in the ending of competition between the two branches for the output of the factories, for the needs of the whole front, naval and military, can now be expressed without confusion in the orders given for machines. But in the employment of the planes a limitless vista opens before the Air Minister. The military value of the air bombardment of cities and the slaughter of non-combatants has not yet been shown. But there has been ample evidence of the immense effect of air bombardment that is concentrated, not on a vast area of city roofs, on which it can make proportionately little impression, but upon the relatively few roads, bridges, and railways that supply an enemy front. When General MAUDE had taken Bagdad it was by aeroplanes raining fire on the Turkish army as it poured northward up the Tigris bank that he completed the rout that has put us in secure possession of the whole Bagdad vilayet. And in the present tremendous struggle nothing is more significant than the accounts of the havoc played by our airmen among the dense German reinforcements converging on the front. It is clear that, given enough aeroplanes to pour a massed and continuous fire on the German routes to the battle-line, we could have made the present offensive largely futile. If such an accession to the Air Service is to be achieved, it can only be by a control which shall direct the bulk of our whole air output and effort to vital uses, whether on land or sea. That should be the work of the Ministry which to-day assumes control of a united air force. The Royal Air Force: born amid the thunders of battle The Observer, 31 March 1918 History will appreciate the fact that the Royal Air Force came into being while the greatest battle ever fought was being waged, and that the aerial arm played a greater part than in any previous battle. To-morrow is the date when the members of our Flying Services become Royal Air Force, and drop the designations Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps. The pang of regret natural at the disappearance of these honoured and glorious names will be tempered by the thought that the change really is one for economy and efficiency. Better still, the Royal Air Force will immediately – do we not know it from the events of the past few days? – win fame that will abide with it, an inspiration during the years to come. While it is a truism to speak of “healthy competition,” forces which are competitive, yet doing similar work and having practically the same end in view, are apt to pull in opposite directions and so actually retard progress. Under the old conditions there could be no real unity. While the two Air Services were separate it was necessary for each to possess a complete administration. Thus, there existed two staffs practically identical, and not only in one direction but in many was there a good deal of duplication. The authorities, in appealing to the new Force to effect the fusion without friction, forgetting old jealousies, state that it is desirable that the new uniform should be donned as soon as possible. In this connection a correspondent points out that compliance will bear unfairly upon the pockets of members of the naval branch. Officers of the R.F.C. will not be so much out of pocket. Probably a special grant will be made; but an early announcement to this effect is much to be desired. It is especially hard upon officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, those never having received the officer’s usual kit allowance, and always, moreover, having been on a lower scale of pay. At one important naval air station the change of uniform is being made practically obligatory on all officers by about the end of this week. May one repeat the suggestion made in The Observer a few weeks ago (see below) that the Royal Air Force should adopt the old motto of the Royal Flying Corps, “Per Ardua ad Astra,” unless anyone can suggest a better?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/27/letter-ernest-hecht-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T15:40:46Z","webTitle":"Letter: Ernest Hecht obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/27/letter-ernest-hecht-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/27/letter-ernest-hecht-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Ernest Hecht obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ernest Hecht and I went to the Quintin school in Regent Street, London, (now part of Quintin Kynaston school in Swiss Cottage) in the mid-1940s.

The rebooted Gilmore Girls, for example, was a strangely cold and unlovable affair, while Will &amp; Grace has adapted itself to the modern age in a way that surprised those sceptical that its more neutered 90s incarnation would be at odds with today’s all-out-there confessional times. For a show that took until midway through its second season to even show two men (not lovers, but friends) kissing on the lips, Will &amp; Grace is now bursting with risque gags and political bite, and it’s been a hit. It’s fresh because it has shifted its shape around its original template, and it feels as if there’s a reason for it to exist again. Is the same true for Roseanne? The series first aired 30 years ago, and its working-class comedy was blunt, down-to-earth and honest, particularly when it came to showing the reality of being broke. By the time it ended in 1997, it had collapsed into absurdity, with a self-flagellating final season in which the Conners won millions on the state lottery. There were cameos from Absolutely Fabulous’s Eddy and Patsy, but the last episode revealed the show to be a fiction written by Roseanne as a way of coping with Dan’s death from a heart attack. The old theory that entertainment should be aspirational appeared to have caught up with a show that was so likable because it had resolutely rejected that. There’s no way it could stand in the reboot, so that storyline is quickly dispensed of using similar tricks, with the whole fiasco revealed as an old screenplay languishing in the garage that nobody picked up. “Dan? I thought you were dead,” cracks Roseanne, one of a trickle of in-jokes served up for old fans of the series, which are largely wry, and not too heavy-handed. The humour of the original, and particularly its earlier seasons, is faithfully replicated in that same way. The jokes are cutting, but only in the way that you’d playfully insult a family member. There’s an overall message of acceptance, that most things can be fixed with a conversation and a hug, though there’s enough acidity to cut through any saccharine and simplistic notion that love trumps all. In today’s Roseanne, the family is at war, as much as it can ever be. Ex-cop Jackie voted for “the worst person alive”, and she’s got the pussy hat to prove it. Roseanne and Dan supported Trump because he promised jobs. Barr has discussed her own support for Trump before, and amid much controversy, but the decision to give fictional Roseanne the same political leanings seems as matter-of-fact as the show was in its heyday. And as the Conners’ life plays out, it’s neither better nor worse under the Trump administration. Darlene has returned home because she’s divorced and out of work; Becky is so strapped for cash that she’s attempting to become a surrogate (in a nice nod, for a woman played by Sarah Chalke, who picked up the role of Becky from Lecy Goranson, now back, in 1993). You get the sense that the family’s slide from being broke to really broke began long before the present, but you also get the sense that nothing much is changing. Take the price of medication: “You get half the drugs for twice the price.” It doesn’t begin to touch on race, however, and that’s one of the few points about its political jocularity that jars; perhaps it will address this in episodes to come. Age is a recurring theme, and there’s a vein of sadness drawn from that which provides more heart than the acerbic political back-and-forths. Darlene has not managed to be the writer she hoped she would become. “I thought I could buy a huge house and hold that over your head,” she says, bleakly, of her return home. Dan and Roseanne are getting old, and celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary, and they’re still juggling credit cards to make ends meet. “Do you get points on your credit card?” asks Darlene. “We get threats: is that the same thing?” Roseanne shoots back. There are moments in which the new showrunners Bruce Helford and Whitney Cummings attempt to drag the Conners into the present. There’s a storyline about Darlene’s young son, Mark, who prefers pink leggings and painted nails to plaid shirts and cargo shorts, and Roseanne and Dan have to learn to trust his own sense of who he is. But really, it’s at its most comfortable when it’s playing the old notes. The jokes are dry and scrape the surface of meanness, while never lacking warmth; Becky is as bratty as ever, while Darlene is as vicious, though JD, now a soldier back from a stint in Syria, barely gets a look-in. It all comes together to make this a fine comedy in parts, even good at times, and it’s a relief in many ways that it doesn’t try to be more. Roseanne starts in the US on ABC on 27 March with a UK date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/less-laundry-less-often-how-to-lighten-the-washday-load-on-the-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T02:44:16Z","webTitle":"Less laundry less often: how to lighten the washday load on the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/less-laundry-less-often-how-to-lighten-the-washday-load-on-the-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/less-laundry-less-often-how-to-lighten-the-washday-load-on-the-environment","fields":{"headline":"Less laundry less often: how to lighten the washday load on the environment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The clothes we wash and wear each week might seem unconnected to the growing plastic pollution crisis in our oceans but a sobering truth is emerging. With each wash, synthetic fabrics shed thousands of plastic particles, leading to broad-scale contamination of waterways. Now itappears we’re drinking that plastic, with a study of tap water in various countries finding 83% of samples were contaminated with plastic fibres. Doing the laundry has other environmental implications, too, from the water and power used to the harmful substances hidden in common detergents. A more natural approach to laundry is crucial for the health of humans and the planet, so consider our practical steps on how to make the switch. Buy clothes that won’t shed plastic microfibres When buying new clothing, avoid petroleum-based synthetics including polyester and nylon, which are plastics that shed thousands of microfibres when washed. Too small to be trapped by wastewater treatment plants, these microfibres pollute rivers and oceans – as the University of New South Wales ecologist Mark Browne discovered in a landmark 2011 report. He estimated that about 1,900 individual fibres can be rinsed off one synthetic garment each wash, all of which ends up in our waterways. “Government and industry have been unwilling for many years to support research,” Browne says. “To address this problem, my Benign by Design program is testing some of the solutions, but progress has been slowed by a lack of support. Serious questions need to be asked of the government as to why products that cause pollution and contamination are put on the market with little to no safety testing.” Guppy Friend filter bags, developed in Germany, are an emerging solution to trapping microfibres in laundry loads, but opting for natural fabrics and fibres wherever possible appears to be the best solution for now. Wash less and use natural detergents Up to 25% of each garment’s carbon footprint comes from the way we wash and care for it, according to Fashion Revolution. And nine out of 10 pieces of clothing end up in landfill long before they should, often because over-washing has caused irreparable colour fading, shrinkage and misshaping. One easy solution is doing less laundry less often. Obviously, items such as undies and socks need washing after each wear, but clothes that don’t sit directly on our skin – such as jackets, coats and jeans – can be worn five or more times before needing a wash. Laundry detergents, bleaches and softeners need careful selection, too. Many products contain sodium laurel sulphate and optical brighteners, both skin irritants, as well as artificial fragrances, usually derived from petrochemicals – all of which act as toxins once flushed into our waterways. Most supermarkets now stock more eco-friendly brands. Among the best are Ecostore, Ecover, Seventh Generation and Sonett. Or go completely natural with SoapNuts, the fruit of a wild Nepalese tree. Its shells contain a natural soap called saponin and, after use, the lot can be thrown into compost. But beware of greenwashing, warns the Ecostore founder, Malcolm Rands, who now heads up Fairground in New Zealand. “A massive problem is consumers don’t know who is telling the truth, and claims are not verified by anyone,” he says. “Read the labels, challenge companies to be more transparent and dig deeper to differentiate between the dark- and light-green brands.” Use a low-water washing machine and avoid dry cleaning Gravity is your friend when it comes to low-impact laundry. Front-loading washing machines, which continually tumble clothing upwards before gravity pulls the lot back down into wash water, use far less energy and water while more effectively cleaning clothes. Front-loaders are generally more expensive and have longer wash cycles than top-loading machines, but the investment is worth it. (See this Choice buyers’ guide for more.) Washing in cold water can also reduce energy costs by as much as 80%. Don’t let all that water run straight down the drain. The average Australian household can reuse around 1,500 litres of greywater each week, a boon for gardeners and those keen to save on water bills (though using natural detergents is crucial). Manually bucketing water outside is the cheapest and most DIY option available. Or you can set up a simple diversion system with hoses – but check the federal government’s “your energy savings” website for council guidelines first. Western Australia’s Water Wally has some off-the-shelf options. For heavily soiled or delicate clothes, think twice about dry cleaning. The usual process involves soaking clothes in a harsh perchloroethylene solvent, a probable carcinogen also used as a metal degreaser. And clothes will be returned to you wrapped in plastic. GreenEarth is an alternative non-toxic solvent, made of liquid silicone (essentially liquid sand) and used by eco-friendly dry cleaners, including Brisbane’s Green Dry Cleaners, KC Dry Cleaners in South Australia and Queensland, and Dry Green in Sydney. Even better? DIY with gentle hand washing in cold water using a mild detergent before laying flat on a towel to air dry. Dry your garments the old-fashioned way Australia’s Hills Hoist rotary clothesline remains one of the cheapest and most effective ways to dry clothes. Even when outdoor drying isn’t possible, hanging garments on a clothes horse inside, placed in the sunniest or breeziest room, proves effective. “Drying your clothes on a clothes line is free but if you need a clothes dryer to dry lots of clothes, buy a heat-pump dryer,” says the DoSomething founder, Jon Dee, who began the successful campaign to eliminate phosphates from Australia’s laundry detergents. “Heat-pump dryers cost more upfront but, compared to normal clothes dryers, they save a lot more energy and can save you lots of money on your energy bills.” Federal government figures back that up, suggesting a standard 5kg electric dryer costs about $350 a year when used daily, whereas a heat-pump dryer costs just one-third of that to run. So next time the washing beckons, consider making small steps to help reduce the load on our planet. • Additional research and reporting by Nicole Lutze"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/good-friday-in-flores-secrets-stamina-and-spiritual-devotion","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T22:04:31Z","webTitle":"Good Friday in Flores: secrets, stamina and spiritual devotion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/good-friday-in-flores-secrets-stamina-and-spiritual-devotion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/good-friday-in-flores-secrets-stamina-and-spiritual-devotion","fields":{"headline":"Good Friday in Flores: secrets, stamina and spiritual devotion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Before heading to Flores in eastern Indonesia for an Easter pilgrimage, I didn’t quite know what to expect. Would it be the blood and gore of a Filipino Good Friday stations of the cross with real crucifixions? Or would it include wildcard elements of Indonesia’s animistic past? Or would it be like milder Easter celebrations of my Australian Catholic youth – where the tallest boy in the class dressed like Jesus and dragged a cross that we’d made in woodwork around the town streets? A look at the itinerary filled my heart with terror. There was so much churchgoing that at first I thought there had been some mistake. Good Friday, for example, had us arriving at a church at 6am for the first mass of the day and returning to the hotel at 3.15 the following morning. That is more than 21 hours solid of churchgoing – more in one day, than I had done in the last 21 years. We arrived, like many thousands of Easter pilgrims before us, after a long journey. To get to Larantuka – the Catholic heart of Indonesia – we flew from Australia to Denpasar and then to Kampung in Timor, then five hours by road to Flores in the far east of Indonesia. After that, it was a five-hour journey through a flyblown and tropical landscape, to the township of Larantuka. Situated on a narrow strip of land between the Ile Mandiri volcano and the Flores Strait, it is far from the tourist trail. But, over Easter, this place is heaving. We were in Larantuka to join 6,000 Catholic pilgrims for the religious festival of Semana Santa – a period that begins on Ash Wednesday and reaches its crescendo on Good Friday, the most sorrowful day of the Catholic calendar. As a child, I had observed an Australian Irish Catholic Easter – strict enough with several masses over four days, no meat on Friday and the stations of the cross, but I expected to be subjected to a strong mix of horror and boredom in Indonesia. Accommodation in the town is basic – many families billet pilgrims. We were housed in a rundown hotel that was little more than concrete breezeblock, rooms cell-like, without running water. Arriving late at night on Holy Thursday, on the terrace of the hotel was a strange sight: an Englishman in rumpled white linen and broad brimmed hat, with an expensive camera by his side. It was a throwback to colonial times: Malaya and Maugham, Kipling and gin and tonics fizzing and the ice melting madly in the sun. Later he told me that it was not he who was the strange sight – it was us, an Aussie press pack, used to perhaps more luxury junkets or at least hotels with running water – being told that no, this is where we were staying. “The horror on your faces when you were told about the bucket shower!” he laughed. The heat in Larantuka was almost extreme, brutal and somehow managed to be dry yet humid at the same time. Sweat ran off us in gallons, the sun was fierce and applied itself to the skin like a blowtorch and there was no breeze despite our nearness to the sea. Before we left Australia, we were instructed to pack an all-black outfit for Good Friday – something modest with sleeves to represent the sorrow of the day. According to our guides and our very learned new English friend (ex-BBC by way of the foreign office) the Easter procession has been going for 500 years. Back then, east Flores was on the spice route and became a hotspot for Catholic missionaries. Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam had never reached this far east of the Indonesian archipelago, but thanks to the arrival of Portuguese missionaries, Larantuka is now 90% Catholic compared with around 3% throughout the rest of Muslim-majority Indonesia. Prior to the introduction of Catholicism, Flores was animistic. But one day, in the late 1560s, local legend goes, a statue of a woman washed up on the beach and was found by a local fisherman. Written on the sand was “Renya rosary”. The statue was kept safe in a local temple. A few years later the Portuguese turned up in this part of far eastern Indonesia and recognised the statue as Mary, the mother of Jesus. They claimed the statue was a miracle, although it was likely it came from the wreck of a Portuguese ship. Two more religious statues found their way to the town (in mysterious circumstances) where they remain today. For 500 years, they have been shrouded in cloth and paraded through town each Easter week. These relics form the core of the Semana Santa and were instrumental in turning this part of Indonesia from animistic to Catholic. Pilgrims had begun arriving in town on Wednesday. I met some from as far away as the US and Germany, as well as Catholic Indonesians who worked as domestics abroad in places such as Dubai and Malaysia. The king of Laruntuka, Don Andre III Marthinus Diaz Vieira de Godhinho, opened the doors of the Tuan Ma (Mother Mary) Chapel and on Holy Thursday night, hundreds of devotees flocked to the Senhor Chapel to kiss the “feet” of Jesus and visit the graves of loved ones. The next morning, we started with a starchy breakfast: boiled rice and oven-baked potato chips and tomato pasta – no meat of course. The Good Friday procession began early. All in our black outfits, ready to be bussed into the religious zone, we looked like casually employed waiters at a downmarket function centre. While we managed to be in black, nothing matched; some wore satin, some wore lace, some wore cotton. Our sleeves were at different lengths. Most of us wore hats to ward off the worst of the sun. We joined thousands and thousands of people all in black wearing t-shirts that bore the legend Semana Santa 2017, with the words Tuan ma and a picture of Mary – the gothic script on black making it look like a heavy metal concert t-shirt. In our black clothes we were vectors of the radiant heat. All of us in turn were told to take our hats off – it was disrespectful – particularly if worn in the chapels. “But ... But … sunburn!” By 11am we were all soaked in sweat and dreaming of our terrible hotel – peeling off the black clothes, the cool shock of the bucket shower, the hard bed with its soft pillow. We were following the Semana Santa version of the stations of the cross – which involved the relics shrouded in cloth being taken from one of the eight armidas (stations) to the next. Many of the thousands we were walking with were young – Indonesians in their 20s. On one station we ran along the water’s edge for a good view as the relics (a small casket that contains a rosary) were loaded onto a boat and went out with a crowded flotilla of fishing boats in a sea-borne procession that took 90 minutes to complete. The boatmen still use oars and are followed on the water by pilgrims in smaller boats. Some of the boat drivers were Muslim and we were told by our guides that the two religions coexisted peacefully in the area. But for outsiders such as ourselves, much of what was happening was confusing. Why the black clothes? And what is difference between an armida and the stations of the cross? Why are the statues worshipped? How much animism has mingled with the Catholic rites? What does it all mean? And, after many hours of this, when will it all end? We had two guides, Raphael and Hans, but they could only help us so much. They were reluctant to spill the beans on the ancient rituals because they said it might bring bad luck. They told us information about the mysterious statues was “taboo” and we weren’t allowed to see them or ask questions. Somehow the long, hot day finished and we went back to the hotel for a bowl of boiled rice. But that was only the warm-up for the main event. At night we gathered in the centre of town to continue the procession. This – in terms of aesthetics – the chanting, vestments and solemnity – resembles the Easter processions of Catholic Spain. There are no crucifixions, Filipino style. It’s a family parade. To our surprise, we journalists were to march in the parade alongside the devout, the priests, nuns and the bishops. “My parents would be proud,” I thought, as I took my undeserved place behind a group of Indonesian and east Timorese clergy. It was a weird experience being in the procession: by turns boring, profound, confusing, mesmeric and meditative. It took seven hours to walk the full five kilometres. The streets were treacherous, slick with candle wax in shiny, slippery pools on the ground. The candles themselves were wheeled in trolleys: moving and flickering banks of light. The rhythm of the night was really only known to those who had done this before. We followed, dropping to our knees when everyone else did, chanting some lament when it seemed rude not to. Families lined the street and gravely watched us – their own candles adding to the waxy mess on the road. We saw our English friend at some point – still in white linen – moving swiftly around the crowd with his camera, he gave us a quick wave. There were shrines on the way – paintings of Jesus festooned with fairy lights. The wax on the ground was becoming problematic, the bishops ahead kept stopping for water and eyed us without curiousity. Group of tiny nuns took selfies. Apart from the clergy, the most devout-looking participants were women. Some wore mantillas and wept, not wildly but softly, for hours as the processions wound on through the streets. They let candle wax drip over their hands and fingers and did not remove it. The following day all the wax is collected from streets and remelted to be used for next year’s parade. We skipped ahead to the front of the procession via a waiting vehicle. The head of the procession was an extraordinary sight. There was a woman singing a lament in a blue dress – a stand in for Mary? And sensationally a group of hooded men carrying something on a raised platform. Unfortunately, the hooded men looked like clansmen, in the light of the flickering candles with their white robes, crosses and pointed hats. They were actually local men, penitents who had sinned that year and wanted to repent. Their identity concealed behind their robes, they were both menacing and mesmerising to watch. For me, at some point in the night, time and space fell away. Who knew what was under the shrouds and why it was taboo? The parade itself seemed not a facsimile of Good Friday – or the Good Fridays I had known (boredom and fish fingers for dinner, the video store closed) – but closer to the raw sorrow, pain and horror, and length, of that actual day. The Son of God had been crucified, and it was not an easy death. Even if you do not believe anymore (or perhaps never did), it is worth acknowledging the horror and violence of this particular part of the Bible. The crucifixion is the dark heart of Catholicism from which the grand miracle – resurrection – springs. In Larantuka, Good Friday is given its full emotional and spiritual expression. The sleepless vigil of the night before and the long day in the heat with the prayers and the queueing in the sun. And then the night, endless steps and wailing and tears and men in robes and the thrown shadows of torches and the sorrowful faces, lit by candles that lined the way.

In an interview with the Guardian before flying to London for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, she said there was great fondness for the members of the royal family whenever they visited New Zealand. Although she could not remember the last time a voter had asked her about the country becoming a republic and admitted it was not a priority for her administration, Ardern said New Zealand would eventually transition away from the monarchy. “When I have been asked for an opinion, I think within my lifetime I think it is a likelihood we will transition. It is not something this government is prioritising at all though. “The most important thing for New Zealand is we have a very special arrangement and relationship via our treaty of Waitangi, and the relationship between Maori and the crown, so before any conversation like that occurs, that is something that will need to be resolved within New Zealand.” Ardern also revealed how she was faring as the new leader of her country and how her life had changed since she became prime minister. She said she had been given words of advice from Barack Obama who visited New Zealand for the first time last week. The former US president encouraged her to accept that she was doing her best, and a certain level of guilt came with the territory of running a country. “I ask him how he dealt with guilt,” sayid Ardern, who is expecting her first child in June and spoke to Obama about how he juggled leadership and family life. “He just talked about the things you can do to always do your best, and that there will always be elements [of guilt] in the roles that we do, and probably to a certain degree just accepting that we are still doing our best.” In February it was reported by the BBC that a “high-level group” of Commonwealth leaders met in London to review the governance of member nations and to examine who should take over as head of the Commonwealth when the Queen dies. Ardern said the matter of succession was a decision for the royal family to make. “No one really wants to discuss [succession] because of course we all treasure the leadership globally that is displayed by the Queen, but ultimately that is a decision for the royal family,” Ardern said. Ardern’s chief press secretary said she did not anticipate being invited to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May, as it was largely a ceremony for friends and family. In the interview Ardern highlight a potentially awkward aspect of her fame, being asked for selfies when shopping for underwear. “Certainly life has changed. It is just incredibly busy. But I really value being able to do normal things,” said Ardern. “Getting stopped in the middle of the lingerie section when you’re trying to stock up on a few things by an older man who wants a selfie is a little bit awkward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-border-wall-construction-photo-tweet","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T00:04:05Z","webTitle":"Trump tweets misleading photos suggesting border wall under way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-border-wall-construction-photo-tweet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-border-wall-construction-photo-tweet","fields":{"headline":"Trump tweets misleading photos suggesting border wall under way","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has tweeted pictures of cranes replacing barrier fence along the Mexican border, suggesting his proposed 2,000-mile “wall” was under way. But the pictures in fact show local work on only a two-mile stretch of barrier undertaken last month – before Congress refused to fully fund Trump’s wall in a budget deal he signed recently. “Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday, attaching four photos apparently from the scene of a small barrier replacement project in Calexico, California. Describing the Calexico replacement project last month, the Associated Press reported that “a barrier built in the 1990s from recycled metal scraps and landing mat will be torn down for bollard-style posts that are 30 feet high, significantly taller than existing walls”. Trump’s failure to procure significant funding for his border wall project in a budget deal he signed earlier this month moved his erstwhile conservative ally Ann Coulter to declare: “He’s not giving us what he promised at every single campaign stop.” The deal allotted $1.6bn for the wall, which the Department of Homeland Security has estimated would cost more than $20bn, an estimate that scholars say may be significantly low. With his political base grumbling about broken promises, Trump has been on the defensive since signing the deal. “Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall,” he tweeted at the weekend. “It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately.” Work has not started immediately. Earlier this month Trump visited a site outside San Diego, California, where eight prototypes for the wall had been erected. But Congress has so far denied the president funding for what would be his signature project. Trump asked the House speaker, Paul Ryan, last week about possibly drawing from the Pentagon budget, which was significantly expanded in the recently signed deal, to pay for the wall, but the idea was not greeted warmly, the Associated Press and others reported. During his run for president, Trump told crowds that Mexico would pay for the wall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/05/political-telenovela-peruvians-captivated-by-fujimori-sibling-rivalry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T06:15:41Z","webTitle":"Political telenovela: Peruvians captivated by Fujimori sibling rivalry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/05/political-telenovela-peruvians-captivated-by-fujimori-sibling-rivalry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/05/political-telenovela-peruvians-captivated-by-fujimori-sibling-rivalry","fields":{"headline":"Political telenovela: Peruvians captivated by Fujimori sibling rivalry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Still reeling from the abrupt resignation of its president last month, Peru is now captivated by a new political drama: the sibling rivalry between the children of the former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, as they battle over his controversial legacy. The power struggle between Keiko and Kenji Fujimori has all the intrigue, melodrama, plots twists and cliffhangers of an over-the-top Latin American soap opera or telenovela – and it has Peruvians hanging on the edge of their seats. Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the majority opposition party, played a key role in the toppling of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski , as her party released a series of secretly filmed videos showing his allies offering to buy the votes of opposition lawmakers to avoid impeachment. In releasing the videos, however, she also implicated her brother Kenji and his political allies in the alleged vote-buying, which could see him face criminal charges. He has vowed revenge, and on Friday is due to testify to prosecutors investigating allegations that Keiko received $1.2m in campaign donations from the scandal-plagued Brazilian firm Odebrecht in 2011. The long-simmering sibling rivalry erupted spectacularly – and now threatens to wipe out both their political futures. Keiko, a two-time presidential candidate, tweeted her regret that “her own brother had become involved in practices which had done so much damage to us as Peruvians and as a family”. She was referring to videos which showed her father’s intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos bribing politicians, judges and army chiefs – which ended her father’s decade-long regime in 2000. The former president was jailed in 2009 for authorising death squads, overseeing rampant corruption and vote-rigging. He was pardoned by Kuczynski in December, but his children could both now face criminal charges. Ironically, the father’s pardon may have aggravated the split between the children, said Gustavo Gorriti, a Peruvian journalist who was kidnapped by Fujimori’s regime in the 1990s. “Kenji remains completely faithful to his father and did everything possible to secure his release,” he says. “While Keiko realised it was better that he was in prison.” Thrown into politics aged 19, Keiko became her father’s first lady in 1994 when her parents separated. Now aged 42, a seasoned politician and twice presidential candidate, she cuts a strikingly different image from Kenji, 37. While Keiko is seen as cold and vengeful, Kenji is indulged as a spoilt youngest son, and won the highest number of votes in Congress when he we re-elected in 2016 Styling themselves as The Avengers, Kenji and a band of dissident lawmakers from his sister’s Fuerza Popular party, split the Fujimorista support base by abstaining from an impeachment vote against Kuczynski in December saving him from being ousted. For a while the tactic worked. Kenji, a self-confessed comic-book geek depicted himself as hammer-wielding Thor or dressed in the Bruce Lee-style yellow jumpsuit of the heroine of Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill films. But then, Keiko got her own back entangling Kenji and his group in the incriminating videos. In giving evidence against his sister in the Odebrecht investigation “Kenji has shown he is prepared to go down the kamikaze way, taking his sister with him,” says Gorriti. Facing expulsion from Peru’s congress, Kenji has lost that political capital, says Giovanna Peñaflor, director of pollster Imasen. “By the same token, it’s been a pyrrhic victory for Keiko,” she adds, saying the dirty tactics used in the feud have worn down public sympathy for both siblings. That has done nothing to diminish Peruvians’ fascination with the ongoing Fujimori saga, says Jorge Bruce, a psychoanalyst and newspaper columnist. “Peruvians love telenovelas and this is a real life soap opera,” he says. “We are a Latin American country where family is still what matters above everything else. The Fujimoris are a particularly complicated, dysfunctional family,” he adds. “Years passed by and we are still under the spell of the Fujimori story – which says more about us than it does about them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/29/thursday-briefing-poison-on-the-doorstep","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T05:31:56Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Poison on the doorstep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/thursday-briefing-poison-on-the-doorstep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/29/thursday-briefing-poison-on-the-doorstep","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Poison on the doorstep","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Skripals were probably poisoned at home – police Hello – I’m Warren Murray and here is your summary of the news. The highest levels of novichok have been found around Sergei and Yulia Skripal’s front door, suggesting they were poisoned at the exiled Russian spy’s Salisbury home. Dean Haydon, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing, said: “At this point in our investigation, we believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent from their front door. We are therefore focusing much of our efforts in and around their address … officers are likely be in the area for several weeks and months.” Public health experts are assessing whether there is a long-term risks to the residents of Salisbury, which will receive a £1m support package from central government to help it recover. More than 130 people may have been exposed to the chemical weapon. After around 150 Russian officials were expelled from more than 25 countries, the UK government is considering further measures to punish Moscow including a ban on trading in Russian sovereign debt through London’s financial markets. * * * Brexit warning to EU families – Thousands of EU citizens’ children living in Britain are at risk of losing their right to be in the country after Brexit, immigration experts have warned. Parents from EU countries are being urged to assess their situation and study the rules or risk their children falling victim to “hostile environment” measures in future years. A University of Birmingham projects warns of how these “Eurochildren” are made vulnerable by Brexit. Children born after their parents receive permanent residency in the post-Brexit system should not have problems, but “the damage done by Brexit to children born before that will have a legacy for future generations,” said Nando Sigona, one of the authors. * * * ‘Not in my name’ – Labour’s disputes panel chair, Christine Shawcroft, has resigned citing her “wrong and misguided” initial defence of a candidate who shared antisemitic Facebook posts. The party, meanwhile, is grappling with abuse of members who are accused of using Monday night’s demonstration against antisemitism as cover to attack Jeremy Corbyn. David Lammy, the Tottenham Labour MP, is facing a campaign by by some branch members to deselect him after he attended what they saw as an anti-Corbyn rally. The Labour leader, speaking to the Jewish News, decried the abuse of people who attended. “People have the right to speak out and the right to demonstrate … Any abuse that’s done is not done in my name.” Jewish leaders, though, say Corbyn is still not taking the lead in tackling antisemitism in Labour. * * * Don’t know the ins and outs – Theresa May’s promised system of rigorous exit checks at UK borders is in disarray and officials literally don’t know whether hundreds of thousands of people are coming or going. No exit records exist for 600,000 people who should have left, while more than 201,000 are shown as leaving without ever having come in, according to a report by the chief borders inspector. David Bolt suggested the rollout of the exit checks programme had been left incomplete and it was “wishful thinking” to present it as the solution to illegal immigration. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, called for the rollout programme to be reopened and for the home secretary to be “far more honest about what the programme is delivering and will deliver in the future”. * * * ‘Excuse after excuse’ – Nearly 100 households from the blocks of flats around Grenfell Tower are still in emergency and temporary accommodation more than nine months on from the disaster. In all, only 62 of the 204 displaced households in the tower and surrounds have been found somewhere permanent to live. The housing secretary, Sajid Javid, has admitted it is “unlikely” those remaining will get new permanent homes by 14 June, the one-year anniversary of the fire. “So much more needs to be done to get people moved into safe homes so they can rebuild their lives,” said Shahin Sadafi, chair of the survivors’ group Grenfell United. “We’ve heard excuse after excuse, now we just need some action.” * * * Fast food hormone hazard – Eating out can raise the body’s level of phtalate, a chemical from plastic food packaging that has been linked to asthma, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and fertility issues, a study has found. Phtalates interfere with the body’s hormones – pregnant women, children and teens are more vulnerable to their toxic effects. In the study, phtalate levels were up to 55% higher in adolescents eating burgers, sandwiches and the like from fast-food outlets or restaurants, compared with those eating at home. The study’s lead author, Dr Julia Varshavsky from the University of California at Berkeley, says future studies need to focus on how phtalates can be removed from the food supply.

This is in line with the existing regulatory situation in the different domestic leagues, which does not impose restrictions on eligibility for players registered for a new club during the winter transfer window.” That seems fair enough – Alexis Sánchez is appearing for Manchester United after moving from Arsenal, after all – though it is only part of the truth. While the whole point of the January window is to allow teams to strengthen for the second half of the league season, the old cup-tie rule still applies in the FA Cup. In practice most Premier League teams can get round it, since their FA Cup involvement commences in January and if a transfer is in the offing the player in question need only miss a match, though lower down the league where Cup rounds take place before Christmas it is not at all uncommon for players who move to find themselves cup-tied at their new clubs. So Uefa has picked out the league practice and ignored the cup tradition, which suggests once again that it is trying to push its main event as a league instead of a cup. It could be argued that the Champions League is a league and that the clue is in the title, though it is not quite as simple as that. The Champions League is only a league, and even then only a quasi-league, before Christmas. When it resumes in the new year – ie when any player transfers between club have been made – it is knockout pure and simple. From that point on it resembles a cup, and for anyone who can remember the old European Cup it will always be a cup anyway. The group stages – unbelievably there used to be two of them – were bolted on to what used to be a straightforward contest between champions to pad out the proceedings, milk the television money and appease big clubs who were threatening a breakaway. For all those reasons it is easy to dislike the Champions League, particularly as its undeniable ability to generate wealth for its regular contestants has resulted in a divisive imbalance of aspiration and achievement in domestic competitions, yet it must also be admitted that once all the fluff is out of the way, the present structure can deliver in a way the old European Cup rarely managed. Next week’s last eight fixtures are a case in point. With the possible exception of Sevilla, who will not be expecting Bayern Munich to approach their games as timidly as Manchester United did, there is not a weak link in sight. Juventus v Real Madrid is a repeat of last season’s final, Barcelona v Roma pits La Liga’s leaders against third in Serie A, while Liverpool v Manchester City brings together two managers who have reached the final and the two Premier League sides who have arguably (sorry Spurs) provided most excitement this season. The old European Cup, though much-loved, did not do that. With only one team per country and an unseeded draw too much was left to chance, and the best ties would often come in early rounds rather than in the later stages. The first meeting of Premier League clubs in the knockout phase since Manchester United defeated Chelsea in the quarter-final in 2011 will inevitably overshadow this weekend’s domestic fixtures. Jürgen Klopp has complained about having to meet Everton in the early kick-off the following weekend, a lunch-time Merseyside derby not being considered ideal for rest and recuperation between the two legs against City, though given Liverpool’s record against Crystal Palace they probably need to fully concentrate on this Saturday’s early kick-off first. The Liverpool manager’s point was slightly undermined by the consideration that City also have a derby between the two legs of the quarter-final, and by the time they face Manchester United they could be in a position to clinch the league title. That rather depends on their next result; City have the late kick-off on Saturday and it takes them to Everton, the only side, albeit under a different manager, to have taken any Premier League points from the Etihad this season. So, either side of pitting their wits against each other in a Champions League quarter-final with its promise of planting a Premier League flag in Europe’s last four, both Klopp and Pep Guardiola have to deal with Sam Allardyce. Even when its head is in the clouds English football always seems to find a way of keeping its feet on the floor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/28/chelsea-montpellier-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T21:37:00Z","webTitle":"Fran Kirby leads way as Chelsea reach first Champions League semi-finals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/28/chelsea-montpellier-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/28/chelsea-montpellier-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Fran Kirby leads way as Chelsea reach first Champions League semi-finals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea Ladies were only just finding their feet as a serious force when an English team last won the Women’s Champions League, 11 years ago. Now, for the first time in their history they are in the semi-finals after they beat Montpellier 3-1 on the night, 5-1 on aggregate. Two goals from Fran Kirby and one by Ramona Bachmann secured a scoreline that was not quite as convincing as it looked. Chelsea were certainly made to scrap for the victory by a Montpellier side who attacked with purpose but found a doughty defence, marshalled by the excellent Millie Bright, in their way and refusing to budge. The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, was a coach at Arsenal when they won this tournament, then known simply as the Uefa Women’s Cup, in 2007. Now she leads one of two English teams in the last four, after Manchester City had booked their place by thrashing Linköping earlier in the day. “For so long we’ve been told that English clubs can’t do it, because it’s about the French and German sides, but this is a proud day for Chelsea and Manchester City,” said Hayes. “We’re no longer second-class in Europe.” Hayes said she demanded a fast start and that is exactly what she got. By the fourth minute they had added to their 2-0 lead from the first leg after Kirby, who Hayes described as “the best English attacker by a country mile”, intercepted a groggy pass from Sakina Karchaoui deep in the Montpellier half and sped through on goal. “It’s probably every striker’s worst nightmare when you’ve got so much time,” Kirby said. If she was having nightmares, it did not show as she tucked a neat finish into the bottom corner. Aside from that strike, Montpellier were the more threatening side in the early stages. Chelsea keeper Hedvig Lindahl made a few solid saves, Valérie Gauvin skimmed a shot just past the post and Katie Chapman had to head off the line following a corner. Hayes’s side were in the curious position of being ostensibly comfortable in the tie but looking vulnerable in the game. Montpellier did find the net in the 37th minute. The former Chelsea midfielder Sofia Jakobsson collected the ball on the right of the area, looked around for options then hit the ball almost for lack of anything else to do. She will presumably claim it was a shot, it could have been a cross, but it was certainly a goal, looping over Lindahl and into the net. The French side started the second half on the front foot again but five minutes after the break Chelsea regained the lead on the night, Kirby threading a perfect pass through to Bachmann, who guided the ball nervelessly into the corner. Chelsea required more hearty defending thereafter but made the tie safe with 13 minutes left. Ji So-yun jinked into the area, was taken down by Linda Sembrant and Kirby tucked the penalty away, fully earning her standing ovation when she was taken off a few minutes later. There is a friendly rivalry between Chelsea and City – Hayes said she would text congratulations to their manager Nick Cushing – but the possibility of them reprising their domestic duels in Europe is a delicious one. “It’s massive that two English teams have made it through,” said Kirby. “Hopefully it’ll be a Chelsea v City final.” First though, it is Wolfsburg in the semi-final, no small task given the Germans have knocked them out of Europe in the last two seasons, while City take on the holders, Lyon. Not that they seem cowed by that. “I’m not afraid of them, so let’s go, let’s bring it on,” said Hayes, who is expecting twins in June. “Hopefully I don’t give birth pitchside.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/28/skripals-poisoned-from-front-door-of-salisbury-home-police-say","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T19:49:08Z","webTitle":"Skripals poisoned from front door of Salisbury home, police say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/skripals-poisoned-from-front-door-of-salisbury-home-police-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/skripals-poisoned-from-front-door-of-salisbury-home-police-say","fields":{"headline":"Skripals poisoned from front door of Salisbury home, police say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Detectives investigating the attempted murders of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal have said they believe the pair were poisoned with a nerve agent at the front door of his Salisbury home. Specialists investigating the poisoning of the the Skripals have found the highest concentration of the nerve agent on the front door at the address, police said. Counter-terrorism detectives will continue to focus their inquiries on the home address for the coming weeks, and possibly months, after the father and daughter were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury earlier this month. Local police have retaken control of The Maltings shopping centre, where the Skripals were first discovered, and London Road cemetery from counter-terrorism detectives, where officers focused their investigation into the nerve agent attack in previous weeks. More than 130 people could have been exposed to the chemical weapon in the aftermath of the poisoning in Salisbury, which the UK government believes was committed by the Russian state. In response to the poisoning, more than 150 Russian officials have been expelled from more than 25 countries, and the UK government is considering further measures to punish Russia, including a ban on the City of London from selling Russian sovereign debt. Public health experts are still working to establish whether the nerve agent attack presents a long term risks to Salisbury’s residents, which will receive a £1m support package from central government to help recover. Deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing, said: “At this point in our investigation, we believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent from their front door. “We are therefore focusing much of our efforts in and around their address. Those living in the Skripals’ neighbourhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low and our searches are precautionary. “I’d also like to thank the local community for their continued support and understanding. The unique circumstances of this investigation means that officers are likely be in the area for several weeks and months.” About 250 counter-terrorism detectives continue to work around the clock on the investigation, supported by a full range of experts and partners. Officers continue to trawl through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and examine more than 1,350 exhibits that have been seized. Approximately 500 witnesses have been identified and hundreds of statements taken. Traces of the nerve agent have been found at some of the other scenes detectives have been working at over the past few weeks, but at lower concentrations than that found at the home address."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/28/gareth-southgate-dele-alli-england-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T21:30:13Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate tells Dele Alli he is not a shoo-in to start for England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/28/gareth-southgate-dele-alli-england-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/28/gareth-southgate-dele-alli-england-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate tells Dele Alli he is not a shoo-in to start for England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate has warned Dele Alli it will not be easy to win back his position in the England team because of the competition for places before the World Cup. The Tottenham player featured for only 22 minutes of the past two friendlies. Southgate intends to select his preliminary squad on 14 May, the day after the Premier League season ends, and confirmed that he was nearing a final decision regarding the strikers and attacking midfielders. Alli is assured of a place, injuries permitting, but the manager has slightly modified his system in the past two games and the player did not get off the bench in the 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday. “I have a problem because I have Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jamie Vardy so there is a huge choice,” Southgate said. “I don’t foresee a scenario where any of those players don’t come to Russia but I have to make those decisions. There is no reason he [Alli] will not come and he can make a huge impact there. He has the ability and I am looking forward to seeing him over the next few weeks.” Alli, according to Southgate, was “disappointed” by his omission but the manager also said that Kane’s return from injury would be another influence at the World Cup because of the understanding between the two Spurs players. Alli was nursing a very minor groin injury during England’s training sessions but this is the first time since establishing himself in the national side that he has dropped out of the team and the manager was encouraged by the way Raheem Sterling adapted to a central attacking role. Southgate said: “It was nice to see because if we play 3-4-3 we know Raheem can play the No 10 role, as he did against France last year, but could he play as one of two forwards when he usually plays on the wing for Manchester City? We know he likes playing through the middle and his performance reminded me of that little spell at Liverpool where he was behind Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge, running and dribbling through the middle of the park.” Southgate is also an admirer of Adam Lallana but the manager said the decision to leave out Alli was not an attempt to make the Spurs player knuckle down in the final weeks of the season. “We want competition for places but there was no ulterior motive to leaving him out. We wanted to look at Raheem again but Dele is still an important player for us. He is in the mix.” England have friendlies against Nigeria at Wembley on 2 June and Costa Rica in Leeds five days later. In the meantime, Southgate intends to maintain a regular dialogue with his players and is mindful that those who do not go to the World Cup should be let down gently. “There are some who have worked with us for quite a while and know they will be part of the squad. There are others who know, after the conversations I’ve had with them, that they are on the edge of it. “It’s important that it doesn’t come as a huge surprise to anybody. I’ve got to keep those conversations going over the next few weeks – letting people know how I see it, so in the end it doesn’t come dramatically to anyone.” Southgate has had one such conversation with Joe Hart now that the goalkeeper has fallen behind Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland in the England set-up. “I’ve been really straight with him throughout. I spoke to him three weeks ago before he was back in West Ham’s team and told him he would be in the squad on the basis of what he had done for us before. He’s a good leader to have around and he’s understood everything completely. He’s played that [back-up] role really well.” Lallana confident he can make World Cup mark Adam Lallana has declared himself fit and ready to make a mark over the run-in to Liverpool’s season to prove he warrants significant involvement at the World Cup. The midfielder has been restricted to 375 minutes of club football this term, and a solitary Premier League start, after a thigh injury last summer. He played the last half-hour of Tuesday’s draw with Italy. “I’m fully fit now,” Lallana said. “I had to manage myself for the first couple of days [of the England get-together], hence why I wasn’t involved over in Holland. It was just great to be back out there in an England shirt for the first time since last summer. I’m smart enough not to be complacent and to know there are plenty of talented players that want to make sure they are picked, even lads who weren’t with us this month. But I’m confident enough in my ability and what I bring to the squad. “Now it’s just about getting that rhythm, which means gaining minutes out on the pitch playing competitive football. There is plenty of time between now and the end of the season. I’m physically and mentally as fresh as anyone going into the back end of the season and going into the World Cup.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-lawyer-presidential-pardon-flynn-manafort-mueller","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T19:35:35Z","webTitle":"Trump lawyer discussed presidential pardons for Flynn and Manafort – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-lawyer-presidential-pardon-flynn-manafort-mueller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/trump-lawyer-presidential-pardon-flynn-manafort-mueller","fields":{"headline":"Trump lawyer discussed presidential pardons for Flynn and Manafort – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of Donald Trump’s lawyers discussed the possibility of presidential pardons for two former aides as the special counsel Robert Mueller built cases against them in his investigation into Russian election meddling, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, eventually made a deal with Mueller, pleading guilty to lying to the FBI in exchange for cooperation. Trump’s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, maintains his innocence on charges including money laundering and tax and bank fraud. Two other former Trump advisers, the foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos and Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates, have entered plea deals. The Times said John Dowd, who resigned as head of Trump’s legal team last week, discussed potential pardons with lawyers representing Flynn and Manafort. Such discussions could raise questions regarding the obstruction of justice, the paper said, although it said there was no evidence Dowd had broached the subject with Trump. Citing three anonymous sources, the Times also said Trump had asked aides about the extent of his pardoning power. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment. The White House denied the report. Dowd told the Times: “There were no discussions. Period. As far as I know, no discussions.” At the daily press briefing, the White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders repeatedly referred to a statement from Trump’s attorney Ty Cobb. “I have only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or under consideration at the White House,” Cobb told the Times. Dowd resigned shortly after calling for the Mueller investigation to be shut down and having to clarify that he was not speaking for the president. Sanders said she was not “aware of any specific actions” Dowd may have taken that may have displeased the president. Trump has struggled to appoint new lawyers to his team dealing with the Mueller inquiry. Sanders also repeated Trump’s denial of collusion with Russia in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 election in his favour. It has been reported that Mueller, who has also indicted 13 Russian nationals, is concentrating on whether Trump has attempted to obstruct justice. Mueller was appointed after Trump fired James Comey as director of the FBI, a move the president told NBC was made in part because of “this Russia thing” and which Comey has testified came after the president pressed him to drop an investigation of Flynn. Mueller is also reported to be interested in the president’s role in drafting a misleading statement about a meeting between aides including Donald Trump Jr, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Manafort, and Russians promising compromising information on Hillary Clinton at Trump Tower in June 2016. On Wednesday afternoon George Conway, the husband of Trump’s aide Kellyanne Conway who was considered for the role of solicitor general, said of the Times story: “This is flabbergasting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/morning-mail-assange-cut-off-from-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T20:06:23Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Assange cut off from the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/morning-mail-assange-cut-off-from-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/morning-mail-assange-cut-off-from-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Assange cut off from the world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 29 March. Top stories Ecuador has cut Julian Assange’s communications with the outside world at its London embassy, where the WikiLeaks founder has been living for nearly six years. The Ecuadorian government said it had cut internet access because Assange had breached “a written commitment made to the government at the end of 2017 not to issue messages that might interfere with other states”. His behaviour on social media “put at risk the good relations [Ecuador] maintains with the United Kingdom, with the other states of the European Union, and with other nations”. Assange tweeted on Monday challenging Britain’s accusation that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in Salisbury. He also questioned the decision by the UK and more than 20 other countries to retaliate by expelling Russian diplomats. Ecuador cut Assange’s internet access in October 2016 amid fears he was using it to interfere in the US presidential election. The newly installed South Australian independent senator, Tim Storer, says he isn’t about backroom horse-trading but a boost to the Newstart payment is a key objective of his period in federal politics. In a broad-ranging interview with Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, the economist says he wants to promote “prosperity and fairness”. This week Storer forced the government to hit pause on its vaunted big business tax cut, refusing to sign on until the Coalition countenanced broader reform. A majority of Australians would support phasing out coal power by 2030, including half the people in a sample identifying as Coalition voters, according to a survey by a progressive thinktank. The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The alliance is not legally binding, and its membership does not include major coal exporters and users. The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia’s partisan divide for signing on. A single mothers’ group says IT outages affecting the government’s child support agency are creating anxiety, confusion and fears that payments may not be made before Easter. Pluto, the multibillion-dollar system designed to administer child support payments, has experienced significant problems. The Community and Public Sector Union said the system had been inoperative for four days and was still unstable. The government said there had only been “intermittent issues, which have been resolved”. Scientists at Australia’s leading marine science agency say an attack on the integrity of their research into threats to the Great Barrier Reef was flawed and based on “misinterpretation” and “selective use of data”. The Australian Institute of Marine Science researchers have responded to accusations made in November in the Marine Pollution Bulletin that claimed much of their work “should be viewed with some doubt”. In November Piers Larcombe, an industry consultant affiliated with the University of Western Australia, and Peter Ridd, of James Cook University in Queensland, claimed there was a lack of “quality control” in marine science. The pair claimed to have identified flaws in nine scientific papers. An Aims scientist, Britta Schaffelke, says she led the response to the criticism because: “We wanted to set the record straight. We have laid out clearly where we disagree and how the initial findings still hold.” Sport Steve Smith and David Warner have been banned for a year after the ball-tampering crisis, with Cameron Bancroft banned for nine months. Warner was revealed as the architect of Australia’s plot, about which Cricket Australia said: “Cheating probably an appropriate word.” Marina Hyde has analysis on a very modern cricket crisis, while Ben Smee says Smith owes an apology to his mother. With the second season of AFLW wrapped up, some think it’s a good time to propose rule changes in an attempt to improve the “spectacle” of women’s footy. This is pure folly, writes Kate O’Halloran, and, if the league moves to dilute its women’s product, it risks losing more young girls to other codes.

The Guardian has compiled a foolproof etiquette guide for being a good host – and an ever better guest. Quick tips? Arrive late and bring more booze than you need. The latest Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage shows the discrepancy of wealth across Australia. “Across the 26 seats the ALP holds with more than 60% of the two-party-preferred vote, there is a skew towards the lower ends of socioeconomic advantage,” writes Greg Jericho, adding: “But the skew in the safe LNP seats is much more obvious and much more at the other end of the scale. Nearly half of residents in 31 safe Liberal party seats are in the top 30% of advantage.” Which partly reveals why the Labor party’s policies are finding more traction within the electorate than those of the Coalition.

In a statement to the stock market, Conviviality said investors had refused its request for £125m of new money, which it needs to stave off bankruptcy after a string of shock profit warnings. Directors are still seeking a buyer for all or part of the business, but Conviviality is facing the prospect of going into administration, which is likely to be managed by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The trade body for the UK’s pubs, more than 20,000 of which are supplied by the company’s Matthew Clark distribution division, warned many could now face “short-term supply issues”. “Despite a significant number of meetings with potential investors resulting in good levels of demand, and constructive discussions with a number of key customers and suppliers regarding the provision of support, there was ultimately insufficient demand to raise the full £125m,” the company said. “The board wish to thank its customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support during this difficult period for the company. “The company is in discussions with its lending banks and advisers regarding other possible options and is in receipt of a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts [of] the business.” The company, which has annual sales of £1.6bn, said its shareholder were likely to receive “little-to-nil” value for their shares, which have been suspended on the junior AIM stock market since 14 March. Despite reporting strong sales and profits in recent trading updates, Conviviality was plunged into turmoil after a string of profit warnings issued earlier this month that saw its shares suspended. The company blamed the first profit warning on a erroneous calculation made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins. It later admitted it had not budgeted for a £30m tax bill. Conviviality’s chief executive, Diana Hunter, stepped down after City analysts criticised the company’s financial controls and processes. The firm is a major player in the UK drinks industry, supplying more than 700 off-licences and serving more than 23,000 pubs and restaurants including the JD Wetherspoon chain, via its Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association said: “We are working with our members to assess the impact of the ongoing issues with Conviviality who, through Matthew Clark, are significant suppliers to the pub trade. “Alternative suppliers will be sought in order to minimise the impact on the trade as far as possible, but inevitably a situation like this will likely cause short term supply issues for pubs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/29/joe-dyrlaga-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T13:51:37Z","webTitle":"Joe Dyrlaga obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/29/joe-dyrlaga-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/29/joe-dyrlaga-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Joe Dyrlaga obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Jozef Dyrlaga, who has died aged 94, was one of thousands of displaced Poles who came to Britain after the second world war for the chance of a new life. Finding work as a coalminer, a job he continued until his retirement, Joe became an honorary Yorkshireman and a lover of everything his adoptive county had to offer. Born in Cięcina, in the mountains near the Czech border, to Karol Dyrlaga, an electrical engineer, and Katerzyna (nee Gluza), a homemaker, he grew up in relative poverty; the family of nine lived in a wooden house with the Catholic church at the centre of their life. He went to the Gymnasium school in Żywiec, where he developed a love of history and learning, but the war cut his education short and he was taken away as forced labour to Germany, working under harsh conditions on a farm. Returning to Poland after the war, he was reunited with his family, but following an altercation with a soldier from the occupying Soviet army he was forced to flee to Germany, eventually reaching the American sector. In a displaced persons camp in Ingolstadt, near Munich, he was employed as a civilian guard in the US army and received the education he had missed. Arriving in the UK in 1947, Joe was given a choice of working on a farm or down the mines; he chose the latter, first in Scotland and then in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. His overriding desire to become British enabled him to settle quickly, aided by his marriage to Elsie Bould, a factory worker he met in 1952 in a cinema queue. Joe became a working-class northerner with a distinctive Polish-Yorkshire accent peppered with the use of “love”. He found camaraderie with his fellow miners and retired as a deputy – similar to a foreman – at Sharlston colliery near Wakefield in 1986. He spent a happy retirement with Elsie, driving around England and Scotland and holidaying in Europe. He also took up crown green bowling (he won many trophies), loved listening to brass bands, was a member of the local working men’s club and an active member of the Labour party. By the time of his death he had become more British than Polish, although he always preferred to be thought of as a Yorkshireman. However, he maintained links with his Polish family and in 1976, when he felt it safe to do so, visited them in Poland. Elsie died in 2010. He is survived by me and my brother, Michael, three granddaughters, a great-granddaughter and two sisters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/mar/29/uk-businesses-workforce-crisis-brexit-young-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T23:01:15Z","webTitle":"UK businesses told to expect workforce crisis after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/29/uk-businesses-workforce-crisis-brexit-young-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/mar/29/uk-businesses-workforce-crisis-brexit-young-workers","fields":{"headline":"UK businesses told to expect workforce crisis after Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British businesses have been warned to brace for a severe workforce crisis triggered by Brexit, with the number of workers entering employment expected to fall behind the rate of population growth for the first time in half a century. According to employment consultant Mercer, the size of the British workforce is expected to rise by just 820,000 by 2025, marking a dramatic slowdown from the previous decade, when almost 2 million people entered employment. The increase would cut the workforce growth rate from 9% in the 10 years to 2015 to 2.4% six years after Britain leaves the EU at the end of March 2019, underscoring businesses’ fears over a potential labour shortage. The slowdown is also forecast to have worrying consequences for the government at a time when more workers are needed to enter the health and social care professions to care for Britain’s ageing population. Mercer estimates there will be an additional 2 million people aged 65 and over by 2025. The consultancy firm said as many as 710,000 people are likely to be required by the health and social care sector over the coming few years, leaving just 110,000 available for the rest of the economy. Gary Simmons, a partner at Mercer, said: “There are going to be big winners and losers in the battle for workers. If businesses don’t take action now they will face significant costs and be left in a poor position.” Net migration numbers to Britain have been falling since the EU referendum, while there are fears among business leaders that tighter controls on immigration could compound growing labour shortages. The latest official figures show net annual migration of EU nationals to Britain fell by 75,000 in the year to September – the lowest level for five years as a “Brexodus” gets under way. The total number of people coming to work in the country fell by 45,000 to 248,000, which was driven by a 58,000 drop in the number of EU citizens coming to work. Sectors such as hospitality, retail and agriculture have voiced particular concerns over their access to migrant labour, while universities, pharmaceutical companies and banks are worried about attracting international talent. Jobs vacancies are at the highest levels since comparable records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, with 816,000 recorded in the three months to February. The Bank of England’s network of regional agents said on Wednesday that recruitment difficulties were the primary concern raised by the businesses they spoke to in the first quarter of the year. Mercer added that over the next eight years there were projections for 300,000 fewer workers under the age of 30, while there would be an increase of 1 million people aged over 50 as a result of falling net migration and ageing baby boomers. London in particular could suffer as its economy was more dependent on young and migrant labour. Mercer forecasts the capital’s resident worker population under the age of 30 will fall by a quarter, while rising by the same amount for the over-50s. Simmons said companies needed to boost their diversity and inclusion practices to encourage more people into the workforce. “Young people don’t grow on trees,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-now-is-the-time-to-change-course","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:31:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Brexit: now is the time to change course | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-now-is-the-time-to-change-course","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-now-is-the-time-to-change-course","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Brexit: now is the time to change course","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When a majority of MPs voted a year ago to authorise the activation of article 50, they did so because they felt it was their duty as mandated by the Brexit referendum. But this does not mean parliament has to agree to whatever Brexit Theresa May offers. Democracy demanded that the vote be honoured, but that doesn’t mean everything done under the banner of Brexit is in the interests of the country or an expression of an irreversible “will of the people”. In reality we are dealing with an ever-shifting battleground of political ideas. Democracy means listening to the majority, but it also means managing conflicting ambitions within that majority. Disentangling all the motives that compelled people to tick the leave box is not easy. Neither should the national mood be seen entirely in terms of the winning side, as though remain voters have disappeared and their ideas are not worth considering. Democracy also means protecting minorities, and 48% is a big minority. A Brexit that would bring the country together is the softest of soft Brexits. But Mrs May decided, without even consulting her cabinet, to go for an extreme model. She sought a mandate for this in a general election and didn’t get one. She pushed ahead regardless, stitching up a pact with the DUP, who don’t even represent the majority vote on Brexit in Northern Ireland, which backed remain. Ireland is a toxic issue. Northern Ireland was torn apart by strife for 30 years until a fragile, precious peace was secured. Any Brexit must uphold the peace process, the Good Friday agreement and therefore the soft border. A deeply polarised UK Given the stakes, the government has wantonly squandered half of the time that was available to negotiate a deal. Only a year is now left until the official moment of departure. Last week’s agreement on a transitional phase must not obscure the severity of what will happen next 29 March if the current timetable is pursued. The troubling reality is that outside of the European Union Britain would be worse off in economic terms under every scenario. Brexit threatens the palimpsest of modern Britain on which layer upon layer of a shared European culture has been inscribed. Leaving the EU will not enhance Britain’s place in the world, it will damage it. In an age of aggressive nationalism, when a spirit of contempt for international rules roams the White House, it is hard to see the virtue in withdrawal from a project conceived to protect them. That is what the referendum vote implies. Yet without sustained evidence that millions of people have had a change of heart, the case for completely reversing the decision is difficult to make at this moment in time. Disappointed remainers must not underestimate the social and political cost of appearing to tell leave voters that their judgment and opinions are invalid; that they were conned, or stupid, or racist. The loss of faith in institutions, ushered in by the 2008 financial crash, stirred resentment against a ruling class. There were previous breaches of trust that created the disillusion with the existing political order: such as Iraq and the fetishising of market forces. The UK has also become deeply polarised, a trend which runs counter to democratic and egalitarian values. It is important not to lose sight of the ideological genesis of Euroscepticism on the hard right of British politics and society. The path to Brexit required a set of contingencies to occur, but the country set out on this journey when the Tories included an EU referendum pledge in their 2015 manifesto. Many leave voters were Conservatives in well-to-do towns; comfortable baby boomers in southern counties. The extent to which Brexit was a popular revolt by the dispossessed can be overstated, most eagerly by the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who would love to have credentials as champions of the underprivileged but don’t deserve them. Remainers have yet to find a coherent pro-EU offer to those people who voted leave that would demonstrate to them that Europhiles have at long last listened to voices they had ignored for too long. So here is the paradox: Brexit does not fix the underlying problems that led many people to feel that they simply had to reject EU membership to get some kind of redress from a political system in which they had lost confidence. The negative economic consequences of Brexit will be felt hardest in places where the leave vote most looks like a cry for economic help. Blaming the EU (often as a proxy for immigration) was a misdiagnosis of a chronic ailment, which has its roots in Thatcher-era deindustrialisation, a failure to manage the effects of globalisation on wages, and a demand for decent public services. Brexit is the wrong prescription. Creeping rightwing coup Withdrawing Brexit has vicious side-effects, not least because referendums have a record of stoking divisions, not healing them. With this in mind, MPs will now have to find a way to leave while mitigating the harm done by leaving. Time is tighter even than the one-year mark suggests. To accommodate the need for continent-wide ratifications, including votes in Westminster, the outline of a deal should be reached by autumn this year. Such a complex project cannot be settled in the next seven months. This is not a question of ambition or imagination but of negotiating capacity. So the likely outcome is a broad agreement on the approximate shape of a future relationship, with details to be filled in during transition. That is a dangerous situation. It sets up a scenario where the UK leaves the EU on terms that even the Brexiters accept are worse than current membership, and then the government gets to fine-tune the details, with the help of Henry VIII powers that it has awarded itself, and to an agenda dictated by a handful of Tory backbenchers. This is not the restoration of sovereignty or the invigoration of democracy that was promised. It looks more like a creeping rightwing coup. Resisting a course that harms the country is not an offence against democracy. It is a patriotic duty to push back against extreme forces that are exploiting, not honouring, the referendum vote. It is in parliament that society’s competing interests and demands are mediated. It is in parliament where the messy, inchoate, often contradictory “will of the people” becomes law. That is the difference between democracy and populism; between government by stable institutions and mob rule. That is why parliament is sovereign – and it always was, despite the claims of Eurosceptics. Their assertion that Brexit was meant to empower parliament has been exposed as a sleight of hand. Parliamentary sovereignty The most egregious displays of contempt for parliamentary sovereignty since the referendum have come not from “Brussels bureaucrats” but from Tory ministers. They even tried to thwart efforts to give MPs a vote on a final deal. Luckily, they failed. Labour were moving in the right direction with their customs partnership proposals and the party needs to resist a hard Brexit at all costs. Neither parliament nor anyone else should be cowed into thinking that the only available deal is the one that Mrs May offers. She has no mandate for the Brexit she seeks. In parliament the majority of pragmatic MPs know this. Yet they lack a credible leader, relying instead on patron saints such as Ken Clarke. Time is running out. Now is the moment to demand a change of course, before it is too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/01/the-inheritance-young-vic-frankenstein-battersea-arts-centre-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: The Inheritance; Frankenstein: Making a Monster – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/01/the-inheritance-young-vic-frankenstein-battersea-arts-centre-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/01/the-inheritance-young-vic-frankenstein-battersea-arts-centre-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: The Inheritance; Frankenstein: Making a Monster – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“You can’t ask an audience to sit through a play that long.” Not an obvious gag – unless you are at the Young Vic, where it gets bellows of laughter. Matthew Lopez’s whopping two-parter can be seen in one day, but you have to clock in at 1.15pm and won’t be out much before 11pm. The length of The Inheritance is not just a challenge to prostates and concentration: it’s a declaration. It announces an intention not simply to punch home a series of significant moments but to trace the links between them: to unravel a history, and ask what one generation has passed on to the next – and whether the legacy could have been different. This high-voltage account of male gay life whirls through marriages, breakups, betrayals, high life and hard times in present-day New York, but it also looks back: to mid-20th-century closeted existences and to the threats – social, physical and psychological – visited by Aids. A fleeting winged being summons up that other epic of gay life, Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, but this is a different social document: less luxuriantly written, more quizzical. It’s absorbing, exciting and uneven, with a dip in the second half that could do with a snip. The amazing thing is how strong it is. At first glance it looks like too literary an idea to work in the theatre. Lopez’s play springs from a fascination with EM Forster, with the sensitivities of Howards End and with Forster’s gay novel, Maurice – unpublished until after the author’s death in 1970. Large chunks of the action are narrated and explained – usually a cue for inertness. And yet the questions it asks are crucial. Could liberation have come earlier? How important is it to retrieve the memories of difficult times? Are the special codes and habits of any particular group to be cherished or are they imprisoning – is camp (exuberantly gestured and danced here) simply “gay minstrelsy”? And Stephen Daldry’s production is masterly, spiced with mischief and teeming with incident, even before anyone has spoken a word. A young man lolls with a book on a plain white platform like a low table. Another youth joins him, with an iPad. Slowly the stage fills with quietly chatting young men, a tangle of lounging limbs. But also with a palpable sense of shared memories in the making. This opening scene, of men moving softly towards each other, has a desolating echo some three hours later when youths from an earlier generation, dead from Aids, gradually fill the stage. It is also full of small carrying details. Everyone walks around in bare feet – intimate and unprotected – throughout. Until one couple get really bourgeois and slip on carpet shoes. The legacy – stolen – at the centre is the same as that in Forster’s novel: a treasured house, beautifully pictured in Bob Crowley’s limpid design, in which white walls slide back to reveal a doll-like mansion and a significant, vivid tree. Some of the main connections and clashes are identical: left versus right, sensitivity versus energy. Lopez quite often overeggs his points, but the evening speaks strongly through its images. And performances. Samuel H Levine doubles up soulfully as two love objects, uncertain, clobbered and, in one wonderful sardonic snicker, knowing. Kyle Soller delicately charts the difficult, admirable progress of the man who melts into goodness. Andrew Burnap – sulkily chiselled and snapping – is alluring, tricky, pitiable; the gunpowder beneath the plot. There is an imposing appearance by Vanessa Redgrave, got up in green like an ancient goddess, the only woman in the play. It is one of the witticisms of the production that she is herself a legacy – from the 1992 movie of Howards End. Inheritance is embodied as well as explained. Battersea Arts Centre’s Beatbox Academy, 10 years old this year, has made a tremendous show. Frankenstein is a rip-it-to-pieces-and-remake-it production that galvanises the heart of Mary Shelley’s exclamatory gothic with vocal percussion, rap and soaring song. Frankenstein is a natural choice for the stage: what could be more theatrical than the quickening of something in the same space as the audience? Seven years ago at the National, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller projected Shelley’s forward-looking sympathies by alternating the parts of scientist and creature. April De Angelis’s current Manchester Royal Exchange adaptation, marking the novel’s 200th anniversary, manages to put on stage an extraordinary amount of Shelley’s prose, with appropriate feminist emphasis. BAC’s beatbox version is fiercer and more inward. Co-directed by Conrad Murray and David Cumming, it has been devised by under 30-year-olds – “generation anonymous” – who chose the story because they recognise what it is to be made into monsters. It shows the creature from within, and invites not compassion but identification. In darkness punctured by a scatter of pendant bulbs, six performers set the stage ticking, thrumming, crooning, throbbing. Each of them has a solo moment: an exquisitely sung lament; a wordless explosion of clicks and hisses; an ingenious rap which brings together antihistamines and tight jeans. The creature’s different organs and limbs are animated separately: legs sprawl all over the stage, breath is born in a sea of sound, until clustering together, huddled and juddering, five men and women become a multilimbed monster, while the narrow-eyed doctor moves to the rhythm of “I’m a genius, genius…” Audiences are encouraged to take pictures on their phones, though the show itself contains a warning about screens as weapons. It also finely conjures up what is usually overlooked in adaptations of Shelley’s novel: the vibrant scenic backdrop, in which the natural world is inspiration and reproof to the doc’s laboratory efforts. Here is whirring, whistling, rustling, piping, cooing; here are leaves and birds and the rush of wind. In the autumn, the Beatbox Academy will perform the piece in BAC’s new Grand Hall, restored after the fire that swept through the building three years go. It’s an appropriate tribute. I have seen several giant stage leaps at Battersea – from Jerry Springer: the Opera to Punchdrunk’s The Masque of the Red Death. Frankenstein is the centre’s latest tremendous creature.

JAL collaborates with BA and Finnair, so the first leg from London Heathrow to Helsinki was operated by BA and the second, Helsinki to Tokyo, with Finnair. The BA flight was delayed by 70 minutes because of the late arrival of two crew members. As a result, we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo and were rerouted the following day via Beijing, arriving 30 hours late. We lost two days of our trip and the cost of the first missed night in our Tokyo hotel. BA has refused compensation as its flight was delayed by less than the three-hour threshold. It is ignoring the fact that this caused us to reach our end destination more than a day late. JAL, meanwhile, tells us it’s BA’s responsibility. LS, London BA is obfuscating. Under EU regulations it is, indeed, the case that compensation is only payable for delays of more than three hours. However, if a passenger purchases a through ticket, and a delay to the first leg of the flight causes them to miss their connection, they are entitled to claim a payout if they reach their end destination more than three hours late. The length of the initial delay is irrelevant. According to the UK regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, it would normally be the airline responsible for the delay that would pay the compensation for the knock-on consequences. When I put this to BA, it immediately dispatched a cheque for the £1,063 you are due. “We have been in contact with our customer to apologise for this error,” it says. Has it learnt from this “error”? Not a bit of it. A month later, I was contacted by NH of Fareham, Hampshire, who was on the same BA flight, also bound for Tokyo. She, too, was told that she was not eligible for compensation because the BA flight was delayed by less than three hours. The fact that her fellow-passenger was eventually paid her dues made no difference. BA changed tack and told NH that she was not eligible because the flight was delayed due to “operational reasons” beyond its control. When NH contested this, it tried another argument and, ignoring evidence to the contrary, twice insisted that she was exempt because she was not travelling on a through ticket. Again, it acknowledged its legal responsibilities when challenged by the Observer and promptly paid up, blaming a “genuine error”. Passengers who have been refused compensation to which they believe they are entitled should take their case to the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme to which the airline is subscribed – in BA’s case it’s CEDR. Not that ADR necessarily helps. MP of Sheffield and his wife have been fighting since 2016 for €800 compensation due from TUI after their flight to Gran Canaria was cancelled. CEDR upheld their claim in March 2017 but its decision was ignored by TUI , as was a county court judgment issued in MP’s favour last October. MP was considering applying to send bailiffs when, in response to the prospect of a headline in the Observer, TUI backed down. Two years after their cancelled flight, a cheque is sent. “We would like to apologise for the delay in processing the claim. We can confirm the matter is now successfully resolved,” it says.

There has been 23 years of massive investment by the clubs to take the game where it is today and I believe that the next 10 years will see the club game again grow massively, though it is difficult if you are trying to build Premier rugby into a worldwide brand and you keep giving your best players to someone else.” Wray did not mention relegation, which since the start of the Premiership in 1997 has been debated, as it was in the 10 years after the league system was set up in 1987. The old Courage league started with 12 clubs, went up to 13 for three seasons, then down to 10 for three and back to 12 in 1996. It stayed at 12 for the first season of the Premiership before being increased to 14 the following season. That number lasted one campaign: London Scottish and Richmond went bust and other professional incarnations were sucked into London Irish. The Premiership has remained a 12-club tournament since: although there have been moves to increase it to 14, as a means of ending, or suspending, promotion and relegation, the prospect of spreading central income more thinly kept hands down. Relegation has become a live issue again as Premiership Rugby plots its course from the 2019 World Cup when the season in Europe will change, starting and ending a month later in October and June. The clubs see the alteration to the calendar as an opportunity to strengthen their position. They tried, through the Rugby Football Union, to get the two fallow weekends in the Six Nations dropped so the tournament was played in one go, but failed. They have also pushed, again via the RFU, for the length of a Lions tour to be cut, but if that happens it will only be because of a concern that South Africa and Australia do not have the strength to sustain seven non‑Test fixtures with so many of their players abroad. They have talked about extending the season, continuing to start in September but going through until the end of June, which prompted outrage from players and the threat of a strike. The clubs want to minimise the clashes with international matches on league weekends and so be able to field their strongest sides more often, adding to the training and playing regimes of international players. When the clubs were negotiating the first elite player agreement with the RFU, which was signed in 2006, the union offered the carrot of an end to relegation. The Premiership turned it down: the generous parachute payment to the relegated club, as long as it was an established shareholder rather than an occasional visitor like Rotherham, in effect turned it into a 13-club league. The RFU’s decision to have the top four in the Championship play off to determine the champions could be seen as a response to that; it certainly delayed Bristol’s return and provided the means for Exeter to rise. That system ended last summer, but the Premiership now wants an end to relegation, at least for a fixed period. The tournament has grown to the point where there are very few Championship clubs who have either the facilities or the financial means to make the leap. The second tier is not funded adequately, as it is in France. Clubs who appeared occasionally in the top flight in the past will not be repeating the experience: London Welsh have reverted to an amateur club, Rotherham are marooned at the bottom of the Championship, a division in which Bedford, Richmond and London Scottish are content to remain. Only two teams have challenged meaningfully for this season’s Championship: the leaders Bristol and Ealing Trailfinders, who trail by 13 points with four matches left. If Bristol are promoted at the expense of London Irish, the Premiership will be made up of clubs who all have primacy of tenure at their grounds. They will all be able to grow financially in a way Irish, who rent Reading Football Club’s stadium and so generate no income from it outside match days, cannot. The clubs have to persuade the RFU to back them over relegation because it is part of the elite player agreement and can only be changed bilaterally. It gives the union the chance to push for more rest periods for the England squad: without the spectre of relegation, some clubs will be drifting towards the end of a season, like Harlequins and Northampton, who supplied seven players to this year’s Six Nations campaign. It may even prompt a discussion about style of play and an emphasis on skill. The agreement has worked in the last 12 years in the sense that the scars of the decade before, when threats of court action were commonplace, have not reopened; but the two sides are coming at it from opposite directions and compromise will only hold them together for so long. Wray said he could see a time when rugby union became like football with supporters more interested in their clubs than their national side. The clubs have played a clever tactical game, which one day may translate to the pitch, over the last 12 years, accruing power and a measure of independence. The next step involves having an influence on the international game. The RFU needs to show resolve over relegation, although having been party to a grossly underfunded Championship, it induced ring-fencing. The clubs point out, rightly, how much they have done for the game in 23 years in terms of investment, profile and facilities, but their focus should be on the field and making the Premiership a tournament for players so that more of the newcomers who are tempted to watch a game at venues such as the Olympic Stadium or St James’s Park become regulars. • This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Mathias Cormann, the finance minister, has refused to buy into reports the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is modelling ways to cut a further 10% from the foreign aid budget. Australia’s aid contribution has been cut repeatedly since 2013. Fairfax Media reported on Wednesday that Dfat was modelling a number of scenarios, including a substantial reduction in aid to south-east Asian nations that are considered to have reached “middle-income status”. An alternative scenario, according to the Fairfax report, is for Australia to stop delivering aid in one whole sector, such as health. Australia’s foreign aid contribution, $3.9bn in 2017-18, is already its lowest on record, just 22 cents for every $100 of gross national income. On Thursday Cormann was asked if the reports were true but he would not buy into them or deny them. “The budget will be delivered on the second Tuesday of May,” he said. Save the Children’s director of public affairs and policy, Mat Tinkler, called on the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to rule out further cuts for developing countries. He said less than a day ago Australia’s minister for international development, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, had indicated in the Senate that the government would maintain the overseas aid budget at $4bn a year over the next two years, so he was especially alarmed by the report. “How does that square with today’s media reports that the government is considering hacking another $400m from the aid budget, a lifeline to many of the poorest people in our region?” Tinkler said. “We’re calling on the treasurer and prime minister to back the minister for international development and announce unequivocally that there will be no more cuts to overseas aid, now or into the future.” In cumulative terms, Australia’s foreign aid budget has been cut, and is projected to be cut, by almost one third – 32.8% – since the Gillard government’s 2013–14 budget, which represented a high point for aid funding. In the 2017 budget the government said Australia’s foreign aid contribution would increase in line with inflation in 2017–18 and 2018–19, but it decided to freeze Australia’s contribution at $4bn in 2019–20 and 2020–21. According to the parliamentary library those two consecutive freezes – worth an estimated $303m in savings over the forward estimates – represented the fifth and sixth cuts, in real terms, to aid funding since 2013-14. The freezes also accelerated Australia’s diminishing aid generosity: our foreign aid contribution as a proportion of gross national income is scheduled to fall to an unprecedented low of 20 cents for every $100 gross national income in 2020–21. “These cuts are also expected to see Australia fall further down the ladder of developed country donors and well below the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ODA/GNI average of 0.32%,” the parliamentary library said. “In 2016 Australia ranked 17th out of 29 OECD bilateral donors for aid generosity, and is projected to fall to 21st in the coming years. Australia is currently the world’s 13th largest economy.” Tinkler said Australia was a wealthy, recession-free country and could afford to play its part helping the poorest people in the world through a world-class aid program. “If we don’t then we risk damaging our reputation globally and undermining international efforts to create a stable and prosperous world,” he said. “We urgently need to scale up aid but instead Australia has slashed overseas aid to developing countries by 30% in the last three years.” with AAP"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/28/christine-shawcroft-labour-disputes-panel-chair-resigns-antisemitism-case","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T22:28:01Z","webTitle":"Labour's disputes panel chair resigns over antisemitism case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/28/christine-shawcroft-labour-disputes-panel-chair-resigns-antisemitism-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/28/christine-shawcroft-labour-disputes-panel-chair-resigns-antisemitism-case","fields":{"headline":"Labour's disputes panel chair resigns over antisemitism case","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Christine Shawcroft, the chair of Labour’s internal disputes panel, has resigned after a leaked email revealed she lent support to a council candidate suspended for alleged antisemitism. Alan Bull, who was selected to stand in Peterborough, was suspended by Labour last week after he was linked to a series of antisemitic social media posts. He was accused of sharing on Facebook an article headlined, “International Red Cross report confirms the Holocaust of 6m Jews is a hoax”, illustrated with a photograph of the gates of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Daily Mail obtained an email sent by Shawcroft to leftwing allies on Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) last weekend – with the party already engulfed in an antisemitism row – in which she called for Bull’s suspension to be lifted so he could stand in May’s local elections. Shawcroft claims in the email that “elements of Peterborough Labour party” have “political reasons” for wanting Bull suspended; and the Facebook post for which he was suspended has been “taken completely out of context”. After the email was leaked, Shawcroft announced that she would step down as chair of the party’s disputes panel, which oversees internal disciplinary cases; but she did not say whether she intended to remain on the NEC. “I sent this email before being aware of the full information about this case and I had not been shown the image of his abhorrent Facebook post,” she said. “This week we have seen a clear expression of the pain and hurt that has been caused to Jewish members of our party and the wider Jewish community by antisemitic abuse and language, and by the reality of antisemitism being denied and downplayed by others. “In light of this, I have decided to stand down as chair of the disputes panel to ensure my wrong and misguided questions on this case do not cause doubt or anxiety about our processes”. Shawcroft only took on the role in January, after her predecessor, Ann Black, was ousted in a show of strength by NEC leftwingers, who have been in the majority since the latest set of NEC elections. She is a director of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn campaign group. Her resignation will pile the pressure on him over the issue of whether Labour is taking claims of antisemitism seriously enough. Jewish groups marched on Westminster on Monday to send a message to the Labour leadership that, “enough is enough”, after Corbyn was forced to apologise for defending the artist of an antisemitic mural. Richard Angell, of centre-left Labour group Progress, said, “Christine Shawcroft’s defence of a known Holocaust denier is disgusting. Resigning from the disputes panel is a sop. She is not fit to be a member of our party, let alone continue as a member of the NEC.” Bull was suspended last week and forced to withdraw as a candidate, after complaints and months of pressure from two other party members, Richard Ferris and Matthew Mahabadi. When there was no action after their first complaints, in November, Ferris and Mahabadi, who are both councillors, announced they would not share a platform with Bull because of his views. Last week they refused to campaign with him, and the Jewish Chronicle picked up the story. Bull was suspended the following day. Earlier this week, both councillors were called before their council group to face a disciplinary hearing because there had been “a large number of complaints” about their conduct. They have not yet heard the result. In an article the two councillors wrote for the New Statesman, Ferris and Mahabadi said: “Antisemitism is a vile evil – you should not have to be Jewish to say so or be offended by it because it is a scar in our society that damages each and every one of us. We, as Labour councillors, will not stand for it. “It is time everyone in the Labour party said the same, acted accordingly and if they cannot, leave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/28/drinks-bottle-can-deposit-return-scheme-cost-1bn-retailers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T15:31:38Z","webTitle":"Bottle and can deposit return scheme could cost £1bn, say UK retailers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/28/drinks-bottle-can-deposit-return-scheme-cost-1bn-retailers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/28/drinks-bottle-can-deposit-return-scheme-cost-1bn-retailers","fields":{"headline":"Bottle and can deposit return scheme could cost £1bn, say UK retailers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK retail industry has warned it could cost £1bn to implement the government’s plan to charge deposits on drinks cans and bottles. Britain’s biggest supermarkets signalled a willingness to work with the environment secretary, Michael Gove, on the scheme, which would result in consumers in England getting the deposit back if they returned the empty drinks containers to stores. However, retailers warned there was much work to be done on how a deposit return system (DRS) would work in practice, after Gove announced the broad outline of the plan but provided little detail. A spokesperson for Tesco said: “We support a cost-effective deposit return system and are working with a number of partners to explore how this can operate at scale. DRS is one part of the holistic approach that is needed to reduce waste and increase recycling in the UK.” Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer said they were also open to working with the government on the proposals. Key issues that have yet to be addressed include who would pay for the scheme, where the planned “reverse vending machines” for returning containers would be placed and whether customers would be able to return bottles and cans to any retailer, irrespective of where they bought them. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for UK retailers, has estimated it would cost £900m-£1bn to install machines at stores across England. It urged ministers to work with the Scottish government, which announced plans for a DRS in September. “We are pleased the government has said any scheme will be based on evidence and any costs for consumers and retailers will be proportionate,” said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the BRC. “It is important it co-ordinates work with the Scottish government, which is further ahead with its planning. The government needs to be creative in its thinking, for example, by using municipal sites and not just shops in town centres to tackle littering.” Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said the industry welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the government’s consultation, which is expected to begin later this year. However, the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), which represents more than 800 independent craft brewers in the UK, said it was concerned that small businesses would be burdened with additional costs. James Calder, head of public affairs at Siba, said: “Small brewers are conscious of their environmental impact and moves to encourage recycling and reduce waste and pollution are welcome. “But Siba members, as relatively small businesses when compared to international mega brewers, are disproportionately burdened by added costs, so any deposit scheme needs to be appropriately targeted and mitigated to ensure this undue burden is minimised.” Countries such as Germany, Sweden and Denmark operate their own versions of a deposit return scheme and have higher recycling rates than the UK. In Britain, just 43% of the 13bn plastic bottles sold each year are recycled and 700,000 turn up as litter every day. In Germany, where a DRS was introduced in 2003, 99% of plastic bottles are recycled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/28/harvey-weinstein-assistant-zelda-perkins-i-was-trapped-in-a-vortex-of-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T15:37:09Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein aide tells of 'morally lacking' non-disclosure deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/28/harvey-weinstein-assistant-zelda-perkins-i-was-trapped-in-a-vortex-of-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/28/harvey-weinstein-assistant-zelda-perkins-i-was-trapped-in-a-vortex-of-fear","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein aide tells of 'morally lacking' non-disclosure deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein’s former assistant has criticised the non-disclosure agreement she had to sign after leaving the film company Miramax as “morally lacking”. Zelda Perkins told MPs from the women and equalities committee that she left her job after Weinstein “sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a colleague of mine”, but then had to sign a wide-ranging agreement that required that she use her “best endeavours” to limit what she said in any criminal case against Weinstein. Perkins, who worked for Weinstein’s Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s, said she was also banned from talking to a doctor about the events unless the doctor also signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The NDA was negotiated by lawyers from the “magic circle” law firm Allen &amp; Overy. Maria Miller, the chair of the committee, said there were concerns about Allen &amp; Overy’s behaviour during the negotiation, telling Perkins: “It’s been suggested that they might not have been working within legal constraints, for instance limiting your disclosure might be perverting the course of justice.” Perkins said Weinstein was allowed to be in the room while his alleged victim signed the NDA. Perkins’s former colleague said Weinstein had sexually assaulted her at the Venice film festival in 1998. Both women left the company soon afterwards. “We were brought into a room with Mr Weinstein,” Perkins told the committee. “That was the first time my colleague had seen him again. He had a long conversation with us, trying to bring us back to the company, apologising for his behaviour. In fact, it was an admission, which my lawyer noted, but was not allowed to leave the room with that piece of paper.” Because the attack occurred in Italy, British police had no jurisdiction. Perkins said her own lawyers advised her not to go to court, because it would be her word against his: “I was told that wasn’t even worth considering because of the disparity of power.” The NDA was reached after several rounds of negotiations, including one session that finished at 5am after 12 hours of debate. Perkins said by the end of the negotiations there was a “siege mentality”. As part of the agreement Weinstein agreed to attend therapy, and Miramax was required to act if there were any further complaints. Under the terms of the agreement, Perkins said that the two women had to “use our best endeavours to not disclose anything in a criminal case” against Weinstein. Perkins said that she had believed she would go to jail if she breached the terms of the agreement. Perkins was not allowed to keep a copy of the NDA. Perkins said that her plan was to go to Disney “because I naively believed that Disney as the parent company of Miramax would be horrified” and said that “my naivety was met with hilarity” by her own lawyers. MPs said there were serious concerns about the reach of some NDAs. Under the terms of her NDA, Perkins said she was banned from discussing anything with “any medical practitioner, any legal representative, the inland revenue, an accountant, a financial adviser” unless they also signed non-disclosure agreements. Perkins said that her former colleague had felt unable to discuss the attempted rape with a trauma counsellor because of the terms of the non-disclosure agreement. Mark Mansell, a partner from Allen &amp; Overy, told the committee that he regretted that Perkins had found the negotiations difficult, but insisted that there were times when it was appropriate to limit statements made during a criminal inquiry. Mansell said: “There can be situations where there is the possibility that the information being given goes over and above what strictly needs to be done and it is possible in those circumstances that someone may try to restrict that.” Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, said: “I was brought up to understand that you should tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,” and added that the NDA “seems to fly in the face of telling the whole truth”. “I don’t think that I am saying that you shouldn’t tell the truth and the whole truth,” said Mansell. “But I think there may be information that someone could voluntarily disclose that they don’t necessarily need to.” Perkins said she faced whispers and rumours after she left Miramax, but was unable to explain the events because of the NDA. She said her career in film was permanently damaged by her departure from Miramax. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/28/sky-bet-fined-vulnerable-customers-gambling-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T09:57:48Z","webTitle":"Sky Bet fined £1m for failing to protect vulnerable customers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/28/sky-bet-fined-vulnerable-customers-gambling-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/28/sky-bet-fined-vulnerable-customers-gambling-commission","fields":{"headline":"Sky Bet fined £1m for failing to protect vulnerable customers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Online gambling firm Sky Bet has been fined £1m for allowing hundreds of potentially vulnerable people to keep betting after they asked to be barred from doing so, while sending promotional material to 50,000 more. Industry regulator the Gambling Commission said Sky Bet was guilty of failings in its self-exclusion tools, which are meant to help people who fear they have a gambling problem lock themselves out of online casinos and sports betting. The fine comes amid delays to the launch of an industry-wide system called GamStop designed to allow addicts to block themselves from multiple companies, following high-profile problems with individual firms’ self-exclusion schemes. The Gambling Commission said 736 Sky Bet customers who had self-excluded were able to open new accounts, in some cases using the same details previously registered with the company. About 50,000 self-excluded customers continued to receive marketing material from Sky Bet by email, text or a mobile app notification after self-excluding. A further 36,748 did not have the balance of their funds with SkyBet returned to them upon closing their accounts. The fine would have been higher but Sky Bet reported the issue to the Gambling Commission of its own accord. “This was a serious failure affecting thousands of potentially vulnerable customers and the £1m penalty package should serve as a warning to all gambling businesses,” said the Gambling Commission programme director, Richard Watson. “Protecting consumers from gambling-related harm is a priority for us and where we see operators failing in their responsibility to keep their customers safe we will take tough action.” The vast majority of the £1m fine will be paid to charities for socially responsible purposes, the Gambling Commission said. Sky Bet’s rival, 888, paid £7.8m last year for failures relating to self-exclusion, the largest penalty ever handed out by the industry regulator. Matt Zarb-Cousin, who founded an app called Gamban that allows problem gamblers to block betting sites from their own computer or phone, said the industry had a poor record. “Sky Bet is only the latest in a long line of failures by operators to uphold self-exclusion, while the multi-operator scheme GamStop has been delayed until later this year,” he said. “Operators should give customers who self exclude the opportunity to block all gambling sites and apps on their devices by offering software that can’t be user-uninstalled.” The Sky Betting &amp; Gaming chief executive, Richard Flint, said: “We have always taken responsible gambling and player protection very seriously but this incident showed that we needed to do more. “When we spotted the issue we pro-actively notified the Gambling Commission and have worked to improve our processes to avoid this happening again. “We could and should have made it harder for self-excluded customers to open duplicate accounts with us and for that we are sorry. “We fully agree with the Gambling Commission’s findings and will donate the agreed sum to charities for socially responsible purposes.” He said the company had not made any profit out of the episode."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/29/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson-bryan-cranston-animation","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T14:00:16Z","webTitle":"Isle of Dogs review – Wes Anderson unleashes a cracking canine caper | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/29/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson-bryan-cranston-animation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/29/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson-bryan-cranston-animation","fields":{"headline":"Isle of Dogs review – Wes Anderson unleashes a cracking canine caper","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s set in Japan, though east London’s Isle of Dogs just happens to be a short drive from 3 Mills Studios, which did a lot of the work on this film. So maybe our Isle of Dogs influenced the director, Wes Anderson. Or maybe he chose the title because it sounds like: “I love dogs.” Isle of Dogs is another utterly distinctive, formally brilliant exercise in savant innocence from Anderson, somewhere between arch naivety and inspired sophistication. I laughed a lot, not really at jokes, but at its hyper-intelligent stabs of visual invention. It’s a stop-motion animation – like his Roald Dahl adaptation Fantastic Mr Fox (2009) – visually controlled to its every analogue micro-particle, a complete handmade world. The screenplay is by Anderson, along with Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and the Japanese actor and writer Kunichi Nomura who was also casting director and voices the villain of the piece – the dog-hating Mayor Kobayashi. We find ourselves in a dystopian Japan of the future, where all dogs are exiled to an offshore island trash dump. One of the interned beasts is Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber) whose devoted master is the 12-year-old Atari (Koyu Rankin), nephew of the dog-hating Mayor himself. This remarkable boy flies to the Isle in a stolen plane on a sensational mission to rescue Spots. And in this he is helped by the ragtag crew of heroic outlaw pooches he meets: Chief (Bryan Cranston), Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Boss (Bill Murray) and Duke (Jeff Goldblum). Isle of Dogs has run into controversy. Anderson’s post-modern japonaiserie, its filmic references to Japanese movies, art and music are all presented in what seems to me joyous good faith. But the heroic dogs speak in American English, and the mostly villainous, dramatically subordinate humans speak in often unsubtitled Japanese, leading to suggestions of insensitivity, cliche, othering and cultural appropriation, although this debate has so far passed over the question of what Japanese people themselves actually think of this film. I would agree that getting Yoko Ono to voice one of the characters maybe takes us coyly close to the laugh-with/laugh-at borderline. But Anderson’s omnivorous appropriation is always cut with his own saline quirk, a willed and almost pedantic superimposition of his own sensibility, that of a western artist. And appropriation is what an imagination does. Doesn’t it venture outside its identity and attempt to master something else – in various serious or comic registers? Anderson is arguably no more or less insensitive or chauvinist here than in his treatment of central European culture in The Grand Budapest Hotel or indeed dear old Blighty in Fantastic Mr Fox. Why should our progressive opinion be nettled now? Why should Japanese culture be assigned the status of underdog? Actually, the chief Japanese influence on Anderson is one I have been noticing since the days of his 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums, and that is Yasujirō Ozu, specifically his habit of setting up direct sightlines into camera, a mannerism that will get you hit over the knuckles with a ruler at film school, but which Ozu made part of his filmic language. And it is part of Anderson’s deadpan rectilinear compositions, huge panoramas and intricate tableaux, often alternating with droll diagrams or layouts. There’s a difference now. Isle of Dogs is bleaker and blanker than Wes Anderson’s habitual visual confectionery. The landscape of garbage canyons is grim, which makes individual details the more notable. Looking out over the mountains of detritus, you can see cable cars on the horizon, tiny blobs on distant threads. Their movement is hypnotic. And there are the dogs themselves, gazing at us square-on with their black-pebble eyes, or in profile at each other. Their expressive clarity of movement is somehow very funny. I mean it as the highest possible compliment in saying they remind me of Jim Henson’s Muppets. Cranston’s Chief is the star of this film, a stray, a maverick, a badass who is the subject of a plot twist and counter-twist. Chief broods about the inevitability of species destiny. He once bit a human’s hand, a hand that was literally trying to feed him, and there is something strangely moving about Chief’s burden of moral self-criticism. Hosting the Golden Globes in 2015, Amy Poehler got a big laugh by saying that Anderson had arrived at the ceremony on “a bicycle made of antique tuba parts”. Actually, the tuba, the bicycle and everything else are all made of thousands of intricate parts that he has designed and built himself. What a creator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/tim-storer-insists-he-wont-horse-trade-but-flags-boost-to-newstart-as-top-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:00:07Z","webTitle":"Tim Storer insists he won't horse-trade, but flags boost to Newstart as top goal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/tim-storer-insists-he-wont-horse-trade-but-flags-boost-to-newstart-as-top-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/tim-storer-insists-he-wont-horse-trade-but-flags-boost-to-newstart-as-top-goal","fields":{"headline":"Tim Storer insists he won't horse-trade, but flags boost to Newstart as top goal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The newly installed South Australian independent senator, Tim Storer, says he isn’t about backroom horse-trading, but he has identified achieving a boost to the Newstart payment as a key objective of his period in federal politics. Storer this week forced the Turnbull government to hit pause on its much vaunted big business tax cut, refusing to sign on until the Coalition countenanced broader tax and policy reform to accompany its proposal to cut the corporate rate from 30% to 25%. In a broad-ranging interview with Guardian Australia, Storer said he intended to assess all legislation on its merits rather than engaging in horse-trading, but he said he was clear about what he wanted to achieve during his time in Canberra. He said a boost to Newstart was a priority. “For me, it is a priority that I would like to take forward,” Storer said. “I’ve got 500 days from when I was declared as a senator to the end of the period. There will be an election in that of course, but yes, [boosting Newstart] is an issue I wish to take forward. “It’s obviously of personal interest to me. I’ve been struck by the implications over the last 25 years,” he said, adding that governments of all stripes were responsible for the current suboptimal level of the benefit. “Newstart has shrunk against average wages, median wages and the minimum wage and the pension. There are groups such as the Business Council of Australia, as well as KPMG and the Australian Council of Social Service and economists like Chris Richardson who have all made calls to link it with wages and increase it.” Storer said the Turnbull government’s standard response to arguments that the benefit was currently too low was to point out that Newstart recipients often received other forms of government payments, but he said even when that was taken into account, people were falling “$96 dollars short of the absolute minimum required to cover the basic cost of living”. The new senator also nominated accountability and transparency in government as a significant preoccupation. He said that policy interest drew him to Nick Xenophon. Storer was aligned with the NXT before splitting with them, and taking his place as an independent replacing Skye Kakoschke-Moore when she was felled by last year’s dual citizenship fracas. Storer also identifies an interest in trade and tourism and public infrastructure investment, as well as business development and transformation, to promote economic growth in South Australia and nationally. Storer is an economist, with an MBA from the Australian National University. He speaks fluent Mandarin, and before politics, ran an Asia-focused consultancy. Asked to summarise his political philosophy and values, Storer said he wants to promote “prosperity and fairness” during his period in public life, and will bring that rubric to considering legislation in his cross bench role. On the company tax cut, Storer said he was concerned the big business relief being proposed by the Coalition was inconsistent with the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy and provided only “modest economic benefits, relative to its cost”. He said the Henry tax review recommended a 25% tax rate for companies “but there were six or seven other signature reforms, which I believe have not been acted upon”. Storer suggested it would be hard to get him over the line on the company tax cut, given his current concerns, but if the government came back with a revised proposal “I will review what is put before me as a senator in legislation in the chamber”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/from-renters-to-peak-season-what-i-learned-from-the-worlds-reality-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T11:22:04Z","webTitle":"From Renters to Peak Season: what I learned from the world's reality TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/from-renters-to-peak-season-what-i-learned-from-the-worlds-reality-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/from-renters-to-peak-season-what-i-learned-from-the-worlds-reality-tv","fields":{"headline":"From Renters to Peak Season: what I learned from the world's reality TV","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thanks to the loosening up of pesky regulations, British holidaymakers will be able to watch some UK TV abroad. No more missed episodes of Corrie, no need to record your football team’s failures for consumption at a later date. As liberating as that is, it also means there is no need for a half-hearted attempt at watching the local TV – and that is a shame. When you look hard enough, you can find some bland but revealing fare. Renters is the best show about the travails of New Zealand property management companies you will ever see. All right, it is dull. Very dull. “One in three New Zealanders lives in rented accommodation,” is how a boring voiceover pitches the intro to every episode. The more lively plot arcs concern illegal soundproof panelling. It is so hypnotically, defiantly ordinary that if they showed it in Norway it would be Slow TV. Of course, that is only when Renters is considered as reality TV. As a travelogue, it is amazing. How do you really come to know a country? Via the haka and abseiling down fern-filled ravines? No, you do it by watching tenant managers kick defaulters out of Dunedin bungalows, put in claims to the Christchurch Earthquake Commission and pick drug spoons off abandoned hobs in Hamilton. Waved into this inner sanctum of New Zealand, we glimpse a culture where everything is civil, small society, olde worlde and humane. In one episode, there is a street full of student houses: the students are hosting an annual “kegger” that turns the entire road into a 500-pissheads party. At one house, the lettings agent comes to admonish them gently to be safe. They take the mucked-up carpets out of the deposit, but the overall attitude is just: “Well, kids have gotta have their fun, too.” In Blighty, the fun police would have tasered the lot within minutes. You can slog through all The Mekong River with Sue Perkins you like, but reality TV is by far the best way into a new culture. It takes you, literally, into the people’s living rooms. MasterChef Australia gives a picture of modern Oz a million miles away from dunnies and multiple Bruces. The show – far longer than its UK counterpart – is a brochure for the country that gave the world the flat white. (Yes, we know New Zealanders disagree.) This is the chi-chi, newly wealthy land of plenty, where a beer costs nine quid and Melbourne pastry chefs have achieved rock-star status. It is a land of fair go cheery multi-ethnicity and really strong video-editing skills. For opposite reasons, anyone touching down at Johannesburg’s OR Tambo International should already have a few episodes of Come Dine With Me South Africa on their iPad. In a deeply suburban country, this was the ideal franchise to lift the lid on the tensions sizzling behind the electric fences. When the well-spoken young gay black man comes for dinner in Camps Bay, take the best Sidney Poitier you have ever seen, multiply it by a thousand Get Outs and you are not even close. Yet for all the producers’ delight in pairing opposites, part of the joy is that it also revisiting the optimism of the Rainbow Nation and finding it in sound health. People are always trying – they are just trying across comically vast gulfs. When I lived in France, I learned all the best bits of the language from watching a dubbed version of Gordon Ramsay’s US Kitchen Nightmares – coyly, Gordon says: “O, la vache!” when he is effed-off (“Oh, the cow!”). Imagine my joy when I realised there was also a local version, in which pompous chef Philippe Etchebest, a Ramsay avatar carved from solid gammon, would turn up at failing Languedoc bistros to pontificate over the aligot. Etchebest’s vision of France shook off any last ooh la la cliches. The early seasons often seemed to be essays on rural poverty. France’s long economic stagnation was everywhere. There was a hopelessness that seeped from these dying mom’n’pop brasseries in the Alsace that the Americans never had. No one seemed to know much about food, either. Finally, my lunchtime experiences of dry pork medallions in salty gravy made sense. Sometimes, pairing a country with its opposite can make for the greatest insights. Dublin Wives – a “Real Housewives of” sub-marque – put a snooty, bitchy format into the world’s most collegiate and easygoing culture, with un-explosive results. MTV Canada’s Peak Season was billed as its answer to The Hills. The snowboarding scene is a cool backdrop, but the real heart of the affair is in Canadians desperately trying to act out US levels of conflict – all you need to know about the nation’s love-hate inferiority complex about its southern neighbour. “Whistler’s crazy and it makes people crazy,” as one character has it, without a drop of irony. Hearteningly in an ever-more-homogenised world, what franchised reality TV proves is that, deep down, even spewing youths spew in their local argot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/18/from-alice-isnt-dead-to-untold-the-best-podcasts-this-spring","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"From Alice Isn’t Dead to Untold: the best podcasts this spring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/18/from-alice-isnt-dead-to-untold-the-best-podcasts-this-spring","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/18/from-alice-isnt-dead-to-untold-the-best-podcasts-this-spring","fields":{"headline":"From Alice Isn’t Dead to Untold: the best podcasts this spring","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Untold – Cambridge Analytica Untold’s investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan was an iTunes chart topper and now the team have been busy looking into the still unfolding Cambridge Analytica scandal.

It’s the story of a woman whose body was found on a mountainside in Norway with all clues to her identity removed. Fifty years later, the real-life case has been reopened. Was she a spy? Why did she “move from hotel to hotel, country to country, like a ghost”? Marit Higraff and Neil McCarthy investigate. Available now, BBC World Service The Making Of A Massacre Pulitzer Prize winner Ginger Thompson has spent two years figuring out exactly what happened in a small border town in Mexico when hundreds of people caught up in a drugs war were killed by one of the world’s most violent drug-trafficking organisations. “These were not people who played with fire,” she says. “None of them had ever done anything to cross the drug cartels… but the massacre came out of nowhere like a lightning bolt and shattered their lives forever.” Her Longform podcast is worth listening to as a primer and the stories she wrote for Pro Publica, which use the oral history form, are mould breaking. The stories she tells about ordinary people who went missing or died are chilling, as is the theory that the 2011 massacre was triggered by the US war on drugs.

You could say it’s like Angels in America crossed with Howards End in that it deals with the bitter inheritance of Aids and the spiritual qualities of a house. That bald summary does scant justice, however, to a play that, in Stephen Daldry’s crystalline production, pierces your emotional defences, raises any number of political issues and enfolds you in its narrative. Lopez’s debt to EM Forster is palpable. There is even a character called Morgan who kickstarts the play by addressing a group of young men and effectively urging them to look in their hearts and write. This prompts a story about a young couple, Eric and Toby, that ripples outward. Eric is a kindly, humane lawyer who lives in a posh Upper West Side apartment. Toby, his longtime lover, is an egotistical, sharp-tongued writer whose success as a novelist and dramatist is based on the denial of his past. Their impending marriage is threatened both by Eric’s loss of the family apartment and by Toby’s fixation on Adam, the charismatic star of his play. This leads to the same clash of values that animates Howards End. The liberal Eric is drawn to a real-estate developer – named Henry Wilcox, like the embodiment of materialism in Forster’s book – who has recently lost his own partner, Walter. One of the best and funniest scenes shows Henry shocking a roomful of Eric’s left-leaning friends by declaring he is a Republican. As in Forster’s book, a property is pivotal. Walter always wanted Eric to have an upstate house he owned that, at the height of the Aids epidemic, he turned into a refuge for the dying. We wait to see whether Eric will ever come into his rightful inheritance. While Lopez’s play has a literary framework, it teems with life and incident: watching it, as a neighbour remarked, is like bingewatching a box-set. It tells multiple stories. One of the most intriguing shows the success-driven Toby becoming involved with a rent boy, Leo, who is not only a lookalike for Adam but also tests the moral probity of all who encounter him. Lopez is also unafraid to periodically stop the plot and clear the stage for an impassioned debate: one of the most intense is about the status of gay culture which, having fought so long against oppression, now finds itself in danger of being co-opted. It is Eric, however, who cuts through the swirling opinions by urging the need to honour the past while living fully in the present. This, in a nutshell, is the Forsterian message that emerges from the play. I admired its rollercoaster energy and high entertainment value, but I found its exclusive maleness limiting. The only woman we meet does not appear until the end, when Vanessa Redgrave makes a moving appearance as a mother who belatedly learned to love her gay son and who now cherishes Walter’s rural sanctuary. I also felt occasionally, as with Adam’s graphic description of his orgiastic experience in a Prague bathhouse, that Lopez was exhibiting his own virtuosity at the expense of the character’s believability. In Daldry’s production, staged on a Bob Crowley set that looks like a stripped Japanese table, the prime emphasis is on narrative clarity. The performances, from a mixed American-British cast, are also exemplary. Kyle Soller conveys every ounce of Eric’s instinctive decency and Andrew Burnap all of Toby’s sad selfishness. Samuel H Levine switches brilliantly between the fast-rising Adam and the sinking Leo and John Benjamin Hickey as Henry embodies the emotional isolation of the stinking rich. But the performance that best epitomises the play’s values is that of Paul Hilton who, as Morgan Forster and Walter, exudes a quiet humanity that suggests respect for the dead needs to be balanced by a love of the living. • At the Young Vic, London, until 19 May.

In a state ceremony that conveyed France’s pride and profound sadness, President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute on Wednesday to the officer who he said had the “gratitude, admiration and affection of the whole country”. It was the first time Macron had been called upon to deliver a state funeral homage since his election in May 2017. He stood grim-faced as the Marseillaise was played. His speech made reference to Joan of Arc, members of the French resistance and others who had died for the country. Before hundreds of people, including former presidents, government ministers, military officers and members of the public, Beltrame’s coffin was carried into the cour d’honneur at Les Invalides by 10 gendarmes who had known him. Hundreds more gathered outside. Beltrame’s képi, the gendarmerie’s headgear, in which he kept a photograph of himself with his wife, Marielle, and his decorations were carried by two officers. He was posthumously promoted to colonel and made a commander of the Légion d’Honneur. Beltrame was hailed a hero after volunteering on Friday to take the place of a female hostage being held by the suspected Islamist gunman Radouane Lakdim, 25, who had already killed three people. Lakdim hijacked a car, gunning down a passenger, then stormed a busy supermarket in the town of Trèbes near Carcassonne, killing a member of staff and a customer and declaring his allegiance to Islamic State. He was holding a 40-year-old woman hostage as police and special forces surrounded the building. Beltrame gave up his weapon and offered to take the place of the woman, named only as Julie, the mother of a two-year-old girl who worked on the checkout. After a three-hour siege, the gendarme was stabbed several times as he tried to disarm Lakdim. The gravely injured officer was flown by helicopter to hospital where he died a few hours later, his wife at his bedside. Macron spoke of the long minutes that passed as Beltrame’s colleagues watched as he “put down his weapon and walked alone to join the terrorist”. “With all his experience … he surely knew he had a rendezvous with death,” the president said. “He took this decision which was not just a sacrifice but was first of all being true to himself, true to his values and true to what he was and what he wanted to be. “He would not have allowed anyone to take his place, because he knew the example has to be set from the top… the light he has lit in us has not gone out.” Wednesday’s ceremony also honoured the terrorist’s three other victims: Christian Medvès, 50, who worked as a butcher at the Super-U in Trèbes; Hervé Sosna, 65, who was shopping when Lakdim shot him, and Jean Mazières, 61, a passenger in the hijacked car. The driver of the vehicle, Renato Silva, 26, was shot in the head and is in a critical condition in hospital. The funeral procession crossed Paris, stopping outside the Panthéon. The words engraved on the facade of the 18th-century former church where France’s great and good are buried had never seemed more appropriate: “To great men, a grateful country.” Before his tribute, Macron spoke briefly to Beltrame’s widow, Marielle, and the officer’s mother, Nicolle Nicolic-Beltrame. Beltrame and his wife were married in a civil ceremony in 2016 and were due to redeclare their vows in a church ceremony in June. The priest who was to have officiated at the wedding was called to Beltrame’s bedside where Marielle was keeping vigil on Friday evening to give him the last rites. Afterwards, his widow, a veterinarian, told La Vie newspaper he was an “ideal husband” and a devoted gendarme. “Arnaud was profoundly attached to what he called the ‘gendarmerie family’ for which he didn’t count the hours, or his engagement. He knew how to unite his men, to give them their momentum, to enable them to give the best of themselves. “He was motivated by very high moral values, the values of service, generosity, giving oneself, abnegation,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/28/pmqs-may-corbyn-britons-could-lose-right-to-urgent-medical-treatment-in-eu-after-brexit-peers-warn-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T18:37:11Z","webTitle":"David Gauke rejects claims MoJ should have launched its own Worboys legal challenge - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/28/pmqs-may-corbyn-britons-could-lose-right-to-urgent-medical-treatment-in-eu-after-brexit-peers-warn-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/28/pmqs-may-corbyn-britons-could-lose-right-to-urgent-medical-treatment-in-eu-after-brexit-peers-warn-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"David Gauke rejects claims MoJ should have launched its own Worboys legal challenge - Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has insisted that he did not know about a controversial £625,000 donation to a tiny, fellow pro-leave organisation when he was helping to run Vote Leave. Gove was co-convenor of Vote Leave’s campaign committee, but he said he did not know about the donation it made to BeLeave that is now at the centre of claims it broke campaign spending rules. Gove told Sky News: I wasn’t involved in the day to day running of the campaign, I was out there making the case for leaving the EU rather than managing the hidden wiring of the campaign. But I think this case has been investigated twice by the Electoral Commission since it occurred and I think on both those occasions the Electoral Commission said it’s quite right that one campaign can donate to another organisation, and indeed my understanding is that the remain campaign did pretty much the same thing. Others involved in running Vote Leave have insisted that the BeLeave donation was legitimate. In a post on his blog today, Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, said: Michael Gove was never on the board of Vote Leave ... Further neither Gove nor Boris [Johnson] had anything to do with such matters as legal compliance. Cummings has also used a blog post to hit back at the Guardian and the Observer over claims that Vote Leave broke election spending rules. In a long post, he addressed some of the claims made by Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, in his evidence to MPs yesterday and effectively accused the Guardian/Observer of hypocrisy (on the grounds that we have run online marketing masterclasses and that our app shares data with Facebook). Amid talk of “multiple legal actions”, he also restated his claim that Vote Leave did nothing wrong because it had written permission from the Electoral Commission to make the payment that it did make to BeLeave. (The commission did send Vote Leave an email saying in principle donations of this kind were fine. What is unclear is whether the commission would have agreed to this specific donation if it had known the full extent of collaboration between Vote Leave and BeLeave that has now been alleged. Cummings contests these allegations, and insists the arrangement was legitimate.) In his blog Cummings also claimed that what Vote Leave did was relatively simple. He said: As has been discussed publicly, what actually happened is relatively simple. Through a combination of focus groups and polling, we were aware that the people we wanted to reach were in particular demographic categories, basically ‘between 35-55, outside London and Scotland, excluding UKIP supporters and associated characteristics, and some other criteria’. We created ads, mainly focussed on the NHS, that AIQ put onto Facebook. These were targeted at this very broad segment of society, completely legitimately and with no use of American voter data (obviously!) to reach about 20% the voting population of the UK. Our use of so-called micro-targeting was minimal. Further, we made ZERO use of so-called ‘psychographic’ marketing because our campaign was informed by looking at what serious science suggests works and Big5/OCEAN profiling for politics is very marginal (and expensive) at best. Theresa May has used a phone call with Donald Trump to welcome his decision to expel 60 Russian diplomats from the US. A Downing Street spokesman said: The PM said the US had delivered a very strong response and welcomed the breadth of international action in response to Russia’s reckless and brazen behaviour – with 26 countries now putting expulsions in place. The prime minister welcomed the temporary exemption to steel and aluminium tariffs announced by the US last week in relation to the European Union. She said she looked forward to constructive talks taking place between the EU and the US on making the exemption permanent. A Labour and a Conservative MP have written to Britain’s most senior tax collector complaining that a substantial proportion of shares in GKN, the target of a hostile takeover bid, are being controlled by short-term investors in such a way that they will not have to pay tax if their shares are acquired by Melrose. Leaders of the Jewish organisations that organised Monday night’s protest against antisemitism in the Labour party have told Jeremy Corbyn that until he stops the abuse of the MPs and peers who attended it, they will not accept his invitation to meet them. As Anne Perkins reports, several MPs have been attacked by the leftwing blog, the Skwawkbox, while David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, may face a deselection challenge from his local party. In a letter to Corbyn, Jonathan Arkush and Jonathan Goldstein, the leaders of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said: Those Labour party members and Labour-supporting blogs pushing the abuse are largely doing so in your name. They need to hear you say, publicly and your own voice that we had every right to protest about antisemitism, and that Labour MPs had every right to support us … that anyone directing abused, intimidation or threats at those of us who oppose anti-semitism is damaging your efforts to eliminate it. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. As well as introducing us to the concept of a ‘blah, blah, blah’ divorce, Emily Thornberry’s comments (see 3.24pm) are interesting because they could be seen as a sign that Labour is gearing up to vote in favour of the final Brexit withdrawal agreement in the autumn. She said: The difficulty with a meaningful vote in October - which we have secured - is what is it that we are going to be agreeing on ? We have our six tests. If you hold up ‘blah, blah, blah’ to the six tests, it will probably pass it ... In a speech on Monday Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that Labour wants to amend the EU withdrawal bill so that MPs will get a proper “meaningful vote” on the final deal in the autumn. He wants to ensure that, if MPs reject the deal, parliament gets to decide what happens next, so that ministers could be sent back to Brussels to try to get a better deal. But the government says, if MPs vote against, the UK will simply leave without a deal. It has always said this implicitly, but recently it has become much more explicit about this. (See what Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said in the Lords earlier this month, or what the prime minister’s spokesman said at lobby on Monday.) Given that EU leaders are unlikely to be keen to reopen the negotiations only a few months before Brexit day, the government’s argument is quite plausible. That might be leading Labour figures to conclude that they will have to support the deal in the end. Thornberry’s comment today follows a report that Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told a private meeting last week that, if parliament voted down the deal, the UK would just “crash out of the EU” regardless, implying Labour would have to vote in favour of the agreement. (Gardiner contested Adam Payne’s Business Insider story, claiming his remarks had been taken out of contest, but his protest was not especially convincing, not least because Payne quoted a Labour leadership source saying Gardiner was just reflecting party policy.) Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has been speaking at Chatham House today. She predicted that the Brexit withdrawal agreement would be so vague that it would amount to little more than a ‘blah, blah, blah’ divorce. She said: What we have said is quite clearly you cannot negotiate everything before the divorce. We need to have an interim period when the status quo prevails. So the question then is, what is the nature of the divorce? So far if the evidence of the past few months is anything to go on, it is going to be a ‘blah, blah, blah’ divorce. It is not going to make any decisions, it is going to continue to kick things down the road. We don’t seem to have come to any difficult decisions at the moment. So the difficulty with a meaningful vote in October - which we have secured - is what is it that we are going to be agreeing on ? We have our six tests. If you hold up ‘blah, blah, blah’ to the six tests, it will probably pass it and then we leave the EU and then we are in the status quo and during that period there has to be a negotiation as to what our final relationship is going to be. So I just hope upon hope we have a general election in the meantime and the grown-ups turn up, so it is decree nisi rather than a decree absolute. The Commons culture committee has announced that Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended from his post after the recent Channel 4 News/Observer revelations about its activities, will appear before it on Tuesday 17 April. He has already given evidence before to the committee as part of its fake news inquiry, but he has been recalled to explain discrepancies between what he said in evidence and what has been subsequently revealed about CA’s reliance on Facebook data. David Gauke, the justice secretary, has defended his decision not to launch a judicial review on behalf of the Ministry of Justice of the Parole Board’s decision to release the black cab rapist John Worboys. He considered going to judicial review, but decided against. Instead two victims, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and the Sun newspaper did launch a judicial review, and today succeeded in blocking Worboys’ release. In a statement to MPs Gauke said that if he had gone to court himself, he could have reduced the chances of the victims winning. He said he considered a challenge on the basis that the Parole Board’s decision was irrational, but was told this was probably fail. He went on: I also received advice on the failure of process argument [the argument that the Parole Board did not follow proper processes - an argument used in court by the victims and Khan] and was advised that this was not one that I as secretary of state would have been able to successfully advance. The victims were better placed to make this argument and this was the argument on which they have won their case. It is right that the actions of ministry officials, as well as the Parole Board, in this important and unusual case have been laid open to judicial scrutiny. I have always said I fully support the right of victims to bring this action. I’ve been very concerned at every point not to do anything to hinder the victims’ right to challenge and to bring their arguments and their personal evidence before the court. Indeed, the judgment suggests that had I brought the case, the standing of the victims may have been compromised. In the Commons Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney judgment, backed Gauke’s position. He said that if Gauke had launched a judicial review, it would probably have failed, and he could have prevented others from bringing a case. Victims of the serial sex attacker John Worboys have succeeded in forcing the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to release him from prison. The chair of the Parole Board, Nick Hardwick, has resigned as judges overturned a decision to release the rapist John Worboys from jail. Jeremy Corbyn has challenged the prime minister over failings in mental health services, saying: “Too many of our fellow citizens suffer alone because there are not enough staff to help them at a moment of crisis.” Households will be hit with the steepest council tax rise in 14 years from April, with the average household in England paying £81 more at a time when most local authorities are driving though big cuts to services. Theresa May has agreed to look into imposing a ban on the City of London from helping Russia to sell its sovereign debt, which prop ups the Russian economy. The niece of the poisoned former Russian spy Sergei Skripal has said he and his daughter Yulia have only a slim chance of surviving. The head of the Army, General Sir Nick Carter, is to be the new Chief of the Defence Staff, the government has announced. As the Press Association reports, Gen Carter will succeed Air Marshal Sir Stuart Peach when he stands down as Britain’s most senior military officer in June to become chairman of Nato’s military committee. The announcement of Gen Carter’s appointment comes just two month after he publicly entered the debate over defence spending, warning the UK was in danger of being left behind by adversaries like Russia. Labour MPs in Yorkshire and Humber have given their support to Dan Jarvis, the backbencher who is defying the Labour leadership and refusing to stand down after being chosen as the party’s candidate for Sheffield city region mayor. A new Labour party rule introduced very recently says he should stand down as an MP because MPs can no longer hold separate elected positions in the party. But Jarvis, a centrist who at one time was seen as a potential leadership challenger to Jeremy Corbyn, is refusing to give up his parliamentary seat. These are from the Yorkshire Post’s Arj Singh. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, told the World at One that he was “appalled” that Jews don’t have faith in Labour. He told the programme: I’m appalled and heartbroken that Londoners of Jewish faith don’t feel the Labour party’s for them. I think the Labour party needs to do much more. It’s the Labour party’s responsibility. Jeremy is the leader but it’s the Labour party’s responsibility to take decisive, swift action against those members of our party against whom allegations have been made. The prime minister’s official spokesman said she had full confidence in justice secretary David Gauke and that, despite not launching his own judicial review of Worboys’ release, he had made it clear throughout that he supported the victims in their decision to do so. On the prospect of a ring-fenced NHS tax, he referred to May’s words in the Commons on the government’s “balanced approach” to public spending which included “ensuring that we keep taxes as low as we can”. Asked whether that was a hint that hypothecation was off the table, he said: You had her words yesterday, you have her words today in the House about our balanced approach. Ultimately the government policy going forward is part of that approach to the economy. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying for PMQs. Generally there is quite a lot of praise for the way Corbyn raised mental health, but he is also being criticised for not raising the Worboys case. Some people think he should have attacked David Gauke, the justice secretary, for not taking the Parole Board’s decision to judicial review himself. (Gauke says he was advised that a legal challenge was “highly unlikely to succeed”. But a legal challenge did succeed. UPDATE: See 2.27pm for more on this.) From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire From the Times’ Patrick Kidd From Sky’s Lewis Goodall From the Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman From the Guardian’s Pippa Crerar From the Independent’s Tom Peck From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope This is what the Press Association has filed on the May/Corbyn exchanges. Jeremy Corbyn asked Theresa May to explain why there are “5,000 fewer mental health nurses” than in 2010. The Labour leader used PMQs to raise concerns about mental health care after a health trust was fined 2 million after neglect at a care unit led to the “completely avoidable” deaths of two vulnerable patients. He paid tribute to the families of Connor Sparrowhawk and Teresa Colvin who died while in the care of Southern Health NHS Trust and asked: “How confident is the prime minister that deaths like Connor’s and Teresa’s could not happen today?” And he went on to ask: “Could the prime minister explain why there are 5,000 fewer mental health nurses than there were in 2010?” May also paid tribute to the families “for the way in which they have campaigned on this particular issue” and said lessons had been learnt by the health and care system as a result of the failings of Southern Health. She added: “We have already committed to improving mental health services on the ground: we are putting extra money into mental health services and I am pleased to say that around 1,400 more people are accessing mental health services every day compared to when we came into power.” Corbyn repeatedly raised funding concerns over mental health services, particularly for children, and used his final remarks to call for the PM to ring-fence NHS mental health budgets. He said: “Mental health affects us all and it’s welcome there’s much less stigma surrounding mental health, however, our NHS is in crisis. The crisis is particularly acute in mental health services. “Despite legislating for parity of esteem, the government has failed to fund it. “We have fewer resources for mental health trusts, fewer mental health nurses, fewer child and adolescent psychiatrists. “So will the prime minister commit to ring-fencing NHS mental health budgets to support those going through a mental health crisis at a time they most need our help and our support?” May said the NHS is receiving extra funding for mental health and other services, adding: “Since November, [chancellor Philip Hammond] has announced an extra £10bn which is going in to our NHS over the next few years.” Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, used his questions to ask about election spending. He started by saying: Does the prime minister agree with me that transparency in political campaign spending and the integrity of electoral laws across the UK must be upheld, and will the prime minister join with me in saying all allegations of improper spending during the EU referendum must be fully investigated? May said the Electoral Commission had already investigated these allegations. Blackford than asked about donations to the DUP. The DUP received £425,000 from the Conservative-run Constitutional Research Council, chaired by Richard Cook, former vice-chair of the Scottish Tories. We know some of the money was given to AIQ, a reported franchise of [Cambridge Analytica] ... The shady business of data mining and undermining electoral law goes right to the heart of the prime ministers party. Will the prime minister give full details between the transactions of the DUP and the Scottish Tory-linked CRC? May said the Electoral Commission had looked at this twice, but that it should consider any new evidence. If there is an allegation of criminal activity that should be taken to the police” My understanding is the Electoral Commission continue to investigate these and will continue to do so. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Labour’s Liz Twist says she will be meeting De La Rue workers from her constituency today. Will May promise no decision on the passport contract until after the recess. May says a final decision has not been announced, but a preferred bidder has been announced. The Home Office is following the proper process, she says. May says all MPs should make it clear there is no place for racial hatred or hate crime in our society, whether it is Islamophobia or antisemitism. Labour’s Jack Dromey says 209 years of GKN history will be decided in the next 24 hours. There is evidence of a hedge fund scam to buy shares in GKN while avoiding paying tax on the shares that will decide its future, he says. May says Greg Clark, the business secretary, has sought assurances from the prospective GKN purchasers. If Dromey has evidence of illegal activity, he should report it to the police, she says. Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative, asks about the Worboys ruling. May says she has the greatest sympathy for his victims. She welcome the judgment. She says David Gauke, the justice secretary, will make a statement on this shortly. Gauke has now made it clear that he will abolish the rule saying the Parole Board cannot give reasons for its decisions. Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP, asks about a Syrian refugee at school in her constituency who cannot go on a school trip because he does not have the right documents. May says the home secretary will look into this. Caroline Spelman, a Conservative, asks May to congratulate those behind the exhibition in the Commons about Yazidi women held in conditions of slavery. May says she wants to ensure these women are freed. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, asks May to confirm that it will not be possible to introduce a hard border by the end of 2020. So will May seek a customs arrangement similar to staying in the customs union. That is a reference to what May told the Commons liaison committee yesterday. May says she wants trade to be as frictionless as possible. It is not completely frictionless today. The government has put forward plans. She says the government is putting steps in place to ensure the new system is ready by the end of the transition. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says the Cambridge Analytica revelations suggest there is something rotten in the heart of our democracy. Will May ensure that the regulatory framework for elections is fit for the digital age. May says the Cambridge Analytica revelations are concerning. People should feel confident about what happens to their data, she says. May says she can announce today that the government is giving the Ministry of Defence £600m for MoD Dreadnought submarine programme. It is also getting another £200m, she says. She says the UK continues to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Alan Brown, the SNP MP, says Boris Johnson was the figurehead for the Vote Leave campaign. And Michael Gove was co-convenor. Dominic Cummings says AggregateIQ were essential to the campaign. How does May feel about them using immoral data mining tactics? May says those allegations have been denied. She says if anyone is suggesting the outcome of the referendum was invalid, she does not accept that. Craig Mackinlay, a Conservative, asks about dental care in his constituency. May says NHS England will be offering dental services when the practice mentioned by Mackinlay closes. PMQs - Snap verdict: The last two weeks have been the best for May since the general election (given the wide praise she has had for her stance on Russia, the diplomatic coup she achieved with the co-ordinated spy expulsions, and Brexit moving forward), and perhaps the worst for Corbyn (antisemitism and Russia), but this afternoon the May resurgence came to a shuddering halt as Corbyn comprehensively and gracefully upended her at PMQs. He picked a second-tier public policy issue where the government’s record is weak and focused on specific questions, not party policy rhetoric - often the best way for the opposition leader to score a hit at PMQs. But he did it well, picking up on points that May made when she replied, and he adopted a more-in-sorrow-than-anger tone (giving credit to May for caring about this, paying tribute to the police) that enhanced his credibility. Crucially, though, he was on winning grounds on points of substance. May just couldn’t answer his argument about how the commitment to mental health parity in the NHS has not been matched by parity of funding. May seemed to run out of things to say after her second answer and towards the end she made a particularly far-fetched attempt to make a connection between mental health and the activities of Corbynite Twitter trolls - although she did not quite have the courage to make the link explicit, and in the end her insinuation was left hanging. Corbyn acknowledges the work the police do. But his point is there should be more professionals. The number of child and adolescant psychiatrists has fallen by 6%, he says. May says the government is addressing this. But there is a wider issue here. When she goes to talk to young people, when she hears about them, one of the issue that she hears about is the use of social media. She hopes Corbyn will join with him in saying social media should not be used in a way that contributes to mental health problems. Corbyn says he hopes May will support Labour’s digital bill which will ensure adequate protections for young people. He mentions a letter from someone waiting months for treatment. NHS affects us all, he says. It is in crisis, and that is particularly acute in mental health services. Will May commit to ring-fencing mental health services? May says the NHS is receiving extra funding. An extra £10bn is going in, she says. That is because the government has adopted a balanced approach to the economy. Labour’s approach would mean increased debt, and ordinary people would pay the price. Corbyn says the government did introduce parity for mental health in the NHS. But that was after a Labour amendment was accepted in the Lords. And the money never followed. Corbyn says he accepts May’s concern. But money has not followed. He says analysis shows mental health trust have less money than five years ago. May says more people are accessing mental health. Spending has increased to a record £11.6bn. She criticises Labour MPs for “chuntering”. Dealing with mental health means addressing it in various way. Corbyn says mental health spending fell between 2010 and 2015. Too often problems have to be dealt with by friends or relatives. Spending is too low. Why is only 5% of the budget spend on children and young people, when they make up 20% of the population? May says spending on mental health services for young people is going up. And she is taking action in other areas, she says. As home secretary she addressed the problem of mental health patients being held in cells. There has been a dramatic reduction. Jeremy Corbyn says this week is autism awareness week. He mentions two families whose loved ones, Teresa Colvin and Conor Sparrowhawk, died while they are in care. Is May confident these cases could not happen again? May says she hopes the lessons from these cases have been learnt. A report into Souther Health is due later this year. Corbyn asks why there are 5,000 fewer mental health services now than in 2010. May says more money is being put into mental health services. Some 1,400 more people are accessing mental health services ever day under this government. This is about the NHS, but about services in the community too. She says she was pleased to launch an initiative for mental health training in schools. Mike Wood, a Conservative, asks May to reject Labour’s calls to scrap the council tax referendum lock. May says in Wood’s Conservative-led Dudley council area people pay among the lowest council tax in the West Midlands. Theresa May starts by wishing everyone a happy Easter. (There is a two-week recess starting after tomorrow.) PMQs is about to start. Have you noticed how Boris Johnson’s tweets are starting to read more and more like Donald Trump’s? Commenting on Theresa May’s announcement yesterday that she is planning a long-term funding increase for the NHS, he posted this on Twitter. That double exclamation mark is pure Trump. Johnson is also emulating Trump’s approach to accuracy. As we have pointed out many times before, mainstream economists don’t think there will be a Brexit dividend. “Brexit is likely to mean less money for public services, including the NHS, than otherwise would have been the case,” the Institute for Fiscal Studies said recently, arguing that any saving to the Exchequer from not having to contribute to the EU budget will not compensate from the tax revenue lost by the impact Brexit will have on lowering growth. Johnson is also ignoring the fact that his colleagues believe extra money for the NHS will have to come from higher taxes. In fact, Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said as much at the weekend, telling ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “In the end if we are going to get more resources into the NHS and social care system, it will have to come through the tax system and also through growth in the economy.” Higher taxes? Johnson did not mention that on the Vote Leave bus. Here is the full text of Nick Hardwick’s resignation letter at head of the Parole Board. It was addressed to David Gauke, the justice secretary, and dated yesterday. In it, Hardwick says that he was told by Gauke his position was “untenable”. He says that he was not on the panel that decided to release John Worboys and that he thought he was capable of leading the Parole Board through the changes now required. (He told a committee in February that he wanted the board to be allowed to explain the reasons for its decisions to the public.) But he says he will not “pass the buck”. He also says this affair raises “very troubling questions about how the board’s independence can be safeguarded”. That amounts to saying that he feels he has been sacked, and that this is an abuse of ministerial power Dear Secretary of State We met this afternoon to consider the implications of the judgment in the Worboys case. I want to repeat my admiration for the courage and tenacity of the women who brought the judicial review. Their success will have consequences that go far beyond this individual case and will benefit victims and the administration of justice for years to come. I am very pleased that the court declared the Rule that prohibits the Parole Board from explaining its decisions should go and that the judgment recognised that this was something I had been calling for. I am pleased too that as a result of Dame Glenys Stacy’s investigation into victim communication in the case, these processes will be improved in future and that she made no criticism of the Parole Board’s actions in this matter. I am also confident that as a result of this case a much simpler system for reviewing Parole Board decisions will be established and, as I have already made clear in my submission to you, this is something I would very much welcome. Consistent with these principles, I have been clear throughout the legal processes that followed the decision in the Worboys case that I welcomed the scrutiny to which it was subject. I instructed that there should be no procedural moves to prevent such scrutiny, as the judgment indicated could have been made, and that our disclosure of material relating to the case should be as full as possible. I am as anxious as everyone else that the correct decision should be made. The court was critical of some aspects of the panel’s decision-making processes although it did not overturn the panel’s decisions on these grounds. It could not, no more than you or I, put itself in the place of the expert and experienced panel members who heard the evidence and made the decision. The court did however find that the panel’s understanding that it could not go beyond the offences for which Worboys was convicted was mistaken in this “difficult, troubling case with many exceptional features”. I shared the panel’s misapprehension in this matter and this was supported by the advice I received. We were wrong. You told me that you thought my position was untenable. I had no role in the decision of the panel in the case and believe I am capable of leading the Parole Board through the changes, many of which I have advocated, that will now be necessary. I am sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case but I have always made it clear that I will support the members and staff of the Board in the very difficult individual decisions they make and I will accept accountability for the work of the Board. I will not pass the buck to those who work under me. In these circumstances I inform you of my decision to resign with immediate effect. In conclusion, I want to state my concern about the independence of the Board. I believe this matter raises very troubling questions about how the Board’s independence can be safeguarded. I hope parliament will consider what structural changes are necessary to ensure this independence is protected in future. Nick Hardwick Chairman, The Parole Board for England and Wales In a statement David Gauke, the justice secretary, said he welcomed the high court decision. He said: I welcome today’s judgment and congratulate the victims who brought this unprecedented legal action. I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my heartfelt sympathy for all they, and the other victims, have suffered as a result of Worboys’ hideous crimes. I took expert legal advice from leading counsel on whether I should bring a challenge. The bar for judicial review is set high. I considered whether the decision was legally rational - in other words, a decision which no reasonable Parole Board could have made. The advice I received was that such an argument was highly unlikely to succeed. And, indeed, this argument did not succeed. However, the victims succeeded in a different argument. Gauke also the Parole Board secrecy rule, rule 25, would now be abolished. He said this would happen “as soon as possible after the Easter recess”. And he also said he intended to bring forward proposals to allow Parole Board decisions to be challenged. He went on: I intend to consult on the detail of these proposals by the end of April alongside other proposals to improve the way that victims are kept informed about the parole process. I will make a statement to Parliament this afternoon and set out our response to the judgment - and our next steps - in more detail. The Sun newspaper was one of the parties that sought a judicial review of the Parole Board’s decision. Its legal challenge focused on the claim that rule 25, the secrecy rule (see 11.05am), was unlawful. In a statement it said: First and foremost this is a day for the victims, who have fought bravely to take this case to court. But it is also a victory for transparency and for the free press in a matter of profound public interest. Today’s ruling is a landmark judgment in favour of open justice and will allow the decisions of the Parole Board to be subject to the scrutiny they deserve. This case has shown all too clearly the value of that work. This is from the BBC’s Norman Smith. Here are extract’s from the high court’s summary of its judgment (pdf). On why the decision to release John Worboys was flawed We uphold the challenge by DSD and NBV [the two Worboys victims who took the case to judicial review], as we have slightly reformulated it, to the rationality of the decision of the Parole Board directing the release of Mr Radford on the basis that it should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending and, in particular, the extent to which the limited way in which he has described his offending may undermine his overall credibility and reliability. That is so even in relation to the offences of which he was convicted, let alone any other offending. In the light of our decision, the release direction will be quashed and Mr Radford’s case remitted to the Parole Board for fresh determination before a differently constituted panel. On what the Parole Board should do next It is for the Parole Board to decide the procedure appropriate to the redetermination of Mr Radford’s case, taking into account the terms of this judgment, including the observations we have made regarding the need to undertake further inquiry. We would add that consideration should also be given by the Parole Board in a case of this complexity and prominence to whether a serving or retired judge should chair the panel. We must emphasise that we have not held, nor must we be understood as suggesting, that Mr Radford’s present risk is such that his continued imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public, or that the Parole Board should so find. Subject only to the review jurisdiction of this Court, the assessment of all the available evidence, and all matters relevant to Mr Radford’s risk, is for the Parole Board alone to make. On why the Parole Board should abandon its secrecy rule and explain its decisions to the public We also uphold the Claimants’ challenge to the vires of Rule 25(1) of the Parole Board Rules 2016 [the rule saying the board cannot publish information about its proceedings]. In the circumstances it will be for the Secretary of State for Justice (as it may be that he is minded to do) to decide how Rule 25 should be reformulated in the light of our Judgment. There are no obvious reasons why the open justice principle should not apply to the Parole Board in the context of providing information on matters of public concern to the very group of individuals who harbour such concern, namely the public itself. Indeed, it seems to us that there are clear and obvious reasons why the Parole Board should do so. This information can readily be provided in a fashion which in no way undermines the Article 8 rights of the prisoner and the confidentiality which attaches to it. Our conclusion is that the open justice principle, or more particularly the right in the public to receive information which flows from the operation of that principle, applies to the proceedings of the Parole Board. Here is the official summary of today’s high court judgment (pdf). And here is the judgment in full (pdf). Here is my colleague Owen Bowcott’s decision about the high court decision. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, sought a judicial review of the decision to release John Worboys along with two of Worboys’ victims. In a statement about today’s high court decision, he welcomes it and says his priority has been to keep Londoners safe. This is from Lord Falconer, a former Labour justice secretary and lord chancellor. More on the court decision ... This is from the legal blogger Carl Gardner. We are now getting the Warboys ruling. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has published council tax figures for England for 2018-19 (pdf). Here are the headline figures. The average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2018-19 will be £1,671 which is an increase of £81 or 5.1% on the 2017-18 figure of £1,591. In 2018-19, 148 out of 152 adult social care authorities will utilise some or all of the 3% adult social care precept flexibility when setting their council tax. This additional flexibility accounts for £30 of the average Band D council tax bill. The average area Band D council tax will be £1,405 in London (an increase of £55 when compared to 2017-18), £1,658 in metropolitan areas (+£83), £1,728 (+£88). Here is our story on Nick Hardwick’s resignation. More from the BBC’s Danny Shaw. This is from my colleague Alan Travis. There will be a ministerial statement on the Parole Board and the Worboys case later, according to Labour whips. This is from the BBC’s Danny Shaw. At 10.30am the high court is due to give its decision in the case brought by victims of the rapist John Worboys who are challenging the Parole Board’s decision to release him. Q: Are the new 1,000 border staff just backfilling vacancies? It is a combination of that and new posts, says Rudd. She says she will write to the committee with details. Rudd says the Home Office is today launching an advertising campaign because it wants to recruit an extra 1,000 border staff. Cooper says it is “baffling” that Rudd does not have more of a plan on immigration. Q: Are you still committed to the migration target (getting annual net migration below 100,000)? Rudd says she is still committed to getting net migration to sustainable levels. Q: Is that a yes or a no? Rudd says she has given her answer. Rudd refuses to say government still committed to getting annual net migration below 100,000. Q: Can you confirm that you are not aiming to get net EU migration from plus 90,000 to minus 50,000? Rudd says she wants to get migration down, consistent with protecting businesses and universities. Cooper says that her committee published a report saying it was important for the government to be honest and open with the public about immigration. Q: Are you being honest and open with the public about this? Rudd says what the public wants is a government committed to getting immigration down. Q: You set out a timetable for the immigration white paper. That does not fit with the timetable for the EU negotiations (which are supposed to wrap up by the autumn.) Rudd says David Davis can brief parliament. Q: Have you not taken any view at all as to what the best immigration objectives could be? Rudd says her objective has been to ensure May and Davis have the best information they need to take decisions on this. Yvette Cooper steps in. Q: You say you will come up with options for immigration. Have you a recommendation for Theresa May and David Davis? No, says Rudd. It will be for them to decide. Q: What is the government’s current position? It is for the prime minister to decide, says Rudd. Q: So is there no proposal as to whether or not immigration will be included as a feature of the future trade relationship. (It is not clear yet whether the trade deal will cover immigration, and whether there will be preferential access for EU nationals.) Rudd says this is a matter for the prime minister. Stuart McDonald, an SNP MP, is asking questions. He says the draft withdrawal treaty still includes a provision saying EU nationals staying in the UK will require comprehensive health insurance. This requirement was supposed to have been dropped. Rudd says she does not know why that is still in the draft treaty. She says she will look into this. Rudd confirms that the immigration white paper has been delayed. But she says that reflects the fact there was an agreement on citizens’ rights in the UK-EU deal agreed in December. Q: When the white paper is published, will it set out the government’s view on what the new immigration system should be? Or will it contain options? Rudd says it will be published at the end of the year. She says she will say more about its contents nearer the time. Rudd says immigration white paper will not be published until end of the year. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair, opens the session by asking about the four reports from the chief inspector of borders. (See 9.35am.) She says the committee asked to get them ahead of today’s hearing. Has the committee had them? No, says Amber Rudd. She says they are being published to parliament first. She says, if the committee wants her to reconsider this procedure, she will think about it. Cooper says the committee would like to be able to question her about them. Can we assume these reports are not complimentary to the Home Office? Rudd says they are being published in the normal way. Cooper says the previous chief inspector of borders was so worried that the Home Office was sitting on his report that he took independent legal advice. Rudd says that was the previous inspector. She says the committee will be able to ask her about them in the future. Cooper says she hopes this serves as a klaxon to journalists, and she advises them to study what is in the reports carefully. This is from the Sun’s Steve Hawkes. Hawkes is referring to the fact that four reports from the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration are due to be published at 2.30pm. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is about to give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. She will be appearing alongside Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office permanent secretary. According to the committee, MPs want to ask about these topics. The Salisbury incident Police resources and responses to current demand Implications of the Parson’s Green terrorist incident Domestic violence and abuse Modern slavery Knife, gun and gang crime Social media I will be monitoring the hearing for highlights. You can watch it here. Will Britons still have the right to receive urgent medical treatment when they travel to the continent after Brexit? At the moment they can, using the European health insurance card (EHIC). And the government wants to ensure that Britons can still be part of the EHIC scheme after Brexit. But this has not been negotiated yet and, in a report published this morning, the House of Lords EU select committee says that it is “unconvinced” that the government will get what it wants. Here is the key passage from the report. In the absence of an agreement on future relations, the rights to reciprocal healthcare currently enjoyed by 27 million UK citizens, thanks to the European health insurance card, will cease after Brexit. Other rights, provided for by the S2 scheme and Patients’ Rights Directive, which cover planned treatment in other EU member states, will also come to an end. We therefore remain unconvinced that reciprocal healthcare for people falling outside the scope of the joint report [the UK-EU agreement reached in December] can continue in its current form. Without more detail from the government about how exactly it intends to maintain reciprocal healthcare arrangements or provide a suitable replacement, this report argues that we should not take the future of UK-EU reciprocal healthcare for granted. Because reciprocal healthcare benefits derive from freedom of movement, we agree with our witnesses that it is difficult to square the government’s ambitions for reciprocal healthcare with its stated aim of ending freedom of movement of people from the EU. As usual, we’ll probably get more Brexit during the day. Here is the agenda. 9.30am: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 9.30am: The ministry for housing, communities and local government publishes council tax figures. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.

Viktoria Skripal said the prognosis for both “really isn’t good” following the novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. She told the BBC: “Out of 99% I have maybe 1% of hope. Whatever it was has given them a very small chance of survival. But they’re going to be invalids for the rest of their lives.” She also revealed that Skripal’s mother had not been told of the incident, adding: “The first priority was to protect our granny so that she wouldn’t hear or find out anything.” Countries across the world have joined the UK in taking diplomatic action against Russia, which has been blamed for the attack. Theresa May said the “unprecedented series of expulsions” of Russian diplomats sent a strong message to Moscow that it could not ignore international law. Briefing the cabinet on Tuesday, the prime minister reported that 23 countries had expelled more than 115 Russian intelligence diplomats. She told her colleagues this demonstrated to the Kremlin “that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security”. The Russian embassy in the UK said the prime minister had still not presented evidence that the country was responsible for the poisonings, adding that “no one in the wider world would take British words for granted”. On Wednesday, Ireland became the 24th country to join the the UK in taking diplomatic action against the Kremlin. Nato announced it was cutting the size of its Russian mission by a third, removing accreditation from seven Russian staff and rejecting three other pending applications. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said the permanent size of the Russian mission would be cut from 30 to 20 people, adding that the gesture was “a clear and very strong message that there was a cost to Russia’s reckless actions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/cricket-gave-us-hope-a-place-dont-we-deserve-better-we-do-not","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T07:03:05Z","webTitle":"Cricket gave us hope, a place.

The event was “overflowing with a harmonious and intimate atmosphere from its beginning to the end”, North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA, breathlessly reported. The pageantry of Kim’s surprise visit to Beijing, confirmed only after he left China on Wednesday, obscures a strained relationship between the two long-time communist allies. China’s state news agency, Xinhua, was careful to describe the visit as “unofficial”. “It was ‘unofficial’ probably because Xi is still angry and frustrated that Kim has shown an utter lack of respect for China’s interests and for Xi personally,” said Michael Kovrig, senior adviser for north-east Asia at the International Crisis Group, an independent conflict-prevention organisation. “Kim is not out of the doghouse yet.” Since taking power in 2011, Kim has conducted more than 85 missile tests, one of which was believed to be deliberately timed to upstage a Brics summit in China last September. As a result of North Korea’s provocations, China has backed increasingly tough international sanctions on Pyongyang as well as cut coal and other imports from the country. China accounts for more than 90% of North Korea’s overall trade and also provides food aid and energy assistance to Pyongyang. This was Kim’s first invitation to meet with Xi in China since coming to power. Kim’s visit doesn’t so much mark an improvement in ties as it does China’s determination not to be sidelined. The trip comes ahead of talks in April between Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and the US president, Donald Trump, possibly in May. “By being the first leader to meet Kim, Xi is decisively showing who is boss in north-east Asia. In the past, China might have let the US drive the process as long as it was consulted. Clearly, Xi has decided China needs to shape the process early and discuss directly with Kim how he thinks that should go,” Kovrig said. China has often said it does not have as much leverage over North Korea as many believe. Kim’s visit to China before meeting Trump and Moon indicates just the opposite. “Next time, the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs says the real issue is between the US and North Korea, and that China is just a mediator or just wants stability, we will know they are lying,” Robert E Kelly, the associate professor at the department of political science and diplomacy at Pusan National University in South Korea, wrote in a blogpost for the Lowy Institute. Just how unified the two countries are over North Korea’s nuclear programme is unclear. Xinhua reported Kim saying he was “committed to denuclearisation on the peninsula”, but Korean state media failed to mention such comments, analysts said. For Kim, the trip not only bolsters his image at home as a powerful statesman – negotiating with the world’s great powers – it also opens avenues for limited reform. Kim was taken to see an “innovation exhibition” at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. During the previous generation of Chinese and North Korean leadership, Kim Jong-il, Kim’s father, also toured industrial sites in China, a sign that Beijing hoped to push its ally toward Chinese-style economic reforms. “It’s what the Chinese seem to want for Kim Jong-un – a tangible realisation that ‘opening up and reform’ along Dengist lines with special economic zones and foreign investment while maintaining iron parameters on civil society, is one pathway to relative wealth and power,” Adam Cathcart, a researcher in Chinese-North Korean relations at the University of Leeds, said, referring to the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who helped open the Chinese economy by designating areas of the country for capitalist market-driven reforms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/01/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-steep","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T08:00:14Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'steep'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/01/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-steep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/01/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-steep","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'steep'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘steep.’ Share your photos of what steep means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

Bedfordshire police said they have taken the measures to raise awareness about the negative effects of selling alcohol to people who have already drunk too much and to help tackle alcohol-related violence and harm. The force said it took the measure earlier this month, testing locations in Dunstable, including pubs, clubs, and newsagents. They noted that all the sites tested made sales to the actors, who were displaying signs of excessive drunkenness. The police said that more than once the actors were given advice on drinks to buy to get “the most drunk”, were encouraged to buy shots, and were sold double measures. The licensing sergeant Liam Mitchell said: “This operation has highlighted just how lax the sale of alcohol can be treated, and has been a good learning experience for the venues and staff involved. “Not only is it an offence to knowingly sell alcohol to a person who is drunk, but excessive drunkenness fuels night-time economy-related violence and places people at risk. The message is simple to venues: if someone’s clearly had too much, then refuse the sale, offer them water, and check that they are safe.” Mitchell said that this was the first time Bedfordshire police had worked with actors in this way, although Merseyside police have done something similar. Advice has now been given to all of the locations. Councillor Ian Dalgarno, an executive member for community services at Central Bedfordshire council (CBC), added: “CBC is committed to making our town centres welcoming, safe and vibrant places to go out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/apr/02/the-beauty-of-bins-instagram-account-catalogues-cities-unique-designs","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"The beauty of bins: Instagram account catalogues cities' unique designs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/02/the-beauty-of-bins-instagram-account-catalogues-cities-unique-designs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/apr/02/the-beauty-of-bins-instagram-account-catalogues-cities-unique-designs","fields":{"headline":"The beauty of bins: Instagram account catalogues cities' unique designs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"From the domes and minarets of Brighton &amp; Hove’s Royal Pavilion to the modern stylised “H” of Hertsmere, Britain’s wheelie bins display a surprising range of logos and colours.

He’s right: the best way to cope with this is to have the positive perspective he describes. The only thing I would add, on the basis of my own excellent guidance in helping me with my current prostate cancer scare, is that there is still much to be said for continuing existing routine checks for prostate cancer despite the limitations of the PSA blood test while we are pressing for the better test that George refers to. Such checks significantly increase the odds in favour of early detection and treatment of this insidious disease. I wish George well in his future treatment and life in general. I for one look forward to reading commentary pieces from this “argumentative old git” long into the future. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Pigs are treated cruelly I was disappointed that in your five-page article about bacon (How can bacon be so bad…? 23 March) there was no mention of pigs or factory farming, nor was there a photo of a pig. People might be less willing to eat bacon or pork if they thought about the fact that most of it comes from intelligent creatures with feelings, who are treated cruelly in many ways. Piglets have their tails cut off without anesthetic, most male pigs are castrated, again without anesthetic or painkillers, and almost all modern pigs are forced to spend their whole life confined in small cages inside concrete buildings. If you have a strong stomach, google “cruelty to pigs” before you eat your next piece of bacon or pork. James Webb Kyoto, Japan Another side of Nigeria Thank you to Chitra Nagarajan and the Guardian Weekly (Focus on abductions warps view of Nigeria, 9 March). I lived in north-east Nigeria for two years and find it frustrating to have so little context for the sporadic reports of abductions. The deaths of men and boys are almost expected, given that communities usually try to protect the vulnerable; yet, we hear only about the kidnappings, as if they happened by magic. I hope this opinion piece leads to more detailed reporting by The Guardian. What I really hope is that the violence and abductions cease. Judith Umbach Calgary, Alberta, Canada The mystery of David Byrne The secret to deciphering the inner David Byrne (“Is there another way to live?”, 30 March) through his corpus is, I think, that there is none – all he throws are curveballs. There are musical concepts – not as overt as Bowie’s – but which is the twitch in twitchy? Revisit his and Eno’s composition, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, with its array of musical genres (and rhetorical spoken-word) sourced from around the planet and moulded into rock-n-roll by adding on beats and changing tempos. Yet it all works, with a spooky joie de vivre. Dorian Lynskey’s assessment of him as “a neutral observer of his own life” is key – he’s outside – a performance-artist of himself. He is a chronicler of his milieu with a lower-case “c” and meant to stay that way. Perhaps he can only be limned from the genres and spheres he has chosen to avoid. RM Fransson Wheat Ridge, Colorado, US Give May some credit I felt compelled to write when I read “The gaunt post-Brexit future towards which May is stubbornly leading us will make Britain a poorer, meaner, lonelier and shabbier place” (Leader comment, 9 March). I would like to remind the British people that, May was a campaigner for Remain. She is now faced with leading the country after the mess that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage created. Do people realise how hard it is to sell a product that you don’t 100% believe in? Her job is not easy considering the position she is in. The British people should at least be thankful that they have a prime minister who tries to hang on despite the odds, despite what she believed in (pro-remain) because she was given the responsibility to do so. Evangeline Mañalac Oslo, Norway Briefly • The wonderful story by Patrick Collinson (Finns are world’s happiest people, 16 March) greatly raised my spirits.

Backpackers outnumber seasonal workers by six to one in Australia’s agricultural sector, with more than 36,000 taking jobs, mainly in horticulture, each year. For backpackers on 417 working holiday visas, the “specified work” requirement allows them to extend their one-year visa by another year if they undertake three months’ work in the agricultural, mining, fishing or construction industries in a regional area. Overwhelmingly, backpackers fill labour market shortages in horticulture, picking fruit on farms across the country. But the “88-day” requirement (as the three months is defined) has been plagued by scandal over the abuse, underpayment and exploitation of backpackers who are dependent upon their employer to fulfil their visa requirement and remain in the country. The seasonal worker program brings workers from nine Pacific countries and Timor-Leste into Australia to work in the horticulture industry, tied to an employer or a labour-hire company. While it is much more tightly regulated than the backpacker fruit-picking industry, the seasonal worker program too, has been marred by 12 deaths of workers in five years, convictions against labour hire companies for “serious exploitation” and threats made against workers for complaining about their conditions. Seasonal workers are similarly vulnerable because they are tied to employers, with limited independent avenue to complain against exploitation. The federal government established a migrant worker taskforce in October 2016 to address migrant worker exploitation, and gave $20m to the Fair Work ombudsman to expand its investigations into the issue. The World Bank report said Australia should consider abolishing the backpackers’ specified work clause to “level the playing field”. “The government provides an explicit incentive for backpackers to work in the agriculture industry by offering them a second-year visa extension conditional on them undertaking work in rural areas,” it said. “Eliminating the second-year visa extension for working holiday visa holders would remove the incentive in place for the 36,264 backpackers in rural areas, who predominantly work in horticulture. “This is not to suggest backpackers should be entirely replaced with Pacific workers - they are also an important source of labour for the horticulture sector - but simply that levelling the playing field would be a step in the right direction. “If all these positions were to go to Pacific Islanders, this would represent an additional A$282m in net annual income gains for the Pacific. This is equivalent to approximately 26% of the Australian government’s entire aid budget for the region.” The World Bank report says the seasonal worker program has been successful in generating remittances to developing Pacific economies, and that bringing workers back to Australia season after season provided regular income to families in the Pacific as well as a reliable labour pool for Australian farmers. “Australia’s seasonal worker program continues to deliver significant advantages, not just for Australian farmers, but for the workers, households and communities of participating Pacific Island countries,” the report said. “Over a six-month employment period, participating Pacific Islanders remit an average of AU$2,200 while in Australia, and transfer AU$6,650 in savings home at the end of their stay.” Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, said the World Bank report would assist the government in improving labour mobility programs, including the establishment of a new Pacific labour mobility scheme. “As we identified in our 2017 foreign policy white paper, increased opportunities for labour mobility from the Pacific to Australia will help to strengthen economic resilience and contribute to stability and prosperity in our region.” The World Bank report does not address, in any way, issues of abuse or exploitation in either of the seasonal worker or working holiday-maker program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/mar/29/alfie-evans-about-to-be-murdered-says-father-after-court-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T08:23:10Z","webTitle":"System has failed Alfie Evans, says father after court defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/29/alfie-evans-about-to-be-murdered-says-father-after-court-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/mar/29/alfie-evans-about-to-be-murdered-says-father-after-court-defeat","fields":{"headline":"System has failed Alfie Evans, says father after court defeat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The father of Alfie Evans has said his seriously ill son has been “failed disgracefully by the system” after losing a last-ditch legal challenge at the European court of human rights. Alfie, who is 22 months old, has a rare degenerative brain condition and has been at the centre of a life-support treatment battle. His parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, from Liverpool, asked judges at the ECHR to examine the case after they exhausted all legal avenues in the UK. On Wednesday, judges in Strasbourg rejected the case and said they had found no appearance of any human rights violation. Writing on Facebook after the ruling, Evans said he and his partner were “in bits, distraught, in pain”, and the decision meant their son was “about to be murdered”. Judges at the high court and supreme court in London previously heard that Alfie, who was born on 9 May 2016, was in a semi-vegetative state and had a worsening neurological condition that doctors had not definitively diagnosed. Specialists at Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool, where the toddler was being treated, said life-support treatment could stop and high court judges accepted medical evidence that showed further treatment was futile. In a message to supporters after the Strasbourg ruling, Evans posted pictures of Alfie on his bed at Alder Hey, dressed in pyjamas and with a dummy in his mouth and holding his father’s hand. He wrote: “Failed disgracefully by the system. Does our son look in any of these pictures like he is dying!!!!!” Evans said: “We as parents are not giving up … Our son is about to be murdered, taking [sic] away from us, his innocent life is about to be taken. “Please our Queen, Pope Francis, please Angela Merkel. Someone save our innocent not dying son. He looks into our eyes every day, he responds to us every day. Alfie James Evans we love you so so so much. We will do everything we can.” In a message directly to Alder Hey, Evans added: “Please AH let him go home to die on a [tracheotomy] that he can pay for out of his own funds!!! We beg now [Alder Hey] to work with us.” In a statement, Alder Hey said it would work with Alfie’s parents to “agree the most appropriate palliative care plan” for the child. It added on Wednesday night: “Today the European court of human rights declared Alfie’s family’s application inadmissible, finding that there was no appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the European convention on human rights. This signals the end of a very difficult and protracted legal process. “We understand that this decision is very distressing for Alfie’s family. Our priority is now to work with them to agree the most appropriate palliative care plan and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/29/bargain-booze-conviviality-administration-wine-rack-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T07:25:45Z","webTitle":"Bargain Booze owner Conviviality to file for administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/bargain-booze-conviviality-administration-wine-rack-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/29/bargain-booze-conviviality-administration-wine-rack-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Bargain Booze owner Conviviality to file for administration","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Conviviality, the company behind the off-licence chains Bargain Booze and Wine Rack, is to appoint administrators within a fortnight, putting 2,600 jobs at risk. The impending administration has prompted warnings that beer pumps could run dry. More than 20,000 of Britain’s pubs are supplied by the company’s Matthew Clark division. The trade body, the British Beer and Pub Association, said many could now face short-term supply issues. Conviviality said after discussions with its banks, the board had decided to appoint administrators within 10 business days, unless circumstances change. The secured creditors can also appoint administrators without filing notice. The news came a day after the company said investors had refused its request for a fresh cash injection of £125m, needed to stave off bankruptcy after a string of profit warnings. The first warning was related to Conviviality’s failure to budget for a £30m tax bill. Its chief executive, Diana Hunter, has stepped down. Directors are still looking for a buyer for all or part of the business, and it will continue to trade. The firm said in a stock market statement on Thursday: “The directors intend to allow the business to continue to trade and the company continues to work alongside advisers in order to preserve as much value as possible for all stakeholders as it explores a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business.” Conviviality supplies more than 700 off-licences and more than 23,000 pubs and restaurants including the JD Wetherspoon chain. The firm’s shares remain suspended from the junior Aim market. Investors are likely to receive “little to nil” value for their shares, the company said. PricewaterhouseCoopers accountancy firm is expected to manage the administration. Conviviality has reportedly had trouble with suppliers and some customers have been looking for alternative sources. An analyst at Langton Capital, Mark Brumby, said other operators such as Marston’s, the brewery and pubs operator, had distribution companies that supply the free trade. Matthew Clark’s assets are likely to find themselves with new owners. “The speed with which Conviviality has apparently unravelled will unsettle investors, suppliers and customers,” Brumby added. “One potential source of problems is the extremely low-margin nature of the majority of the businesses that Conviviality was involved in. This was a problem shared with Carillion. It is harder to survive shocks when margins are low. The antidote is perhaps to be incredibly well run.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/31/the-queensland-mps-who-may-not-make-it-to-the-next-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T00:00:39Z","webTitle":"The Queensland MPs who may not make it to the next election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/the-queensland-mps-who-may-not-make-it-to-the-next-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/the-queensland-mps-who-may-not-make-it-to-the-next-election","fields":{"headline":"The Queensland MPs who may not make it to the next election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Incumbent Queensland MPs and senators have found their positions under threat as both major parties look to “renew” their tickets and improve their electoral chances in the sunshine state. With the on-ground contest in Queensland critical to the outcome of the next federal election, and with insiders suggesting 10 of the state’s 30 seats are in play, the Liberal National party is contemplating a potential shake-up of its federal Senate ticket, as well as challenges to lower house sitting members. Jane Prentice, who has held the seat of Ryan since 2010, is understood to be facing a challenge from the Brisbane councillor Julian Simmonds, who is considered a rising star within the LNP. Sources within the Coalition, which sits as one combined party in Queensland, said they believed a battle “was imminent”, with opinion split on the outcome. Keith Pitt, who was one of the leading voices within the Nationals party room advocating for change during the Barnaby Joyce scandal, is also under pressure, with several LNP sources telling Guardian Australia a challenger “was being sought”. “At this stage it is scouting but trust me when I say there are a lot of people still angry with the way the Barnaby saga played out, with [Michael] McCormack taking over the leadership,” one party operative said. It is understood Pitt is not the only regional LNP MP under pressure. The former Newman minister John McVeigh is preparing for a potential challenge from the Christian right flank of his southern Queensland branch, disgruntled at his support for marriage equality. McVeigh voted yes, despite a slim no vote in his electorate of Groom, having canvassed opinions and concluding that the youth vote was under-represented in the survey. But that has left him open to attack in one of the most notoriously conservative branches of the LNP, with the former challenger David van Gend understood to be canvassing for a candidate to challenge him. The LNP Senate ticket is also considered a work in progress. The party is working towards talking Ian Macdonald into retirement, despite the veteran senator’s protestations. “He’ll be 80 if he gets another term,” said another LNP source, one of several to confirm the push. “Eighty. He’s been there since 1990 and it’s time. We all appreciate what he has done, but it’s time. “Don’t be surprised if Barry O’Sullivan ends up part of the shuffle mix either.” While the LNP said any decisions would be up to branch members, the mood for change has been growing since the 2016 election, with the Queensland branch of the Coalition concerned about its future cabinet and leadership prospects. Complicating the matter is the internal division between members who consider themselves progressive liberals and their more conservative fellows. “It has always been a sometimes delicate balance, but with us being one official party in Queensland, instead of a coalition, the divide is a little more obvious up here,” a party source said. “Then you take into account who we need to win, or hold seats like Dawson and Maranoa against One Nation and you start hearing that we need to go further to the right. But how does that win us Brisbane or the Gold Coast? With George [Brandis] out, we are a liberal voice down in the cabinet and in the party. It’s hard not to think we are at a crossroads up here.” Labor is also looking to change the status quo, with the Senate ticket under the microscope as part of a wider left-faction insurgence across the east coast. Claire Moore and Chris Ketter’s spots are both understood to be the targets for the shake-up, with the Queensland party arm scouting for candidates. “Claire has had 18 years, it’s normal that after almost two decades you begin to look at renewing,” a Labor source said. “It is going to depend on what candidates are put forward but I think you’ll see some change. “It is time. And we are looking to not only win the next election, which is going to depend a lot on what happens up here, but hold on to government, and ensure Queensland is represented at that cabinet table.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/29/sunrise-under-investigation-over-highly-offensive-panel-discussion","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T06:42:03Z","webTitle":"Sunrise under investigation over ‘highly offensive’ panel discussion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/29/sunrise-under-investigation-over-highly-offensive-panel-discussion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/29/sunrise-under-investigation-over-highly-offensive-panel-discussion","fields":{"headline":"Sunrise under investigation over ‘highly offensive’ panel discussion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Channel Seven is being formally investigated by the broadcasting watchdog over complaints it aired “a highly offensive, racist and divisive statement” in a Sunrise panel show. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) on Thursday confirmed it was investigating whether Sunrise breached the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice 2015, in a panel discussion of the Indigenous child protection issue earlier this month. The Sunrise panel, hosted by Samantha Armytage with commentators Prue MacSween and Ben Davis, discussed a News Corp article which claimed the federal assistant minister for children, David Gillespie, had called for “white families” to be “allowed to adopt abused Indigenous children”. Gillespie said he did not use the phrase “white families”. The panel did not include any Indigenous person, made several factually wrong statements, and aired comments by MacSween that the stolen generations policy removed children for their own wellbeing and “perhaps” it should happen again. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge lodged a formal complaint with Acma, claiming MacSween’s comment was “a highly offensive, racist and divisive statement”, and there was no attempt by Armytage to condemn or rebuke it. Acma responded that a “significant amount of community concern has been expressed about that broadcast”, and it had commenced a formal investigation. In 2016-17, Acma received more than 1,100 complaints. It exercised its discretion to investigate 120 complaints about broadcasting matters and declined to investigate another 78, its annual report said. “When deciding whether to investigate a particular matter, our primary consideration is the public interest. A range of factors are considered, including the nature and seriousness of the matter raised or steps taken by the broadcaster involved to prevent future incidences of the issue.” The panel sparked protests, which Sunrise kept out of its live broadcast by playing stock footage behind the hosts’ desk. After sustained criticism, Sunrise invited three Indigenous child protection experts for a “special” panel the following week. That panel, hosted by Armytage’s cohost, David Koch, discussed the complexities of child protection and possible solutions, but made no acknowledgement or correction to the false claims aired in the first panel. Shoebridge welcomed the investigation. “It has been more than two weeks and Sunrise still hasn’t apologised to First Nations people for its racist and biased commentary of the stolen generation,” Shoebridge told Guardian Australia. “Worse still, Sunrise made a concerted effort to silence opposition and cover up protests outside their studio with a fake background.” Channel Seven has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/29/transvaginal-mesh-use-should-be-suspended-health-groups-say","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T05:45:38Z","webTitle":"Transvaginal mesh use should be suspended, health groups say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/29/transvaginal-mesh-use-should-be-suspended-health-groups-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/29/transvaginal-mesh-use-should-be-suspended-health-groups-say","fields":{"headline":"Transvaginal mesh use should be suspended, health groups say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Health consumer groups have called for the use of transvaginal mesh to be suspended while a comprehensive audit of complications is conducted. The call, made by an alliance of six state and territory consumer health groups, comes as the law firm Slater and Gordon announced it was investigating a second class action against manufacturers. On Wednesday a Senate inquiry delivered a damning report into the use of transvaginal mesh products in Australia. The devices are surgically implanted to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, common childbirth complications. It’s estimated about 150,000 women have undergone the procedure in Australia. The devices have been associated with significant, often life-altering complications, including debilitating pain, and have prompted class actions in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. The Senate inquiry on Wednesday recommended the devices be used only as a “last resort”. It found women were often not properly appraised of less invasive and risky alternatives, such as physiotherapy, and that doctors did not acquire fully informed consent. The inquiry also warned it was next to impossible to tell how many women had suffered complications, because the reporting of adverse events was haphazard and voluntary. It recommended an audit be conducted of transvaginal mesh procedures by the Australian commission on safety and quality in health care. It also called for mandatory reporting of complications and a national register of high-risk medical devices. On Thursday a group of six state and territory health consumer groups welcomed the recommendations. But the groups also called for mesh use to be suspended until the audit is complete. “We are disappointed that a more cautious approach wasn’t taken, to recommend the suspension in use of all mesh until the data is in to establish their safety and efficacy,” Health Consumers Queensland’s chief executive officer, Melissa Fox, said. “These devices will continue to be implanted in women in hospitals across Australia tomorrow, and not one more woman should be unwittingly subjected to this high-stakes surgical intervention until we can be assured of their safety.” Urologists, however, have cautioned against limiting their use for urinary incontinence. The Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand said urine leakage was common after childbirth, and that nearly one in 10 women would need surgery for stress incontinence by the age of 80. Prof Vincent Tse, from the Urological Society, said the recommendation mesh be used only as a last resort was fair for pelvic organ prolapse. But he said: “The Urological Society strongly believes that Australian women should be given the choice to have a mid urethral sling for treatment of their stress incontinence.” The devices are the subject of a class action run by Shine Lawyers in the federal court. The case against Johnson &amp; Johnson has accused it of playing down the risks, failing to properly convey warnings to surgeons and patients, not conducting proper clinical trials, and aggressively marketing the devices to surgeons. A second class action firm, Slater and Gordon, flagged it was also investigating a class action over the mesh products. It would consider action against other manufacturers. A senior associate, Rhea Dhillon, said consideration of the class action was in its “advanced stages”. “This inquiry has provided irrefutable evidence of the extensive suffering of women who have received pelvic mesh implants,” Dhillon said. “What is incredibly concerning is that the risk of complication does not appear to be isolated to any one particular brand, but rather attached to the product itself. Boston Scientific and Coloplast are among the manufacturers we have been investigating.” The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists welcomed the Senate inquiry’s report. It supported developing a registry of high-risk medical devices. The college’s president, Steve Robson, said he supported the registry so that robust and secure data was available. “It was very clear in the report that women who have experienced adverse complications as a result of a mesh implant have endured long-term pain and reduced quality of life,” Robson said. “[The college] is not dismissive of these accounts and is profoundly sympathetic to all women who have had this experience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/indian-commonwealth-games-imposters-detained-at-brisbane-airport","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T04:19:16Z","webTitle":"Indian Commonwealth Games 'imposters' detained at Brisbane airport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/indian-commonwealth-games-imposters-detained-at-brisbane-airport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/indian-commonwealth-games-imposters-detained-at-brisbane-airport","fields":{"headline":"Indian Commonwealth Games 'imposters' detained at Brisbane airport","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A group of Indian nationals has been arrested and detained as “imposters” claiming to be journalists covering the Commonwealth Games. The Australian Border Force (ABF) said one 46-year-old man has been charged with people smuggling and falsifying documents, after the group was questioned at Brisbane airport and eight were found to be carrying fraudulent media accreditation. The man has been remanded in custody and was due to appear before the Brisbane magistrate’s court on Thursday. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in jail. The other eight individuals have been sent to immigration detention. ABF said an air liaison officer (ALO) in Bangkok had flagged the group as potential non-genuine travellers as they transited on the way to Australia, and they were detained and questioned on arrival. “Anyone wishing to enter Australia, including athletes, team officials, spectators and the media, must hold a valid visa and accreditation and must be deemed to be a legitimate visitor,” the ABF regional commander Terry Price said. “We have a skilled network of ALOs at key overseas international airports who can identify travellers of concern and stop them travelling or, as in this case, provide real-time information to alert colleagues onshore.” “The ABF remains highly alert to other similar attempts that may occur as we get closer to the start of the Commonwealth Games.” The Queensland deputy police commissioner, Bob Gee, said the incident was proof that the system to stop illegal arrivals using the Commonwealth Games as cover worked.

His vigour and commitment constitutes its own advocacy. The new clarinet concerto by Mark David Boden (not to be confused with Mark Bowden, former BBC NOW composer-in-residence and member of the Camberwell Composers’ Collective) was written for the orchestra’s principal clarinettist Robert Plane. By way of invoking common ground, Boden homed in on their shared passion for running in movements entitled Adrenaline, Isotonic, Threshold and Hypertension. Rather than elevated in aesthetic or philosophical terms, this was hyper-energetic, brimful with motor energy, with Plane’s tireless virtuosity speaking for itself. Sarah Lianne Lewis chooses evocative titles. Her 2017 piece Is There No Seeker of Dreams That Were? took its title from the American poet Cale Young Rice’s New Dreams for Old, and sought instrumental colours to reflect his themes of loss and grief. Lewis was particularly concerned to convey the waves of emotion that rise with their own uncontrollable dynamic, and the inherent austerity of this vein carried more force than the moments of ostensibly consoling tonality. Guto Puw’s Camouflage was also premiered, a piece in which textures and characteristic sounds merged and re-emerged in the overall picture, as in nature. The music’s constant ebb and flow always held the ear. It was also rather telling that Puw, in his deeply instinctive pursuit of a higher integrity and purity, was unafraid to camouflage himself. Large-scale works by Alun Hoddinott and Michael Berkeley, showcasing what is stylistically a brilliant chameleon ensemble, completed an invigorating evening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/29/ruthless-review-arts-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T15:00:17Z","webTitle":"Ruthless! review – showbiz schemers play dirty in ultra-camp musical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/29/ruthless-review-arts-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/29/ruthless-review-arts-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Ruthless! review – showbiz schemers play dirty in ultra-camp musical","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Camp, says one of the gay men in Matthew Lopez’s new play, The Inheritance, is like a degrading form of minstrelsy. That remark echoed in my mind while watching this 25-year-old off-Broadway musical with a score by Marvin Laird and book and lyrics by Joel Paley. It offers two hours of unrelieved camp that, by the end, had me longing for some other business than show business. Its theme is the murderous obsessiveness it supposedly takes to get to the top. Laird and Paley demonstrate this through characters who include a demonic tot who bumps off a rival in a school musical, her mother who belatedly turns into a Broadway star and a manic agent who has her own thwarted dreams. You can tick off one by one the allusions to The Bad Seed, All About Eve, Gypsy, Mame and even, when the child’s mother exits suggestively dragging a chair, the Bob Fosse school of choreography. The problem is twofold: the show aims at so many targets it hits none of them and, while sending up the single-minded nature of show business, it seems hopelessly enthralled by it. Richard Fitch’s production strikes camp from the start with Jason Gardiner, a judge on ITV’s Dancing on Ice, playing the female agent as if nothing succeeds like excess. Anya Evans, one of four kids cast as the mercilessly ambitious Tina, suggests a dangerous version of Shirley Temple while Kim Maresca implies that behind every suburban mum lurks a performer hungering for the spotlight.

Nick Hardwick, who was forced to resign by Gauke, said three high court judges had made it clear that a dossier of evidence supplied by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to the Parole Board panel considering Worboys’ release did not contain sufficient detail on Worboys’ alleged broader offending. Downing Street sources indicated the prime minister still had full confidence in Gauke. Independent members of the Parole Board rallied round Hardwick to defend his record and express anger at his forced resignation. The judges’ comments came in a ruling handed down on Wednesday that overturned the Parole Board’s decision to release Worboys and ordered a fresh hearing, prompting the effective sacking of Hardwick as chair of the board. The Parole Board should have looked more closely at Worboys’ other alleged offences, the judges said. Worboys was convicted of 19 offences, including rape, against 12 victims but police believe he may have attacked more than 100 women. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday, Hardwick, who has received the backing of the QC representing the victims who brought the judicial review, stopped short of calling for Gauke to resign but said the minister must take responsibility for his department’s mistakes or the right lessons would not be learned. “The dossier that the panel received from the secretary of state – that was the secretary of state’s responsibility – didn’t contain sufficient information about those other alleged offences,” Hardwick said. The MoJ has said there was detail in the information supplied, but Hardwick said: “I don’t think the Ministry of Justice is being correct in this. The judgment is very clear that the dossier provided to the panel by the secretary of state didn’t contain all the information it should have done and the secretary of state’s representative – who is at the panel – didn’t in any way suggest the panel should have considered those other matters.” Hardwick said it was the “widely held practice” of the Parole Board at the time not to look at offences for which a prisoner seeking parole had not been convicted. “I didn’t resign willingly, I resigned because the justice secretary said I had no choice,” he said. “I accept that the Parole Board was at fault in these matters. I don’t accept we were any more at fault than the Ministry of Justice and I don’t believe the right lessons will be learned from this case if the only people accepting any responsibility for the things that went wrong here is us.” A Downing Street spokesman said: “This case has clearly exposed issues with the parole process as a whole. We share these concerns. The secretary of state has set out a number of steps he plans to take. “He has apologised. He has been clear the system hasn’t worked for the victims in this case. He said he acknowledged that and apologised for it.” Victoria Scott, an independent member of the Parole Board appointed under Nick Hardwick’s chairmanship, said: “I am disappointed and angry that he has been forced to resign. “On his watch the Parole Board cleared the longstanding backlog: dealing with 25,000 cases and holding over 7,000 oral hearings in 2017 whilst at the same time keeping the rate of serious further offending at less than 1%. “Throughout his time in post Mr Hardwick worked tirelessly to increase understanding of the Parole Board’s work and pushed for greater transparency. “He championed increased engagement with victims. He was a powerful advocate for a truly independent Parole Board and we need that now more than ever.” The Ministry of Justice is reviewing six cases in the year to April 2027 in which prisoners were released from maximum security – that is, category A – jails. An MoJ spokesperson said: “The Parole Board told the court that six category A offenders had been released in the year to April 2017. The secretary of state has asked the department to verify that there are in fact six cases of Category A prisoners that were released – and to check if there were any concerns in those cases and in any other release decisions from Category A since (April 2017).” Worboys, 60, now goes by the name John Radford. He was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years, and has spent 10 years in jail. Gauke was appointed as justice secretary, replacing David Lidington, in January’s cabinet reshuffle, days after the Parole Board announced its decision on Worboys."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/01/secular-groups-call-for-review-of-blatantly-discriminatory-school-chaplains-program","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T00:09:44Z","webTitle":"Secular groups call for review of 'blatantly discriminatory' school chaplains program","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/01/secular-groups-call-for-review-of-blatantly-discriminatory-school-chaplains-program","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/01/secular-groups-call-for-review-of-blatantly-discriminatory-school-chaplains-program","fields":{"headline":"Secular groups call for review of 'blatantly discriminatory' school chaplains program","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A group of humanist societies has demanded that the Australian Human Rights Commission review the $60m-a-year school chaplains program, claiming it harms freedom of religion. The secular and atheist groups wrote to the AHRC president, Rosalind Croucher, requesting a review on the basis that only religious people can be hired for the roles despite the fact that pastoral care is non-religious. The Rationalist Society of Australia president, Meredith Doig, told Guardian Australia the program is “blatantly discriminatory” and the group had mobilised after a push by Luke Howarth and dozens of other Coalition MPs to expand the program. The chaplains program was introduced by John Howard, continued by Labor governments, and was granted $245m in the 2014 budget by the Abbott government. Howarth wants the program at least extended in the 2018 budget but ideally expanded, citing the fact that chaplains only receive $20,000 a year compared with the minimum wage of $45,000. Chaplains generally work part-time or schools fundraise to extend their hours. Howarth told Guardian Australia he has asked the treasurer and education minister for a 25% pay increase to $25,000 a year because the 800 chaplains in Queensland doing “a fantastic job” have not had a pay rise since the program’s inception. The humanist societies have asked Croucher to set up an inquiry into the program on the basis it “may be inconsistent with or contrary to” a human right. The complaint argues the program “interferes with the right to religious freedom and involves religious discrimination in hiring decisions”. It notes the criteria for the program include that a school chaplain be a person who “is recognised through formal ordination, commissioning, recognised religious qualifications or endorsement by a recognised or accepted religious institution”. “This selection criterion amounts to requiring a person be religious. It excludes non-religious people from working as school chaplains.” Despite the religious affiliation implied by the name “chaplains”, the complaint argues their work is “entirely non-religious” and could equally be performed by people who are not religious. In a 2015 consultation report the AHRC reported that at almost all the public meetings it held complaints were raised about the chaplains program. It said while the program varied between schools many people raised the “implications of government paying religious organisations to provide chaplaincy services in public schools that would otherwise be provided free at a place of worship”. “The chaplaincy program … restricts freedom FROM religion,” one survey respondent said. “A democratic government should be secular yet it has imposed a religious preference on all children regardless of their background.” Doig said one non-religious couple had complained to the AHRC when they were not hired for the program, but this was the first time it had been asked to inquire into the “transparently discriminatory program”. Howarth responded to the complaint by saying “these people are anti-religion, anti-God, anti-anything non-secular”. “They want to throw the baby out with the bathwater; there is a lot of support for chaplains from people who aren’t people of faith due to the good works they do in schools.” Howarth said chaplains “don’t go round preaching” or recruiting students, but were free to answer questions about their faith. Asked why pastoral care could not be provided by non-religious people, he said that “we’ve already got counsellors and psychologists that do that role” and noted the program allowed people of different faiths to serve as chaplains. Croucher is also a member of the review of religious freedom led by former the attorney general Philip Ruddock. The Ruddock review was due to report by 31 March but the prime minister announced it would be extended to 18 May owing to an avalanche of more than 16,000 submissions. Guardian Australia contacted the AHRC for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/31/sorry-matt-canavan-no-one-believes-coal-magic-means-everyone-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T19:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sorry, Matt Canavan, no one believes coal magic means everyone wins | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/sorry-matt-canavan-no-one-believes-coal-magic-means-everyone-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/31/sorry-matt-canavan-no-one-believes-coal-magic-means-everyone-wins","fields":{"headline":"Sorry, Matt Canavan, no one believes coal magic means everyone wins","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Matt Canavan has an economics degree, graduating from the University of Queensland with first class honours. The Nationals senator and federal minister for resources worked at the Productivity Commission before he entered politics, first as a staffer for his colleague and friend Barnaby Joyce, before being elected to the Senate himself. The economic pointy head backstory makes Canavan an unconventional National, a fact that doesn’t go unnoticed among his party room colleagues. It also makes some of his public commentary this week just that bit harder to get your head around. In a busy week, where the government prosecuted but lost an attempt to steer its big business tax cut through the Senate, where Tony Abbott was so desperate for a “look at me” moment he launched Pauline Hanson’s new book, where the nation roiled inconsolably about the behaviour of our cricketers – Canavan fronted the National Press Club to try and generate a couple of headlines of his own. Canavan, like every other resources minister I’ve seen before him, is an unabashed champion of the mining sector. Boosterism comes with the territory, and the current occupant of the portfolio doesn’t disappoint. Given every major business sector in the country is pursuing a “please like me” soft advertising campaign of some type – the Business Council of Australia launched one this week, BHP urges us on high rotation to Think Big, the banks have ads specifically to tell customers they aren’t that awful – it was unsurprising to hear Canavan flagging (among other things) efforts to “bolster the community support for the resources sector” including through an “ongoing campaign” to inform people of its benefits. All just as you’d expect, right down to Stop Adani protesters bursting into the room to puncture his remarks. Where things took an unexpected turn was in the questions, when Canavan raised a balled fist of protest against the future. Asked whether as federal resources minister (as well as a democratically elected parliamentarian in a representative democracy) he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future – Canavan suggested the world needed to stay as it is. It was “objectionable” he said, to talk about people losing their livelihoods. He said concepts like “just transitions” were a con. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank. If you want to shut down the coal industry and cost people jobs, say it. Have the guts to say it.” Canavan advised the questioner (which, full disclosure, happened to be me) to take a trip to northern Tasmania to see what a transition really looked like. “Real poverty,” he noted. “House prices halve, people get locked in to an environment they can’t get out of and their lives are destroyed. “Utter heartbreak.” You might need to remind yourself at this point of the recount that this is a former Productivity Commission economist talking. If Productivity Commission economists are a foreign species to you, think about people mildly obsessed with transformation, structural adjustment, economic efficiency – that sort of thing. They are the folks who have been saying for decades in the politest possible way: suck it up soldier, your economy needs you to understand that things change, and the way to get through these adjustments is to pursue evidence-based policy. Couple of things. Canavan’s empathy for the coal and power workers – while doubtless sincere at a personal level – is a bit hard to square with his service for a government that shuttered the Australian car industry with barely a backward glance. I really don’t remember much outward concern for falling house prices, or destroyed lives or “utter heartbreak” in Adelaide. Perhaps some displaced workers are more equal than others. Then there’s the inconvenient fact that it is his own government’s policy driving the transformation he says shouldn’t happen. Canavan was part of a government that signed the Paris climate agreement – a set of commitments that make decarbonisation not optional, or hypothetical, but inevitable. Nobody held a gun to the government’s head and made it sign an international agreement to reduce emissions. Abbott might have grumbled at the time, and he engages in active revisionism now, but the fact is he signed Australia up, voluntarily. If Canavan thinks there should be no adjustment for coal communities, then he’s actually arguing that Australia should quit the Paris agreement – except of course he doesn’t argue that, because that would be problematic for Liberals trying to hold urban seats. The resources minister attempts to tip-toe through the obvious contradictions by arguing that high-efficiency coal will help reduce reduce emissions and help Australia meet its Paris target. In this happy story, we can reduce our emissions and boost the coal industry too. But is this happy story true? While it is self-evidently correct that “clean” coal plants are better in terms of emissions than ageing dirty ones, the minister omits several relevant points. “Clean coal will help us meet Paris” ignores the fact the technology is incredibly expensive; that taxpayers would bear significant risks because clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. And the electricity grid in Australia is moving inexorably in the opposite direction – towards decentralisation. There’s one more point that we can make about who should bear the transition. If Canavan thinks coal communities shouldn’t be made to adjust, but it’s OK for Australia to remain in the Paris deal, then he should be arguing in public and around the cabinet table for other sectors of the economy to do their fair share of heavy lifting. The government is trying to pass off the as-yet-unfinished national energy guarantee as a settled climate and energy policy, which it most decidedly isn’t. Assuming they can land it, this is not mission accomplished. The national energy guarantee is a policy for only one sector of the economy – electricity – and a sector of the economy where emissions are already falling. Thus far, the government has produced no plans for other sectors of the economy – say transport, or agriculture, where emissions are currently rising – presumably because the Coalition can’t ever have a rational conversation about emissions reduction without someone having a brain explosion. So what are the facts? If Australia remains in the Paris agreement, and we honour the undertakings we have made (and the government keeps saying we will do both those things), then a transition is coming. The transition can’t be avoided. It is already under way. Ultimately, the question I asked Canavan wasn’t about whether he was intrinsically opposed to the future, but about who takes responsibility for it. This government, and future Australian governments, will determine whether the transition associated with decarbonisation is fair and orderly and structured, or whether it is chaotic and ugly and deeply unfair to the regional communities the resources minister says he cares about. Empathy is fine from politicians, welcome in fact, but truth is better, because these communities aren’t stupid, and they won’t be bought off by facile storytelling that suggests coal magic means everyone wins, and no one has to pick up the tab. They want to know that someone in elected office is thinking about a new pipeline of blue-collar jobs. These communities need a plan, and they need political representation with the foresight to give them one, and to do that, our elected representatives have to be very clear about why they are in public life, and who it is they actually represent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/15/this-is-my-country-how-a-melbourne-suburb-defied-the-far-right-to-welcome-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T01:51:00Z","webTitle":"'This is my country': how a Melbourne suburb defied the far-right to welcome refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/this-is-my-country-how-a-melbourne-suburb-defied-the-far-right-to-welcome-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/this-is-my-country-how-a-melbourne-suburb-defied-the-far-right-to-welcome-refugees","fields":{"headline":"'This is my country': how a Melbourne suburb defied the far-right to welcome refugees","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On a dreary Sunday afternoon in late March, the sort that provides a harsh lesson on what Melbourne weather is capable of, a Syrian refugee talks through an interpreter about her escape from the conflict that has torn her homeland apart. Amena*, who along with about 100 other refugees from Syria and Iraq settled in the suburb of Eltham on the outskirts of north-east Melbourne a year ago, escaped not just endless civil war but an abusive and violent domestic situation. She is one of six newly arrived refugees who have met in an Eltham church to discuss with local volunteers what help is needed to further settle in, what sort of work they are looking for and how best to practise their English. Amena says that since arriving in Australia she feels safe for the first time in many years. “I feel like I’m with my family now,” Amena says, gesturing to Eltham residents. “This is my country now. I feel safe, I feel very happy … I’m very proud that I’m in Australia.” The afternoon tea meeting was organised by Welcome to Eltham, a community group formed to help Syrian and Iraqi refugees who have been settled in the suburb. The group has helped newly arrived residents with everything from English to driving lessons, and helped many to find new jobs. Welcome to Eltham was formed shortly before the refugees arrived in December 2016. A block of about 60 unused units on the same site as the St Vincent’s aged care facility in Eltham had been selected as a resettlement site. The block, which had been abandoned since it was damaged in floods in 2010, was to be rebuilt in partnership with CatholicCare and used to house the refugees. The plan sparked protests from Australian far-right groups, culminating with the so-called Battle for Eltham in late 2016, when groups descended on the suburb to protest against the refugees’ arrival. But the Eltham locals banded together and rallied against the outside agitators, adorning the town with more than 8,000 butterflies, in reference to the copper butterfly found in the area that was saved more than 30 years ago by the community. Many residents also marched down its main street in a show of support for the refugees. In the face of outside opposition and hate, many of the local residents decided to show the newly arrived refugees what the town was really like, going above and beyond in welcoming the new arrivals. When the first refugee arrived just before Christmas in 2016, she was met with housewarming gifts organised by Welcome to Eltham, including household essentials and a welcome book signed by hundreds of locals. Since then, about 100 refugees have been settled in the units in Eltham. Many of Welcome to Eltham’s members have taken courses in English tutoring to teach the refugees, with a small cohort making the trek to Brunswick every Friday evening to teach the parents of the children who are at marching band practice next door. The group has also provided subsidised driving lessons for their new neighbours. “There was no one providing that for this community,” says Welcome to Eltham’s founder, Nina Kelabora. “So that was just a really quiet way of giving people independence and increasing their connections to the broader community.” At the afternoon tea, new Eltham resident Lely says: “We are so happy here ... We didn’t think it would happen like this, and that this would come. My experience has been very good.” Several events have also been held in Eltham to help integrate the two communities, and introduce some Iraqi and Syrian culture to the Australians. This included a dance featuring a Syrian and Iraqi band, and a hafla in which everyone brought a plate of food from their home country. “It was an opportunity for people to get to know some of the Syrians and Iraqis in a natural way,” says the Welcome to Eltham president, Gillian Essex. “It was a joy to watch people engaging with each other.” Cooking and sharing food has been how many of the refugees have shared their culture. At the afternoon tea, Iraqi and Syrian dishes sit next to Australian party classics, the food providing an easy conversation starter. It is the spontaneous, natural encounters that are most powerful, Essex says. Such as when a newly arrived refugee found a vine leaf that she used to cook with back in Syria in a local’s front garden. She promptly knocked on the front door and asked to use it. The neighbour agreed, and even got to taste the final product. The Welcome to Eltham team says they have been able to see their new neighbours transform before their eyes, into comfortable and happy people. “It has been wonderful watching people begin to flourish when we find them work experience or match them up with local enthusiasts in their field of work,” Essex says. “These people have lost so much and when they come many struggle with learning English and getting used to our culture. But once they find work, they thrive and their English improves dramatically, along with their confidence.” For Kelabora, it is all about the quiet moments, away from the spotlight and bigger crowds. “Like having a cup of tea with someone and learning about Arabic tea – those really quiet moments are the most fulfilling,” she says. “A lot of the satisfaction for me comes from hearing those stories, the stuff that is happening by itself.” The experience has also transformed Eltham itself. “People say that the only thing wrong with Eltham is it’s too white-bread, and we need more multigrain,” Essex says. “This is reinforcing who we are as a community. We are generous and we are embracing of other people and cultures.” The refugees that are over the age of 55 can stay on in their accommodation in Eltham after it is transitioned to seniors’ accommodation, when the resettlement program comes to an end in September. Of the 12 units that house older refugees, all are looking to remain in the area. Sara is one of the refugees at the weekend meeting. She worked as an Arabic and English teacher in Syria before the outbreak of the war, and helps with some of the interpreting on the day. “I want to make something in Australia, so the people see this Syrian girl wants to do something,” Sara says. “I hope to do something good for Australia.” * Names have been changed to protect anonymity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/29/e-cigarettes-still-banned-in-australia-despite-support-from-some-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T02:24:18Z","webTitle":"E-cigarettes still banned in Australia despite support from some MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/29/e-cigarettes-still-banned-in-australia-despite-support-from-some-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/29/e-cigarettes-still-banned-in-australia-despite-support-from-some-mps","fields":{"headline":"E-cigarettes still banned in Australia despite support from some MPs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"To vape, or not to vape. Even after a year-long inquiry, Australia’s parliament can’t decide. The parliamentary committee charged with reviewing the nation’s e-cigarette laws, which bans personal vaping devices and the nicotine liquid which accompanies it, remains split. The official report called for further inquiry, recommending the National Health and Medical Council fund an independent review of the available evidence of the health impacts of vaping, and e-cigarette liquids, as well as a review of the regulations around the world. But the committee’s chair, Trent Zimmerman, wrote a dissenting report with his Liberal party colleague Tim Wilson. “The committee has been presented with starkly conflicting views during this inquiry and I respect those committee members who have formed different judgements to my own,” Zimmerman wrote. “I do, however, strongly disagree with the conclusions reached by the majority of my colleagues. “… While the evidence base regarding e-cigarettes is still emerging, there are clear indications that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to human health than smoking tobacco cigarettes. If long-term smokers who have been unable to quit smoking tobacco cigarettes switch to e-cigarettes, thousands of lives could be saved.” Queensland MP Andrew Laming also submitted a dissenting report, which echoed the spirit of Zimmerman’s conclusions, although was much more succinct. “Life is short and shorter for smokers. Just legalise vaping,” he wrote in his two-sentence official report, believed to be one of the shortest in parliamentary history. Liquid nicotine is classified as a poison in Australia and is banned, meaning it and nicotine e-cigarettes cannot be legally sold. The committee heard from the medical community and big tobacco during its 12-month inquiry, where often contradictory evidence was presented about the benefits of vaping over smoking as a quit aid. Although there was evidence to point to e-cigarettes as being better in a health sense than traditional cigarettes, concerns were raised over long-term effects and the possibility that younger people, who have been turning away from cigarettes, could be attracted to vaping and become nicotine-dependent. It was those concerns which led to the official recommendations for more information before a final decision was made. The committee’s deputy chair, Steve Georganas, was one of the members particularly concerned by the influence of tobacco companies in the sphere, writing that their inclusion “gave big tobacco an appalling opportunity to influence tobacco policy in Australia”. “This appears to have violated the World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control by inviting the tobacco industry to submit and testify to the committee,” he wrote. “This alarmed some of the committee members and experts such as the Australian Medical Association who also testified, and should alarm the government. “Governments should continue to follow the advice of the independent experts on nicotine e-cigarettes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/29/australias-emissions-rise-again-in-2017-putting-paris-targets-in-doubt","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T03:05:15Z","webTitle":"Australia's emissions rise again in 2017, putting Paris targets in doubt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/29/australias-emissions-rise-again-in-2017-putting-paris-targets-in-doubt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/29/australias-emissions-rise-again-in-2017-putting-paris-targets-in-doubt","fields":{"headline":"Australia's emissions rise again in 2017, putting Paris targets in doubt","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 were again the highest on record when unreliable data from sectors including land clearing and forestry are excluded, according to consultants NDEVR Environmental. Even including land clearing, overall emissions show a continued rising trend, which began in about 2011, putting Australia’s commitment under the Paris agreement further out of reach. The rising greenhouse gas pollution comes despite continued decline in emissions from the electricity sector, following increased renewable energy generation and the closure of Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Hazelwood. NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released. The latest NDEVR figures include the last three months of 2017, allowing a comparison of calendar-year figures since records began in 2002, revealing 2017 had the highest emissions on record, when those from land-use change are excluded. Even including the unreliable land-use figures, overall emissions continued their overall upward trend, taking Australia further from the commitments it made in Paris to help keep global warming under 2C. It is even making its current target (a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels by 2030), which experts agree is not yet strong enough to comply with the Paris agreement, seem increasingly out of reach. In 2017, Australia’s total emissions from all sectors excluding land-use change came to 556.11m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, according to NDEVR’s projections. That surpassed the last record, set in just 2016, by 7.21m tonnes. Overall emissions including land-use change – which involves activities such as land clearing and forestry – were the highest since 2011, indicating a clear upward trend since that time, reversing years of declining emissions starting in 2007. Emissions from the electricity sector in the last three months of 2017 were the lowest they’ve been in the data set, going back to 2001. And in the full year, they were the second lowest, pipped only by 2013. But that reduction was overwhelmed by increases in other sectors. Emissions from transport were at a record high in the last three months of 2017, continuing a steady rise since the records began in 2001. Fugitive emissions, which include emissions from the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels, were also projected to be the highest on record. Stationary energy, which includes energy produced for industrial processes such as the growing LNG industry, was also projected to be at the equal highest on record, matching the previous quarter from July to September 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/29/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T07:01:08Z","webTitle":"Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook business chief leans out of spotlight in scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/29/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook business chief leans out of spotlight in scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal, there has been a glaring lack of leadership from Facebook. Almost five days of silence passed before its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, faced the public with a post to his Facebook profile and a series of well-rehearsed interviews with handpicked media outlets. As the public bayed “Where’s Mark?”, his right-hand woman, Sheryl Sandberg, has avoided much of the scrutiny, despite the fact that she is the architect of Facebook’s data-centric advertising business and a highly skilled communicator. As the social network faces its biggest reputation crisis yet, critics are asking if the author of Lean In, a book about leadership in business, is choosing to lean out of the limelight. “It’s truly remarkable that Sandberg hasn’t come under greater public scrutiny for this crisis, since she is widely perceived to be the ‘adult’ who was hired to manage these kinds of political situations in a savvy way for the company,” said Kara Alaimo, assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who said he encouraged Mark Zuckerberg to hire Sandberg, and who helped poach her from Google about a decade ago, pointed out the executive had long been “applauded for Facebook’s extraordinary growth and profitability”. “Now that the dark side of that success has been exposed, she needs to do a better job of accepting responsibility for the consequences of the choices she makes,” he said. “She’s not leaning in at all,” McNamee said, in a reference Sandberg’s widely read book published five years ago. “If ever there was a time for her to lean in, this is it.” Sandberg joined Facebook as chief operating officer from Google in March 2008, at a time when Facebook was growing rapidly but bleeding cash. She brought a wealth of managerial and operations experience, emotional intelligence, political acumen and, crucially, firsthand knowledge of how to build a sophisticated advertising business based on user data. At Google, Sandberg was instrumental in developing the company’s lucrative advertising programs, AdWords and AdSense. As soon as she arrived at Facebook, Sandberg asked staff what business Facebook was in. “Everyone had their own ideas,” she told Vanity Fair in 2013. “But through that process, the people who were the important decision-makers became committed to ads.” Under Sandberg’s leadership, an ad model that took advantage of Facebook’s social graph emerged, starting with “engagement ads” that invited users to “like” the page of an advertiser and interact with the brand. Later, Facebook developed “custom audiences”, allowing external advertisers to merge the data they had about individuals with Facebook’s data. This meant companies could micro-target their existing customers on the platform, layering their own customer data with Facebook’s invaluable information about likes, friends and biographical material. In politics, the integration of campaign data with Facebook’s data was a game changer and critical to Barack Obama’s 2012 election. That year, four years after Sandberg’s arrival, Facebook started co-sponsoring presidential debates in the Republican primaries. In 2015, Facebook rolled out features to allow advertisers to target “political influencers” – people who like lots of political pages, click on political ads and share content from political organisations. Tools such as these made Facebook extraordinarily profitable, with sales of about $40bn in 2017. But they also left the company susceptible to privacy violations, and criticisms that it was surveilling its own users or corrupting the democratic process. “Targeted advertising allows a campaign to say completely different, possibly conflicting things to different groups. Is that democratic?” said the inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, in March last year. The problem is, targeted advertising is Facebook’s lifeblood – and that of the broader online marketing industry. “They are in a massive business model bind. To acknowledge the larger issue is to admit there’s a serious threat to their core business model,” said the entrepreneur and writer John Battelle. “That’s why Sheryl, who really runs the business, hasn’t been full-throated about this.” Since the controversy over Facebook data acquired by Cambridge Analytica first erupted, Sandberg did grant one interview with CNBC and has shared a couple of Zuckerberg’s posts on the matter. “This was a huge breach of trust,” Sandberg told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin. “People come to Facebook every day and they depend on us to protect their data and I am so sorry that we let so many people down.” Behind the scenes, Sandberg has been meeting with policymakers and advertisers, working hard to manage the fallout as Facebook users start to question the very business model she introduced to the social network. However, other than the CNBC appearance, Sandberg, the architect of the business model that is now the subject of so much scrutiny, has remained silent in public. “She has the communications chops to have been successfully deployed early on as their most formidable weapon in the crisis communications arsenal that Facebook has,” said Bob Pickard, a public relations veteran. “Had she been unleashed early on, it’s entirely possible there would not have been this public demand that Zuckerberg issue a statement.” Others disagree, believing that having anyone less than the CEO – even someone with Sandberg’s stature – would have been deemed insufficient given the intensity of the crisis. “If Sandberg were to be very visible, there would still be a desire to hear from Zuckerberg as the founder and iconic figure representing the company,” said Jeff Hauser, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Staying away from the public relations battle also allows Sandberg to protect her personal brand, which extends beyond Facebook and into her hugely popular books: Lean In, which explains why women are held back in the workplace and proposes solutions, and Option B, the self-help book she wrote after her 47-year-old husband Dave Goldberg died suddenly at the gym in 2015. “Avoiding direct scrutiny allows Sandberg to hold on to as much of her image as she had before the year and a half of hell for Facebook,” added Hauser. “The persona she crafted so carefully is imperiled by the behaviour she facilitated on Facebook.” Hauser added that it was also strategically valuable for Facebook to have a figure who was “relatively un-besmirched as a backup plan”. There are also suggestions that Sandberg might have political ambitions post-Facebook. Before working at Google, Sandberg was chief of staff for Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary Larry Summers and she is very well regarded among policymakers. During the last presidential election, Sandberg was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton and even tipped as a possible treasury secretary. All of which make her a potential candidate for two of the most powerful positions in the world: the next CEO of Facebook, should Zuckerberg ever choose to step-down, or even a future occupant of the White House. If a political career is on the horizon, it might be prudent for Sandberg to be more publicly engaged with the crisis, said Adam Hodge, a crisis communications strategist from SKDKnickerbocker. “One way to distinguish yourself is to step up and show leadership and be the face and voice of fixing a problem and turning a corner,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/27/steve-smith-australia-ball-tampering-scandal-spirit-of-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T15:15:57Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith is enveloped in a perfect storm of cricket’s distant ideal | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/27/steve-smith-australia-ball-tampering-scandal-spirit-of-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/27/steve-smith-australia-ball-tampering-scandal-spirit-of-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith is enveloped in a perfect storm of cricket’s distant ideal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The approaching roar They say one of the early signs of a tsunami is the distant roar of the coming water. And maybe Steve Smith began to understand what was about to hit him when he heard the murmurs of disbelief during his confessional press conference on Saturday as he tried to sweep away his cheating with some po-faced platitudes about pride and integrity, and a promise he wouldn’t let it happen again. The wave broke over him later that night when Malcolm Turnbull spoke about his “shocking disappointment” and the Australian Sports Commission called for Smith to step down. If Smith was expecting a few ripples, he ended up completely overwhelmed by water. By Sunday, it was not only front-page news in Australia but in South Africa, India, and England too, where it led the BBC’s evening news. It ran around the cricket-playing world and beyond, made headlines in the Washington Post and the New York Times, L’Equipe and Le Figaro, the Berliner Zeitung and the Japan Times. Google registered surges in searches for “ball tampering” in Nepal, Qatar, Switzerland, Thailand and Malaysia. Smith’s Indian Premier League team pulled away from him and eight of Cricket Australia’s major sponsors announced they were reviewing their relationships with the sport. Here is the thing though: ball tampering is not a mortal sin. The International Cricket Council rates it a level two offence, equal with making an offensive gesture to another player. The maximum penalty is a one-match ban and Cameron Bancroft didn’t even get that. The ICC fined him 75% of his match fee. It was not so long ago it fined Faf du Plessis 50% for wearing the wrong colour shoelaces. Ball tampering is a law best observed in the breach, no more shocking than the gambling in Rick’s Cafe in the film Casablanca. Du Plessis admitted tampering himself, once, when he was caught rubbing the ball on his pocket zip in 2013. Vernon Philander was fined for picking at the seam in 2014. So was Dasun Shanaka just last November. But this latest case is different in three key respects. One is that the scheme was cooked up in advance by a “leadership group”, another is that Bancroft brought a tool on to the field for the express purpose of cheating, though why you would imagine they were the only players to do either of those, innocence only knows. What was unique, though, was the video evidence was so clear they confessed to it. Bancroft’s tampering, then, was at the far end of a spectrum of offences but he was so bad at it the umpires did not even feel the need to change the ball. Never mind the disservice to the game, he was a discredit to those who would cheat it, too. Four days later, now the waters are starting to settle again, it’s not the offence that seems so very startling but the response to it. Because – and I’ll admit I haven’t checked the archives here – when Shanaka was caught I can’t recall Theresa May’s people feeling the need to provide a hot take on the topic. May is only going with the ebb and swell of the public mood, which is a strange brew of puritan pillorying, lunatics indulging in their daily two-minute hate, Australian fans suffering from genuine shame and sorrow and everyone else’s giddy schadenfreude. Over on Cricinfo, Brydon Coverdale has written well about why Australia cares so much. They had a Test match team a generation before they even became a federation and their champion, Don Bradman, has the same legal status as the local saint. They take the trivial business of sport seriously, which is one reason why they win so much so often. Which does nothing much to endear them to the rest of us, who support the teams they so often beat. And this particular Australia side, so oblivious to their own flaws, so alive to everyone else’s, are especially unpopular. It was only two months ago that Cricket Australia’s website ran a news story covering the accusations that England were ball tampering during the Ashes. Now the suspicion is Australia were doing it all along. Smith’s promise that this was the first time they had tried it doesn’t come off as too convincing given the South African cameramen had apparently been tipped off about what was going on. It’s not just the crime the Australians are suffering for here but the hypocrisy that came before it. Beneath all that, though, the backlash that hit Smith was driven along by another, even more powerful, idea. Which is that cricket, despite it all, is still a sport people associate with fair play, that, as they put it in the preamble to the Laws, it “owes much of its unique appeal to the fact it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game”. This, even though the players have been cheating, swindling, fixing, and tampering ever since the shepherds started swinging their crooks. The Spirit of Cricket used to seem to me to be a myth, just so much romantic bunk. But this storm proves that it persists, even if only as a distant ideal. It’s almost reassuring that a sport which is so worried about it’s waning popularity can excite such passion, since apathy, not anger, is the surest sign the love is gone. • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The allegation – the latest in a string of allegations of the sexual abuse of young women by Kelly – was made, referring to another woman, by former girlfriend Kitti Jones, in a BBC3 documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes. During two years of dating Kelly from 2011 onwards, Jones, 34, says she was groomed by him, and forced to have sex with him and others at least 10 times in a “sex dungeon”. She said: “I was introduced to one of the girls, that he told me he ‘trained’ since she was 14, those were his words. I saw that she was dressed like me, that she was saying the things I’d say and her mannerisms were like mine. That’s when it clicked in my head that he had been grooming me to become one of his pets. He calls them his pets.” Jones said Kelly made the unnamed woman “crawl on the floor towards me and perform oral sex on me, and he said, ‘This is my fucking pet, I trained her. She’s going to teach you how to be with me.’” It is unclear how old the woman was at the time of this incident. Kelly or his representatives made no comment to the BBC or the Guardian, but he has previously denied accusations of sexual impropriety or violence against women. In 2008, Kelly was found not guilty of child pornography charges after he was accused of filming and photographing sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl. He has reportedly made out of court settlements with various other women, including in 1996 Tiffany Hawkins, who said she had a sexual relationship with him for three years from the age of 15. Jones has spoken out against Kelly before, in an October 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, in which she described him becoming physically abusive after she confronted him over the alleged child abuse images: “He would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don’t ever get in his business.” In the BBC documentary, Jones says Kelly was “very abusive, physically, mentally, verbally. I think he gets some sort of satisfaction within himself, knowing that he’s taking control over other people.” In July 2017, Jones, along with three other women, spoke out against Kelly for an investigation by reporter Jim DeRogatis for BuzzFeed News, in which they accused him of “brainwashing” a series of women into a cult-like setup, where Kelly required them to have sex with him, and controlled what they wore and when they could use the bathroom or their phones. Kelly denied the claims, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name”. DeRogatis later spoke to Jerhonda Pace, another woman who had a sexual relationship with Kelly. She said: “I was slapped and I was choked and I was spit on” by Kelly, who also reportedly had her dress up like a schoolgirl and call him “daddy”. Elsewhere in the documentary, Kelly’s ex-manager Rocky Bivens stated that he was at the secret wedding ceremony between the singer and fellow R&amp;B star Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time. Kelly has in the past denied the marriage. Kelly is one of the most successful R&amp;B singers of all time, having scored six US No 1 albums, with seven more reaching the Top 5; his hits include Bump n’ Grind, I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition (Remix). His success has waned in recent years, however, and he hasn’t had a single in the US Top 20 since 2007."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/27/kerslake-report-manchester-arena-attack-police-fire-ambulance-and-media-responses-to-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T16:09:51Z","webTitle":"Kerslake findings: emergency responses to Manchester Arena attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/kerslake-report-manchester-arena-attack-police-fire-ambulance-and-media-responses-to-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/27/kerslake-report-manchester-arena-attack-police-fire-ambulance-and-media-responses-to-attack","fields":{"headline":"Kerslake findings: emergency responses to Manchester Arena attack","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fire service The Kerslake report was initiated last September by Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, after he was contacted by “immensely frustrated” firefighters who had been ordered by their superiors to move away from the arena rather than towards it. The firefighters heard the explosion from their base at Manchester Central fire station, which is just 0.6 miles from the concert venue, but they were ordered to drive three miles north of the city centre to Philips Park, another station. They turned on the TV to see colleagues from the police and ambulance service at the scene, Burnham told reporters on Tuesday, but were still told by the officer in charge of the fire service response that it was too dangerous to deploy. They believed a marauding terror attack was under way and national protocol said they should keep their distance. It was two hours before they were allowed into the arena – when their usual response time is six minutes. It was a decision Burnham described as “right on paper but wrong in practice”. Peter O’Reilly, the chief fire officer on 22 May last year, decided not to go to the arena that night, going instead to the fire service headquarters in Swinton, five miles away. He took early retirement in September on a full pension. His successor, Dawn Docx, said no one had been disciplined as a result because she was more interested in learning than blaming. Burnham said on Tuesday that it wasn’t fair to “scapegoat” one individual but that he had commissioned a “whole service” review into the culture and practices of Greater Manchester fire and rescue service. Police Greater Manchester police (GMP) was largely praised by Lord Kerslake for its response to the attacks. But areas of learning were identified. The force failed to tell other agencies – notably the fire and ambulance services – that it had declared Operation Plato, the agreed operational response to a suspected marauding terrorist firearms attack. The force duty officer believed a Paris-style gun attack might follow the bomb, partly because early reports suggested casualties had suffered gunshot wounds. The officer deployed 106 armed response officers within an hour, as well as explosive-sensing sniffer dogs from GMP and other local forces. Protocol dictated that the force duty officer should withdraw all responders from the arena foyer after initiating Operation Plato. But they didn’t, deciding that to tell these responders to evacuate would have been “unconscionable”. The duty officer was praised for this agonising decision by Burnham, who said: “Individuals on the ground at the arena took brave, common sense decisions which made the response better than it otherwise would have been had they followed protocol.” In the absence of confirmation of Operation Plato, the fire service stayed away. Ambulance service The report concluded it was actually “fortuitous” the North West ambulance service was not informed about Operation Plato – otherwise they may have pulled out their paramedics and instead they stayed and “lives were saved”. Just three weeks before the attack, Greater Manchester NHS had done a simulation exercise for what would happen in the event of an attack. The freshness of memories in relation to this exercise meant that from the strategic and tactical level, things worked well, Kerslake found. The first call to the ambulance service came in at 22.32, a minute after the bomb. Subsequent callers reported a variety of descriptions of the event including “speaker exploded” to “multiple gunshots”. An advanced paramedic self-deployed, arriving at the arena 10 minutes later. As he entered he was told by a police officer on the concourse that the incident was a suicide bomber. Along with a colleague he went into the foyer, where the bomb had detonated, and began to triage patients, despite not knowing if a marauding gunman was on the loose. Some survivors told Kerslake that they felt medical treatment was too slow and that they were left lying on the floor for two hours. But Burnham said criticism that only a small number of paramedics were working in the foyer was “unfair, given that it took police some time to confirm this was not a marauding attack and there were no other devices or attackers in the arena”. In total, 56 ambulances and seven rapid response vehicles were deployed to the arena, along with six advanced paramedics and three consultant paramedics. Media The panel said it was shocked and dismayed by the accounts of the families of their experiences with some of the media. They spoke of being “hounded”, of a “lack of respect”, and of “sneaky” attempts to take photos when families were receiving bad news. “To have experienced such intrusive and overbearing behaviour at a time of such enormous vulnerability seemed to us to be completely and utterly unacceptable,” the authors wrote, adding: “We recognise that this was some, but by no means all of the media and that the media also have a positive and important role to play.” At the hospitals, families looking for missing loved ones and visiting the injured described having to force their way through scrums of reporters who “wouldn’t take no for an answer”. Some complained that photographers took pictures of them through windows as they were being told their loved ones had died. One hospital worker spoke of a note offering £2,000 for information being included in a tin of biscuits given to the staff. Several people told of the physical presence of media crews outside their homes. One mentioned the forceful attempt by a reporter to gain access through their front door by ramming a foot in the doorway. The child of one family was given condolences on the doorstep before official notification of the death of her mother. Another family told how their child was stopped by journalists while making their way to school. Families Burnham made it clear from the beginning that the experiences of bereaved families, the injured and others directly affected should be at the heart of the process. The review panel heard from family and friends of 11 of the 22 people who died, as well as 200 others affected by the attack. For those who were bereaved, many found the time it took to receive the news too long and question why they could not have been advised much sooner. Those respondents who were already sure in their own minds had given identifying information to the the police. But most said they appreciated the compassion shown to them at the morgue. One said of their relative: “All the little bits and pieces, his wallet came back, the respect that’s been shown, because not only were his cards there but there’s a little bag in the wallet that contained every fragment of every card that was chipped and broken. They sent it all back, they haven’t just binned it. They sent every little particle back. Opinion was split on how £20m donated by members of the public to the We Love Manchester emergency fund had been distributed. “If you ask me about the money, or the way it’s been publicised, it makes me feel ill, but I do have to live, and we do have to pay bills, so we are grateful,” said one. Another said: “I am self-employed but unable to work due to my injuries. The fund has provided money for rent and to live off but I feel that I am banging my head against a brick wall for support. The fund has offered two lump sums but we were not told when they will arrive or how much we will receive. We do not understand why the fund are so secretive about where the money is going and why the bereaved families were given more money than those living with injuries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-pickled-garden-vegetables","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pickled garden vegetables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-pickled-garden-vegetables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-pickled-garden-vegetables","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pickled garden vegetables","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I want pickles most when we don’t have any. It is almost always the same: while making some sort of frittata or savoury pie – probably a potato, leftover greens, egg and cheese combination – it crosses my mind that it is going to need contrast, crunch, a jolt, a rush of sour and sweet. In short, pickles. But I have slippers on and it is raining, so I convince myself that I am not really that much of a pickle lover, that the red onion soaked in vinegar on the ubiquitous fennel salad will do. Of course, it doesn’t do: there is something missing both on my plate and in my mouth; certain tastebuds have not been touched. More regret comes later standing at the fridge door, in the same way I have done all my life, trying to find something to fill a gap or desire, and the only thing I want is not there. In her essay about pickles and writing, Danya Kukafka puts her finger on the point. That they are not food, not nutrients: “There is a reason we have pickles, and it is the same reason we crave good art: we are in it for the pleasure … we are in it for the rush of salt, the crunch and satisfaction, that perfect bite.” I happily buy my jars of perfect and not-so-perfect bites, but I enjoy making them, too – although, as much as I like the idea of a cupboard filled with rows of jars, or my flat looking like an Egyptian grocer, I always think of Margaret Costa and make small batches of preserves. She intended this advice for when you are making something new but, for a part-time and cautious preserver, it is advice to live by. It feels manageable, both in the making and the storing, because if something does go awry then it doesn’t matter, because the modest results can still be kept in the fridge. Today’s preserve, based on a recipe by Domenica Marchetti, is one of the many variations of an Italian la giardiniera, which simply means a preserved mix of seasonal garden vegetables. This March batch included carrot, turnip, red cabbage, beetroot (leaving no doubt about colour – soft pink or absolute purple depending on proportions) fennel and red onion. This method makes a pleasing, entry-level pickle, with both crunch and jolt, its flavour sour and assertive enough to fill your mouth in a single bite but just sweet enough not to be abrasive. The pickle equivalent of easy-listening maybe (serious fermenters and pickle aficionados may like to stop reading now). As a guide, 1kg of vegetables, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces, needs 750ml pickling liquid made by mixing 550ml white wine vinegar with 200ml water in a pan, then adding a heaped tablespoon each of fine salt and sugar, and whatever you fancy of the following: a crushed red chilli, peeled or crushed garlic, bay, dill, peppercorns, juniper berries or coriander seeds. Then heat it slowly. Once at boiling point, add all the vegetables, stir, cover the pan and leave on the heat for one minute. And that is pretty much it. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the bottom of each of two large, sterilised jars (wash them in boiling water and dry in a low oven). Now use a slotted spoon to lift the vegetables into the jars, cover with pickling liquid, share out the spices and screw on the lids. If you can, wait a week, although they’re good to eat the next day. I keep my pickles in the fridge for up to two months. They taste better when cold anyway: brighter somehow, the sweet and sour and taste even more pronounced – especially next to a cheese sandwich, a slice of savoury pie or boiled meat, or simply savoured straight from the jar against a kitchen counter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/27/guardian-weekly-nature-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T13:15:01Z","webTitle":"Inside the 30 March edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/27/guardian-weekly-nature-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/27/guardian-weekly-nature-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 30 March edition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"By any standards it’s been an action-packed news agenda of late, but the latest edition of Guardian Weekly proved particularly tricky to piece together. Several fast-moving stories, including the Russian diplomatic expulsions, the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook revelations and allegations of antisemitism in the UK Labour party – made it difficult to judge quite where to “pause” them for the deadline purposes of the Weekly. I think the team has made a great job of it and I hope you do too! (As usual you can email me your thoughts on the edition here.) On the cover this week is a story of growing global concern that has left me increasingly shocked the more I learn about it. A major, UN-backed biodiversity study has underlined how unfettered exploitation of resources is threatening water and food security for billions of people. From species die-outs to freshwater shortages to agricultural land degradation, human activity is pushing life on the planet to the brink of catastrophe, says the report. Jonathan Watts reports on a potentially terrifying conflation of global resource mismanagement. Inside the paper we report on the inspiring March for Our Lives protests in support of gun regulation in the US, including a manifesto for change written by students from Parkland, Florida. From Latin America there’s the fascinating tale of a lost Patagonian kingdom that has revived issues for the present-day continent. From Sri Lanka, we hear how vast Chinese infrastructure loans have left the island nation indebted and potentially compromised. In the Weekly Review we welcome back our former environment editor John Vidal for a guest return in which he considers the rise of unsustainable cities around the world. And a personal favourite feature of mine returns to the historical legacy of The Wire, 10 years after the seminal Baltimore-based US TV drama ended (after a recent re-viewing of four of the five series, I can confirm that while the mobile phones look dated, the themes remain as urgent as ever). Discovery separates fiction from truth on the subject of the male hormone testosterone. The Book reviews delve into the grim world of low-paid work, and Culture catches up with David Byrne, the former Talking Heads frontman who is still making provocative music and art. It’s a fast-moving world out there and we hope we have provided you with the tools you need to sit back and reflect on it all.

Did Michael (Peter Mullan) and Cathy (Lesley Manville) finally throw caution to the wind in the season finale of Mum, embrace their destiny, tell each other how they felt and set off for a bright new future together? Well, sort of. The great skill of Stefan Golaszewski’s sitcom is the way in which it recognises that big over-the-top declarations, while perfect on TV, aren’t really the stuff of everyday life. Thus, in an episode that was all about moving on – Pauline (Dorothy Atkinson) from her divorce, Jason (Sam Swainsbury) and Kelly (Lisa McGrillis) to their new home, Michael to Spain to be with his daughters – Cathy, too, finally took the plunge by telling Michael how she felt with a heartfelt speech. “I’d love to look at you and not notice your eyes,” she said. “I’d love to go to bed at night and not think about you. I adore you.” It was exactly the kind of speech that Richard Curtis has built an entire industry on, but after she had finished, the desperately overwhelmed Michael then scuttled into the toilet for a think. He wasn’t the only one struggling to cope with relationships, in a perfectly pitched final episode of what has been a perfectly pitched second series. “She’ll always love my dad, you know that, don’t you?” Jason remarked to Michael, the naked hurt in his voice transforming him from the slightly dim punchline of previous episodes to what he actually is: a grieving twentysomething, who still wishes every day that the father he adored could come home. That’s the pleasure of Mum. For every laugh-out-loud moment – Pauline’s ever-lengthening list of the finer things in life (“Radio 4, Classic FM, anything made by an artisan, golf, Wimbledon, jazz, the Tate, wine you can’t buy in a supermarket … Kent”) was a particular joy – there is a downbeat acknowledgement that life can hurt and it can be hard to move on. Or, as the ever-acute Pauline put it: “What these happy people don’t realise is that it will end because everything good always ends. Those fabulous smiles will fall from their faces and they’ll be wading through rivers of shit like the rest of us.” Of course, if Mum – and Golaszewski – really believed that, then the series would be impossible to watch. Instead, few programmes celebrate humanity, in all its complexity, so clearly. From the little moments such as Cathy’s father-in-law Reg (Karl Johnson) carefully drawing back a strand of his snoozing wife’s hair while Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun blared in the background, to the empty despair flitting across Pauline’s face as Derek (Ross Boatman) desperately tried to please her, to the big life-changing ones such as Michael’s proposed Spanish exile – this is a comedy that understands that every aspect of life is worth cherishing. And its life-affirming intentions are never clearer than in its treatment of the central relationship. It takes a certain amount of bravery to step blindly off the cliff and trust that the person you adore adores you back, and all the more so when, like Cathy, you are a widow who was married for decades. That Manville and Mullan manage to show us all of that fear and love and trust and hidden pain, often without saying a word, is a testimony both to their skill and to the completeness of the world that Golaszewski has created. When they finally reached for out for each other, their fingers curling together as Jason’s Bonfire Night fireworks exploded around them, I can’t have been the only person who cried."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/31/stephen-collins-on-blue-passports-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Stephen Collins on blue passports – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/31/stephen-collins-on-blue-passports-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2018/mar/31/stephen-collins-on-blue-passports-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Collins on blue passports – cartoon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/28/christian-ribeiro-gareth-bale-wales-retire-oxford-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T09:30:18Z","webTitle":"Christian Ribeiro: ‘I was told to stop or I wouldn’t be walking in my 30s’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/28/christian-ribeiro-gareth-bale-wales-retire-oxford-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/mar/28/christian-ribeiro-gareth-bale-wales-retire-oxford-injury","fields":{"headline":"Christian Ribeiro: ‘I was told to stop or I wouldn’t be walking in my 30s’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Christian Ribeiro remembers the phone call from the Oxford United physiotherapist as he navigated the snaking country lanes back towards the city. He describes the surreal moment, the rattle of his ringtone and the conversation during which Andrew Proctor relayed the message from the consultant that ended Ribeiro’s career at the age of 27. “Before he had even said it, I knew what he was going to say because the things he was listing off were serious, they were not little niggles, these were serious problems,” Ribeiro says of his knee injury. “When he came to the end, he said: ‘Chris you need to speak to your family – this is the end of you, really.’ I had already absorbed it. I said: ‘Yep, leave it with me, I know.’ I said to him: ‘Just be blunt.’ I didn’t want him to sugarcoat anything. It was boom, boom, boom, with all these things going on. It was a case of: ‘You need to consider retirement right now.’ I said: ‘OK, that’s it, I won’t play again.’ I gave him my decision there and then. The next week we cemented it.” For Ribeiro, the November team meeting before Oxford faced Plymouth Argyle came with a twist. He stood in the dressing room, in front of coaching staff and team-mates, to deliver the news he would never play again. “I thanked them all because my last year at Oxford was my most enjoyable in football. I was not expecting any of them to cry their eyes out. I thought beforehand I wasn’t going to get emotional because I was quite rational and calm but when you stand up in front of 30 people … I was getting a little bit bubbly by the end but I kept it all down.” Ribeiro is relaxed, his outlook positive. His journey here, via Scunthorpe United and Exeter City, is a sad tale for somebody with ability and quality. Born in Swansea he played for Wales as a teenager and counted Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey as team-mates. “I never reached their heights and I was always very sad about that. I couldn’t stay at that level, unfortunately.” Injuries blighted his career, including his first start for Bristol City, the club he joined aged 10, when he was forced off after 26 minutes with anterior cruciate ligament damage. Ribeiro was highly rated from a young age, recalls feeling “invincible” while playing in the Championship and turned down a move to the Premier League. He believes his body “probably never fully recovered” from that injury 10 years ago. “After that, I was still chasing the dream but I realised I wasn’t the same and that I was quietly losing something.” The beginning of the end, he says, arrived last September. After the perfect pre-season, he was playing regularly but he felt an innocuous clunk towards the end of training. In numbing pain, he limped through the final five minutes of the session – “basically hid” – knowing he was in line to start at right-back against Gillingham the following day. “I got into the warmup and I couldn’t move. It was downhill from then really; probably two months later I was being told I was retiring.” With the team on a decent run, Ribeiro battled on, playing another seven games, acutely aware something was wrong. “The pain was debilitating me, getting worse and worse with each match, to the point where in the last couple of games I have no idea how I was still playing,” he says. “By carrying on I was putting my long-term health at risk. I knew that because I was having to play on such strong painkillers all of the time. The pain I was in, struggling to go up and down the stairs, I honestly look back and think how I was playing was bonkers, really. It was crazy, I don’t know how I was getting through games. I was on my last life – it was very much: ‘This is it.’” Ribeiro played against MK Dons on Tuesday 7 November and the following Saturday he was in line to face Northampton Town. The day before the game he pulled up halfway through training and was sent for a MRI scan. “I had an inkling something was seriously wrong so it wasn’t a total shock but you never expect the final call to say you’re done. I was told: ‘You have to stop otherwise you won’t be walking in your 30s.’” As soon as he had finished speaking to the club physio he rang his partner Beccie, a physio at Cheltenham general hospital, and his parents, Anne and Mike. “Those were the only three I told on the Friday. To a point they were relieved because they could see how much pain I was in. It was obviously sad but they watched a couple of games with my knee all taped up, limping through. I wasn’t able to play my usual game and they could see that.” Ribeiro is keeping his options open as he works towards his Uefa B licence. Scouting and media work are also options, as is delving into financial planning or mortgage advising. “When you are in football, you’re looked after like a child; everything’s done for you and it’s great. When you’re out of it, it’s my responsibility to get on with things and it’s a whole different mindset. It’s a testing time, it’s a bit scary but I am enjoying it as well.” Technically, though, he remains a professional footballer, under contract until this summer. “All of my life, people say: ‘What do you do?’ And I say: ‘I play football’ but now it’s not true is it?” Ribeiro says, as his wry smile broadens. “I suppose now I am considered an ex-footballer and it is odd but I have come to terms with all of that and I’m getting over it. I’d like to think there is more to me than just football.” Talking points • This time next month Ipswich Town supporters ought to know whether Mick McCarthy will be at the helm for the 2018-19 season. Marcus Evans, the lesser-spotted owner, has said the 59-year-old’s position will be clarified in the coming weeks. • Only Cardiff are in better form than Millwall (over the past six games) and Neil Harris’s side must quietly fancy their chances of being this season’s surprise package. Their immediate schedule looks kind and, with six away wins on the bounce, that fearless streak may push them into the play-offs. • A bumper Easter period lies ahead for Notts County, who face promotion rivals Wycombe and Accrington in the space of five days. Kevin Nolan badly needs a reaction from his seemingly flagging squad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/27/lost-amazon-villages-uncovered-by-archaeologists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T15:51:36Z","webTitle":"Lost Amazon villages uncovered by archaeologists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/27/lost-amazon-villages-uncovered-by-archaeologists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/27/lost-amazon-villages-uncovered-by-archaeologists","fields":{"headline":"Lost Amazon villages uncovered by archaeologists","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Once people thought the Amazon was a near-uninhabited rainforest before the Europeans turned up, but researchers say they have found new evidence that it was in fact a hive of human activity and home to millions of people. A new study has revealed details of 81 sites in the previously uncharted territory of the Amazon’s upper Tapajós Basin, with settlements ranging from small villages just 30m wide to a large site covering 19 hectares. Researchers say the new discoveries are helping to unpick what the Amazon would have been like before Europeans arrived. “The idea that the Amazon was a pristine forest, untouched by humans, home to scattered nomadic populations … we already knew that was not true,” said Dr Jonas Gregorio de Souza, first author of the study from the University of Exeter. “The big debate is how populations were distributed in pre-Columbian times in the Amazon.” Writing in the journal Nature Communications, de Souza and colleagues explain how the sites were first discovered by satellite imagery of the area, revealed by deforestation. And how they show evidence of human activity in the form of earthworks. These include ditches enclosing the sites for fortification, sunken roads, and earth platforms on which houses would have stood. The team checked 24 of the locations with boots on the ground. “Everything that we identified on satellite imagery that we tested was an archeological site,” said de Souza, adding that the team also came across fragments of ceramics, polished stone axes and a type of fertile dark earth that is an indication of long-term human habitation. Wood charcoal associated with ceramic fragments from one site was carbon-dated to between 1410 and 1460 AD; dates of many of the sites previously discovered in the southern rim of the Amazon show a peak of activity between 1250 and 1500. The researchers say the buildings themselves would have been made from wood, and the settlements might have been surrounded by wooden walls known as palisades – although no remains of such posts have been found. De Souza said the results are exciting because the newly discovered settlements were found near small streams, creeks and springs, adding weight to the idea that people were not only concentrated at sites on fertile floodplains on the edge of major rivers, as was long thought. “The idea was that in the areas that are located further away from the main rivers, populations maybe were actually smaller and they had a negligible impact on the environment,” said de Souza. “We demonstrated that these regions may have had pretty large populations as well in the past.” That, the authors write, also chimes with accounts from the 18th century which reported large villages and wide roads in such areas. Models based on the research suggest that at the time, the southern rim of the Amazon alone could have been home to between 500,000 and one million people. But, de Souza added, the arrival of Europeans quickly took its toll. “We know that diseases travelled much faster than people and probably this population was already weakened by diseases brought by Europeans even before the Europeans set foot on the area,” he said. The research, which was funded by National Geographic and the European Research Council project Past, also highlights that previously discovered earthworks in other regions along the southern rim of the Amazon were not isolated, but part of a stretch of human settlements running along 1,100 miles from east to west. But evidence including variations in ceramic styles suggest that populations living around the same time in these different regions had different cultures. “In each one of the regions of the southern Amazon, you find a different local expression of these architectural traditions – so there are different kinds of site layouts and artefacts that are found in each of the regions,” said de Souza. Further discoveries are likely: models suggest earthworks might be found over a 400,000 square kilometre area with more than 1,300 sites – more than 60% of which have yet to be found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/27/northern-ireland-same-sex-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T11:45:46Z","webTitle":"It’s time to make Northern Ireland allow same-sex marriage | Conor McGinn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/northern-ireland-same-sex-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/northern-ireland-same-sex-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"It’s time to make Northern Ireland allow same-sex marriage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There will be same-sex couples across Britain and Ireland this week excitedly discussing getting married. The talk will be of who gets invited to the wedding, how much to spend on the food and drink, what they will wear, and even of troublesome table plans. For them, equal marriage has been around for a while now and is a fact of life. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 paved the way for gay couples to get married in England and Wales. France, Luxembourg, Germany, Scotland and Ireland have all legalised equal marriage. Same-sex marriage became legal in Australia in December – 16 years after the Netherlands became the first country to fully legalise equal marriage in 2001. But it is a different tale where I grew up, in Northern Ireland, where thousands of same-sex couples are denied the basic human right of getting married to the person they love. Everyone knows that politics in Northern Ireland can be complex, to put it mildly. It’s further complicated by the current deadlock at Stormont. However, the Northern Ireland assembly did vote in favour of an equal marriage bill and all the polls show that a majority of the public in Northern Ireland support same-sex marriage. Equal marriage has the backing of the SDLP, the Alliance party, Sinn Féin, the Green party, as well as the support of other smaller parties and senior members of the Ulster Unionist party. However, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), which the Tories rely on for their Commons majority, blocked the proposed legislation and its progress is now stalled following the collapse of talks – in part over the issue of same-sex marriage – between the DUP and Sinn Féin. I’m very clear that the decision to approve same-sex marriage would ideally be made by the Northern Ireland assembly doing the job it is supposed to be doing. But there has been a vacuum now for more than a year and every day that LGBT couples in Northern Ireland have to wait for equal marriage legislation to be passed is a day too long The UK government should now introduce legislation as quickly as possible to end this injustice. I know that many in Northern Ireland share my view. The government has to date resisted the opportunity to give that assurance. But something has to change. That is why I am introducing planned legislation in the form of a backbench bill at Westminster to allow equal marriage in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland secretary of state, Karen Bradley, has confirmed to me that the House of Commons has the power to do this, and that the Conservative party will allow its MPs a free vote on the issue. Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd, has backed my proposals, and has committed a Labour government to legislating for equal marriage. I am confident my bill will command the support of MPs from across the House of Commons. In the House of Lords, the Conservative peer Lord Hayward has tabled a private member’s bill seeking to bring equal marriage to Northern Ireland. I am working with the Love Equality campaign – a coalition of organisations in Northern Ireland – to get this legislation on to the statute book. The campaign – which includes Amnesty International UK, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Union of Students &amp; the Union of Students Ireland, the Rainbow Project, Cara-Friend and Here NI – and MPs, peers, and the wider LGBT community are also supporting my equal marriage bill for Northern Ireland. It will be heard in the Commons on Wednesday. Same-sex couples should not have to wait any more for this long overdue change and to enjoy the same rights as my constituents in St Helens, or people in Dublin, London, Cardiff or Edinburgh. The UK government has a moral duty to act and bring in legislation to finally end this discrimination. And, while I believe my proposed legislation has the support of a majority of MPs in the Commons, it could be knocked off course by the parliamentary process. That is why it is vital that the government joins all those who are supporting this change and makes sure that we get legislation to end the ban on same-sex marriage and bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and Ireland. Politics in Northern Ireland is often complicated. But this is not about people being unionists or nationalists. It is not actually about whether people who want to get married are gay or straight. In fact, it isn’t really about politics at all. It’s simply about people being equal. It’s about doing what is fair and what is right. And it’s about doing it now. It is time we said “I do” to equality and justice, so same-sex couples in Northern Ireland can say “we do”, and marry the person they love. • Conor McGinn is the Labour MP for St Helens North"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/28/michigan-state-university-consulting-fees-larry-nassar-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T20:55:49Z","webTitle":"MSU paid firm $500,000 to monitor Larry Nassar victims during sentence hearing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/michigan-state-university-consulting-fees-larry-nassar-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/28/michigan-state-university-consulting-fees-larry-nassar-abuse","fields":{"headline":"MSU paid firm $500,000 to monitor Larry Nassar victims during sentence hearing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michigan State University paid a public relations firm more than $500,000 to monitor the social media accounts of women who had been abused by Larry Nassar. According to documents obtained by the Lansing State Journal, New York firm Weber Shandwick billed the university for 1,440 hours’ work in January as Nassar, who had used his position at MSU to abuse female athletes under the guise of medical care, faced dozens of his victims in court. The firm reported to MSU on how social media posts by Nassar’s victims, as well as politicians, journalists and celebrities, were received by the public. “Guardian Reporter Owen Gibson’s tweet linking to the Guardian article on Biles [had] 16 retweets; 19 likes,” read one report. Weber Shandwick employees were paid between $200 and $600 an hour for their work. The Journal also reported that MSU had spent $9.69m by the start of March on law and consulting firms. More than 250 people are suing MSU over claims the university failed to protect them from Nassar. USA Gymnastics, where Nassar also worked and abused athletes - including Olympic gold medalists – are also being sued. Nassar was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison for his crimes, in addition to a 60-year term for possession of child abuse images.

McCartney announced on Wednesday that she had bought a 50% stake in the label, which Kering had owned since the brand was founded 17 years ago. “It is the right moment to acquire the full control of the company bearing my name,” McCartney said in a statement. “This opportunity represents a crucial patrimonial decision for me. I am extremely grateful to François-Henri Pinault and his family and everyone at the Kering group for everything we have built together in the last 17 years. I look forward to the next chapter of my life and what this brand and our team can achieve in the future.” The daughter of the former Beatle Sir Paul and Linda, the late photographer and animal rights activist, she became interested in fashion at a young age and designed her first jacket at 13. After interning at Christian Lacroix and rising to become the creative director of the Parisian fashion house Chloé, McCartney, 45, started her own label in a joint venture with Kering in 2001. The brand, which has stuck to strict ethical principles and does not use leather or fur, has grown to 17 stores across the world, including Mayfair in London, Soho in Manhattan and West Hollywood, in Los Angeles. Neither McCartney nor Kering would comment on how much was paid to buy out Kering’s stake. It has been rumoured that Sir Paul McCartney had helped her finance the deal. McCartney had until the end of this month to exercise an option to buyout Kering’s stake, according to the terms of the joint venture. Pinault, Kering’s chairman and chief executive, said: “It is the right time for Stella to move to the next stage. Kering is a luxury group that empowers creative minds and helps disruptive ideas become reality. I am extremely proud of what Kering and Stella McCartney have accomplished together since 2001. “I would like to thank Stella and her team wholeheartedly for everything they have brought to Kering – far beyond business. Stella knows she can always count on my friendship and support.” McCartney’s brand was a small part of Kering’s business, which reported its most profitable year on record in 2017, making profits of €3bn on sales of €15.5bn. Kering said growth at its Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent brands had been “spectacular”. The company’s fastest growing brand is Balenciaga. Kering has been slimming down its portfolio of brands including the spin-off of the German sportswear brand Puma in January. Sales at Stella McCartney’s UK division rose 31% to £41.7m in the year 31 December 2016, according to filings at Companies House. Profits were up 42.5% to £7m compared with the previous year. McCartney said she will remain on the board of the Kering Foundation, which aims to tackle violence against women, and will continue to collaborate with Kering on improving sustainability in fashion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/28/reckitt-benckiser-needs-to-wean-itself-off-a-dud-pay-model","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T18:44:54Z","webTitle":"Reckitt Benckiser needs to wean itself off a dud pay model | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/28/reckitt-benckiser-needs-to-wean-itself-off-a-dud-pay-model","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/28/reckitt-benckiser-needs-to-wean-itself-off-a-dud-pay-model","fields":{"headline":"Reckitt Benckiser  needs to wean itself off a dud pay model","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shed no tears for Rakesh Kapoor, the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser who has had £11.2m deducted from his 2017 pay package. He still earned £12.5m, owns shares in the Dettol-to-Durex firm worth £40m and this year is chasing a £22.7m maximum jackpot. He’ll get along fine. No need for a Nurofen. Reckitt has too often over the years found itself defending the indefensible – remember the £90m for Bart Becht, Kapoor’s predecessor, in 2010 – so perhaps deserves half a cheer for remembering that discretion is allowed when a mechanical pay formula spits out an obviously silly number. In this case, Kapoor scored top marks under the terms of his 2015-17 long-term incentive plan, or LTIP. Reckitt had to achieve growth in earnings per share, ignoring the effects of acquisitions, of 10%. It achieved 11.5%. In practice, pretending that everything went swimmingly would have fooled nobody. Reckitt’s share price has fallen by a quarter since last summer as the market has digested a cyber-attack, a profits warning and the acquisition of a baby milk business where the $18bn price struck many observers as far too rich. In the circumstances, handing Kapoor his full LTIP whack of £22.4m would have risked a BP-style revolt by investors. Cutting the figure in half to acknowledge “the shareholder experience”, in the committee’s coy phrase, reduces the risk of a riot. In truth, though, Reckitt’s pay committee deserves little credit. It has failed to ask the obvious question: if an LTIP scheme tied solely to earnings per share has been exposed as a dud, why is it still being used? This is the second year in a row that Kapoor’s pay has had to be adjusted downwards to reflect factors that the model could not compute. Last year the boss was obliged to make a gesture to acknowledge a safety scandal with a Reckitt product in South Korea linked to the death of 92 people. Kapoor, though not in charge when the scandal happened, was docked 40% but still collected £14m. Reckitt could have concluded at the time that a one-eyed focus on earnings per share is a poor way to measure performance. It is also the true that investment managers themselves, weary of an executive pay system where luck and timing often play a greater role than skill and hard work, are increasingly open to ditching LTIPs. The new chair of Reckitt’s pay committee, Mary Harris, should order a review. Even by the lavish standards of large FTSE 100 companies, Kapoor is highly paid. And when the formula for calculating his rewards can’t withstand contact with common sense, it’s time to design a better system. Grim outlook for Conviviality “The board believe that shareholders in the company will receive little-to-nil value.” That’s the stark reality for investors in Conviviality, owner of the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains. An intended £125m rescue has flopped and a sale of assets is under way. Matthew Clark, the well-established wholesale distribution business, will probably attract interest but the rest is anybody’s guess. At the start of this month Conviviality was worth £550m, making the speed of this collapse spectacular. The causes plainly run deeper than a £30m tax bill that the company failed to spot. The next announcement – one trusts – will come from the Financial Reporting Council and will promise to get to the bottom of what happened. Is Shire going the way of GKN? Just as the GKN/Melrose excitement draws to a close on Thursday, here comes a bid for a bigger FTSE 100 company. The business secretary, Greg Clark, can relax, though. He won’t be called upon to perform a dance. Biotech firm Shire has risen from humble origins in Basingstoke to become one of the largest companies on the London market, worth £33bn, but it is Irish these days. Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan is merely “considering” an offer that is at “a preliminary and exploratory” stage, a statement riddled with get-outs, but chief executive Christophe Weber, a former high-flyer at GlaxoSmithKline, sounds serious about his plan to create his vision of “a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader”. He just needs to work out how to pay for Shire. In terms of stock market value, Takeda is the smaller company and shares in Japanese firms don’t go down easily with UK fund managers. You can’t blame Weber for sniffing an opportunity, though. Shire is carrying a load of debt after its $32bn purchase two years ago of the US haemophilia firm Baxalta, a deal that looks less good after the arrival of tough competition from the likes of Roche. Shire is vulnerable – to Takeda or somebody else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/08/neuroscientist-gregory-berns-studying-dogs-more-enjoyable-than-studying-himan","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T08:30:25Z","webTitle":"Neuroscientist Gregory Berns: ‘Studying dogs is way more enjoyable than studying humans’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/08/neuroscientist-gregory-berns-studying-dogs-more-enjoyable-than-studying-himan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/08/neuroscientist-gregory-berns-studying-dogs-more-enjoyable-than-studying-himan","fields":{"headline":"Neuroscientist Gregory Berns: ‘Studying dogs is way more enjoyable than studying humans’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Gregory Berns is a distinguished professor of neuroeconomics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. His current work involves taking brain scans of dogs to probe what goes on between canine ears, as well as using scanning techniques to probe the connections within brains of dead animals, including the extinct Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine. In your new book, you say a dog’s brain is about the size of a lemon… That’s probably for a medium-size dog, like a labrador. Bigger dogs generally have bigger brains, so obviously you are not going to get a lemon inside a chihuahua’s head. What’s the rest made of? Is it just air between the ears? You are not far off. There is a lot of air in the skull, especially in the front between the eyes and above the nose, there is a big frontal sinus and then around the sides it is all muscle. When did you first think “I know, I’ll stick my dog in an MRI scanner”? It really was a weird eureka moment. The catalyst was the Bin Laden mission. There was a military dog on the mission and they can do things like jumping out of helicopters and that was my epiphany. If a dog can be trained to jump out of a helicopter, certainly we can train a dog to go in an MRI [scanner]. Why did you want to look at the dog’s brain? It was an idea in search of a question initially. But one of the first things that I wanted to know was, if we are looking at dogs’ reward system – in terms of parts of their brain that are critical for motivation and, if you want to be a little philosophical about it, pleasure and what they like – do they hang around us humans just for food because we feed them or is there more to the dog-human bond than that? You said that you see a reward response in a dog’s brain to human odours and that is evidence of something like love. Could it not just be an association with food? That finding by itself could be association. But it is not just any human because it was only the smell of their human that triggered that response, so there is a recognition component there – but it still could be “Hey, this is the person who feeds me.” Which is why we did the other experiment of food versus praise, where we examined the response to the expectation of food versus the expectation of “Hey good girl!” We found most of the dogs had equal responses to both. One of the big messages I am trying to convey is that dogs are individuals too and in every experiment that we have done we see a range of responses. The structure of a dog’s brain is rather different from a human’s – how far can we say there are analogous areas? That’s a good question. If you just look physically at the brain, there are obvious differences in size, so immediately there is a challenge there to identify corresponding parts in one brain with another. Humans have proportionally much larger frontal lobes, so there is more stuff there that a dog does not have. So it is problematic to say that regions are analogous just based on how they appear. But there is a functional analogy, which is really what I am talking about. The idea with a functional analogy is, if you have two individuals, whether they are the same species or not, engaging in the same activity or the same task and you see a region of the brain that is active in the same condition in both cases, then you would say they are functionally analogous because they seem to be doing the same thing. Is this a big project in anthropomorphism? I don’t think so. I don’t claim dogs understand what we are saying the way we do. Some people are convinced their dogs understand what they are saying, but dogs don’t have the same amount of brain real estate for processing language that we do. There was a study recently about dogs manipulating their faces to communicate with humans. What do you make of that? Do they really pull the big eye stunt? Obviously they want to communicate with us because they live with us. They are very social animals; in my view, their greatest trick is how social they are – that is what makes them a dog and not a wolf. But if a dog makes a particular facial expression, are we to conclude that they are trying to communicate with us or not? I don’t know. When you look at a dog in an MRI scanner and you see activity in a region, do we know if that is down to thoughts, an impulse, inbuilt or training? What is the alternative if they don’t think? Then we are back to what essentially Descartes said, which is that animals have no thoughts, that they are just a bundle of reflexes. That would be a Cartesian view of animals that I think most people would not accept any more. Most scientists would not accept that. In part, that is because dogs and all animals have the ability to learn from the environment. They are at some level taking things into account, things that have happened to them, and altering their actions based on these things. To put it in words, they form predictions of how the world behaves around them and that includes other entities. To me, that is what thought is. Now the thing I think people get hung up on is that they don’t have an internal monologue like we do. Do you think dogs have an imagination? For sure. I think all animals have a form of imagination. I think one of the major functions of a brain is to, for lack of a better word, imagine. Now that may be a bit anthropomorphic for your tastes, so the other way to think about it is that brains are necessary for prediction. There was one incident you talk about where you had to kill a dog as part of your work... It wasn’t research, that was training as a medical doctor. It was just what all medical doctors had to do. Yeah, it left a lasting impression and I regret it greatly. Do you think some animals have lower sentience so it is OK to eat them? It is really tricky to kind of prioritise certain animals over other animals. At least in the western world, nobody is going to eat a dog, but that doesn’t mean they are more sentient or more intelligent than other animals that we do eat – it is because they are charismatic and we like them. On the face of it, that doesn’t seem right. You talk about how in your experiments the dogs are not restrained but free to leave at any time, just as humans are. That is admirable, but how realistic an approach is that for medical research? The problem with a lot of medical research is they use animals in ways that don’t even translate to human health. It is well known that rat and mouse physiology and the way they react to drugs is not very predictive of how humans react to drugs. So we do need to think seriously about the use of animals in medical research and whether it is really worth doing or not. Do you see yourself as a modern Dr Dolittle? No, I didn’t think it was going to end this way, but it is more enjoyable than studying people. • What It’s Like to Be a Dog by Gregory Berns is published by Oneworld (£16.99).

Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.” Cook also said that it is past time to regulate Facebook. “I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,” he said. “However, I think we’re beyond that here.” The comment echoed remarks Cook made in Beijing last week, when he said: “I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.” Facebook has received a deluge of criticism in the wake of the Observer’s reporting that the personal information of 50 million American users was used by the electioneering firm Cambridge Analytica. But Cook has been sounding the alarm on mass data collection by Facebook and Google for years. The executive has long pointed to the distinction between Apple’s business model – selling products to customers for a profit – and that of internet platforms that are “gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it”, as he said in 2015. That business model has been extraordinarily profitable for Facebook and Google, but the companies are now facing a reckoning from consumers waking up to the sheer volume of information being collected from them – and concerned about who might be using it and how. Cook is not the only Silicon Valley CEO to take aim at Facebook during its time of troubles. On Friday, Elon Musk deleted the Facebook pages for two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. Cook, 57, did not have any suggestions for how Zuckerberg should address the fallout from the privacy scandal.

The £5,000 prize is given to the poet “who has made the most exciting contribution to poetry”, putting published collections alongside live performance, installations and radio pieces. Bernard, who uses the pronoun “they”, examined a tragedy which came to be a defining moment in black British history after 13 young people died at a birthday party in south London. The cause of the fire has never been established, with inquests in 1981 and 2004 returning open verdicts amid accusations of police incompetence and government indifference. The hour-long solo performance, which was given at the Roundhouse in north London as part of the 2017 Last Word festival, combined archive footage with film, audio and live poetry written in the voices of those killed in the blaze. Bernard switches between the raw horror of the unfolding tragedy, writing: “Voices ah call seh dem haffi get out / “Screamin begin an di people ah shout”, and the scene outside, where “The flash of the photographer / leaves hot white / wherever the world looks: // they twist back her arm / handcuff her and lift her to her feet / pull back her snarling face for the press // We watch”. The aftermath is conjured up in reflections from those left behind – ”I asked them for your / body. And they said they didn’t advise it, me going to see what / was left” – and in public pronouncements where the personal has been removed: “The family of Blank today issued this statement … Blank broke their own neck in the back of the – / The officers involved have defended their actions”. “Will anybody speak of this / the way the flowers do,” Bernard writes, “the way the common speaks /of the fearless dying leaves?” According to one of the judges, Sally Beamish, what most impressed the panel about Bernard’s performance was “the honesty, the vulnerability and the fact it was so intensely personal”. “What Jay has done is to relate the story of the New Cross fire from their own perspective,” Beamish said. “In an amazing way, they’ve made a parallel between that struggle for validation in the black British community and their own redefining of their gender through surgery. It made it a very intimate experience, very personal and very brave.” The performance centres on a young woman who died in the fire, Beamish explained, “a girl who expected to become a woman and never did. Perhaps there’s also a parallel there with Jay, who was born a girl and was expected to become a woman, but has made a different choice.” As well as considering the written text, the judges watched the film projected during the event and footage of Bernard reading their own work, Beamish said. “All the work on the shortlist was astonishing and inspiring. This stood out as something which we wanted to find a wider audience.” Bernard’s work has appeared in anthologies and magazines including Ten: The New Wave, and Out of Bounds: Black British and Asian Poets, and Place. They performed as part of two Speaking Volumes Breaking Grounds tours in the US, and were poet in residence at the George Padmore Institute. Alongside Beamish on the judging panel were the poets Gillian Allnutt and Lemn Sissay. The prize was founded by the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, and is funded by the stipend the laureate traditionally receives from the Queen. Bernard joins a roster of winners including Alice Oswald – who won the inaugural award in 2009 with her collection Weeds and Wild Flowers – Lavinia Greenlaw, Andrew Motion and last year’s winner, Hollie McNish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/28/womens-golf-ana-inspiration-major-lexi-thompson","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:25:47Z","webTitle":"Twelve months on, Lexi Thompson relives four-shot penalty nightmares | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/womens-golf-ana-inspiration-major-lexi-thompson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/28/womens-golf-ana-inspiration-major-lexi-thompson","fields":{"headline":"Twelve months on, Lexi Thompson relives four-shot penalty nightmares","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Who won the first women’s major of 2017? Some marquee golf events are better remembered for someone falling short rather than for the champion. Quiz fodder lies therein. Ryu So-yeon is the answer to the question and she will try to retain the title at the ANA Inspiration in California which begins on Thursday . The last staging was overshadowed by such epic controversy involving Lexi Thompson, the player Ryu eventually defeated in a play-off, that virtually every leading name in golf had their say on the matter. Whether the American did indeed incorrectly replace her ball on a green was lost in the debate over whether it was appropriate for her to be informed of a four-shot penalty several holes later after intervention from those watching on television. Thompson went from the hunted to the hunter with one very public sanction. Rules have subsequently been modified to avoid a repeat of a scenario where, not for the first time, golf’s law enforcers received widespread criticism. Thompson found herself unable to regain composure to the point where the South Korean Ryu emerged victorious. The impact on the champion, of course, was unfortunate. Impact on the loser? Evidently profound. “That night was extremely rough,” Thompson said. “I was screaming, crying. You know, I’ve relived it for a while. I had nightmares about it, I still occasionally do. It’s been rough but the fans were behind me the weeks after, the months after. “I stayed off social media after that because the media was blowing it up and making me feel terrible. So I just tried not to pay attention to any of that. I just had to let it go and let time pass. I don’t look at myself that I changed the rule. I’m just happy that the rule changed so nobody else can be put through what I was put through last year.” Thompson recovered to record two wins before the end of 2017. She begins this week as the world No 2, one place above the defending champion. Hurt still lingers; this time, she is the sentimental favourite and one clearly with a score to settle. For Ryu, it is a difficult and unfair movie. “The thing was I was not the one in charge of taking care of all the rulings,” Ryu said. “All I had to do was only what I can do. So what I can do is keep playing golf, stay focused on each shot, each hole, and just seeing the tournament instead of seeing the hassles. “Sometimes we’re out there and this player is too slow, or this ruling was bad, whatever, but those things, I cannot fix it. What I can do and what I can handle is just to do my thing.” If women’s golf would rather do without such drama this time around, there remain storylines capable of capturing the imagination. That Michelle Wie has a single major to her name at the age of 28 contradicts earlier, and extraordinary, hype. It also, however, has reasoning in the lengthy list of injuries which have prevented Wie from fulfilling outstanding potential. Victory as claimed with a closing 65 at the HSBC Women’s Championship in early March, Wie’s first LPGA Tour victory for four years, illustrated what she is still capable of if her body permits. “When your back is hurting or neck is hurting, you can’t really do much,” Wie said. “It definitely helps to not have your hands hurt when you putt. So being healthy and pain-free definitely helps in all aspects of your game, even putting. “There was a lot of doubt, especially when you don’t remember the last time you haven’t felt pain. It’s a hard road. Just having to change my swing so many times, working around my injuries. I thought a couple of them were going to be career-ending. But I had great people around me, a great support system, and we just took it slowly. Just got myself back healthy, and I was trying to stay healthy. That was definitely my number one goal.” Wie joked when asked if she had discussed such a situation with Tiger Woods. “Every time we see each other we list off all the things. ‘How’s your ankle, how’s your back, how’s your everything?’ It’s a 20-minute conversation and then we can move on from there.” There has, though, been an element of hope for Wie through Woods’s ongoing comeback from the depths of physical despair. “It’s so inspiring,” she said. “Just seeing what he’s gone through with his injuries, and then just seeing what his club-head speed is right now and everything, seeing how he’s hitting the ball and how he was coming back, it’s truly inspiring and motivating.” Thompson should have more incentive than the rest of the field put together.

The company has listed 12 policy-related job openings based in Washington DC as it faces increased scrutiny over its privacy policies after it was reported that Cambridge Analytica had obtained data from up to 50 million Facebook users. The revelation sparked new concern about the amount of information that the company had collected from its users and with whom it was shared. The job listings include a Washington DC-based public policy manager “to work with both the legislative branch and third-party groups as a clear line of communication, helping to advocate on behalf of the company’s mission and goals” as well as a politics and government manager to “work with candidates, elected officials, and others in the US political system to use our platform and civic engagement tools to connect in meaningful and innovative ways”. The social media website has long faced scrutiny over the use of its platform by Russia to influence the 2016 election. In October 2017, a lawyer for Facebook testified before Congress that Russian-backed content may have reached up to 126 million Americans on the website. In addition to this content, political advertisements bought by Russia may have reached as many 10 million people. Luther Lowe, the vice-president for public policy at Yelp, told the Guardian that Facebook’s DC hiring spree represents an effort to “play catch up with Google”. He noted that Facebook’s presence in Washington is currently about half the size of Google, a company that has had several privacy scandals over the past decade. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, spent $18m on lobbying in 2017 including $6m alone in one three-month period. This was more than any other company spent on lobbying in Washington DC. Its top lobbyist in Washington, Susan Molinari, is a former Republican congresswoman who also had a brief stint as a television anchor at CBS. The company’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, also served as an informal adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016 although he has since praised Donald Trump at a White House meeting. The United States has lagged behind the European Union in the past in oversight of tech companies and social media but Lowe noted “both the Android data leaks over the weekend and Cambridge Analytica news are forcing mechanisms on Congress to catch up with Europe on consumer privacy protections”. In contrast to the United States, the European Union has had tougher regulations on tech companies and fined Google €2.4bn ($2.95bn) in 2017 for abusing its dominance in the search engine market to favor its own products. Zuckerberg’s expected testimony, likely to take place in April, before the House energy and commerce committee marks the first time the Facebook founder will appear under oath to discuss the controversy. The Senate judiciary committee and Senate commerce committee have also invited him to testify. In 2017, Facebook spent over $11m on its lobbying effort in Washington, representing an increase of nearly $3m on its expenditures in 2016. The company has increased its spending in Washington almost every year since 2009 when it spent just over $200,000. The company has long had links to prominent Democrats. One of Facebook’s founders, Chris Hughes, left the company in 2007 to work for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. Hughes’s husband later mounted an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2014 in upstate New York. It also worked closely with the Obama re-election campaign in 2012. Both Zuckerberg and Facebook’s corporate Pac have donated to politicians from both parties. In 2016, Facebook gave $519,500 to federal candidates, 55% of which went to Republicans. Zuckerberg was also the founder of a pro-immigration reform group FWD.US and was criticized by Donald Trump in 2015 as a result."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/28/viola-player-wins-royal-opera-house-case-for-hearing-damage","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:18:36Z","webTitle":"Viola player wins Royal Opera House case for hearing damage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/28/viola-player-wins-royal-opera-house-case-for-hearing-damage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/28/viola-player-wins-royal-opera-house-case-for-hearing-damage","fields":{"headline":"Viola player wins Royal Opera House case for hearing damage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A classical musician has won a landmark case for damages against the Royal Opera House after claiming his hearing was irreparably damaged by the horn section during a thunderous rendition of Wagner’s Ring Cycle. In the first case of its kind, Christopher Goldscheider, a viola player, claimed he was exposed to unacceptable noise levels in the pit at Covent Garden as the orchestra rehearsed Die Walküre (The Valkyrie) in 2012. Goldscheider, 45, from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, said he suffered “acoustic shock” after a blast from the 18-strong brass section, situated directly behind him, caused the overall volume in the pit to reach at least 137 decibels – about the volume of a jet engine from 100ft away. Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled in his favour on the issues of breach of duty and causation of injury, with damages to be assessed. Goldscheider’s claim for lost earnings alone is £750,000. He says he has been forced to give up playing or even listening to music. The Royal Opera House Covent Garden Foundation was refused permission to appeal against the ruling, although it can still apply directly to the Court of Appeal. Theo Huckle QC, representing Goldscheider, said the effects of the injury - including hypersensitivity to noise - had “seriously diminished his life in all significant respects”. Goldscheider, he added, was exposed to an average noise level of 91 decibels over a three-hour period and, despite him wearing ear plugs, that gave rise to a “substantial risk of injury”. The foundation had argued that Goldscheider’s condition was not caused by playing in the orchestra, but had in fact been the result of his coincidentally developing Meniere’s disease at around the same time. David Platt QC said he had been provided with ear protection and the opera house had gone “as far and, if anything, further than the reasonable employer” to reduce noise levels. The judge said the foundation was in breach of a number of control of noise at work regulations, and that it was this noise that had led to Goldscheider’s hearing problems. Had the foundation complied with its statutory duty, Goldscheider would not have been exposed to the level of noise he endured, she added. She was satisfied that the noise levels at the rehearsal were within the range identified as causing acoustic shock. “The index exposure was the playing of the principal trumpet in the right ear of the claimant whether it was one sound or a cluster of sounds of short duration,” Davies said. “It was that exposure which resulted in the claimant sustaining acoustic shock which led to the injury which he sustained and the symptoms which have developed, from which he continues to suffer.” Goldscheider’s solicitor, Chris Fry, said the acoustic shock had brought his client’s glittering career to an end. Goldscheider, who took up the viola at the age of five, and studied music in Prague and the UK, had played on stage with Kylie Minogue and live with the Three Tenors in front of 100,000 people in Barcelona. “This is the first time that the court has explored the music industry’s legal obligations towards the hearing of musicians, and the first time that acoustic shock has been recognised as a compensatable condition by the court,” Fry wrote in a blog reporting the ruling. “The decision leaves insurers for the Royal Opera House responsible for a £750,000 compensation claim, and legal costs in addition, an urgent need to rethink its policies and procedures, a possible re-design of ‘The Pit’, and probable claims against them by other musicians.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/28/julian-assange-internet-connection-ecuador-embassy-cut-off-wikileaks","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:11:54Z","webTitle":"Ecuador cuts off Julian Assange's internet access at London embassy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/28/julian-assange-internet-connection-ecuador-embassy-cut-off-wikileaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/28/julian-assange-internet-connection-ecuador-embassy-cut-off-wikileaks","fields":{"headline":"Ecuador cuts off Julian Assange's internet access at London embassy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ecuador has cut Julian Assange’s communications with the outside world from its London embassy, where the founder of the whistleblowing WikiLeaks website has been living for nearly six years. The Ecuadorian government said in statement that it had acted because Assange had breached “a written commitment made to the government at the end of 2017 not to issue messages that might interfere with other states”. It said Assange’s recent behaviour on social media “put at risk the good relations [Ecuador] maintains with the United Kingdom, with the other states of the European Union, and with other nations”. The move came after Assange tweeted on Monday challenging Britain’s accusation that Russia was responsible for the nerve agent poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury earlier this month. The WikiLeaks founder also questioned the decision by the UK and more than 20 other countries to retaliate against the poisoning by expelling Russian diplomats deemed spies. Assange has lived in the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sex crimes he denies. Sweden has dropped the case but Assange remains subject to arrest in the UK for jumping bail and fears he will be extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities if he leaves the embassy building. Ecuador previously cut Assange’s internet access in the embassy in October 2016 over fears he was using it to interfere in the US presidential election following Wikileaks’ publication of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser, John Podesta. In May 2017 the Ecuadorian president, Lenin Moreno, again asked Assange to refrain from commenting on Spain’s dispute with the separatist region of Catalonia. Assange had tweeted that Madrid was guilty of “repression”. As part of a subsequent agreement between Assange and the Ecuadorian government, he is not permitted to send any messages that could interfere with Ecuador’s relations with other countries. Assange’s comments on the nerve agent attack on double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia prompted the British foreign office minister Alan Duncan to call him a “miserable little worm” during a Commons debate on Tuesday. Duncan said he should leave the embassy and surrender to British justice. Assange replied: “Britain should come clean on whether it intends to extradite me to the United States for publishing the truth and cease its ongoing violation of the UN rulings in this matter. “If it does this disgraceful impasse can be resolved tomorrow. I have already fully served any theoretical (I haven’t been charged) ‘bail violation’ whilst in prison and under house arrest. So why is there a warrant for my arrest?” The former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the music producer Brian Eno said in a statement they had heard “with great concern” about Assange’s lost internet access. “Only extraordinary pressure from the US and the Spanish governments can explain why Ecuador’s authorities should have taken such appalling steps in isolating Julian,” they pair said, adding Assange had only recently been granted citizenship. “Clearly, Ecuador’s government has been subjected to bullying over its decision to grant Julian asylum, support and ultimately, diplomatic status.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/28/john-worboys-parole-board-nick-hardwick-david-gauke","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T18:12:24Z","webTitle":"John Worboys’ victims weren’t only failed by the Parole Board | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/john-worboys-parole-board-nick-hardwick-david-gauke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/john-worboys-parole-board-nick-hardwick-david-gauke","fields":{"headline":"John Worboys’ victims weren’t only failed by the Parole Board","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Frozen in shock, disgusted and traumatised by the thought that Worboys could be on the streets so soon.” That’s how one of John Worboys’ victims described her feelings since she learned in January that the man known as the “black-cab rapist” would be released from prison. Her shock has been widely shared. How could Worboys – jailed indefinitely back in 2009 for drugging, raping and sexually assaulting several women in his taxi – be released just nine years later? That decision by the Parole Board was today overturned by the high court. It is highly unusual for a prisoner to be released directly from a maximum security prison, and professionals who worked with Worboys referenced his skills in “manipulation” and “impression management”, suggesting he is someone who may be more than adept at gaming the system. Moreover, Worboys spent six years after his conviction protesting his innocence and trying to secure his release. Because the Parole Board did not release any reasoning behind its decision, Worboys’ victims have been left completely in the dark as to how a man who only relatively recently admitted his guilt for the crimes of which he’d been convicted could have been told “you now take full responsibility for your offending behaviour,” and “you have learned to be open and honest with professionals”. These judgments would have been critical in the decision to release him. But thanks to a brave judicial review of the decision, taken by two of Worboys’ victims, we now have an idea as to how the Parole Board came to decide to release a dangerous and calculating rapist, who the police believe has committed dozens of similar offences. Today’s high court ruling makes for damning reading. The Parole Board’s chair, Nick Hardwick, who has been forced to resign, always maintained that under the law, the panel that considered Worboys’ case had to take a view of his risk to the public based only on evidence relating to the crimes of which he had actually been convicted. And the Crown Prosecution Service decided only to take a handful to court – even though other cases might well have met the evidentiary bar for prosecution. But the high court ruling makes clear that even on the basis of the crimes of which he was convicted, there are serious questions to be asked of the panel’s deliberations. The dossier they considered was missing critical information that would have allowed panel members to probe the honesty of Worboys’ account, such as the prosecution’s opening statement in his criminal trial. It was the Ministry of Justice’s job to prepare this dossier, but panel members should have asked for it. The ruling also comments on the inconsistencies in Worboys’ account to the panel, and asks why they weren’t exposed or explored by it – particularly its lawyer – and concludes: “It is a fair reading of the notes of the hearing that the credibility and reliability of [Worboys’] account was not probed to any extent, if at all.” Moreover, it says that the panel should have taken into account evidence relating to Worboys’ other potential offences in assessing his risk to the public. That evidence has surfaced in other high court cases and was significant – for example a “rape kit” found at his home address – and it was amassed long before the relationship breakdown he claims triggered the crimes of which he has been convicted. The high court judges stop short of saying the Parole Board decision was wrong. But read the ruling, and you cannot fail to ask how on earth the panel came to its view that Worboys had adequately demonstrated he was safe to be released. The Parole Board has made mistakes, and should be held accountable. But Hardwick’s forced resignation has the ring of a politician looking for a fall guy. Hardwick has been clear about the need for reform and greater transparency. There is a risk that his resignation allows the justice secretary, David Gauke, to deflect difficult questions he himself must answer. Why did the MoJ fail to include all the relevant information in the dossier that went to the board? Gauke is also ultimately responsible for the well-documented failings of the probation service to alert Worboys’ victims to his release. Why shouldn’t he take responsibility for these failings, as Hardwick has? Gauke today also announced plans to make parole decisions far more transparent. Unlike the courts system, the Parole Board has operated under a cloak of secrecy for too long. Worboys’ victims shouldn’t have had to crowdfund a high court case to find out how the release decision was made. But transparency is not enough. The board’s independence is paramount: decisions about a prisoner’s release should not be subject to either ministerial meddling or the court of public opinion. What today’s ruling reveals, though, is the urgent need to review the robustness of the system. Right now, the Parole Board sits as a non-departmental public body sponsored by the MoJ. Given the importance of its decisions, there is an argument for moving it into the courts system, with more involvement from judges in serious and complex cases such as Worboys’. But the biggest takeaway here is surely the extent to which the system remains set against victims. The two women who took this case, known as DSD and NBV, had already spent years in the court system trying to secure justice for their terrible treatment at the hands of the Metropolitan police. They should not have had to return to get this decision overturned; and that, ultimately, is the sign of a system not working for victims. • Sonia Sodha is the Observer’s chief leader writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/30/erin-raye-track-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T09:30:15Z","webTitle":"This week’s tracks reviewed: Roger Daltrey, Erin Rae and Girli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/30/erin-raye-track-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/30/erin-raye-track-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"This week’s tracks reviewed: Roger Daltrey, Erin Rae and Girli","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Erin Rae Can’t Cut Loose Speaking as someone who owns a different pair of cowboy boots for every day of the week, my internal bias towards anything featuring a twangy guitar and the pure mountain vocal of a woman who’s definitely got a pet cat named after Dolly Parton should disqualify me from commenting on anything country.

Strict policy interventions to reduce use of antibiotics, as employed in the UK, cannot be upheld to the same extent in countries where the burden of disease is much higher, antibiotics are accessible without prescription, and access to healthcare is much reduced. A new report highlights the increase in both the use of antibiotics and access to them, particularly in developing countries. The impact on antibiotic resistance cannot be underestimated. As economies in lower- and middle-income countries grow, so does access to medicine and use of antibiotics, as the study – from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US – shows. A 65% rise in antibiotic use demonstrates a worrying upward trend, and the authors highlight that without significant changes antibiotic use in 2030 could be up to 200% higher than when first estimated three years ago. The need for urgent action has never been more clear. Antibiotic resistance is not confined by borders, therefore those combating it need to have a strong interest in collaborating and supporting efforts in other countries. No one solution can address this problem; a multifaceted response is required. We must improve public education, particularly in regions where antibiotics do not require a prescription. Infection prevention and control, often seen as beyond the issue of antibiotic resistance, should be prioritised, and a significant increase in the tracking of infection and resistance rates will be needed globally. Crucially, we must help to alter healthcare providers’ reliance on prescribing by symptoms alone, by providing them with rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. Imagine a test that could tell a prescriber in a matter of minutes if a patient’s sore throat was caused by a virus or a bacterial infection; or one that could rapidly determine the best course of antibiotics for an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. If the right tests are available, clinicians will no longer need to rely on symptoms alone to make a diagnosis, or on central laboratory facilities if a test can be done in minutes at the patient’s bedside. At the Longitude prize we have established a £10m fund to seek solutions for antibiotic resistance, and reduce inappropriate prescriptions by incentivising the development of a rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test. This would allow clinicians to prescribe antibiotics only when needed, and ensure patients with viral infections were not given antibiotics. Access to such innovative tests must not be limited to high-GDP countries; as we have seen from this new report, antibiotic use is particularly on the increase in developing countries and resource-poor settings, where humidity, access to power and refrigeration all need to be considered for any new diagnostic methods. Cost is an important driver: how can we ensure diagnostics are used when antibiotics can often be bought without prescription, and for significantly less than the price of running a test? Governments and health institutions must invest in supporting their prescribers with the tools to aid accurate diagnosis of bacterial infections. The cost of antibiotic resistance is often underestimated – for example, the duration of hospital stays increases with resistant infections, which is expensive for the health system or insurer. Further cost-effectiveness studies would do much to aid the uptake of new diagnostics. The tide of antibiotic resistance continues to rise, and the global healthcare community must work together to ensure that all countries, no matter their GDP, have access to the education and tools to tackle this emerging crisis. • Caroline Purslow is programme manager for the Longitude prize at the Challenge Prize Centre of the innovation foundation Nesta"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/29/mp-two-jobs-dan-jarvis-sheffield-mayor-westminster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Is it really such a terrible thing for your MP to have two jobs? | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/mp-two-jobs-dan-jarvis-sheffield-mayor-westminster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/mp-two-jobs-dan-jarvis-sheffield-mayor-westminster","fields":{"headline":"Is it really such a terrible thing for your MP to have two jobs?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gilmour Leburn sounds like a character from minor fiction, the glamorous detective in some interwar country house whodunnit perhaps. The real life Leburn, however, was a Scottish Conservative MP. His claim on a footnote in British political history rests upon a solitary fact. His early death in 1963 caused a byelection in Kinross and West Perthshire. This byelection enabled the new prime minister, the Earl of Home, who was then a member of the House of Lords, to disclaim his peerage and win a seat in the House of Commons as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. That strange interregnum between Home’s elevation to the premiership in October 1963 and his arrival in the House of Commons in November was the last occasion when Britain was led by a prime minister who was not an MP – and even, for the period of the byelection, a prime minister who was not a member of either house of parliament. Such events feel as if they come from another world – impossible to imagine today. But is this so? Granted, the chances of a member of the House of Lords becoming prime minister are now extremely remote. These days, though, peers are not the only significant politicians outside the Commons. The major parties of the present day don’t just exist at Westminster but in the devolved legislatures too. Increasingly they contain a number of high-profile senior figures who are not MPs but who shape our politics even more. Some of these are sometimes even spoken of as potential UK party leaders. The Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson is one case in point. The Labour mayor of London Sadiq Khan is another. Yet the requirement for a party leader, and for a prime minister, to be drawn from the Commons alone has grown tighter since the days of Douglas-Home. The rules of the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all require that the party leader is a member of the House of Commons when a contest occurs. Of the major parties in parliament, only the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish parties do not observe this requirement. Yet as these rules have got tighter, Britain has become more devolved and MPs have lost some authority. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved governments, while some English cities and city regions have directly elected mayors, with more to come. These are now important parts of the governance of Britain. Yet the barriers between them and Westminster are higher than ever. That is because it has become standard that no one should sit in a devolved body, or be a mayor, while sitting in the Commons. Dual mandates are now not permitted between the Commons and the European, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures – though this does not yet apply to the Scottish parliament or the mayoralties. Yet opposition to this is in fact a relatively recent convention. Donald Dewar, first to be first minister of Scotland, sat in both the Scottish and the Westminster parliaments until his death in 2000. Alex Salmond sat in both bodies too, including for a period when he was also SNP leader. Until 2010, 16 out of 18 Northern Ireland MPs sat in the Northern Ireland assembly at the same time. As recently as 2015-16, Boris Johnson was simultaneously mayor of London and an MP. Opposition to dual mandates has crept into the political system with little scrutiny. Its causes include the belief, reflecting in part the decline of local government and the advice sector, that a modern MP should be a 24/7 constituency caseworker. Another is the sometimes puritanical distaste – notably in the Labour party – towards MPs who do second jobs of any kind. Undoubtedly the workload and travel demands of dual mandates are exacting. But so is being a government minister or an opposition frontbencher – and MPs manage to combine those demands with sitting in the Commons at the same time. The latest flurry around the dual mandate issue is taking place in the Labour party. Last week, the MP for Barnsley Central, Dan Jarvis, won the vote among local Labour members to be the party’s candidate for the new Sheffield city regional mayoralty. National party officials have instructed Jarvis to resign as an MP if he wins the Sheffield race. Jarvis refuses to make that promise. He says he will forego the Sheffield salary because the post carries very few powers and he wants to remain at Westminster to make the case for more. He draws the comparison with government ministers, who spend their days in departmental offices while also taking part in Commons business. As ever in the Labour party, this isn’t just about the rules or even the issues around devolution but an argument about power. The rules allow Jarvis to “double-job”, as he made clear he intends to do, if elected. But the party national executive, controlled by the left, wants to stop the centrist MP from having his way. The Unite union, firmly on the left, also has its eye on Jarvis’s safe seat. Politics should be more flexible about these things. Others do these things better. Politics should find ways to lower barriers between devolved institutions and the national legislature, not always build them up. This isn’t an easy task. The gravy train opportunities must be firmly controlled. But the national and local debates would be better if politicians such as the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones and the DUP leader Arlene Foster had their own voices at Westminster sometimes – and if Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn debated in the devolved legislatures too. It would be ridiculous if the manifestly able Davidson was unable to contend for the Tory leadership one day just because she was not an MP. Similarly with Khan – or Jarvis – and Labour’s top job. The answer to much of this is staring us in the face. Devolution and integration should be friends and neighbours, not enemies and rivals. So abolish the appointed and hereditary House of Lords. Create a new upper house at Westminster. Do it so that the second chamber represents a federal view of Britain, its regions, nations and other local interests. Allow them to sit together. Politics is too important to be left to MPs. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/28/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T20:00:11Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/28/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/28/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A panel about the F1 Australian Grand Prix (Albert Park circuit guide, 24 March, page 9, Sport) said the race distance was 123km.

In the dying seconds of the first half, Mainz had an appeal for handball turned down by the referee Guido Winkmann, with the scores still at 0-0. Winkmann then blew for the break, allowing the players to go in for half-time – only for the VAR official to give the handball and award a penalty. Following a delay of almost five minutes, Freiburg’s players had to be summoned from the dressing room after it was ruled that Daniel Brosinski’s cross had been handled by Marc-Oliver Kempf. Six minutes and 44 seconds after the first 45 minutes were up, Pablo de Blasis stroked home the spot kick to put his side a goal up and to allow both teams to head back off the pitch for half-time again. The chaotic scenes did little to appease fans who had protested against Monday night football by bombarding the pitch with toilet rolls at the start of each half, forcing the second half to be delayed by 10 minutes. De Blasis was on target again in the second half, just about, and sealed a 2-0 win for Mainz when his shot at an open goal bounced in off the post in the 78th minute. It allowed Mainz to move above free-falling Freiburg in the table and up to 15th, ending their own six-game winless run in the process. The VAR system has been used in the Bundesliga this season but not without controversy as it has been at the centre of several disputed decisions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-weekly-briefing-launch-of-the-campaign-for-a-peoples-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: launch of the campaign for a 'people's vote'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-weekly-briefing-launch-of-the-campaign-for-a-peoples-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/17/brexit-weekly-briefing-launch-of-the-campaign-for-a-peoples-vote","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: launch of the campaign for a 'people's vote'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian Supporter. Thank you. Top stories With Westminster and Brussels on holiday, there weren’t many. But as the UK and EU gear up for their first discussion this week on the future relationship, MPs from the four main parties in Britain launched a push for a “people’s vote” on the final deal. Carefully avoiding the term “second referendum”, the cross-party lineup included the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Chuka Umunna, who urged his Labour party to be “true to its values and support this”. Whether the proposition can win a majority in the House of Commons is unclear. But pressure on the government to secure a sensible final deal mounted, with the Institute of Directors bluntly urging it to maintain close ties with the EU after Brexit. The IoD said trade with the EU and the rest of the world would have to be boosted to fulfil ministers’ “global Britain” ambitions, with the EU currently providing stronger growth for UK firms selling overseas than Asia or North America. A warning of what might be in store if the government gets it wrong came from Jaguar Land Rover, which announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs owing to Brexit “headwinds” – while Ireland reiterated its regular reminder of trouble ahead. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned that the withdrawal treaty and the transition agreement would both be at risk as early as June unless Britain came up with an acceptable wording as a “backstop” solution to the Irish border question in the event of no deal. Best of the rest Fake news inquiry raises concerns over targeting of voters in referendum. Britons living in the rest of the EU are mainly working age not over-65s, says ONS. Essential to avoid disaster of hard Irish border, says Tony Blair on Good Friday agreement anniversary. Leave.EU and Arron Banks face new questions about referendum funding. Vote Leave broke spending limits on industrial scale, says former staffer. Britons in France grill ambassador over post-Brexit rights. UK could create 5,000 jobs by moving to sustainable fishing, says report. Labour says Barry Gardiner backs its Brexit policy despite “bollocks” comments. Number of Britons becoming citizens of another EU state doubled in 2016. UK could ban livestock exports for slaughter after Brexit, says the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Brexiters seek campaign memorabilia for “museum of sovereignty”. Top comment In the Guardian, Hugo Dixon argues that Brexit is looking bad on all fronts, which is why there should be a people’s vote on the final deal: Quitting the EU will affect us for generations to come. It will impact jobs, the NHS, the environment, our ability to stand up to bullies across the world, our pride and even the unity of the United Kingdom. A good deal would be good for our public services, prosperity, power and peace. But as new facts emerge, it is clear Brexit will fail on all counts. The leave campaign’s slogan was “take back control”. This is a bad joke. As Theresa May makes one climbdown after another in the Brexit talks, it’s clear we are losing control. This is because we need the EU more than it needs us – exactly the opposite of what Johnson, Gove and co promised two years ago. This tail-between-our-legs Brexit will be bad for our pride and bad for our power. We’ll have less clout on the global stage too. At a time when Russia is flexing its muscles, is it really sensible to burn our bridges with Europe? Brexiters will, no doubt, seek to trash the idea of a people’s vote by calling it a second referendum. It’s not. In 2016, voters had a choice between the reality of staying in the EU and the fantasy promised by the leave campaign. Once we know what the deal is, we will be able to compare two realities. That’s not undemocratic. It’s common sense. In the New Statesman, George Eaton argues that public opinion remains too ambiguous for most MPs to back a new vote: The facts have changed since the public first voted. Rather than swiftly securing a new trade deal, the UK has been forced to accept a “transition period” of 21 months during which it will remain subject to all EU laws. Though a recession has been avoided, British GDP growth in 2017 was the weakest for five years and the worst of any G7 country. The fantasy of reaping £350m a week for the NHS has been discredited (Britain is forecast to endure a net fiscal loss of around that amount). A YouGov poll suggests 44% of voters believe the public should have the “final say” on whether the UK remains in the EU, while 38% believe it should not. Remainers naturally seized on the finding, but public opinion is more ambiguous than they would like. A differently worded question in the same poll, which asked whether there should be a “public vote”, put “should not” ahead by six points (45-39). And it is far from certain that the UK would differently. Today’s YouGov poll gives Remain a three-point lead (44-41), but others have suggested Leave would win by a similar margin. There is an unambiguous democratic case for a new referendum, but the political case is harder to make.

Pep Guardiola’s side secured the Premier League title on Sunday after winning the EFL Cup in February, yet thoughts are turning to how the team can improve. Last week City were knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool at the quarter-final stage. De Bruyne said: “That’s the next step for us. We have played some great games in the Champions League and we’ve not been too far away. Maybe we haven’t gone as far as we would have liked but there have been performances along the way that show we could do something special in the future. “It’s great to play at the highest level and success doesn’t come easy when you’re playing against teams who have been around it for so many years, but we improved a little on [the last-16] last season and we’ll look to do the same again next year. It’s what we all want; to do the best we can in all of the competitions and the Champions League is no different.” De Bruyne hopes that Guardiola can strengthen the squad. “It’s important for the club to add new players and to keep getting stronger,” the Belgium international said. “That’s true for all teams. We have a great group of players right now and with a few additions here and there hopefully that will take us on to another level. Competition will be even tougher next season and we have to be ready for that. “Not only in the Premier League but in the Champions League and the cup competitions too. If we want to keep achieving I think competition for places is a good thing and only makes you try to improve as a player. “The feeling among the squad is great. We have enjoyed the season a lot but there is work to do if we want to achieve more in future. That can be the trickiest thing in football, to not only win but keep winning. Having such a young squad will hopefully help us to achieve that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/16/canada-trudeau-transcanada-pipeline","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T17:37:23Z","webTitle":"Canada: Trudeau vows to push ahead with pipeline plans in spite of protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/canada-trudeau-transcanada-pipeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/16/canada-trudeau-transcanada-pipeline","fields":{"headline":"Canada: Trudeau vows to push ahead with pipeline plans in spite of protests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Justin Trudeau has said Canada’s government is prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward plans for a controversial pipeline expansion, despite protests and efforts by a provincial government to halt the project on environmental grounds. For months, the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia have been locked in a standoff over plans, spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, to expand an existing pipeline and lay nearly 1,000km of new pipe from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast. While the project could allow Alberta to get its landlocked bitumen to markets in Asia and reduce its reliance on the US market, it has encountered opposition in British Columbia over the potential for oil spills and the impact that a dramatic rise in tanker traffic could have on the region’s southern resident killer whales, a population already on the knife edge of extinction. The political stalemate over the C$7.4bn project catapulted into the national conversation last week after Kinder Morgan Canada announced it would walk away from the project unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May. Their project has now become a crucial test for Trudeau and his Liberal government, who swept into office in 2015 on promises of striking a balance between economic growth, environmental concerns and repairing the country’s fraught relationship with indigenous peoples. “While governments grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant permission,” noted the Liberal party’s 2015 platform. The pipeline expansion has put this sentiment to the test, with Vancouver and nearby Burnaby launching court actions against the project along with several First Nations communities. After taking power in 2017, the provincial government of British Columbia – a left-leaning coalition which relies on support from the Green Party – vowed to use all the tools available to them to halt the project. Recent weeks have seen indigenous-led protests against the project heat up, sending thousands into the streets. About 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs. On Sunday, Trudeau interrupted a foreign trip to meet the premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, reiterating his government’s determination to see the project completed. “The Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada − it will be built,” he told reporters after the meeting. The prime minister said the project – which would nearly triple the flow of Alberta’s bitumen to the west coast – is in the national interest. “It means good jobs in Alberta, they’ve suffered tough times. It means good jobs in BC, thousands of them as the pipeline is built.” The uncertainty looming over trade relations between Canada and the US as well as waning investor confidence in Canada’s ability to complete big projects reinforce why this expansion needs to go forward, he added. Trudeau said his government would launch formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan and potentially use taxpayer dollars to ensure the project goes forward. As interprovincial pipelines are the federal government’s jurisdiction, his government may also pursue legislation to assert Ottawa’s authority over the project, he said. Approving the project in 2016, Trudeau said: “I’ve said many times that there isn’t a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it.” After meeting Trudeau on Sunday, John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, showed no sign that his government would drop its opposition to the project. “My obligation is to the people of BC, and I will defend that until I am no longer premier,” he said. Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, said she would move to introduce legislation on Monday that would allow her province to scale back its oil and gas exports to British Columbia, potentially driving up prices in the province."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T21:06:30Z","webTitle":"Andy Carroll’s late strike for West Ham saves Joe Hart and stuns Stoke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/16/west-ham-united-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Andy Carroll’s late strike for West Ham saves Joe Hart and stuns Stoke","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"These are the moments when Gareth Southgate could be forgiven for wondering whether it is time to draw a line through Joe Hart’s international career. This was another personal ordeal for the man who has just lost his place as England’s first-choice goalkeeper. Southgate was here to witness it and, at this rate, there has to be a serious possibility that Hart will be cut adrift from the England squad that goes to Russia for this summer’s World Cup. What other conclusion can be drawn when the goalkeeping error that led to Peter Crouch, one of Stoke’s substitutes, opening the scoring can hardly be described as a one-off? Indeed, Hart did something very similar in the 3-0 defeat at home to Burnley last month, on the day he was recalled to the side after a long spell in the wilderness. It is becoming a recurring theme and West Ham’s fans were not in the mood to be sympathetic after his latest lapse. There were ironic, unforgiving cheers towards the end whenever Hart gathered the ball without making a mistake. At least Hart was spared the ignominy of his mistake being the game’s decisive moment and West Ham’s equaliser, courtesy of the fit-again Andy Carroll, helped David Moyes’s team edge another point further away from the relegation places. Stoke, on the other hand, remain in 19th position, having passed up a glorious opportunity to register their first away win since October. Paul Lambert’s side now have only four games to save themselves and still have to play Liverpool after they have hosted Europa League-chasing Burnley on Sunday. Lambert looked crestfallen afterwards but Stoke’s manager was stretching the truth when he said all the luck had gone against his team. On the contrary, there were three disallowed goals for West Ham in a chaotic second half for the referee, Michael Oliver, in his first game back since the now-infamous Champions League tie between Juventus and Real Madrid, Gianluigi Buffon’s red card and all the unpleasantness that has followed. Marko Arnautovic had strayed offside before directing in his 55th-minute header and the same player was flagged again when Edimilson Fernandes fired in a shot from 20 yards. This time, Arnautovic was standing directly in Jack Butland’s line of vision and, though Moyes seemed aggrieved at the time, he accepted afterwards it was a fine piece of officiating. West Ham’s manager was less impressed with the decision, in stoppage-time, to penalise Carroll for his challenge on Ryan Shawcross just before another substitute, Javier Hernández, fired in what would almost certainly have been a winner. It was a dramatic finale to a game that had taken a long time to ignite and, for Carroll, a personal triumph given that he had not played since 4 January and, at one point, was not expected to feature again this season. His goal was expertly taken: he guided in a controlled left-foot volley from Aaron Cresswell’s cross and shifted the mood just as the West Ham fans were preparing, undoubtedly, for another show of loud dissent at the final whistle. Carroll returned to full training only five days before this match and there was an irony that it was two of England’s forgotten men who came up with the goals on the night Southgate was in the crowd to keep tabs on the two goalkeepers. Moyes made a point afterwards of not being too hard on Hart, restricting himself to saying it was a “surprise” to see the former England No 1 fumbling Xherdan Shaqiri’s shot into Crouch’s path. Moyes also made the point, legitimately, that Hart had made some fine saves in their previous game at Chelsea. Yet this felt like a manager trying not to damage Hart’s confidence any further. The truth, however it is dressed up, was that it was a wretched error from an increasingly accident-prone goalkeeper. For Stoke, the disappointment was their inability to hold on once they had put themselves in a winning position. The game lived down to expectations during the opening 45 minutes – two ordinary sides huffing and puffing without any real wit or creativity – and it was easy to see why Stoke were averaging under a goal per game this season. Stoke have not managed two goals in a league fixture since January. They have the worst goal difference in the league and it is a problem that needs to be fixed if there is to be a dramatic feat of escapology in the next few weeks. Lambert argued afterwards that if Stoke had played this well throughout the season Mark Hughes would still be their manager and the team would not be in the bottom three. There was a fair amount of top-spin on that assessment but in one respect it was an improvement – Stoke had lost their previous seven fixtures in London, conceding 26 goals in the process. Ultimately, though, it needed a goalkeeping mistake for them to take the lead and that, for Hart, made this a night that could have serious ramifications for his hopes of going to the World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/16/mauricio-pochettino-catchup-tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-semi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T21:30:19Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino plots game of catch-up for Tottenham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/16/mauricio-pochettino-catchup-tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-semi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/16/mauricio-pochettino-catchup-tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-semi","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino plots game of catch-up for Tottenham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has passed on his congratulations to Manchester City on becoming Premier League champions and immediately turned his thoughts to how he and Tottenham might get the better of them next season. Spurs have work to do to guarantee a place in the top four, a job that continues at Brighton on Tuesday night, before the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United on Saturday. Pochettino is also still chewing over the performance that enabled City to ease to a 3-1 win at Wembley last Saturday. He believes elements of that display showed Spurs can compete but that his team must start next season strongly if they are to have a hope of becoming champions. “I want to congratulate Pep, the coaching staff and of course the players – they deserve the title,” he said. “In football, after a whole season, it is the most consistent side that has the capacity to win. “[On Saturday] when we reached our real levels we showed we can compete with Manchester City. But to be consistent over the entire season is the challenge for us. “If we want to win and challenge for big things, we need to start from day one in pre-season. If you analyse how we started the last three seasons, they began after four, five or 10 games. That is a thing to improve. We are going to be focused on starting better.” One of the factors that has impeded Spurs’ starts in previous seasons has been recruitment, with the club often completing deals in the final weeks of the transfer window. This summer the transfer window will close as the season begins, but with a World Cup also in the offing Pochettino feels they will have to act earlier. “It is so dangerous to go and scout players in the World Cup. If a player plays well you will have a lot of competition and how are you going to sign him? Sometimes you need to anticipate, to think, ‘OK, this player can be good for us’, but you need to sign [him] before the tournament starts. We are thinking and trying to anticipate because it will be difficult if not. “It’s not all about money in football, that is true. But it helps. As a coach you can have ideas about football but then you need the principal actors to deliver this idea. We are competing in a different way to Manchester City. At Tottenham we have to be brave, to believe, to work harder than other clubs that are at our level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/16/pep-guardiola-next-challenge-manchester-city-win-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:15:00Z","webTitle":"What next for Pep Guardiola?

It has to be the Champions League trophy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You won. Fine. Now win again. Win better. Even in a moment of triumph, with his beautifully engineered seventh domestic title safely stowed away, it is hard to avoid that nagging paradox that runs through Pep Guardiola’s managerial career. Although not before making space for a little grateful applause. It was fitting Manchester City’s Premier League title arrived at a canter in the end, leaving some clarity around the edges, some time to step back and simply admire. A prolonged stutter to the line may have confirmed a few hard-to-shift Proper Football Man Prejudices. But it would also have been misleading. City have the most points, most shots, most goals and most passes. They’ve been strolling away at the top of the league since the fifth week of the season, a 6-0 win at Watford nestled in the middle of a 5-0, a 4-0, a 5-0 and a 7-2. In reality it is not possible to win more convincingly than this. Not least when, besides the numbers, there is also the basic tone and texture of this league title, the sense of players stretching out into the fringes of their own talent, finding new patterns and rhythms. From August into April these Premier League champions have been a rare joy, a team that keep the ball with the usual Pep-issue mania but come forward in a relentless swarm, spreading the game into every available part of the space whatever the score, whatever the time on the clock, always unapologetically itself. It is worth noting that had City failed to deliver this season the same Manchester United team who clanked their way to a square-headed title-sealing defeat by West Brom may now be in line to win the Premier League. In the event United’s expensive brand of stodge is a reminder of just how difficult it is to engineer drive and fluency in a standard modern team of expensive bolt-on parts. By contrast, the champions have been a rare gift, a reminder that for all its vested interests, its fixed hierarchies, elite modern football can still be a genuinely uplifting thing. At which point the wheels start to clank, the screen dissolves and another version of this movie begins to roll. This is the alternative history of Pep. For all its brilliance this City team are also a ruthlessly assembled winning machine. Just as for the manager another league title is another season spent exclusively in the company of the sport’s financially incontinent elite. En route to winning the title and a League Cup Guardiola has spent £448m on players in two seasons, the greatest single transfer splurge in history. And so that paradox kicks in: a brilliant team who also have a sense of inevitability about them, a project that simply cannot be allowed to fail. How to resolve this contradiction is not immediately clear. There are shades of a footballing version of the Peter Principle. Guardiola has been so good at managing teams he only ever gets to manage the ones who are so powerful they cannot fail. Even through this glaze there are other contradictions. For all this, Guardiola has somehow managed to retain not just the moral high ground but an air of likable asceticism. He seems an oddly monk-like figure, known for the purity of his methods, the idealistic obsession with detail. At times this can be endearingly comical. Even in the middle of the title stroll Guardiola spent Christmas Day watching videos of Newcastle, the kind of festive viewing choice that brings to mind the response of one exasperated friend to the news that the dying poet Philip Larkin was seeing out his days drinking “nothing but cheap red wine” – the suggestion that he could, at least, try some expensive red wine. At the same time he is clearly a brilliant manager on a very basic level, venerated in England partly because so much of what he does is an upgrade on the old managerial tropes. Like a George Graham for the non-contact age, Guardiola spends hours drilling his defensive line, enacting what is in effect a more fluid version of moving up and down together holding a piece of rope. In the old Don Revie style he makes a point of knowing the first name of everyone at the club, of urging his players to bond and spend time together socially, although rather than nine pints of lager it is breakfast with the club nutritionist and quinoa doggy bags after training. Yet for all the graft and detail, there are those obvious blind spots. Guardiola has never managed a team where success would not have arrived anyway in some form or other. He is rightly feted for his 12 trophies at the Camp Nou. But Barcelona have won almost as many since he left and as many Champions Leagues without him since Lionel Messi showed up. Similarly with City, where this season’s achievements on trophies alone are an exact replica of what Manuel Pellegrini rustled up in his first season. There is nothing here to compare with Porto winning the Champions League, or Inter, or Atlético Madrid’s rise. Winning a title he had no right to win, wrestling against the tide of history. This remains the unticked box for a manager routinely venerated as the best of his generation. With this in mind next season presents another kind of opportunity. It may be harsh to say Guardiola must win the Champions League for his time at City to be judged an unqualified success but it is also true, as it was at Bayern Munich. Albeit this time around there is a chance to enter, for the first time, a frontier territory. Winning the Champions League would be undeniably Guardiola’s own work, at least with this current City, who are not a collection of ready-made global stars but a team with an attacking unit aged 21, 22 and 23, where nobody in the regular first XI has won this competition before. This may well change as City strengthen in the summer. No doubt Guardiola’s obsession with the Champions League will contribute to this. Seven years on from his last victorious semi-final, this competition has undeniably got away from him, evolving instead into a series of tactical glitches, Pep blinking first in the glare. Never mind, for now, the money spent, the will-to-power of the Premier League’s Emirati overlords. If this title has been a freewheeling joy, next season presents something else, a chance for Guardiola to do something different, to win for the first time against the prevailing tide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/17/nsw-police-watchdog-condemns-dangerous-plan-to-restructure-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:00:02Z","webTitle":"NSW police watchdog condemns 'dangerous' plan to restructure crime commission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/nsw-police-watchdog-condemns-dangerous-plan-to-restructure-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/nsw-police-watchdog-condemns-dangerous-plan-to-restructure-commission","fields":{"headline":"NSW police watchdog condemns 'dangerous' plan to restructure crime commission","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A proposal to make the head of the powerful New South Wales Crime Commission a non-judicial appointment is a “worrying development” that could undermine its independence, the state’s police watchdog has warned. Highly secretive and equipped with broad super-judicial powers, the NSW Crime Commission can compel people to give evidence even if they are not suspected of a crime and removes the right to silence, meaning its targets can be jailed if they refuse to answer questions. The commissioner is currently required to have qualifications equivalent to a supreme court judge, including seven or more years of experience as a lawyer. But the NSW government is considering changing the position from a judicial to a non-judicial role as part of a review into the “structure, functions and operation” of the commission. The government is proposing to replace the commissioner with a new chief executive officer who would not need legal qualifications. The current head of the commission, Peter Bodor QC, has already spoken against the plan, telling a NSW parliamentary committee in March that it would have the effect of “thinning” its leadership. But now the proposal has been condemned by the head of the Law Enforcement Crime Commission, the state’s police watchdog. In a letter to a parliamentary committee, the LECC’s commissioner, Michael Adams, warned that fiddling with the commission’s structure risked undermining its crime-fighting abilities and could open it up to political interference. Adams said that a person without judicial experience would be “unlikely to be qualified to undertake investigations, let alone exercise highly intrusive compulsory powers”. “The fundamental difference between [the current model] and the CEO model appears to me that the CEO need not have legal qualifications or, if legal qualifications are required, no extensive legal experience,” Adams wrote. “In light of the extraordinary powers abrogating civil rights which may be exercised by the crime commission, this difference is a worrying development. “I leave aside the point that an experienced legal practitioner will have had the responsibility over a number of years of conducting cases including, in particular, the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Such a person would also be expected to have a detailed understanding of the rules of procedural fairness.” But he also warned that tinkering with the commission’s structure risked undermining its independence. Oversight for the crime commission is currently conducted by a five-person management committee that includes the commissioner. Adams said that the current arrangement makes it impossible for “political interference” to occur but warned that changing that structure without a “statutory guarantee of functional independence” would be a “retrograde and dangerous development”. “For reasons which should not need to be explained, the commission’s functions must be completely independent of political control or influence,” he wrote. The NSW shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, has also been critical of the proposal. “The current structure requires appropriate legal qualifications for the commissioner [and] granted the powers and role of the commissioner that should not be changed,” he said. A spokeswoman for the minister for police, Troy Grant, said that “no decisions have yet been made” about the commission’s structure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/17/australia-joins-us-and-uk-in-blaming-russia-for-cyber-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T00:56:43Z","webTitle":"Australia joins US and UK in blaming Russian-backed hackers for cyber-attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/17/australia-joins-us-and-uk-in-blaming-russia-for-cyber-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/17/australia-joins-us-and-uk-in-blaming-russia-for-cyber-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Australia joins US and UK in blaming Russian-backed hackers for cyber-attacks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia has joined the US and UK in publicly blaming Russia for a “malicious” global cyber-attack last year. The attack appeared to be an attempt at espionage, stealing intellectual property and laying the foundation for a future attack on infrastructure. Australia joined a coordinated announcement sheeting the blame home to Russian state-sponsored actors. The US and the UK held rare coordinated conference calls on Monday to reveal their findings on the malicious activity identified in August 2017. The attacks targeted Cisco routers with “Smart Install” and potentially affected government departments, companies and infrastructure facilities running Cisco equipment. Tensions with Russia have escalated since the US and UK’s weekend strikes on targets in Syria suspected of being involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons. While Australia did not take part in the strikes – the US, UK and France carried them out – Australia has been part of previous actions in Syria. There has been speculation that Russia will retaliate in the form of cyber-attacks. It took months of investigations to trace the origin of the August cyber-attacks, authorities said, and Tuesday’s announcement was not in response to developments in Syria. “Based on advice from Australian intelligence agencies, and in consultation with our allies, the Australian government has determined that Russian state-sponsored actors are responsible for this activity, which occurred in 2017,” the minister for law enforcement and cybersecurity, Angus Taylor, said in a said in a statement. “These incidents are unacceptable and the Australian government calls on all countries, including Russia, not to take actions that could lead to damage of critical infrastructure that provide services to the public. “Commercially available routers were used as a point of entry, demonstrating that every connected device is vulnerable to malicious activity.” While a significant number of Australian organisations had been affected, there was no indication Australian information had been compromised, he said. The Australian Cyber Security Centre has been providing mitigation advice to companies and internet service providers that may have been affected. In August it issued a warning saying that switches with Cisco Smart Install accessible from the internet, and routers or switches with simple network management protocol enabled and exposed to the internet, were vulnerable. It said that the malicious activity enabled sensitive information, such as device administrative credentials, to be accessed and that it could be used to compromise the routers and then lead to other devices on the network being targeted. “Access to the device may facilitate malicious cyber adversaries gaining access to the information that flows through the device,” the agency warned. US and UK officials said in their conference call they had high confidence that Russia was to blame. In a joint statement, said they said the cyber-attack had been aimed not just at the UK and US but globally. “Specifically, these cyber-exploits were directed at network infrastructure devices worldwide such as routers, switches, firewalls, network intrusion detection system,” it said. “Russian state-sponsored actors are using compromised routers to conduct spoofing ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks to support espionage, extract intellectual property, maintain persistent access to victim networks and potentially lay a foundation for future offensive operations.” The US and UK have previously blamed Russia for cyber-attacks such as the crippling attacks last year that created disruption worldwide, including to the National Health Service, and an intrusion into the US energy grid. But they portrayed this as far more serious because of the potential to undermine infrastructure. Millions of machines had been targeted in a “sustained” campaign and the US and UK admitted they still did not know the full extent to which the system had been compromised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/16/michael-cohen-donald-trump-seized-documents-judge","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T00:10:52Z","webTitle":"Judge rejects Trump and Cohen's bid to view seized papers before prosecutors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/michael-cohen-donald-trump-seized-documents-judge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/michael-cohen-donald-trump-seized-documents-judge","fields":{"headline":"Judge rejects Trump and Cohen's bid to view seized papers before prosecutors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A request from Donald Trump and his legal fixer Michael Cohen to be allowed to vet the documents seized from Cohen by the FBI before prosecutors can examine them was rejected by a federal judge on Monday. But Judge Kimba Wood said she may appoint an independent lawyer to review the records for any protected by attorney-client privilege – possibly with a specific remit of checking documents related to the president. “In terms of the perception of fairness, a special master might have a role here,” Wood said at Manhattan federal court, without immediately issuing an official ruling. Wood also denied a request from Trump for a temporary restraining order against his own justice department, which would have explicitly ordered prosecutors to not begin going through the files from Cohen’s home, office and hotel. The judge’s decisions dealt a blow to Trump and Cohen, who asked to have the first look at Cohen’s files after Trump denounced the FBI raids as being part of a political “witch-hunt” and declared: “Attorney-client privilege is dead!” An attorney for the president on Monday accused prosecutors of “government overreach”. Cohen, who has worked as a lawyer and troubleshooter for Trump over the past decade, is the subject of a criminal investigation that prosecutors in New York have said focuses on his private finances and business interests. The FBI last week searched Cohen’s properties along with a safe deposit box, phones and other devices after obtaining a search warrant from a judge, apparently out of concern that Cohen would not comply with a subpoena. The seized material has not yet been made available to prosecutors investigating Cohen. Stephen Ryan, an attorney for Cohen, said on Monday that five paragraphs in the search warrant paperwork were phrased in such a way as to seek “the papers of the president of the United States that are in the possession of my client”. He declined to explain further when asked by the Guardian following the hearing. Communications between lawyers and clients are typically confidential under the doctrine of attorney-client privilege. But an exception exists for documents containing evidence that the attorney was involved in a crime. Searches of any attorney’s office by the federal government are highly unusual and typically trigger the appointment of a so-called “taint team” of prosecutors, who are walled off from colleagues on the main investigation, to root out privileged files. But Joanna Hendon, an attorney for Trump, told the court on Monday: “He is objecting to anyone other than himself making the initial determination of privilege.” FBI agents are believed to have taken documents relating to a $130,000 payoff to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actor known as Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump and was paid to keep quiet. Investigators are likely to examine whether the payment was legal under election campaign finance laws and whether Cohen disclosed the true reason for borrowing the funds. Clifford and her attorney attended Monday’s hearing but did not intervene. After being seated by officials in a corner of the room far from the legal action, Clifford appeared bored and leaned her head against the wall. Court artists craned to observe Clifford through their magnifying spectacles. Thomas McKay, an assistant US attorney, argued against the request from Cohen and Trump, saying it was not justified or legally sound. McKay accused the pair of deliberately trying to delay the investigation into Cohen and slow down proceedings for years. Todd Harrison, another attorney for Cohen, complained about this apparent accusation of bad faith. Insisting that Cohen’s team were “pretty good people”, he prompted a withering response from the judge. “It’s not that you’re not good people,” said Wood. “It’s that you’ve misstated the law.” Hendon, Trump’s attorney, conceded that allowing them to review the seized files for privileged documents “will take a long time” but blamed the justice department for using a search warrant to run a dragnet through Cohen’s files. McKay said Cohen’s case should be treated “like any other white-collar case”, as his work as an attorney was not central to their inquiries. “Mr Cohen might have a legal degree, but this investigation and search is largely focused on his private business dealings and personal financial dealings,” he said. But attorneys for Cohen and Trump were at pains to disagree. “We’re talking about an unprecedented raid on the office and the home of the sitting president of the United States’s personal attorney,” said Harrison. Describing the case as “combustible”, Harrison said the intense public and media interest in the case, and “partisan attacks” around the subject, meant that special measures were necessary to ensure the appearance of fairness. But McKay hit back at the claims, accusing the Cohen-Trump side of “trying to drum up media attention and then turning around and citing that media attention” as the basis for special treatment. “Both Mr Cohen and President Trump made inflammatory statements about this case. Our office has done no such thing,” said McKay. McKay returned repeatedly to his central argument that Cohen, and in turn Trump, should not be given allowances unavailable to ordinary citizens. “It would not protect the public confidence in the administration of justice to give Mr Cohen and the president special treatment,” said McKay, adding later: “Just because Mr Cohen has a powerful client does not mean he’s entitled to special treatment.” Hendon denied seeking unusual concessions for Trump and said he should merely be allowed to defend his privilege as an attorney’s client. “I’m just asking for the president to be given the opportunity to exercise his sacred right,” she said. Wood directed prosecutors to produce a copy of all Cohen’s files for his team and to begin searching metadata to estimate the volume of material. Then, she suggested, a taint team would proceed. She also asked prosecutors and Cohen’s attorneys to each give her a shortlist of four nominees for the role of special master."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/13/music-festivals-mixology-how-cruises-got-cool","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Music festivals and mixology: how cruises got cool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/13/music-festivals-mixology-how-cruises-got-cool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/13/music-festivals-mixology-how-cruises-got-cool","fields":{"headline":"Music festivals and mixology: how cruises got cool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Think of cruise holidays and a whole host of images spring to mind. Endless buffets. Crushed velvet upholstery. Sex on the beach (the cocktail, obviously). His and hers dressing gowns. Jane McDonald. And, most of all, lots and lots of older people, from well-heeled fiftysomethings to time-rich retirees. Millennials? Not so much. That may be changing, though. Last July, the Cruise Lines International Association revealed that the average age of cruisegoers had fallen to a sprightly 46, its lowest figure in 20 years. (In the UK, the number is a more mature 55.) While those figures may not seem particularly dramatic, they are nevertheless encouraging for an industry that has been largely reliant on the grey pound. A number of cruise companies are working hard to coax younger holidaymakers on board. Last month saw the maiden voyage of what is being referred to as the first line aimed squarely at millennials. U by Uniworld, which offers river cruises through various European cities, including Amsterdam, Budapest and Frankfurt, made headlines when it announced that its ships would only accept 21- to 45-year-olds. That upper age limit has since been removed – Uniworld’s CEO, Ellen Bettridge, suggests the U line is instead for people with an adventurous mindset – but the appeal to youth remains. On board U’s two vessels, you will find silent discos and mixology sessions, while the black-tie meals associated with P&amp;O et al have been replaced by a more casual dining experience featuring brunch and small plates. It is practically Dalston on the Danube. Uniworld isn’t the only established cruise brand chasing younger customers. Next year, the German firm Amadeus is launching cruises along the Rhine, the Danube and the Seine with onboard “celebrity influencers”, who will document the trip on social media. The Regent Seas Explorer offers spin classes and designer handbag stores, while MSC’s Seaside class styles itself in the manner of a Miami South Beach condo, and has a teppanyaki grill and the longest zipline of any cruise ship on the planet. Then there are the floating festivals such as Anchored and Groove Cruise, the latter boasting EDM artists including Deadmau5 and Benny Benassi. Those festivals build on another unlikely trend: the theme cruise. A number of these cruises emerged at the beginning of the decade, featuring bands such as Paramore and Weezer, comic book conventions and, bizarrely, the cast of the Saw horror films. Even festival giant Coachella briefly got in on the act, with a lineup that featured Pulp, Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy. One lesson learned from these theme events is that the cruising itself isn’t necessarily the main draw. “With something like Anchored, people didn’t necessarily know they were going on a cruise. This just happened to be a floating festival at sea,” explains Adam Coulter, the managing editor of the website Cruise Critic. Uniworld has similarly tried to play down the cruise bit of its millennial-friendly cruises, with Bettridge describing the U instead as a “floating boutique hotel that you can hop on and hop off”. It offers regular stop-offs at European cities, with the boats sitting in dock until the wee small hours for the benefit of late-night revellers. The boats are smaller, encouraging closer contact between passengers. There is also less of an emphasis on the mass group activities – the “herding around”, as Coulter puts it – of traditional cruise lines. Instead, holidaymakers are encouraged to explore, with bicycle tours, trips around food markets and visits to breweries or the beach. Twenty-seven-year-old Nina, from Canada, was on U’s first cruise. “I have done a lot of megaship cruises and this river cruise definitely has a different feel to it,” she says. “There are fewer people and you get to interact more. I am an active person, so I particularly liked how active the excursions were. A lot of biking, for sure. “The age group did play a factor in our decision-making,” she adds, noting that the average age of passengers on her boat was “late 20s and early 30s”. The new style of cruising could compete with more traditional package holidays for younger customers, Coulter believes. “You’ve got a ship that’s going to, say, Mykonos, Kos or Santorini in the middle of high season, when you can’t get a hotel room for love nor money.” A cruise ship, with accommodation, food and even some booze included in the price, might start to look tempting. How tempting remains to be seen. U’s cheapest holiday is £1,469 for eight days – less than many cruises, but still a significant outlay for most younger people. The scrapping of the upper age limit suggests they are not quite ready to throw themselves at this form of package holiday. Yet even if the millennial cruise proves to be little more than a passing fad, it is having an effect on the wider industry. Coulter notes that some features – more time in port, less emphasis on group activities – are being adopted by the bigger lines, which are also racing to include eye-grabbing technology such as indoor skydiving tunnels and giant HD screens. Perhaps most crucially of all, internet access – formerly one of the most retrograde aspects of the cruise experience, slow and often laughably expensive – has finally sailed into the 21st century, with affordable superfast wifi on many lines. Perfect, Coulter notes, for the “generation that wants to post selfies and put stuff on Instagram. They want their friends to know they are on a cruise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/18/american-elections-hack-bruce-scheier","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"American elections are too easy to hack.

We must take action now","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Elections serve two purposes. The first, and obvious, purpose is to accurately choose the winner. But the second is equally important: to convince the loser. To the extent that an election system is not transparently and auditably accurate, it fails in that second purpose. Our election systems are failing, and we need to fix them. Today, we conduct our elections on computers. Our registration lists are in computer databases. We vote on computerized voting machines. And our tabulation and reporting is done on computers. We do this for a lot of good reasons, but a side effect is that elections now have all the insecurities inherent in computers. The only way to reliably protect elections from both malice and accident is to use something that is not hackable or unreliable at scale; the best way to do that is to back up as much of the system as possible with paper. Recently, there have been two graphic demonstrations of how bad our computerized voting system is. In 2007, the states of California and Ohio conducted audits of their electronic voting machines. Expert review teams found exploitable vulnerabilities in almost every component they examined. The researchers were able to undetectably alter vote tallies, erase audit logs, and load malware on to the systems. Some of their attacks could be implemented by a single individual with no greater access than a normal poll worker; others could be done remotely. Last year, the Defcon hackers’ conference sponsored a Voting Village. Organizers collected 25 pieces of voting equipment, including voting machines and electronic poll books. By the end of the weekend, conference attendees had found ways to compromise every piece of test equipment: to load malicious software, compromise vote tallies and audit logs, or cause equipment to fail. It’s important to understand that these were not well-funded nation-state attackers. These were not even academics who had been studying the problem for weeks. These were bored hackers, with no experience with voting machines, playing around between parties one weekend. It shouldn’t be any surprise that voting equipment, including voting machines, voter registration databases, and vote tabulation systems, are that hackable. They’re computers – often ancient computers running operating systems no longer supported by the manufacturers – and they don’t have any magical security technology that the rest of the industry isn’t privy to. If anything, they’re less secure than the computers we generally use, because their manufacturers hide any flaws behind the proprietary nature of their equipment. We’re not just worried about altering the vote. Sometimes causing widespread failures, or even just sowing mistrust in the system, is enough. And an election whose results are not trusted or believed is a failed election. Voting systems have another requirement that makes security even harder to achieve: the requirement for a secret ballot. Because we have to securely separate the election-roll system that determines who can vote from the system that collects and tabulates the votes, we can’t use the security systems available to banking and other high-value applications. We can securely bank online, but can’t securely vote online. If we could do away with anonymity – if everyone could check that their vote was counted correctly – then it would be easy to secure the vote. But that would lead to other problems. Before the US had the secret ballot, voter coercion and vote-buying were widespread. We can’t, so we need to accept that our voting systems are insecure. We need an election system that is resilient to the threats. And for many parts of the system, that means paper. Let’s start with the voter rolls. We know they’ve already been targeted. In 2016, someone changed the party affiliation of hundreds of voters before the Republican primary. That’s just one possibility. A well-executed attack that deletes, for example, one in five voters at random – or changes their addresses – would cause chaos on election day. Yes, we need to shore up the security of these systems. We need better computer, network, and database security for the various state voter organizations. We also need to better secure the voter registration websites, with better design and better internet security. We need better security for the companies that build and sell all this equipment. Multiple, unchangeable backups are essential. A record of every addition, deletion, and change needs to be stored on a separate system, on write-only media like a DVD. Copies of that DVD, or – even better – a paper printout of the voter rolls, should be available at every polling place on election day. We need to be ready for anything. Next, the voting machines themselves. Security researchers agree that the gold standard is a voter-verified paper ballot. The easiest (and cheapest) way to achieve this is through optical-scan voting. Voters mark paper ballots by hand; they are fed into a machine and counted automatically. That paper ballot is saved, and serves as a final true record in a recount in case of problems. Touch-screen machines that print a paper ballot to drop in a ballot box can also work for voters with disabilities, as long as the ballot can be easily read and verified by the voter. Finally, the tabulation and reporting systems. Here again we need more security in the process, but we must always use those paper ballots as checks on the computers. A manual, post-election, risk-limiting audit varies the number of ballots examined according to the margin of victory. Conducting this audit after every election, before the results are certified, gives us confidence that the election outcome is correct, even if the voting machines and tabulation computers have been tampered with. Additionally, we need better coordination and communications when incidents occur. It’s vital to agree on these procedures and policies before an election. Before the fact, when anyone can win and no one knows whose votes might be changed, it’s easy to agree on strong security. But after the vote, someone is the presumptive winner – and then everything changes. Half of the country wants the result to stand, and half wants it reversed. At that point, it’s too late to agree on anything. The politicians running in the election shouldn’t have to argue their challenges in court. Getting elections right is in the interest of all citizens. Many countries have independent election commissions that are charged with conducting elections and ensuring their security. We don’t do that in the US. Instead, we have representatives from each of our two parties in the room, keeping an eye on each other. That provided acceptable security against 20th-century threats, but is totally inadequate to secure our elections in the 21st century. And the belief that the diversity of voting systems in the US provides a measure of security is a dangerous myth, because few districts can be decisive and there are so few voting-machine vendors. We can do better. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security declared elections to be critical infrastructure, allowing the department to focus on securing them. On 23 March, Congress allocated $380m to states to upgrade election security. These are good starts, but don’t go nearly far enough. The constitution delegates elections to the states but allows Congress to “make or alter such Regulations”. In 1845, Congress set a nationwide election day. Today, we need it to set uniform and strict election standards.

And in a dramatic cultural breakthough, 30-year-old rapper Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer for music in a category long reserved for classical works. The New York Times and New Yorker were jointly awarded the Pulitzer prize for public service on Monday for investigating accusations of sexual harassment and assault made against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein. Reports on the allegations, which Weinstein has denied, led to a cascade of accusations and admissions of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, politics and beyond as the #MeToo movement made 2017 a year of reckoning for powerful men. The Times also shared the national reporting Pulitzer with rival the Washington Post, in recognition of each newspaper’s dedicated coverage of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. But in a year when the media has been galvanised by digging into Trump’s chaotic presidency, Lamar’s award for his album Damn also stood out as the rapper from Compton, California became the first rap artist to win a Pulitzer in music. It is the first piece of popular music to receive the music award since it was introduced in 1943. The music award was the last to be announced at the Pulitzer prize ceremony on Monday afternoon at Columbia University in New York City. Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy, the first woman and person of color to announce the award, smiled while reading Lamar’s name. Before announcing the journalism winners, Canedy explained why these works were selected: “Their work is real news of the highest order, executed nobly as journalism was always intended, without fear or favor.” Her reference to “real news” was a subtle rebuke to Donald Trump’s constant badgering of journalists, which has helped make the phrase “fake news” part of the cultural lexicon. The two national newspapers to take home the most awards, the New York Times and the Washington Post, have been subjected to repeated attacks by the president. Trump has called for the Post to be registered as a lobbying group and frequently complains about reporting done by the “failing” New York Times. The New York Times, however, won the most Pulitzer prizes with three awards. Its final award was in the editorial cartooning for a series profiling a real-life family of refugees in the US. The Times’ rival, the Washington Post, secured two awards. The second was the investigative reporting prize, handed down for the newspaper’s examination of the Republican nominee for the Alabama’s special Senate election, Roy Moore. He lost the race after six women said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. He denied dating anyone underage and that he had sexually assaulted anyone. Marty Baron, executive editor at the Washington Post, said in a statement: “In the end, the work of these Post journalists stands as a case study in why we need a free and independent press in this country.” The allegations made against Moore also helped drive the commentary award, which was given to John Archibald, an Alabama Media Group writer and longtime Birmingham News columnist, for his writing on state politics. He was one of several regional journalists and newspapers to be awarded a Pulitzer. The Press Democrat, in Santa Rosa, California, earned the breaking news award for its coverage of the wildfires that devastated the state last year. The Arizona Republic, with the USA Today Network, was awarded the explanatory journalism award for a series on the border wall between the US and Mexico. And the Cincinnati Enquirer took home the local reporting award for a package on how the region has been affected by the opioid addiction crisis. Andie Dominick, of the Des Moines Register, received the editorial writing prize for “examining in a clear, indignant voice, free of cliché or sentimentality” the consequences of Iowa healthcare laws. Photographer Ryan Kelly, of the Daily Progress in Charlottesville, Virginia, won the breaking news photography award for capturing the moment a car struck demonstrators during a clash between white supremacists and their opponents. Persistent racism in the US also marked the feature writing award, which went to Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, for her reporting on Dylann Roof, who killed nine black people at a church in South Carolina, for GQ magazine in the piece A Most American Terrorist. The international reporting prize went to Reuters for its coverage of the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war, which has seen thousands killed. The wire reporting service also won the feature photography award for following the plight of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar. And the New York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz won the criticism prize. Along with Lamar’s Damn, the other winners outside of the journalism categories were Andrew Sean Greer’s Less, for fiction; Cost of Living, for drama; The Gulf: The Making of An American Sea for US history and Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder, for biography. Poet Frank Bidart won the award for his collection Half-Light and the nonfiction award went to James Forman Jr for Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/17/madonna-janelle-monae-female-sexuality-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"From Madonna to Janelle Monáe: how female sexuality progressed in pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/17/madonna-janelle-monae-female-sexuality-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/17/madonna-janelle-monae-female-sexuality-pop","fields":{"headline":"From Madonna to Janelle Monáe: how female sexuality progressed in pop","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1997, Aerosmith released an ode to the female anatomy, simply titled Pink, in which Steven Tyler famously brayed about his tremendous love of a woman’s vagina. Every line began with the declaration “Piiiink…”, followed by a cheeseball rhyme scheme describing a variety of sexual situations. Subtle it was not. Fortunately, more than two decades later, R&amp;B-soul luminary Janelle Monáe has rescued us from a lifetime of negative Aerosmith-word associations by taking back the song title, teaming up with art-pop nymph Grimes and swapping out the I for a Y. In 2018, we get Pynk, a silky, joyful, funk-fused gem that, like the Aerosmith track, is about the vagina and also starts each line with the word “pink”. But where Tyler was blunt and blundering, Monáe is slick and sophisticated. Like the alternative spelling of “womyn”, Pynk finds Monáe keen to explore a world free from male influence. In the song’s vibrant music video, the star, who has never officially defined her sexuality except to deem herself “sexually liberated”, dances in triangular, ruffled “pussy” pants, throws a ladies-only house party, shows off unshaven pubic hair and nuzzles actor Tessa Thompson. She praises the female form and the nirvana between her legs (“Pink like the paradise found”). Men don’t figure into the song’s equation, unless it’s to dismissively point out that they’ve “got blue”. Which is fine, because “we’ve got the pink”. Critics have hailed the song as a must-hear girl power anthem, while the lesbian community has praised its accompanying video for beingdeeply erotic and artistically groundbreaking. Celebrating female sexuality in pop music is nothing new, of course. But has it ever been this For Women’s Eyes Only? Madonna set a new bar for mainstream erotic expression in the early 80s when she famously humped the 1986 VMA stage in white lace, singing about how she’d found a lover so good that it made her feel like – well, you remember. In the next decade, she morphed from a newly liberated “virgin” to a proud dominatrix, publicly experimenting with then-taboo subjects like sadomasochism and BDSM on her fifth studio album, Erotica, and her carnal-noir 1992 coffee-table book, Sex. Later, in the pop music boom of the late 90s and early 00s, legions of stars and would-be stars followed in Madonna’s stead, though they arguably took the “sexy virgin” thing a lot more literally than their 80s idol. In 1999, a teenage Britney Spears popularized short schoolgirl skirts and pigtails with her debut video for … Baby One More Time and posed for the cover of Rolling Stone in skimpy PJs with a plush Teletubby in one hand and a phone receiver in the other. On her third album, though, a now twentysomething Spears showed off her sexually empowered side, opting for breathy, moaning vocals on 2001 single I’m A Slave 4 U and open-mouth kissing Madonna herself in 2003 at the VMAs alongside another newly “dirrty” pop performer (and fellow Disney Mouseketeer) Christina Aguilera. It’d be nice to think that the virgin-discovers-sex pop music narrative had worn itself out in recent years, but still, they persisted, with the once family-friendly Miley Cyrus bursting out of a child’s toy (a teddy bear) at the 2013 VMAs and rubbing up against Robin Thicke (among other things, like posing for alleged sexual predator Terry Richardson). Or how about Selena Gomez, who, after years of Barney and Disney, declared herself a proudly sexual being in 2013 by donning a black lace corset and cooing that “when you’re ready, come and get it (na, na, na, na)”. Frustratingly, as cliche as the story is, it’s clearly still a money-maker. And as much as you’d want to congratulate those singers on taking ownership of their sexuality, it’s hard to forget that their awakenings are conveniently designed for male enjoyment and objectification. In other instances, pop singers eschewed the chaste image entirely, sometimes appearing to explore bisexuality and lesbianism, like Katy Perry, making her grand entrance in the late aughts by declaring that she kissed a girl, and she liked it. (Though, of course, she hopes her boyfriend don’t mind it.) Six years earlier, female Russian duo Tatu titillated audiences by touching tongues in soaked-through schoolgirl outfits in the video for their one-hit wonder All The Things She Said. Though on the surface mainstream pop’s dalliance with bisexuality and lesbianism appears progressive, a second look reveals tracks like Perry’s and Tatu’s as shallow – like drunken college-age girls kissing on a dare from their boyfriends. Or like lesbian porn created by and for men, or even Blue Is The Warmest Color director Abdellatif Kechiche encouraging lengthy and later deemed unrealistic lesbian sex scenes that left the film’s stars feeling exploited. Pynk, however, is totally unconcerned with male titillation and builds on the theme from Monáe’s earlier single, bisexual anthem Make Me Feel, which essentially declares its singer’s attraction to humans, not genders. Against crisp finger snaps and skittering synth, Monáe takes her appreciation of the female form a step further by pointing out the color of a woman’s anatomy, referencing the vulva, vagina, the brain, tongue and eyelids, and she recites the ways her color of choice symbolizes sexual passion and revelry (“I wanna fall through the stars / Getting lost in the dark is my favorite part”). Think of the possibilities that Pynk provides: perhaps, thanks to Monáe, young women will have a more realistic portrait of what being queer means. On the other hand, maybe they’ll be more assertive in telling their partners what they like. Maybe they’ll feel more at ease with exploring or simply looking at themselves with a compact. Most important, though, hopefully they’ll stop seeking validation in men’s approval. Because they’ll know that they are enough. Like Madonna three decades ago, Monáe’s set a new bar for owning and extolling female sexuality. Only this time, it’s not meant to shock, objectify or ensure that the label makes its money back. It’s just for her. And you. As it should be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/17/rise-in-attacks-on-nhs-workers-blamed-on-lack-of-staff-money-and-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T23:01:21Z","webTitle":"Rise in attacks on NHS workers blamed on lack of staff and delays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/17/rise-in-attacks-on-nhs-workers-blamed-on-lack-of-staff-money-and-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/17/rise-in-attacks-on-nhs-workers-blamed-on-lack-of-staff-money-and-delays","fields":{"headline":"Rise in attacks on NHS workers blamed on lack of staff and delays","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Growing numbers of NHS personnel in England have been the victim of a violent attack at work, with understaffing and delays in patients accessing services being blamed for the rise. Figures supplied by hospital trusts have shown that they recorded 56,435 physical assaults on staff in 2016-17, up 9.7% on the 51,447 recorded the year before. The data, from 181 of the NHS’s 244 hospital trusts, was obtained by the Health Service Journal on behalf of the union Unison under the Freedom of Information Act. Nurses, paramedics and mental health staff are among those most likely to be assaulted. Acute hospital trusts have seen the biggest increase in attacks. There were 18,720 assaults on their staff during 2016-17, 21% more than the 15,469 the previous year. Unison said the jump was staggering and was linked to NHS pressures and growing waits for urgent and emergency care. The figures appear to show that trusts with the worst performance in terms of key NHS-wide treatment targets are more likely to see their personnel being attacked. Hospitals should treat and then admit, transfer or discharge 95% of A&amp;E patients within four hours, provide non-urgent care to 92% of patients within 18 weeks and meet strict financial targets. But short staffing, tight budgets and rising demand mean that many cannot meet all targets. At trusts that treated 90% or less of patients waiting for planned care, under the referral to treatment 18-week care pathway, assaults on staff went up by an average of 36.2% from a total of 5,125 in 2015-16 to 6,982 in 2016-17, far more than the general 9.7% increase. Likewise, hospitals with large deficits have also seen notable increases. At those which were more than £20m in the red, assaults rose from 4,152 in 2015-16 to 5,113 in 2016-17 – a 23.1% increase. In contrast, trusts which were in the black had a 1.5% rise. Unison said if the figures were extrapolated to include the 63 trusts that did not respond to a request for figures, the true total of assaults every year would be about 75,000, or 200 a day. “Across the entire NHS, staff shortages are harming patient care and helping to create a hostile environment where health workers are increasingly at risk of being assaulted,” said Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health. “It’s no accident that trusts where the pressures seem the most extreme – where there are huge financial deficits or where it’s a struggle to meet growing demands on services – have seen the steepest rise in the number of attacks. This desperate situation is only set to worsen as the squeeze on resources gets tighter.” Staff in mental health services are seven and a half times more likely to be assaulted. There were a total of 33,820 assaults in 2016-17 in the mental health trusts that responded – a 5% annual rise, which was smaller than the year before. “This seems to suggest the sector is having some success in preventing a difficult situation from getting any worse,” Unison said. “Violence and aggression towards ambulance staff is abhorrent and we encourage all of our member services to prosecute perpetrators to the full extent of the law. There can never be any excuse for verbally or physically abusing NHS ambulance staff, who are simply doing their job trying to care for patients in often difficult circumstances,” said Martin Flaherty, the managing director of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives. NHS England said: “It is completely unacceptable that a nurse, paramedic, porter or any member of NHS staff should be assaulted physically or verbally as they care for patients. NHS England continues to work with trusts and any of our staff affected, to help the police and other authorities do everything needed when an assault takes place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/16/the-guardian-view-on-syria-parliament-should-have-been-consulted","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T17:31:02Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Syria: parliament should have been consulted | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/the-guardian-view-on-syria-parliament-should-have-been-consulted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/the-guardian-view-on-syria-parliament-should-have-been-consulted","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on bombing Syria: a gesture not a message","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The weekend’s bombing of Syria, led by the United States with the United Kingdom and France in tow, was intended to send a message: that we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against civilians, and if diplomacy cannot prevent it then we will use force. Narrowly targeted missile strikes against chemical weapons facilities were a direct response to what was almost certainly the Assad regime’s chemical attack on the town of Douma, which left dozens dead. Parliament should have been consulted before the missiles were fired, but now that they have fallen we must hope their intended message gets through. Unfortunately, there are good reasons to doubt it will. The strikes were calibrated with competing goals in mind. They had to be tough enough to deter Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again, but not so tough that they would provoke Russia, which backs the Syrian regime, into retaliatory action that might escalate the conflict. This may prove too narrow a strategic window to be truly effective. With ample warning of a strike, the Syrian regime had plenty of time to move stockpiles and soldiers away from the target areas before the bombing started. Mr Assad maintains the capacity to use chemical weapons against his own people and the willingness to prop up his tyranny at the cost of any number of civilian lives. The weekend’s bombing was less a message than a gesture – and a gesture that fails in its effect sends the opposite message to that intended. That may have been the message received by both sides in the war: “The American strikes did not change anything for Syrians on the ground,” Osama Shoghari, an anti-government activist, said afterwards. Last year the US bombed Syria in response to a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhun. The fact that they are doing the same thing again a year later shows that the message Mr Assad received from the last, limited attack was that he would not be seriously punished if he did it again. President Macron claimed over the weekend that “we had reached a point where these strikes were necessary to give back the [international] community some credibility”. Which raises the question: with whom did we have credibility before? Mrs May’s claim that “we have not done this because President Trump asked us to do so. We have done it because we believe it was the right thing to do” is difficult to take seriously. Had Mr Trump not gone ahead, France and the UK would not have bombed Syria by themselves. This is essentially a US military operation. That leaves the UK and France pinning their hopes on the White House. We know that President Trump is impulsive, abrasive, crude and thin-skinned. The former FBI director, James Comey, has branded him “unethical, and untethered to the truth and institutional values”. We also know that Mr Trump is consumed by a variety of scandals at home that will leave him at best distracted and, at worst, seeking distraction. There are no easy options in Syria and the international community should be ashamed that our interventions, be they military or diplomatic, have failed to bring peace. Mr Trump is not the man to repair the consequences of earlier mistakes. We hope Assad, Russia and Iran take this latest attack as proof that the international community is prepared to buttress its diplomacy with force when necessary, even as we fear that they won’t. There will not be a military solution to this conflict. And while a diplomatic solution has proved elusive, it is the only one that will stop the bloodshed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/16/ireland-warns-of-perils-of-failing-to-agree-brexit-backstop-solution-on-border","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:14:55Z","webTitle":"Ireland warns of perils of failing to agree Brexit  'backstop' solution on border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/16/ireland-warns-of-perils-of-failing-to-agree-brexit-backstop-solution-on-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/16/ireland-warns-of-perils-of-failing-to-agree-brexit-backstop-solution-on-border","fields":{"headline":"Ireland warns of perils of failing to agree Brexit  'backstop' solution on border","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ireland has warned there will be no Brexit withdrawal treaty and no transition agreement unless Britain comes up with acceptable wording as a “backstop” solution to the Irish border question in the event of no deal. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, told reporters in Luxembourg that difficulties would arise as early as June if the wording was not agreed. Asked whether the transition agreement would be at risk if there was no deal in place by June, he said: “It puts everything at risk. Michel Barnier [the EU chief negotiator] has been very clear there will be no withdrawal agreement if there is not a backstop relating to the Irish border consistent with paragraph 49 of the political agreement in December. “The British government have committed to doing [backstop] that. If that is not in the withdrawal agreement, then there will be no withdrawal agreement and there will be no transitional deal either.” The vexed question of how to retain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is the subject of six weeks of side talks between officials from London and Brussels. They are three weeks in with a formal review due on Wednesday between Britain’s lead negotiator, Olly Robbins, and the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. Asked whether the UK was closer to agreeing wording that would mean full alignment in regulations north and south of the border, Coveney said: “Not at the moment”. The UK and the EU agreed three options on Northern Ireland in the joint report on Brexit signed in December. Option A was that a solution would be found in the wider deal, option B was a bespoke arrangement and option C the backstop solution of full alignment of regulations on both sides of the border in the event of talks breaking down. But when the EU translated option C into legal text, May said no prime minister could accept a draft that would involve Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market. Many believe the latest talks have kicked the can down the road, and Coveney has warned that time is running out if Britain is to agree its final Brexit deal by October. “If there is not substantial progress on the Irish border, the backstop, [which is] simply in line with what the British have committed to, then I think there will be difficulties in June,” he said in reference to the next summit of EU leaders scheduled to review Brexit talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/apr/22/sexual-addiction-desire-and-dopamine-hits","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Sexual addiction, desire and dopamine hits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/22/sexual-addiction-desire-and-dopamine-hits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/apr/22/sexual-addiction-desire-and-dopamine-hits","fields":{"headline":"Sexual addiction, desire and dopamine hits","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Of the many alleged victims of the film producer Harvey Weinstein, perhaps the most overlooked and least sympathised with are so-called sex addicts. They may not have directly suffered at his hands, but in their own way they have felt a harsh blowback from his actions. When the damning testimonies of sexual abuse began to pile up, Weinstein denied allegations of non-consensual sex but did admit to a problem and is believed to have sought sanctuary – and treatment – at the Meadows, an upmarket sex addiction rehabilitation centre in Arizona. It runs a men-only programme entitled, a little ironically in Weinstein’s case, Gentle Path, which lasts 45 days. Participants are assessed as to their position on the sex-addiction spectrum, according to a programme designed by Dr Patrick Carnes, the leading expert in the field who first popularised the term “sex addiction”. Level 1 is overuse of porn or masturbation and visiting prostitutes; Level 2 is victimisation, exhibitionism, voyeurism and harassment; Level 3 is rape, incest, child sex abuse. Carnes believes most people with addiction problems are a Level 1 or 2. The residents of the centre undergo group, individual and family therapies. In a “nurturing community”, they also engage in meditation, exercise programmes, spiritual practices and lectures. By all accounts, the food and accommodation leave little to be desired. The aim is for residents to “gain the courage to face difficult issues, including grief and loss; heal from emotional trauma; and become accountable for their own feelings, behaviours and recovery”. The actor Kevin Spacey, another accused of predatory sexual behaviour, is also said to have attended the Meadows. To many observers, Weinstein’s sex-addiction treatment appeared like the last refuge of the Hollywood scoundrel, a handy excuse when all else had failed: “It’s not my fault. It’s my damaged psyche!” Even the term sex addiction seems a little too convenient: a vice masquerading as a pathology, an excuse dressed up as an illness. It’s not a condition that is recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM], the bible of the American Psychiatric Association. There are no physical symptoms of withdrawal, as there are with, for example, alcohol and drug addiction. However, therapists in the field speak of a growing sexual addiction “pandemic” that a mixture of shame and misunderstanding has kept hidden. Paula Hall runs the Laurel Centre, a specialist organisation in Leamington Spa dedicated to sexual-addiction therapy. She believes the publicity surrounding recent high-profile scandals has been detrimental to an understanding of what she believes is a very real and growing problem. “There is a percentage of people who are sexually addicted and offend,” she tells me in her London office. “It absolutely in no way excuses the offending, and is a completely separate issue. So if Harvey Weinstein is a sex addict I hope he will get the help he needs. And if he is guilty of what he’s been accused of, I hope he gets locked up as well. They’re not mutually exclusive. Unfortunately, it has again cast doubt on the whole sex addiction label and left ordinary guys finding it harder to reach out. As one client said to me: ‘I’m worried that even being here, people will assume that I’m predatory.’” Hall insists the debate about whether or not sex addiction is a clinically accepted condition misses the point. “Look,” she says, “bereavement is not in the DSM, but no therapist says: ‘Sorry, bad luck. I can’t see you.’” The clients who come to her seeking help are, Hall says, often in a state of great distress and not infrequently suicidal. They want to stop doing what they’re doing: be it watching porn, visiting prostitutes, or using the internet to organise fleeting sexual encounters. But they can’t, in much the same way that the compulsive gambler can’t stop gambling, even though it’s destroying his life. When things were at their worst, Rob Joy would hold his head in tears of frustration and smash another mobile phone, while his wife lay asleep in blissful ignorance upstairs in bed. The 39-year-old owner of a decorating company would destroy his phones to stop himself from viewing pornography and texting, or “sexting”, women in provocative or inappropriate ways. As compulsive sexual behaviours go, Joy’s were a long way from the most extreme. On Carnes’s scale, he would classify as Level 1. But it was enough to lead to a crisis that saw him lose his job, his friends and, effectively, his home. What made the situation particularly difficult was that his job was that of an Evangelical Christian pastor in a respectable Northamptonshire market town. A short, good-looking man who buzzes with words and energy, he felt overwhelmed by the work which, aside from the financial responsibilities, included advising married couples on the issue of adultery. He and his wife had a two-year-old child and one-month-old baby, and Joy had taken to unwinding with a couple of drinks in the evening which, he admits, lowered his inhibitions. Then he would stay up looking at porn and seeking digital flirtations. “I wanted the conversation to go to the point of sexualised conversation,” he recalls at his base in Luton. “Masturbation and then finished.” That was the line beyond which he didn’t want to cross, out of respect for his wife, although on a couple of occasions he did transgress and he was mortified with shame and guilt. One day three years ago, he tried to steer a text conversation with a woman from his congregation in a similar direction, but she reported him to church leaders who conducted an investigation. They looked at Joy’s computer and found porn sites and incriminating emails. His world fell apart. Within days he was dismissed, ostracised by his community and had to move away from the village. The family spent months sleeping on his in-laws’ sitting room floor. In the aftermath, Joy felt humiliated, depressed, and full of remorse. It was at that low point that he decided to seek treatment for sex addiction. The vast majority of sex addicts who seek help are male, though many studies, including Paula Hall’s own, have shown that 30% are female. So why are they not seeking help? “There’s a lot more shame for women,” says Hall. “We accept a man being a bit of a player, a bit of a lad. But a woman’s going to get a lot more societal shunning.” One therapist in Bristol, Gary McFarlane, a member of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity, who treats people throughout the UK and around the world via video link, told me that, broadly, he found that while men were more likely to be sex addicts, women were more often love addicts. Hall, however, does not recognise the distinction. “All addictions are basically symptoms of something else,” she says. “For many people it’s a symptom of a lack of self-worth, a way of seeking validation and affection, of feeling wanted and feeling needed. That is equally true for male clients.” When she first started working in the field, most men sought treatment after being found out by a partner. The therapy was part of an ultimatum. But, increasingly, her clients are coming of their own accord because they can no longer function with their dependency – some have spent “tens and tens of thousands” on their sexual habits. There are times, however, when the dependency still wins out. “One guy stopped coming,” she says with a broad smile, “because he said he couldn’t afford both me and ‘the girls’.” In nearly all cases she sees, the entry point, the gateway drug as it were, is pornography. Like the other therapists I spoke to, Hall believes there has been a generational shift in behaviour as a result of the digital ubiquity of porn. “The problem is hidden from the person themselves. You can’t drink alcohol or take drugs for five hours and not feel it the next day, or people around you not notice. You can watch porn for eight hours every single day and no one is going to know. There are no side effects.” Yet Hall is not interested in pathologising watching pornography, or indeed any other sexual behaviour involving consenting adults. “Ultimately the type of the behaviour is not what defines an addiction, just as if you’re an alcoholic it doesn’t make any difference if you drink whisky or gin. It’s the dependency and inability to stop that defines the problem.” Owen Redahan, a sex addiction counsellor who has a practice in London’s Canary Wharf, agrees. “I get clients coming in who say they must be addicted to sex and you go through it and they aren’t.” Some people have high sex drives, which should not be confused with sex addiction. “Most of the people I work with,” says Hall, “have long ago forgotten what their sex drive is.” She compares the situation to the chronically obese person who can’t stop eating. They don’t experience hunger and in a similar way the sex addict doesn’t feel sexual desire. What they are in search of is the dopamine hit from a risky or inappropriate sexualised encounter, the self-soothing buzz that will momentarily block out the underlying feelings of self-loathing and anguish. But those feelings soon return and the sufferer seeks respite in the next sexual encounter. That is the cycle the writer Erica Garza describes in her memoir Getting Off: One Woman’s Journey Through Sex and Porn Addiction. It’s a compelling read about sexual compulsion. “I started watching mild porn,” she tells me, “but to get that feeling of shame I had to watch harder and harder porn. I had to go to extremes. I had to find something that I thought was shameful and disgusting and that leaked out into the rest of my life.” Pretty soon Garza was picking men up in bars and having unprotected sex with them, which left her with an emptiness she vainly tried to fill with more reckless sexual behaviour. What’s unusual about her case is the pattern of her recovery. As she tells it in her book, she met a man she fell in love with and sex became a medium for expressing love rather than anaesthetising pain. In her new “healthy” relationship, she avoided pornography and put a premium on monogamy, because that felt the safest way to live her life. No one can be certain, but by some assessments the relapse rate for sex addiction seems to be quite high, partly, perhaps, because of the ease and proliferation of casual or commercialised sex, and pornography. “After a while,” says Garza, the monogamy and no pornography strictures “felt inauthentic, as if I was cutting off a part of my sexuality. That didn’t feel right.” Now she and her husband have boundaries in place, though she seems to suggest that they’re quite permissive – at least by the standards of most recovering sex addicts. And this is where sex, as a form of addiction, is a problematic concept. The alcoholic, the drug addict, the compulsive gambler all know that recovery involves total and, ideally, permanent abstinence. But what of the sex addict? Celibacy is not much of an answer. So what is? “Identifying what is positive sexually to that person,” says Hall. “When, after a sexual encounter, you feel worse about yourself, that’s not a good sign. So the exercise we do is write down what is definitely OK and what is definitely not OK, and they’re allowed a temporary space, which is ‘iffy’.” “Pornography almost certainly is not OK ever [for the sex addict], but it can be OK – and this is the critical understanding of sex addiction – if it is coming from the place of libido, from sexual desire, as opposed to dopamine arousal. Masturbation is the classic one. When is it OK? When is not OK? Not in Sainsbury’s.” For Rob Joy, the road back from sex addiction has been long and difficult. Earlier in his life he underwent a dramatic change when he became a Christian. For 10 years before that, from the age of 16 to 26, he’d been a drug addict, and for most of that time a crack addict. Yet when he took to religion, he was able to stop overnight. He got married to a fellow believer, and told his story of overcoming drug addiction, criminality and gang life to rapt audiences around the country. But not even his love of God could stop his sexual compulsions. Like many addicts, Joy traces the source of his problem to childhood trauma – in his case being introduced to pornography as a four year old by older children on his estate. His father, he says, also had a lecherous attitude to sex and, in fact, died in a brothel while having sex with a prostitute. “You don’t want to become a victim,” Joy says, “but sex addicts are victims, too. You see people being named and shamed at the moment, and their behaviour is absolutely wrong and it needs correcting, or punishment, but the way we are shaming people is causing so much more damage to them, because most of them probably have similar stories to me. Their brains have been set like wet concrete at an early age.” Joy, who also describes himself as “an author and itinerant Evangelist”, undertook treatment with Gary McFarlane, and that made him come to terms with the nature of his problem. He now has a security app on his phone and his laptop that alerts his wife to any ill-advised communications. Recently, he sent a message to her that ended with a loving “XXX”, which triggered an alarm owing to its pornographic connotation. “I genuinely do not want to watch porn,” he says. “I do not want to dishonour my wife or degrade the women on the internet. I weep over it. I walk into shops with my 12-year-old son and magazines are at eye level. And I say, sorry that’s wrong. You can go two or three weeks and one day you just go, I need it. And the risks you’ll take in being caught are ridiculous.” Luckily his wife, Lydia, has been extremely supportive and understanding. “Obviously I was very hurt,” she says. “I went through different phases. At first I felt sympathy, because I saw how people were looking at him with total disgust. But there were also times when I just felt anger, mostly at the situation, but that came out as being more distant from him.” Lydia never lost her belief in his strength of character but, watching his efforts, she also regained her trust. Having gone through the experience, she has contributed to a book he has written about his addiction. “I want to help people and the partners who feel that they can’t forgive or understand it,” she says. Sex addiction may not have made it into the psychiatric manuals, but it does seem to have entered plenty of people’s lives. In many respects it’s a modern phenomenon, born of increased opportunities, the anonymous and hyper-sexualised online world, and the forlorn urge to find transient respite from the all-too-common internal voices of angst and self-doubt. Yet, like some fiendishly adapted parasite, it’s made its home in humanity’s oldest and most vital urge. And this means that, whether or not clinicians agree that it exists, it’s unlikely to go away."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/16/mps-likely-to-have-given-prior-backing-to-british-strike-on-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:00:15Z","webTitle":"MPs likely to have given backing before British strike on Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/16/mps-likely-to-have-given-prior-backing-to-british-strike-on-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/16/mps-likely-to-have-given-prior-backing-to-british-strike-on-syria","fields":{"headline":"MPs likely to have given backing before British strike on Syria","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Commons response to Theresa May’s statement on military strikes in Syria exposed a paradox: while many believed she should have sought the approval of parliament beforehand, it seemed clear this would have been granted anyway. The Labour MP Jess Phillips summed up this view two hours into the discussion, saying: “I regret that were wasn’t a parliamentary vote on this issue. But I wish to tell the prime minister and the house that she would have had my vote had I been asked to give it.” Some other Labour MPs stood up to contradict Jeremy Corbyn’s view that the UK involvement in Saturday’s military action was legally questionable and should not have happened, while also regretting May’s decision to not recall parliament. Similarly, a number of independent-minded Conservative MPs supported May’s decision to join the US and France in the strikes, with several of them lambasting Corbyn’s position. But the prime minister came under repeated pressure over the lack of advance parliamentary scrutiny of the decision. Yvette Cooper, a senior backbench Labour MP, said: “The PM and her cabinet today appear not just be arguing about the circumstances of last week, but also to be rejecting the entire principle of consulting, debating and voting in parliament in advance of military action.” Another Labour MP, Hilary Benn, asked for an assurance from May that if there was a further chemical weapons attack in Syria, “she will come to parliament first, she will share such evidence as she can with us as she has today, and that she will trust parliament to decide what is to be done”. The prime minister also came under pressure over the very limited numbers of Syrian refugees brought to the UK, particularly unaccompanied children. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, highlighted what she called “the jarring contrast between the humanitarian arguments” that May has made for the airstrikes and “her government’s inhumane and inadequate approach to Syrian refugees, which has left vulnerable children stranded and alone”. Labour’s Stella Creasy said she wanted to “beg the prime minister to rethink her approach to those Syrians who have fled to Europe”. Creasy said: “They are the same people fleeing this horror, they are the people who needed this safe haven.” A series of MPs instead took aim at Corbyn’s insistence that even military action to avert humanitarian catastrophes should only happen with the approval of the UN security council, among them the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve. Such a position would mean, Grieve argued, “that any tyrant, megalomaniac, person intent on carrying out genocide, if they have the support of an amoral state within the security council, they will be able to conduct that genocide with total impunity, even if it was within our power to act to prevent it”. He added: “Far from upholding the international rules-based system, the reality is that it would be dead.” Some backbenchers were more sceptical about May’s decision, including the Labour MP Laura Pidcock, who asked whether further UK strikes could take place, and Caroline Lucas, the Green co-leader, who said international inspectors should have been asked to examine the suspected chemical weapons sites attacked on Saturday. But a series of other Labour MPs, albeit generally ones not closely allied to Corbyn, very publicly disagreed with their leader’s stance. The Ilford South MP, Mike Gapes, pointed to intervention directed by earlier Labour governments without UN approval in Sierra Leone, Kosovo and elsewhere, saying: “There is a longstanding and noble tradition on these benches supporting humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect.” Chris Leslie called the military strike “absolutely the right thing to do”, adding: “Those who would turn a blind eye, who would do nothing, in pursuit of some moral high ground, should also be held accountable, for once, today as well.” Wes Streeting, also from Labour, noted the demonstration against the military strikes taking place outside parliament, organised by the Stop the War campaign group. “We all know that the Syrian civil war will only end through diplomatic means, which is why this evening’s Stop the War demonstration should be taking place outside the Russian embassy, and not outside this parliament,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/19/danny-fields-best-photograph-ramones-washington-supreme-court-prowl","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Danny Fields' best photograph: the Ramones prowl round the US supreme court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/19/danny-fields-best-photograph-ramones-washington-supreme-court-prowl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/19/danny-fields-best-photograph-ramones-washington-supreme-court-prowl","fields":{"headline":"Danny Fields' best photograph: the Ramones prowl round the US supreme court","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I became the Ramones’ manager after seeing them at CBGB in New York. From the opening downstroke of the guitar, I loved them. When I met them afterwards, they asked if I would write about them. I said: “More than that, I want to manage you.” I started taking photos of them when they were making their first album. If the manager has done a good job there’s nothing to do once the band gets to the studio except let her bang, so I took a camera along, thinking I could record moments that might be considered candid. They realised that even if I took pictures of them drooling, I wasn’t going to use them – as their manager, I wasn’t going to do anything to damage their career. What made them good to photograph was the same thing that made them good on stage: presentation. They were intuitive. The first time I saw them live, the presentation was perfect – the clothes, the hair, the architecture of the set. They knew how to do it and they’d figured it out themselves. They weren’t puppets. When rock’n’roll wants to come out, it comes out of every pore, and they had that. This was taken in November 1976. Jimmy Carter had been elected president, Gerald Ford had lost. The Ramones had a show at the Cellar Door club in Washington and we had a free afternoon. I said: “Let’s walk around and take some pictures.” There are good backgrounds in Washington and I shot four rolls of film. This was taken in front of the United States supreme court. There was no one there, though. This was pre-bag search. I imagine now it would be swarming with police. They went up the steps and came down towards me, as I walked backwards to get the building in. The word irony is overused, but you can’t overuse it with the Ramones because everything with them is ironic. And the irony here is these four leather-clad kids – who have come from a particular kind of rock’n’roll known as punk rock – strolling around the supreme court, which is inviolate. This is kind of a behind-the-scenes picture: what do you do on an afternoon – between waking up and doing the soundcheck – in a place you’ve never played? Hey, it’s Washington, it’s a hilarious-looking place – let’s run around! The picture on the inner sleeve of Leave Home, the band’s second album, shows them outside the White House. That was taken on the same day. When I shot them I liked to surround them with things, otherwise it’s the same four people over and over. After a while, it became about getting them in a crowd, or in front of a building. This day was grey and overcast, so there was no horrible sunshine. There are photographers who can do miracles with sunlight on a dappled field, but it’s not good for people. Danny Fields’ CV Born New York City, 1939.

Now a bike builder in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has set about rescuing the collapsible bike’s reputation by creating this full-size folder. The Montague Allston is here to prove that good looks, great performance and portability can all exist in one tidy package. Instead of dish-sized wheels, the Allston is equipped with full-sized road wheels that deliver a ride indistinguishable from other high-performance bikes. It doesn’t use a traditional derailleur and it doesn’t even have a chain, which can be noisy and oily. Instead there is a sealed internal gear hub for shifting and a carbon belt that requires no oil and will never rust, no matter how long this winter goes on. Wide tyres and hydraulic disc brakes mean it can master all that a pot-holed city street will throw at it. When folded, the bike is just 36in wide, 28in high and 12in deep. It comes with its own travel case, ideal for the car boot, train or cupboard under the stairs. This means your Allston will never be stolen from outside your flat. This might just make it the ultimate city bike… Be your own bike mechanic One of the great pleasures of being a cyclist is keeping your machine in peak working condition. Aside from cleaning and oiling, there are many servicing and maintenance jobs that you can do yourself – with the right guidance. Now Haynes has teamed up with BikeRadar, the authority on bikes and cycling gear, to create the ultimate Road Bike Manual app. Based on Haynes’s bestselling bike manual, the app provides an authoritative and trusted voice when it comes to step-by-step maintenance. From the wheels to the cockpit, drive train, frame care and brakes, the app provides essential how-to information and advice. It’s packed with handy information and pointers, plus invaluable roadside fixes and it features instructional videos that provide advice on how to fix a bike when it all goes wrong, but the tools or parts required to fix the problem properly aren’t available. When it comes to roadside fixes, the app provides tips on how to fix chains, broken handlebars and an innovative last resort inner tube fix, plus much much more. With over 30 years’ experience, Chaz Curry, who wrote the app’s content, said: “In producing this app, I was keen to convey the techniques and ‘trade craft’ that have taken me a lifteime to learn. Whilst most online content gives the user instructions on how to complete a project, they rarely highlight the finer points that allow you to complete the job efficiently and to a professional standard. By passing on this knowledge, I hope that the user will have the confidence to take on any of the tasks that I have covered in the app and come to enjoy fixing and maintaining their own bicycle themselves.” Dave Clutterbuck, BikeRadar’s publishing director, added: “There is so much information available to today’s cyclist about bike repair and maintenance, but the quality and utility of this information varies massively. This makes it difficult for people to find the right advice for them. Teaming up with Haynes – a company that shares our heritage of world-class reader advice – has allowed us to create the best tool for cyclists, whatever their level of expertise.” With new content being added every month, The Road Bike Manual App will be a continuously updated product all for one low price – meaning that never before has Haynes offered its content so inexpensively. Available now for tablets and smartphones, The Road Bike Manual App can be downloaded for just £2.99 from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

I shouldn't have trusted Mark Zuckerberg","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fourteen years, two months, and eight days ago, I made a mistake. Like a lot of mistakes made at the age of 20 inside a college dorm room, it involved trusting a man I shouldn’t have, and it still affects me to this day. No, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t give me herpes. But in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, I have been thinking back to my decision to sign up for thefacebook.com on the site’s fifth day in existence, and I am struck by the parallels between Zuckerberg’s creation and a pesky (if generally benign) virus. Facebook isn’t going to kill me, but it has wormed its way into all of my relationships, caused me to infect other people, and I will never, ever be fully rid of it. Last week, Zuckerberg was called to answer for himself. Over the course of two days of questioning before Congress, Zuckerberg sought to assure the public that we, not he, are in “complete control” of our relationships with Facebook. He repeated this guarantee dozens of times, returning again and again to the idea that users can control their Facebook data. But the Zuckerberg of 2018 sounds suspiciously like the “Mark E Zuckerberg ’06” who was interviewed by the Harvard Crimson on 9 February 2004 about his brand new website. It was this article that prompted my roommates and me to start entrusting a stranger behind a computer screen with the keys to our identities: names, birthdates, photographs, email addresses, and more. “There are pretty intensive privacy options,” he told the paper. “People have very good control over who can see their information.” “On Facebook, everything that you share there you have control over,” he told Senator Dean Heller just moments after failing to give a straight answer on whether Facebook has ever collected the contents of its users’ phone calls. “You can say I don’t want this information to be there. You have full access to understand all, every piece of information that Facebook might know about you, and you can get rid of all of it.” Zuckerberg was lying then and he’s lying now. We do not have “complete control” and we never have, as evidenced by the fact that even people who never signed up for Facebook have “shadow profiles” created without their consent. He has been getting away with this same spin for 14 years, two months, and eight days. Watching him dissemble in front of Congress, I couldn’t help but see him as one of those fresh-faced boys at Harvard who transitioned seamlessly from their New England prep schools to the Ivy League, and excelled at maintaining steady eye contact with the professor while they opined about books they hadn’t read. I can still remember our excitement and curiosity for the new website that promised to enhance and replace the physical facebooks that Harvard passed out to first-year students. Those thin, hardcover volumes were a frequent source of useful information and prurient entertainment. We used to pore over the book, trying to figure out the name of this guy from class, or that girl from Saturday night, judging the looks of other students and generally indulging in a kind of pre-cyber cyber-stalking: it was a way to learn things about other people without having to ask them directly. Zuckerberg’s website broke the facebook out of its bindings. During those first weeks and months, we bore witness to Facebook’s power to reorient social interactions. With Facebook, you were friends, or not friends; in a relationship, single, or “it’s complicated”; popularity was easily quantifiable; those who chose not to sign up for Facebook were defining themselves as abstainers, whether they wanted to or not. All of the beautiful and painful mess of human interactions was reducible to a data point in the social graph. We embraced this recalibration of social relations without thinking about who or what was behind them. Judging strangers based on their facebook photo transitioned seamlessly into judging people based on their Facebook profile and Facebook habits. It’s embarrassing to remember now my own decision, born of a hefty sense of my own too-coolness, that I would only ever respond to other people’s friend requests, and not send any myself, as if this were a meaningful form of self-definition. I’d like to think that I spared a thought for the motivations of the man behind the computer screen, but I’m sure I didn’t. Even if I had thought to assign a word, let alone a value, to the idea that I should maintain control over the pieces of information by which others would come to know and judge me – “privacy”, I think we call this – I probably would have been taken in by Zuckerberg’s assurances in that first Crimson article that his website was perfectly safe. The truth is that Facebook’s great value has come from making the rest of us lose control. Yes, we can decide what photos and status updates and biographical details we plug into Facebook’s gaping maw. But the most valuable insights have been gleaned from the things we didn’t even realize we were giving away. Facebook knows what I read on the internet, where I want to go on vacation, how late I stay up at night, whose posts I scroll quickly by, and whose posts I pause to linger over. It knows that I took reporting trips to Montana and Seattle and San Diego, despite the fact that I have never allowed it to track me by GPS. It knows my father’s cellphone number, despite the fact that he has never signed up for its service, because I was stupid enough to share my contacts with it once, several years ago. It knows all of these things that are, in my opinion, none of its goddamn business. If I’ve learned one thing from Mark Zuckerberg it’s that the most valuable knowledge about another person comes from learning things about them that they wouldn’t tell you themselves. So here’s what I know about Mark Zuckerberg. During those first few weeks of Facebook’s existence, while he was assuring his fellow college students that we could trust him with our identities, he had a private conversation on instant messenger with a friend. That conversation was subsequently leaked, and published by Silicon Valley Insider. It is as follows: ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard ZUCK: just ask ZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns FRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one? ZUCK: people just submitted it ZUCK: i don’t know why ZUCK: they “trust me” ZUCK: dumb fucks In the intervening years, I’ve learned that Zuckerberg values his own privacy so much that he has security guards watching his trash, that he bought four houses surrounding his own house to avoid having neighbors, that he sued hundreds of Hawaiians to sever their claim to tiny plots of land within his massive Kauai estate, and that he secretly built tools to prevent further private messages from coming back to haunt him. What I haven’t learned, or seen any sign of, is that he has changed his opinion of the intelligence of his users. It’s Zuckerberg’s world, and we’re all just a bunch of dumb fucks living in it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/17/the-way-some-pigs-are-reared-is-upsetting-and-wrong-say-shoppers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T23:02:21Z","webTitle":"The way some pigs are reared is 'upsetting and wrong', say shoppers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/the-way-some-pigs-are-reared-is-upsetting-and-wrong-say-shoppers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/17/the-way-some-pigs-are-reared-is-upsetting-and-wrong-say-shoppers","fields":{"headline":"The way some pigs are reared is 'upsetting and wrong', say shoppers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Shoppers around the world overwhelmingly support high animal welfare standards for pigs, and most would also be prepared to change their supermarket habits in response, an international survey on pork consumption has found. Seven out of 10 people questioned said they found the manner in which pigs are reared for slaughter on some factory farms “upsetting”, “wrong” or “shocking”, after being shown photographs of some pig-keeping conditions in the online poll. The survey highlighted practices such as sows kept in small cages, antibiotic use, as well as tail-docking, teeth-grinding and castration, sometimes without pain relief. Eight out of 10 shoppers surveyed in more than ten countries agreed that high welfare for pigs was important, and nearly nine of out of 10 in three key countries said they could be persuaded to shop at a supermarket committed to improving the lives of pigs. However, fewer than one in three shoppers in most countries polled said they actively looked for labels on pork products indicating the animals had been reared in high-welfare conditions, and the great majority of those surveyed globally cited price, quality and appearance as more important in choosing which pork products to eat. The survey was carried out on behalf of World Animal Protection, and involved interviews with nearly 10,000 consumers worldwide, including the UK, the US and China, all major consumers of pork products, by the polling company Voodoo. About 1,000 interviews were conducted in each country in the report. World Animal Protection, a campaigning organisation, called on major supermarkets to pledge higher pig welfare in sourcing their meat, and urged consumers to demand change from retailers. Steve McIvor, chief executive, said: “Supermarkets hold the power to create better lives for pigs. We are encouraging customers of leading supermarkets to let them know they expect higher welfare standards for pork products, with the guarantee that pigs are raised right.” The group wants pigs to be allowed to live in social groups in comfortable environments, with opportunities to express natural behaviour, and an end to practices such as those highlighted in the survey: sows in small cages, pigs kept in “dark, squalid warehouses and cramped, stressful conditions”, piglets having their teeth ground and tail docked without anaesthetic, and the overuse of antibiotics. Consumer concerns over poor conditions for many pigs was outlined in the UK recently in the BBC programme Countryfile, in which a farmer showed pigs being reared in cages, provoking furious responses on social media both from those shocked by what they saw and defenders of intensive farming for enabling cheaper meat. Changing buying habits among consumers may be a challenge, as most surveyed do not currently base their consumption on welfare considerations and many showed little awareness of key aspects of pig-rearing. Minimum standards such as the space in which sows are kept and basic restrictions on antibiotics are enforced in countries such as Europe but are not enough, according to campaigners, while the rearing of pigs in “mega-farms” in which they rarely have access to the outdoors is on the increase. Some supermarkets around the world have already committed to higher welfare standards. From July, for instance, the Co-op in the UK will source all of its own-brand fresh pork, bacon, sausage, gammon and ham from outdoor-bred pigs on RSPCA-assured farms. Jo Whitfield, the retail chief executive of Co-op, said: “The highest animal welfare standards should not just be the preserve of top-tier products and we want to ensure that the very best-quality British pork is available at everyday affordable prices.” On outdoor-bred farms, piglets and their mothers have access to the outdoors for about four to six weeks from birth. After that, they can be reared indoors. In outdoor-reared systems, the pigs have access to fields for about half their lives.

In its report, the House of Lords committee on political polling and digital media also noted that the use of social media to adversely influence the political debate was “deeply concerning”. There has been a “widespread loss of confidence in polling” since 2015, when the pollsters failed to predict a Conservative win, the report says. There are also “concerns about the extent to which inaccurate polls might be shaping the ‘narrative’ during election campaigns, and therefore how they might be affecting the democratic process”. As a result, the Lords recommend expanding the role of the British Polling Council, the self-regulatory body of the public polling industry, to go beyond simply ensuring transparency in how pollsters operate. In the future, the report says, the BPC should “work with the Electoral Commission, the Market Research Society and media regulators such as Ipso and Impress to ensure that the best methodologies are used, that sources of poll funding are declared, that polls are better reported and that polling performance is openly reviewed after each general election”. Lord Lipsey, the chairman of the committee, said: “The polling industry needs to get its house in order. Otherwise the case for banning polling in the run-up to elections – one we for now reject – will become stronger. “We heard compelling evidence that polls influence the narrative around elections and thus go to the root of our democratic debate. This makes it vital they are conducted properly and held to the highest standards of accuracy.” The committee also examined the role of social media during elections. It backed calls to require disclosure on online campaign material, requiring an imprint – similar to printed pamphlets – stating who has published it. “This will be crucial in helping to ensure that public confidence is maintained in the electoral system,” the report says. It notes, however, “that this will do little to address the challenges posed by international actors who try to operate below the radar”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/17/contaminated-blood-scandal-haemophiliacs-hiv-hepatitis-c","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Britain’s use of contaminated blood was no ‘tragedy’ – it was a scandal | Simon Hattenstone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/contaminated-blood-scandal-haemophiliacs-hiv-hepatitis-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/17/contaminated-blood-scandal-haemophiliacs-hiv-hepatitis-c","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s use of contaminated blood was no ‘tragedy’ – it was a scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In two weeks’ time Sir Brian Langstaff will take up his post as chair of the public inquiry into contaminated blood and contaminated blood products. Today, World Haemophilia Day, is the perfect occasion to remind Langstaff what the thousands of haemophiliac victims need from this inquiry if they are to get justice. In the 1970s and 1980s more than 4,600 haemophiliacs contracted HIV or hepatitis C after being infected by contaminated blood-clotting products. Much of the blood had been imported on the cheap from US prisons, and taken from high-risk donors (sex workers, drug addicts and alcoholics) who were paid for their blood. As early as 1975, the TV programme World in Action exposed the fact that the NHS was buying this blood and that it had led to a hepatitis epidemic among haemophiliacs. This was before HIV and Aids had been diagnosed. That year, David Owen, the then Labour health secretary, promised Britain would become self-sufficient in blood products to ensure vulnerable patients were put at minimal risk. But this never happened. By the mid-80s, the government was still buying the deadly blood from Arkansas prisons, despite the fact that the US Food and Drug Administration had banned its sale in America in 1983. In 1983 Dr NS Galbraith, founding director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in England and Wales, wrote to the Department of Health and Social Security, saying: “All blood products made from blood donated in the US after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of Aids transmission by these products has been clarified.” But they were not withdrawn. The Department of Health considered his advice “premature”. Six months later, the then minister of state for health, Kenneth Clarke, told the House of Commons: “There is no conclusive evidence that Aids is transmitted by blood products.” The government prefers to refer it as the contaminated blood “tragedy”, but make no mistake: this is a scandal. (In a further diminution, the inquiry is now into “infected” rather than “contaminated” blood, as it was initially). Tragedy, as victims and loved ones point out, suggests there is no one to blame. This could not be further from the truth. Last year, the former health secretary Andy Burnham said, in his final speech in the Commons, that the use of contaminated blood was a “criminal cover-up on an industrial scale” and threatened to pass his evidence to the police if the government did not act. Three months later, in July 2017, a public inquiry was announced. This is the third inquiry into contaminated blood in Britain, but the other two have been dismissed by campaign groups as a whitewash. So what do victims want from the public inquiry (the terms of reference for which have yet to be defined)? First, it must discover exactly how this happened and why it was covered up for so long. Those affected need legal aid to ensure they can fully participate in the inquiry, and there must be compensation without further delay for lost incomes and lost lives. By the early 1980s, government experts knew that those receiving Factor VIII (and less commonly Factor IX) blood-clotting products were at risk of HIV infection. Medical experts recommended that the products underwent heat treatment to kill infection-causing viruses, but implementation was delayed because of the expense. Even after it had been introduced, unheated Factor VIII product was given to patients in A&amp;E departments of hospitals. Campaign groups such as Tainted Blood believe haemophiliacs were used as human guinea pigs in contravention of the Nuremberg Code created at the end of the second world war, which states that “nobody will be experimented on medically without their consent”. Initially the heated blood products were tested on chimpanzees, but this proved too expensive. As early as January 1982 haemophilia expert Prof Arthur Bloom wrote to the country’s haemophilia centres telling them new preparations of Factor VIII were going to be processed through heat treatment, saying it was vital to discover how much infectivity had been reduced with the new heat-treated products: “The most clearcut way of doing this is by administering those concentrates to patients requiring treatment who have not been previously exposed to large pool concentrates.” These patients were known as pups – previously untreated patients. None of them knew they were pups. Colin Smith, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C, died at the age of seven weighing 13 pounds. After his death, his parents, Jan and Colin Sr, discovered in his notes that he was one of Bloom’s pups. “All these materials carry the risk of hepatitis … but this is something haemophiliacs have to accept,” Bloom wrote. Yet the Smiths were never told of this risk. Factor VIII concentrate was only supposed to be given for life-threatening bleeds. After his death, Colin’s parents discovered he had been treated with Factor VIII after hitting his head “without any evidence of intracranial bleeding” and for a swollen finger. His parents not only had to suffer the heartbreak of their son’s painful death, but also the humiliation of being ostracised by their community – Aids was painted on the side of their house in six-foot letters. They ended up moving home. Before the Factor VIII product was introduced, haemophiliacs had been treated with a product called cryoprecipitate. It was cumbersome and involved visits to the hospital, but it was safe and effective. The minutes from the 1983 annual meeting of the UK Haemophilia Centres Directors state that Dr Margaret Chisholm raised the issue of “patients refusing to take up commercial Factor VIII because of the Aids scare” and asked “whether the directors could revert to using cryoprecipitate for home therapy”. According to the minutes Bloom, by then chair of the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors’ Organisation, responded that “there was no need for this switch to occur on the basis that there was no proof that commercial concentrates were the cause of Aids”. If he had listened to Chisholm many lives could have been saved. In one special school, Treloar College, 89 children were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C from 1975 onwards. Only 16 are alive today. There are other issues for the inquiry to consider – not least the attitude of some medical experts, civil servants and politicians who appeared to regard haemophiliacs as little more than a financial burden. In one memo from 1985 a government official wrote “those who are already doomed will generate savings which more than cover the cost of testing blood donations”. The contaminated blood scandal was not confined to Britain. In France the former health secretary was found guilty of manslaughter but not jailed. In Japan senior health officials were jailed for negligence. Jan and Colin Smith believe their son was killed by the state, and they want the public inquiry to tell them how. But for them that is just the start. They will not be satisfied until those responsible face criminal charges. • Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/16/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paul-pogba-bournemouth-fa-cup-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T21:30:19Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho says Manchester United semi-final places are up for grabs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/16/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paul-pogba-bournemouth-fa-cup-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/16/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paul-pogba-bournemouth-fa-cup-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho says Manchester United semi-final places are up for grabs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho has appeared to question the ambition of some Manchester United players after the defeat by West Bromwich Albion that left Manchester City Premier League champions. The team who lost 1-0 at Old Trafford were all internationals and the manager offered an enlightening response on Monday when asked whether he was getting enough from experienced players. “Consistency has nothing to do with age,” he said. “It has to do with personality, has to do with the way you live for football, what is your priority in your life, what are your ambitions. This has nothing to do with age. “I have met players of 30 years old who were not consistent at all and I found boys of 18, 19, 20 who were real men, real pros. It is not about the age.” Mourinho will make changes for the match at Bournemouth on Wednesday with a view to giving players the chance to make the side for the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Saturday. “Rotating is not the right word,” the manager said. “If I play a player against Bournemouth and the player is phenomenal, he plays in the semi‑final. So it is not rotating, because rotating [sounds] like a player that plays against Bournemouth is to give a rest to somebody that is going to play in the semi‑final. It is an opportunity for some people to play and try to get a place for Spurs. “Some of the guys that played [against West Brom] don’t have a place in that team [for Bournemouth]. What is the criteria for a manager to choose a team? I only know one criteria: the way they play. Or do you want me to go for the price they cost, or their salary, or their beautiful face?” Mourinho refused to single out Paul Pogba, indicating the midfielder was replaced after 58 minutes against West Brom because of a booking. “It was not just him [who was poor],” he said. “And he had a yellow card so he was in a more difficult position than others. “With only two midfield players, you cannot play with one at risk of not being able to make a foul. You can do it if your team is not losing the ball, but our team was losing the ball so everything was complicated. We were losing lots of balls, so by losing lots of balls, with turns and flicks and tricks, the midfield players and central defenders are at risk of one touch, one late challenge and they are out. “So Paul [had to be careful] because of the yellow card. In terms of the way he played he was not worse than some of the others who were on the pitch for 90 minutes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/17/karl-lokko-gang-leader-shot-cut-face-stabbed-chest-south-london","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"‘By the age of 16, I had been shot at, cut in the face and stabbed in the chest’ | Karl Lokko","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/17/karl-lokko-gang-leader-shot-cut-face-stabbed-chest-south-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/17/karl-lokko-gang-leader-shot-cut-face-stabbed-chest-south-london","fields":{"headline":"‘By the age of 16, I had been shot at, cut in the face and stabbed in the chest’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Until I was about 12 years old my only offence was playing ball games where it said “No ball games allowed”. But that all changed after the first time I witnessed someone being shot on the Myatts Field estate in Brixton, south London where I lived with my family. After firing his gun, the shooter ran towards me and my friends, took off his jumper, put it by one of our makeshift goalposts and told us to keep playing. Processing these sort of events at such a young age was traumatic. Four years on, I was heavily involved in gangs. By the age of 16 I had been shot at, cut on the face and stabbed in the chest, and one of my best friends had been killed, just a couple days before our GCSE exams. I had strayed completely off the path my parents had intended for me. Criminal activity was an everyday thing: I would be armed on my way to the local chicken shop with friends. The radical change in my personal identity was alarming even to me. I would sometimes reflect on how far removed I had become from my previous morals. I was extremely fortunate that Pastor Mimi Asher’s son was a close friend of mine; we were part of the same gang. She was desperate for her son to escape the clutches of the gangs. To do so she realised in order for her efforts to be effective she would have to reach his friends too. She opened her home, allowing it to become a sort of informal therapeutic community rehabilitation hub. During this time I was shot at outside her house and the bullet went through her front door. Yet she continued her offensive against what she called our true enemy, the ideology of “gangsterism”. Her counselling and Bible-based intervention work led me to denounce my gang involvement and turn my life around. Through her holistic approach and spiritual teachings I was able to claim back my true identity and strive towards excellence. A little more than a decade later, I volunteer at the youth charity, Youth in Action, which runs alongside Pastor Mimi’s church. I offer young people the mentoring and support that she once offered me. But gang culture isn’t confined to a few bad estates any more. It’s epidemic in and around London, weighing heaviest on those living on council estates. The government has acknowledged that we have a problem. But it needs to mature in its response to surges in youth violence. The textbook approach of increased stop and search and harsher penalties will only address the symptoms of knife crime; it will not solve it. The reduction in youth services budgets by £22m across the capital since 2011 has most definitely been a huge blow to efforts to tackle the problem. Gang culture is a byproduct of the fractures in society; it’s not created by Instagram uploads and UK grime rappers. More support needs to be given to interventions that have had some success, helping them to have an even greater impact. If Youth in Action had a permanent base that was fit for purpose, its the robust rehabilitation work I received in Pastor Mimi’s council estate house some years ago could be extended to more young men and women in the community. The mentors have the understanding and insights to make a real impact, but we are caught in a frustrating limbo of being acknowledged as a key player yet not being given a space that will allow us to do what we do best. There are many derelict buildings in the area, but the council tends to sell them to private developers to build residences that most of the community can’t afford to live in. We are told that the planning permission we need to save lives may not be possible. We could potentially help thousands rather than a couple of hundred young people a week. I am proof that, with the right support, lives can be turned around. We should understand that if anyone is exposed to constant threats and traumas there is the potential for them to go in the wrong direction. Fear is what fuels such lifestyles; feeling displaced and hopeless causes young men and women to squander their potential on street ambitions. Let’s help them help themselves rather than brand them feral and unreachable. The hard to reach are still within our reach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/16/us-and-uk-blame-russia-for-malicious-cyber-offensive","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:23:04Z","webTitle":"US and UK blame Russia for 'malicious' cyber-offensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/16/us-and-uk-blame-russia-for-malicious-cyber-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/16/us-and-uk-blame-russia-for-malicious-cyber-offensive","fields":{"headline":"US and UK blame Russia for 'malicious' cyber-offensive","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The cyberwar between the west and Russia has escalated after the UK and the US issued a joint alert accusing Moscow of mounting a “malicious” internet offensive that appeared to be aimed at espionage, stealing intellectual property and laying the foundation for an attack on infrastructure. Senior security officials in the US and UK held a rare joint conference call to directly blame the Kremlin for targeting government institutions, private sector organisations and infrastructure, and internet providers supporting these sectors. Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator, set out a range of actions the US could take such as fresh sanctions and indictments as well as retaliating with its own cyber-offensive capabilities. “We are pushing back and we are pushing back hard,” he said. Joyce stressed the offensive could not be linked to Friday’s raid on Syria. It was not retaliation for the US, UK and French attack as the US and UK had been investigating the cyber-offensive for months. Nor, he said, should the decision to make public the cyber-attack be seen as a response to events in Syria. Joyce was joined in the call by representatives from the FBI, the US Department of Homeland Security and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of the surveillance agency GCHQ. The US and UK, in a joint statement, said the cyber-attack was aimed not just at the UK and US but globally. “Specifically, these cyber-exploits were directed at network infrastructure devices worldwide such as routers, switches, firewalls, network intrusion detection system,” it said. “Russian state-sponsored actors are using compromised routers to conduct spoofing ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks to support espionage, extract intellectual property, maintain persistent access to victim networks and potentially lay a foundation for future offensive operations. “The current state of US and UK network devices, coupled with a Russian government campaign to exploit these devices, threatens our respective safety, security, and economic wellbeing.” The US has given the cyber activity alleged to be from Russia the name GRiZZLY STEP. The US and UK have previously blamed Russia for cyber-attacks such as crippling attacks last year that created disruption worldwide, including to the National Health Service, and for a cyber-intrusion into the US energy grid. But they portrayed this as far more serious because of the potential to undermine infrastructure. Millions of machines had been targeted in a “sustained” campaign and the US and UK admitted they still did not know the full extent to which the system had been compromised. Previously the two nations have spoken only of attacks “originating from Russia”, with lines between Russian criminals and state activity being blurred, but they pinned blame on the Kremlin on this occasion. The US and UK said they had “high confidence” that the Kremlin was behind the attack. It is the first time they have issued joint advice to all sectors that might have been compromised, offering steps to to identify and neutralise potential problems relating to the attacks. Ciaran Martin, the chief executive of the NCSC, which works closely with the surveillance agency GCHQ, said: “This is a very significant moment as we hold Russia to account.” Howard Marshall, who works in the FBI’s cyber-division and who was on the conference call, said: “We will bring every tool to bear against them in every corner of cyberspace.” The decision of the US and UK governments to go public reflects a loss of patience with Moscow after a series of cyber-attacks and hacks allegedly originating from within Russia. It could also be born out of frustration over Russia’s supposed interference in democratic elections in the US and Europe, its support for Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and incidents such as the use of a nerve agent in Salisbury. Both the US and UK, like Russia, have cyber-offensive capabilities. The head of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, in his first public speech last week, described how such a capability was used to degrade Islamic State’s ability to disseminate propaganda from its Syrian headquarters in Raqqa. It was the first time that UK has admitted to having used its cyber-offensive capability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/lucy-cooke-i-loved-to-drink-smoke-and-have-a-good-time-getting-cancer-at-45-marked-an-end-to-that","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Lucy Cooke: ‘I loved to drink, smoke and have a good time.

Animals are in my blood – my father was a keen amateur naturalist and so was his father. If I feel stressed and go for a walk in the woods or by the sea and immerse myself in nature it has the ability to really calm me down. I found out I had cancer while shooting a nature series around England. I was essentially an animal midwife, watching animals give birth on camera – it was life happening before my eyes. It was a really positive thing to be working on alongside something that was a stark reminder of my own mortality. My doctor told me that for some women having breast cancer could be a positive experience in some ways. I remember looking at him and thinking: ‘How on earth could that be true?’ But I came to understand that he was right: it forces a shift in your behaviour. In my 20s and 30s, I loved to party. I loved to drink, smoke and have a good time. Getting cancer at 45 marked an end to that. Three years later I run every day, I meditate and I do yoga. I’m a lot healthier than I was in my later 30s. I spent most of my time worrying. When I became ill, it became clear you don’t have to. I could see these two paths and I was determined to be as positive as I could and, to be honest, it wasn’t as hard as that sounds. Being around animals a lot of the time definitely releases oxytocin and relaxes you. Gardening has also helped me. It’s the connection with nature that I find meditative – tending and looking after my vegetables. I’ve just bought a cottage in Hastings.

First Nations facing down a pipeline","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last Saturday, Indigenous leaders stood arm-in-arm in front of the gates of Kinder Morgan’s pipeline worksite in Burnaby, British Columbia. For weeks before, hundreds of non-native people – environmentalists, federal parliamentarians Elizabeth May and Kennedy Stewart, even an engineer formerly employed by the Texas oil corporation – had marched to the same place. In each case, police approached, read aloud their violation of a no-go zone, and arrested and shackled them. Now it was the turn of half of the leadership of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, including Grand Chief Stewart Phillip. They waited in the rain for hours. But the police never came. It wasn’t an accident. As the push for this pipeline has transfixed the country, there’s one image the oil industry and Canadian government desperately want to avoid: that of Indigenous peoples as the unifying front of a rising movement for an alternative. The media has thus far done them the favour. We’ve heard little about the Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish, the coastal First Nations who’ve taken the federal government to court. We’ve heard even less about the Secwepemc in the interior of BC – whose lands cover almost half of Kinder Morgan’s route – who are building solar-panelled tiny houses directly in the pipeline’s path. And we’ve heard nothing about the Lubicon, Athabasca Chipewyan and Beaver Lake Cree downstream of the Alberta mines, who first raised the cry of concern about Canada’s future with the tar sands. They understand what the Alberta and Canadian governments seem to not. To prevent climate breakdown, we must stop oil companies from digging up new deposits of fossil fuels. Government boosters of each pipeline project have instead sent a very clear message: to hell with our climate commitments. So Indigenous peoples have done what our governments will not: they’ve drawn a line. At a meeting in Alberta ten years ago, long before the world knew of the tar sands, a young Indigenous activist named Clayton Thomas-Mueller pointed at a map of proposed pipelines, sprawling like tentacles across North America. “This map traces where our allies will emerge,” he predicted. And so we’ve seen new, diverse coalitions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people spring forth in the pathway of the Northern Gateway, Keystone XL, and Energy East pipelines. Each has been stalled or halted. Kinder Morgan’s TransMountain expansion – tripling its carrying capacity – is the latest. The thousands who’ve flocked to Burnaby mountain the last weeks now know that real climate leaders aren’t found in legislatures. They’re found mounting blockades on the ground. The rule of law, you say? By pushing through the pipeline, Justin Trudeau bulldozes it himself. He violates Indigenous land rights on unceded lands that have been recognized by the Supreme Court, and the right to “free, prior informed consent” in the United Nations declaration. He violates the Paris Climate Accords, whose ambitious target his government was praised for helping establish. And he violates an electoral mandate granted by a majority of British Columbians. In other words, the Indigenous-led opposition to pipelines aren’t “rogue criminals” or a “noisy minority.” They’re enforcing the democratic will of a province – and the sacred legal duties of the country. So don’t let pundits and politicians pretend this crisis is about BC Premier John Horgan defying federal jurisdiction. Governments aren’t provoking a new constitutional impasse. They’re prolonging an old colonial pillage. Much of the remaining pools of global carbon – and the infrastructure to ship it out – are located on Indigenous peoples’ territories. Which makes the attempt to trample through their lands by a foreign oil company – a spawn of Enron – part of a long, familiar story. Yet Justin Trudeau doesn’t call this what it is. He calls it the “national interest.” But wrapping a crime in the flag of national interest can only shroud the truth for so long. The wall of Indigenous-led protest points the way to a new story: a transition off fossil fuels to a thriving low-carbon economy. The world is already turning on the tar sands. Its shadow may tower over Canadian politics, but its contribution is diminishing and small: just 2 percent of our economy. The good news is that we can create far more jobs through investment in a clean energy transition than in oil and gas – as many as 34 times more. Such as in public transit, housing retrofits and health or care-giving work. Or by funding Indigenous-owned renewable projects that communities are already getting off the ground. So why are Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley spending our taxes bailing out a Texas oil billionaire? They should be bailing out Canada’s workers, First Nations and the climate. To say that Indigenous peoples have become the heroes in this fight isn’t high-minded romanticism. It’s hard-bitten reality. Those First Nations who’ve signed deals with Kinder Morgan struggle with crushing poverty – they are stuck between a pipeline and a hard place. And as Indigenous rights have become more formidable, the financials buy-offs – as much as $1bn per fossil fuel project – have only grown larger. This suggests one thing about the resistance of other First Nations: that it is even more remarkable. “We need the money [the project would bring], but we don’t need it enough to sell out the things we love and are spiritually connected to – and that’s our land, our water, our people,” Rueben George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation said on Friday. The Tsleil-Waututh, and their many growing supporters, will be on watch when Kinder Morgan takes its likely next step: drilling a hole through Burnaby mountain. Polls show that 10 percent of British Columbians – an astonishing half-a-million people – are already prepared to engage in civil disobedience to stop it. They understand what government and industry hoped they would not: that Indigenous rights aren’t just a tool to forge a safe, liveable future – they’re the most powerful one we have. It means the best representative of our national interest isn’t Justin Trudeau or Rachel Notley, nor even John Horgan. It’s the Indigenous peoples standing in the path of a pipeline.

We paid £3,000 last term for services that were not provided. I wrote to the master of the university, David Latchman, about this and received no reply. I then wrote to the registrar and got this back: “Your tuition fees contribute towards your entire learning experience and are not directly linked to specific contact or teaching hours. Your tuition fees also cover infrastructure such as buildings, library and IT.” How can it possibly be stated that my entire learning experience is not diminished by a lack of lectures? The university have taken my money and banked what they have not paid the lecturers, it seems. We have been told that the strike may affect lectures for the first two weeks of next term and could be ongoing. I have just been asked to pay my fees for the summer term. I don’t intend to throw more money at the university unless I get a promise of compensation if the strike is ongoing. I wonder if I’ll be thrown off the course? Katrina Allen London • As a student of English at the University of Southampton, I have been affected by the recent decision by the UCU that called for all of my lecturers to strike with the aim of retaining a favourable pension deal. At the end of my four-year course, I will have racked up debts in excess of £54,000, a sum that will increase at a rate of interest of approximately 6% (why didn’t I ask the banks for a loan instead?). I understand that lecturers are feeling frustrated about their pension cut, especially when the pay of the vice-chancellor of my university is £433,000. This is a perfectly legitimate concern. But without trying to mount a pedestal of moral authority, I would not be going on strike were I a lecturer. The work that goes into the six hours of lectures and seminars that I am entitled to each week is admirable. Oh, and the one hour per week during which I am able to arrange a 10-minute meeting with my tutor to discuss my progress. If this was back in the days of free tuition, I might even have joined the staff on the picket lines. But unfortunately, I wasn’t born in the same decade as my baby-boomer parents, and I am paying £9,250 per annum for tuition alone. I hope that the lecturers don’t win this battle. If vice-chancellors were to now bend and snap against their principles (however much I might disagree with whatever they are), it would set a dangerous precedent that students are legitimate pawns to take advantage of in industrial disputes. And we are not. Ben Dolbear Southampton • I am about to sit my GCSEs. I am surrounded by many bright young women every day, some who excel in examinations and others who do not. However, one thing we all have in common is our strong feelings towards standardised testing. Every year thousands of 15/16-year-olds are forced to sit GCSEs. What education ministers do not realise is the harm this pressure causes young people. It leads to high stress levels, a loss of interest in education and, in many cases, mental health problems: approximately one in 10 children have them. I have seen the harmful effects of this robotic exam system which leaves no room for creativity. We need students to feel that there is more to life than exam grades. This can be achieved by encouraging universities to look at the whole person rather than just grades, and to value experiences and extracurriculars, like the US education system. The most successful people did not get straight A*s. The exams should also lend themselves to all kinds of students, not simply those with the ability to memorise, testing true intelligence rather than artificial intelligence. We are growing up in an age of robots; surely we should be raising humans who can do what robots cannot do: be creative. The government should scrap GCSEs and focus on A-levels – maybe if the school system did not burn so many people out, then people would stay on. At least ministers should realise that, as Einstein (the cleverest of them all) said: “Everyone is a genius.

The tweets were a reaction to unfavourable excerpts released in advance of Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty, in which Comey likens the president to a mob boss and dismisses “the forest fire that is the Trump presidency”. After Trump’s tweets, Merriam-Webster dictionary reported a 60,000% spike in searches for the definition of “slimeball”, which it defines as “a morally repulsive or odious person”. Just like the mob, Trump likes to dole out nicknames, especially to his opponents. It’s a trick he may have learned from professional wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment, which inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 2013. Its wrestlers go by names such as “Stone Cold Steve Austin” or “The Undertaker” – distinguishing for its predominantly young audience the heroes from the villains. So who else has Trump rebranded? ‘Crooked Hillary’ Throughout the 2016 election campaign Trump would often refer to Hillary Clinton as “Crooked Hillary”, usually in reference to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state in the Obama White House. ‘Little Marco’ Marco Rubio earned his moniker after poking fun at Trump’s “small hands” during the 2016 Republican presidential campaign. ‘Crazy Bernie’ Bernie Sanders joined the list of nicknames when Trump rounded on the senator during the Democrats’ presidential race. Sanders was doing well against Clinton at the time, when Trump tweeted : “I don’t want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!” ‘Sloppy Steve’ After Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was published, Trump slammed the former White House strategist Steve Bannon in another early-morning rant on Twitter – and “Sloppy Steve” was born. ‘Rocket man’ Trump nicknamed North Korea leader Kim Jong-un a “maniac” and a “whack job” before settling on “rocket man” at the 2017 United Nations General Assembly. Al ‘Frankenstien’ After Senator Al Franken was accused of sexually harassing Los Angeles radio host Leeann Tweeden in 2006, Trump – who doesn’t seem terribly concerned about appearing hypocritical – lambasted the senator and compared him to Frankenstein, only he spelled it wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/16/daniel-ricciardo-sets-pulses-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T16:41:41Z","webTitle":"Daniel Ricciardo sets F1 pulses racing with masterclass in Chinese GP | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/daniel-ricciardo-sets-pulses-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/16/daniel-ricciardo-sets-pulses-racing","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Ricciardo sets F1 pulses racing with masterclass in Chinese GP","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The depth of Ricciardo’s riches Daniel Ricciardo’s skill at overtaking was never in doubt but his remarkable performance in China was confirmation of just how far he is willing to go. “I know what I can do in the car,” he said before the Australian Grand Prix. “Even if there is a 10% possibility then I am going to do it.” He made good on this promise with aplomb in Shanghai. His pass on Lewis Hamilton was a perfect combination of timing and late-braking but the move on Valtteri Bottas was something else. Ricciardo knew the win was within his grasp but where other drivers may have been more circumspect the Australian wanted to use his tyre advantage while he had it. He committed into turn four up the inside, a racer’s manoeuvre if ever there was one. Bottas was skilful and professional in giving him room but, as he had said, Ricciardo knew exactly what he could do in the car. Verstappen has lessons to learn Red Bull still have great faith in Max Verstappen and his raw talent is obvious but three races into the season Ricciardo’s team-mate could learn from the Australian. Verstappen spun in Melbourne, crashed in qualifying in Bahrain and then had to retire after an overambitious move on Hamilton. His clash with Sebastian Vettel, which cost the German places in Shanghai, was worse by far. Vettel saw him coming, knew the place was gone and gave him space but the 20-year-old was still too hot, locked-up heavily and caught Vettel. The contrast with Ricciardo on Hamilton could not be greater. The team principal, Christian Horner, said he was “fully confident” Verstappen would learn from the mistake. But it is perhaps Red Bull’s head of motorsport, Helmut Marko, he should really heed. “He just shouldn’t overdo it. He knows what he lost,” Marko said. “There was a victory for him on the table but he gave it away.” Raikkonen feels the pain A difficult weekend for Ferrari but perhaps harder for Kimi Raikkonen to take. The Finn did secure third place but of concern was the indication that Ferrari were willing to sacrifice him to help Vettel’s championship fight. After Vettel had been jumped in the pitstops by Bottas they left Raikkonen out on worn tyres, lapping ever slower in what appeared to be a move to block Bottas when he caught him. It failed as Bottas swiftly dispatched him but without the intervention of the safety car it would have dropped Raikkonen down at least to sixth. It may be the case Ferrari had opted to keep him out as the best chance of a win, gambling on a safety car stop to favour Raikkonen but backing Vettel as they did last season seems the more likely rationale. Raikkonen perhaps knows it, describing it as: “A painful race and not a very enjoyable one.” Williams have their work cut out A terrible start to the season only faintly improved in China with Williams’ Lance Stroll finishing 14th and Sergey Sirotkin 15th. The scale of the problems facing the team was illustrated when Paddy Lowe, the chief technical officer, welcomed it as a positive result. “Compared to where we were in Bahrain it’s fantastic,” he said. In Bahrain they qualified 18th and 20th. The team have not completed the opening three races without scoring a point since 2009 – when they finished ninth in the championship. They are 10th but at least Lowe was impressively honest in China. “We cannot allow anything to detract from the fact we were not able to build a good enough car,” he said, but was optimistic more was to come. “I can’t give a time frame but we are going to make significant progress in this first half of the season.” Tyre changes are having an impact Bringing a wider and softer range of tyres to increase strategy options this season was one of the targets given to Pirelli. They delivered the softer rubber and there are early indications that it will lead to a greater variation in racing. In Bahrain eight strategies were used by the drivers who finished in the top 10. In China they took the more interesting step of bringing the soft and ultrasoft tyres, dropping the supersoft, making the performance differential even greater. Red Bull needed to use the ultrasoft in qualifying and it committed them to the two-stop race that ultimately worked out so strongly in their favour, as it did for Renault who scored a sixth place. Pirelli are not there yet, before the safety car the four leaders were all still on a one stop but the rubber the tyre manufacturer has provided is at least offering more variables across the grid this season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/16/trump-comey-book-attack-interview-abc-fbi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T15:04:29Z","webTitle":"Trump lashes out at Comey after explosive interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/trump-comey-book-attack-interview-abc-fbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/trump-comey-book-attack-interview-abc-fbi","fields":{"headline":"Trump lashes out at Comey after explosive interview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump lashed out at James Comey on Monday again following an explosive TV interview in which the former FBI director labeled the president “morally unfit” for office. “Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!” Trump’s tweet came the morning after Comey gave his first televised interview since he was unceremoniously fired last May while overseeing the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the US election. In a lengthy sit-down with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos to discuss his new book, A Higher Loyalty, Comey offered his sharpest rebuke yet of Trump’s presidency and labeled his former boss a “stain” on those who worked for him. “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds,” Comey said. He later added that Trump may have committed obstruction of justice by repeatedly pressing him to drop his inquiry into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “There’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice,” Comey said, adding that if Trump were to fire the special counsel Robert Mueller it would “set off alarm bells that this is his most serious attack yet on the rule of law”. Trump was probably referring in his tweet to Comey’s decision in July 2016 to clear Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing in her use of a private email server as secretary of state. On Sunday, Trump similarly suggested Comey’s handling of the Clinton case seemed to be based on the assumption she would win. He also appeared to cite Comey’s testimony before Congress last year, in which he told Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, that he had never been an anonymous source to the press nor had he authorized someone else to do the same. On Monday, it emerged that Trump saw portions of Comey’s interview. But he did not watch the entire program, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Sanders said Comey was “a self-admitted leaker”. “I think that his credibility is really at hand, and it’s quite interesting that he would question someone else’s when he has such a lack of credibility himself,” Sanders said. Trump has also repeatedly zeroed in on the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe’s admission that he authorized an agent to speak anonymously to the press. McCabe was fired last month, two days before he was due to retire. Comey was fired by Trump in May last year because of his investigation into “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia”. There is no evidence Comey or McCabe committed any crimes. The Trump administration, with the support of the Republican National Committee, has mounted a campaign to discredit Comey amid the release of his book. On Monday, as Trump prepared to head off to Florida for a week, his senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, sought to undermine Comey’s credibility by questioning his controversial decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private emails server 11 days before the November 2016 presidential election. “This guy swung an election,” Conway said on ABC’s Good Morning America, seeming to suggest that Comey had contributed to Trump’s victory – a theory unlikely to find favor with the president. “He thought the wrong person would win.” She quickly rowed back on that in a tweet, writing: “He did not. He swung and miss [sic]. I was putting to bed that he was even capable of such a thing. Add sarcasm and stir.” In his interview, Comey defended the 28 October letter announcing the reopening of the investigation, which Clinton has said lost her the election to Trump. “If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we’re done,” Comey said of his thinking at the time, referring to what he believed was the FBI’s responsibility to act as an independent law enforcement agency. “We’re no longer that group in America that is apart from the partisans, and that can be trusted. We’re just another player in the tribal battle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/05/best-body-washes-sensitive-skin-beauty-sali-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"The best body washes for sensitive skin | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/05/best-body-washes-sensitive-skin-beauty-sali-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/05/best-body-washes-sensitive-skin-beauty-sali-hughes","fields":{"headline":"The best body washes for sensitive skin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s surprising how many people think they’re sensitive to water. They describe extreme post-shower redness, blotchiness, soreness and/or itching – a highly inconvenient reaction to an unavoidable daily ritual. Aquagenic urticaria (water allergy or sensitivity) is a miserable business, but in reality not all that common. In my experience, those who believe water is causing problems are more likely to be reacting to body washes containing sodium laureth/lauryl sulphate (SLS), a surfactant processed chemically from coconut or palm oil and used widely to make toiletries and cleaning products foam and lather. Although most people tolerate SLS, it has a PR problem. Many believe it’s carcinogenic (there’s no solid evidence for this), harmful to the environment (it can be toxic to marine life) and a skin irritant (it’s not; reactions are usually mild). But SLS is drying. When skin becomes very dry, it itches, feels tight and uncomfortable, and sometimes reddens. In such circumstances, an SLS-free body wash is a wise choice, and a must if you suffer from eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis or ichthyosis. I was born with the latter (hence my obsession with skin) and have switched almost exclusively to Soaper Duper Body Washes (£6 for a whopping 500ml, packed in 100% recycled plastic). There are six natural, SLS-free fragrances, the shea and coconut being especially good for dry skin. For the fragrance-intolerant, I recommend Sukin’s wonderful Dermasukin Daily Gentle Soap Free Wash (£8.98, 250ml), which contains aloe, camomile and nothing nasty. It lathers to leave skin feeling properly clean (thanks to sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, an eco-friendly and gentle surfactant) and increases post-shower comfort. Baby washes are often a safe bet for the fragrance-averse, too. Childs Farm makes a mild, simple, unfragranced wash for £4 (250ml) that cleans without irritation. You could use soap, the product SLS was designed to replace. Dr Bronner’s Pure Castille Liquid Soap (£7.69, 237ml), in 100% recycled packaging, comes in natural fragrances or unscented, and can be used safely as shampoo, hand-wash, shower gel, household cleanser and detergent for hand-washing. Every product mentioned above is also cruelty free."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/16/martin-sorrells-resignation-triggers-slide-in-wpp-shares","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T16:25:31Z","webTitle":"Martin Sorrell's resignation triggers 6.5% slide in WPP shares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/16/martin-sorrells-resignation-triggers-slide-in-wpp-shares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/16/martin-sorrells-resignation-triggers-slide-in-wpp-shares","fields":{"headline":"Martin Sorrell's resignation triggers 6.5% slide in WPP shares","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell’s abrupt resignation from WPP triggered a 6.5% slide in the group’s share price on Monday as investors mulled the uncertain future of the world’s largest advertising business. Sir Martin, who founded WPP 33 years ago, resigned with immediate effect on Saturday amid an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct. Analysts reacted cautiously to the resignation, telling investors there will not be an immediate crisis at WPP. However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP’s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was “regrettable” to have a leadership transition without Sorrell’s involvement. “It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,” Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. “We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell’s departure on the group’s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.” WPP’s share price ended the day down 6.5% at £11.11p – adding pressure on the already embattled ad group. The next test for WPP comes on 30 April when the company reports its first quarter results, with a failure to meet analysts’ expectations likely to increase the pressure for a break-up or disposals. Sorrell, 73, has “unreservedly denied” the misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The decision not to publish was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, who said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. After years of above-par performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year – before reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 ad recession – as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age. “Whether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,” Davidson said. “Particularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.” A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP’s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network. The frontrunning internal candidates are Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, who were appointed WPP’s joint chief operating officers following Sorrell’s departure on Saturday. “We believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,” Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. “The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.” Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP’s parts at about £17 a share, valuing the group at £22bn. WPP’s current share price is £11.50, a market capitalisation of £15bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/16/wpp-breakup-advertising-sir-martin-sorrell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T14:35:31Z","webTitle":"WPP: breaking up world's top advertising group could net £22bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/16/wpp-breakup-advertising-sir-martin-sorrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/16/wpp-breakup-advertising-sir-martin-sorrell","fields":{"headline":"WPP: breaking up world's top advertising group could net £22bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell’s resignation has raised the question of whether his successor will be able to stop a breakup of the world’s largest advertising group.

Some analysts believe that there is more value in breaking up the sprawling empire – WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries – particularly as its stock market value has plummeted more than a third in the past year. A breakup of WPP could net shareholders more than £22bn, about £17 a share, much more than its current value of £11.50 a share or £15bn market cap, according to analysts. WPP reports its operations in four main business groupings: 1. Advertising and media buying (estimated sale value: £11bn-plus) The largest is advertising and media investment management – essentially the agencies that make ads and those that buy the ad space they appear in – which is the jewel in Sorrell’s crown. AMIM made £1.1bn in profit last year (almost 50% of WPP’s total of £2.3bn), accounts for 46% of revenues and boasts the best margin of 19%. Global advertising networks J Walter Thompson: The world’s oldest advertising agency group with clients including Shell, Debenhams and Kit Kat. Ogilvy &amp; Mather: Clients include Unilever’s Dove, as well as Boots. Young &amp; Rubicam: Its most noticeable campaigns of recent times have included Virgin and the BBC. Grey Global: Clients include Marks &amp; Spencer, Lucozade and Birds Eye. Global media agency networks MediaCom: Employs almost 6,000 staff globally with clients including Sky, Gillette and Mars. Mindshare: Has clients including HSBC and Marmite owner Unilever. It is in charge of allocating $35bn (£24.4bn) worth of advertising spend a year. Wavemaker: Formed from the recent merger of MEC and Maxus, employs 8,500 staff with clients including L’Oréal, Vodafone, Compare the Market and Morrisons. Essence: Clients include BT, Google, Financial Times, Target and Visa. 2. Public relations and public affairs (estimated sale value: £1.4bn) The least profitable of WPP’s units, accounting for just 8% (£183m) of the total operating profit and 7.7% of revenues. Companies within this division include Cohn &amp; Wolfe and Burson Marsteller (which are merging globally), Hill &amp; Knowlton, Finsbury, Buchanan, Clarion and Ogilvy PR. 3. Market research (estimated sale value: £3.5bn) The second-smallest profit centre for WPP, which officially calls this division data investment management, contributes 15% of total profits (£350m) and 18.5% of revenues for the group. WPP is already mulling a potential sale of the division. 4. Branding, healthcare and specialist (estimated sale value: £8bn to £10bn) The division has some attractive assets due to the profitability of areas such as healthcare. It is also home to a number of WPP’s valuable digital and interactive businesses. It accounts for 27.5% of profits (£625m) and 28% of total revenues. Digital advertising businesses include Wunderman, VML and AKQA, which has clients including Nike and Volvo. Branding agencies include Fitch and Coley Porter Bell. Healthcare communications agencies include GCI, Sudler &amp; Hennessey and Common Health. Clients include AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Colgate, GlaxoSmithKline and Kimberley Clark. Other investments (estimated sale value: £6bn) WPP also has what anlaysts have called a “hidden treasure trove” of assets that are not part of its core business lines but could be worth as much as £6bn. These include stakes in the Vice media group and Nasdaq-listed software group Globant. WPP lists these investments, which also include tech and digital businesses, on its books at a value of £2.2bn. However, analysts point out that the true market value could be three times higher, at more than £6bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/16/wolves-count-their-blessings-after-promotion-gamble-pays-off-quickly","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T14:00:10Z","webTitle":"Rúben Neves ‘loving’ life at Wolves and planning to stay for Premier League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/16/wolves-count-their-blessings-after-promotion-gamble-pays-off-quickly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/16/wolves-count-their-blessings-after-promotion-gamble-pays-off-quickly","fields":{"headline":"Rúben Neves ‘loving’ life at Wolves and planning to stay for Premier League","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rúben Neves plans on staying at Wolves next season after helping to end their six-year exile from the Premier League and the midfielder hopes an outstanding first season in England can earn him a place in the Portugal squad at the World Cup finals in Russia this summer. Neves has been the club’s marquee signing, with the £15.8m club‑record buy from Porto excelling since swapping the Champions League for the Championship last summer. He is among the players at Wolves who belong to the agent Jorge Mendes but the 21-year-old midfielder admits he is keen to play in the top flight with Wolves, with the club one point away from being crowned champions. “It’s [going to be] my first season in the Premier League, it’s the place that Wolves deserve, that the fans deserve as well,” Neves said. “I am happy here and if it’s possible I’d like to stay here for my first year in the Premier League. Honestly, I love to play here, I love the boys, I am really happy to play here and I’m really happy to stay. I think I have it all to stay but in football we never know but, yes, I would like to stay. “We are really happy because we achieved our goal a little bit earlier but now we have other goals – we want to be champions. We have three games to go so we have to come back to our hard work to try to get this goal. It’s really good for me. When I came [to Wolves], I came to improve myself and help the club. We are in the Premier League [now] and that’s the most important thing.” Neves has been capped five times and admits his form, including six goals, has helped to put him on the radar of Fernando Santos, the Portugal manager. “Of course all the players are thinking about that,” he said. “I am honestly focused on the here and now but if after that I have to go to the World Cup, I am happy with that. They have Wolves TV, sometimes the games are on Sky Sports, so they can see my games. They sent me a message to congratulate me for the promotion but nothing more.” Wolves clinched promotion on Saturday, when Fulham could only draw with Brentford, and celebrated on Sunday with a 2-0 victory against Birmingham City. That win was their 29th of the season and Kevin Thelwell, the club’s sporting director, believes Nuno Espírito Santo deserves enormous credit. “There’s 101 reasons why we have got promoted but the main reason is Nuno,” Thelwell said. “You hear a lot of coaches and managers needing more time, spending more time to pull off a philosophy, nine or 12 months or maybe longer, but this guy did it in four weeks. He deserves a huge amount of credit, he’s done a fantastic job.” Of the criticism of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes, whose Gestifute agency has seven clients at the club, including Espírito Santo, Thelwell said: “Jorge is an agent just like any other. We’ve taken some of Jorge’s clients but also taken clients from other agents. My perspective on it is we haven’t broken any of the rules, we are very clear on that and the EFL suggests we are very clear on that and Jorge is an agent that has helped us to improve the squad, just like some other agencies have. “In the first year our recruitment didn’t go so well and not so many people were talking about us then. In the second year we managed to pull it all together. We took some risks, Rúben Neves would have been offered to a number of people – not just Wolverhampton Wanderers, as would have some of the other players.” The 44-year-old Thelwell, who joined the club 10 years ago, admits Wolves are now “moving into a different stratosphere” and confirmed that had they not won promotion this year, adhering to the financial fair play (FFP) regulations could have proved a stumbling block. “We have always been very positive about the possibility of getting promoted this year,” Thelwell said. “Yes, possibly [we would have failed FFP] the answer is, in short, but thank God we don’t have to wrestle with that now and that we have got a different problem to solve. “I think from our perspective we are not keen to put a ceiling on it really, it’s almost dare-to-dream stuff. It sounds a little bit ridiculous when you look at the recent history where Wolves have been. But, why not is the answer from my perspective. They [Wolves’ owner Fosun] are uber-ambitious, and they have been uber-supportive. With the squad we’ve got, the age of the players, the coach we’ve got, sky’s the limit really.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T04:00:27Z","webTitle":"More than 95% of world's population breathe dangerous air, major study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"More than 95% of world's population breathe dangerous air, major study finds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 95% of the world’s population breathe unsafe air and the burden is falling hardest on the poorest communities, with the gap between the most polluted and least polluted countries rising rapidly, a comprehensive study of global air pollution has found. Cities are home to an increasing majority of the world’s people, exposing billions to unsafe air, particularly in developing countries, but in rural areas the risk of indoor air pollution is often caused by burning solid fuels. One in three people worldwide faces the double whammy of unsafe air both indoors and out. The report by the Health Effects Institute used new findings such as satellite data and better monitoring to estimate the numbers of people exposed to air polluted above the levels deemed safe by the World Health Organisation. This exposure has made air pollution the fourth highest cause of death globally, after high blood pressure, diet and smoking, and the greatest environmental health risk. Experts estimate that exposure to air pollution contributed to more than 6m deaths worldwide last year, playing a role in increasing the risk of stroke, heart attack, lung cancer and chronic lung disease. China and India accounted for more than half of the death toll. Burning solid fuel such as coal or biomass in their homes for cooking or heating exposed 2.6 billion people to indoor air pollution in 2016, the report found. Indoor air pollution can also affect air quality in the surrounding area, with this effect contributing to one in four pollution deaths in India and nearly one in five in China. Bob O’Keefe, vice-president of the institute, said the gap between the most polluted air on the planet and the least polluted was striking. While developed countries have made moves to clean up, many developing countries have fallen further behind while seeking economic growth. He said there was now an 11-fold gap between the most polluted and least polluted areas, compared with a six-fold gap in 1990. “Air pollution control systems still lag behind economic development [in poorer nations],” he said. But he added: “There are reasons for optimism, though there is a long way to go. China seems to be now moving pretty aggressively, for instance in cutting coal and on stronger controls. India has really begun to step up on indoor air pollution, for instance through the provision of LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] as a cooking fuel, and through electrification.” The number of people exposed to indoor air pollution from burning solid fuels has fallen from an estimated 3.6 billion around the world in 1990 to about 2.4 billion today, despite a rising population. Emissions from transport are a growing concern, however, as road traffic increases. Diesel fuel is a leading cause of air pollution in some rich countries, including the UK, but in poorer countries the often decrepit state of many vehicles means petrol-driven engines can be just as bad in their outputs, especially of the fine particulate matter blamed for millions of deaths a year. O’Keefe said governments were under increasing pressure to deal with the problems through regulation and controls, and hailed internet access as having a significant impact. “Social media has been very important, as a growing number of people have access to it and to data and discussions [on air pollution]. People now have the ability to worry about not just the food they eat and a roof over the head, but they have the means to discuss [issues] in public,” he said. Tuesday’s report reinforces an increasing volume of data in recent years that has shown how air pollution is increasing and causing deaths. More data has become available in the past decade from satellites and on-the-ground monitoring, while large-scale studies have revealed more of the health risks arising from breathing dirty air, which rarely kills people directly but is now known to contribute to other causes of death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/sleep-billion-dollar-business-tiredness-spooning-robots-cuddle-blankets-luxury","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"Dream ticket: how sleep became a billion-dollar business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/sleep-billion-dollar-business-tiredness-spooning-robots-cuddle-blankets-luxury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/17/sleep-billion-dollar-business-tiredness-spooning-robots-cuddle-blankets-luxury","fields":{"headline":"Dream ticket: how sleep became a billion-dollar business","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rockwell Shah speaks with almost evangelical zeal about sleep. He is the CEO of Pzizz, an app that “designs dynamic audio” to get you to “sleep at the push of a button”; for him, bedtime is a “sleep experience”. Does he use his own app? “Oh my God! All the time.” As a sleep entrepreneur, what is his bedtime routine like – does he swear by camomile tea or special pyjamas? “I have a Purple mattress. I love the darn thing; it’s not like anything you’ve ever experienced with a mattress before, you basically float on top of it.” He does not, he clarifies, have any affiliation to the company. He is just truly that excited about shuteye. Who can blame him? A good night’s sleep helps our memory, learning and mood. So it is no wonder that an industry of bright-eyed sleep entrepreneurs has awoken around our quest for better, deeper, longer sleep. They are offering everything from sleep trackers to white noise machines and hi-tech pyjamas that claim to create “an advanced sleep system for better rest and recovery”, made from bioceramic material that “absorbs the body’s natural heat and reflects that energy back into the skin”. Then there is a new robot, versed in “thousands of years of Buddhist breathing techniques”, that promises to soothe you to sleep, if only you spoon it. Yours to order for €539 (£466). In the world of sleep, business is booming: according to a 2017 McKinsey report, the sleep-health industry – anything from bedding and sound control to sleep consultants and prescription sleep aids – “is collectively estimated to be worth between $30bn and $40bn and has historically grown by more than 8% a year, with few signs of slowing down”. At a time when our innate ability to sleep is being kiboshed by work, life and disruptive partners – one recent study found that 30% of Americans wanted a “sleep divorce” – capitalism is, for better or worse, finding a way to sell it back to us. Just look at the mattress market. In recent years, mattresses have become a highly desirable commodity, sold by companies that increasingly behave like tech startups, putting growth at their core and accessing venture capital markets more usually associated with Silicon Valley. The New York-based online mattress retailer Casper reached $100m in sales in 2015, the year after it launched; British company Simba expects sales of £100m by next year, having launched in 2016. The Pzizz app launched in October 2016 and now has more than half a million downloads across 160 countries. The Duke of York declared himself a fan, and JK Rowling said it was the “best I’ve used by a mile”. Shah spent 10 years working in a medical software company before starting the app, fuelled by his own past struggles to nod off as well as a “recognition that sleep has been declared a public health crisis”. He describes in more detail how Pzizz works: “dreamscapes engineered to lull your body into sleep” are paired with voiceovers “based on clinical sleep interventions, things like progressive muscle relaxation, clinical sleep hypnosis, breathing exercises and autogenic training”, a technique that teaches your body to respond to verbal commands. The scripts are modular, meaning “literally billions of variations”, and the voice actors are chosen for possessing “that special quality” – they know how to “speak in a certain way that just … gets you …” – he slows his voice right down – “to … relax”. It certainly sounds relaxing. But what does the meteoric rise of this industry say about our lives – are we in a sleep crisis? “The simple answer is ‘yes’,” says Dr Guy Meadows, the co-founder and clinical director of the Sleep School, which runs insomnia clinics in central London, “we are in a sleeplessness epidemic.” A perfect storm has settled over our bedrooms, and it is stopping us from drifting off. “Tiredness,” he says, “is the new norm.” The internet is awash with concern about sleep, its quality, length and regularity. Recent articles warn us that “One bad night’s sleep may increase levels of Alzheimer’s protein”; that “Late risers [are] at increased risk of early death” and explain “Why going to bed in the wrong pyjamas could be affecting your sleep”. Children around the world are sleeping less – in the UK, for instance, hospital attendances for children under 14 with sleep disorders have tripled over the past 10 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that a third of US adults say they usually get less than the recommended amount of sleep. The World Health Organization recommends between seven and nine hours a night, but a 2013 study by the National Sleep Foundation showed the average adult in the UK is getting just 6hr 49min each weeknight. People are falling asleep on New York’s subway so frequently that Mayor Bill de Blasio backed a scheme to start waking them up. From academics to entrepreneurs, everyone agrees that a large portion of blame lies with digital technology. Watching The Good Place on Netflix with one eye on Instagram and another on the news is not, it turns out, a recipe for good sleep. And it is not just about the blue light of screens that we have all come to dread, the wavelength of which affects levels of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. “We are more connected, and more stimulated – in a cognitive sense,” says Meadows. “Our brain is not switching off, which is affecting its ability to gradually downshift its gears into sleep.” Going back to a much earlier tech revolution, the sheer fact of electricity means we can choose to stay up until all hours. “We’ve invaded the night,” says Dr Russell Foster, the director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, “and we’ve fitted more and more into the working day. Sleep has been the first victim.” Work was once unlikely to be allowed into the bedroom, but can now commonly be found there, and not just in the form of midnight email sessions propped up on pillows. Shah points to the insecurity of the gig economy: “It has ramifications. Everybody is worried all the time about where the next paycheck is coming from,” he says. Therein lies what a lot of the chatter around sleep seems to miss – that many people can’t afford to get enough; a good night’s sleep has become a luxury. Those in richer countries tend to get more. And the richer people in those countries tend to get more than the poor. According to a University of Chicago study from 2006, US adults are more likely to get more sleep, and sleep better, if they are white, wealthy and – perhaps surprisingly – women. Our obsession with sleep has coincided with, and in some ways been consolidated into, the wellness industry. Sleep has been given that most modern of makeovers – it has been Goop-ified, given the clean-sleeping treatment, with Gwyneth Paltrow evangelising about making sleep a priority and her 10-hour-a-night ideal. People are being encouraged to douse vetiver-scented wellness oil between their toes or do a five-minute foam-rolling session right before heading to bed. But that doesn’t negate the fact that all of us, even those with expensive pillows and oily toes, could probably use more sleep. Even if the numbers on sleeplessness make for grim reading, it is still good news that our attitudes are shifting. Foster says: “We’re right to take sleep seriously. It is 36% of our biology, and it has been largely marginalised and ignored.” When Trump declared, at a campaign event in Illinois in 2015, “I have a great temperament for success. You know, I’m not a big sleeper, I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep,” his sleep bravado sounded retrograde, a vestige of 1980s Wall Street, where money never slept because sleeping was for wimps. The cult of “manly wakefulness” (as opposed to female “beauty sleep”), as Prof Alan Derickson coined it in his 2013 book Dangerously Sleepy, has been superseded – now we see a bit more shuteye and a bit less beep-de-beep as no bad thing. It perhaps helps that Bill Clinton, who was said to get only four to six hours while in office, has since admitted: “Most of the mistakes I made, I made when I was too tired.” Anyone can sleep for a meagre few hours a night, but only a “minute percentage” can do that and function, according to Meadows. The corporate workshop side of Meadows’ sleep school has expanded massively since its launch in 2008. Now one of the largest parts of the business is going into banks, law firms, management consultancies and ad agencies to provide a programme of sleep education for employees. Where once businesses were paying their staff not to sleep, now they are paying to teach them how to get better sleep. Little wonder when 200,000 working days a year are lost to absenteeism caused by lack of sleep in the UK, and sleep-deprived workers cost the UK economy £40bn a year. It has been just over a decade since Arianna Huffington collapsed from sleep deprivation and arose to stage her call to arms – and to the bedroom – putting paid to the idea that CEOs or indeed anyone can function on what many of us would count as a long nap each night. And many people have tried to heed her message, if they can afford to (it is worth noting that Huffington has “nine or so” assistants). In recent years, Amazon’s bestseller list has been topped by a children’s book called The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep. It is written by a Swedish psychologist and its focus and structure are designed to lull children into slumber. And adults are queueing up in pyjama’d throngs to be put to sleep by classical music – from Berlin to Sydney, Max Richter’s Sleep, an eight-hour “personal lullaby for a frenetic world”, has turned a sleepover into a good night out. So what led to this change in mindset? One answer lies in the lab. “What has fundamentally changed,” says Foster, is that “serious neuroscientists have started to take sleep seriously – it was a bit of a graveyard of the neuroscience world.” But not any more – and the “data emerging are quite spectacular”. He rattles some off in a torrent so convincing it will make you want to head straight to bed: the “beautiful experiment” published by Jan Born in 2004 that showed the massive impact sleep can have on problem-solving. The “nice data” from Eve Van Cauter’s University of Chicago lab that found that sleep loss in healthy young adults increased their risk of type 2 diabetes. And the experiment that showed you are less likely to remember words with a positive value (think: love or joy) if you are sleep-deprived – “Our level of sleep will very much reflect the way we remember positive and negative experiences.” Anecdotally, it stacks up – who isn’t moody when they are functioning on too little sleep? “If you’re not fully rested,” Foster continues, “then you tend to be overly impulsive – jumping that red light; unreflective of things that you do; you lack in empathy, so your ability to pick up the social signals of others is not good. Tired people not only fail to come up with innovative solutions to complex problems – to use this extraordinary brain – but their ability to function generally, sense of humour, social interactions fall apart really quickly.” And that, he says, is just relatively short-term sleep loss. “For a long time,” says Meadows, “insomnia has been thought of as a symptom of poor mental health. Now we know that actually it is also a trigger – sleep is considered an early warning sign, a canary down the coalmine for anxiety, depression, bipolar.” With the science of sleep proving Virginia Woolf was playing with fire when she dismissed shuteye as a “deplorable curtailment of the joy of life”, it is no wonder we’re anxious to get enough. Many of us turn to sleep trackers for help. Trackers claiming to measure how long we are sleeping, and what kind of sleep we are getting – light, deep or REM – are now common bed companions. Foster is wary: “They have been half validated and they sort of work for people who have very stable sleep/wake patterns, but if you have any irregularity or are falling outside of the normal range, and frankly that’s most of us, they fall apart very quickly.” While “they are great for empowering you to say: ‘Yeah, there’s a bunch of stuff I can do to improve my sleep,’” he says, “I don’t think we’re there yet with these devices … [But] everybody’s jumped on the bandwagon … there are a lot of people who take these things very seriously.” Cut to sleep’s very modern, meta disorder: orthosomnia. Dr Sabra Abbott, a professor in neurology and sleep medicine at Northwestern Memorial hospital, co-coined the term with her colleague Dr Kelly Baron in a 2017 paper, Are Some Patients Taking the Quantified Self Too Far?. She tells me how they started seeing patients who “didn’t necessarily initially have sleep complaints – their primary concern was that their tracker was telling them they weren’t getting the right amount or right type of sleep. It seemed,” she says, “that the device was creating a sleep problem that may not have otherwise been there.” Foster likens this newfound interest in sleep trackers to “when domestic electrification first came in. A whole bunch of people started to wire up houses and a number of them burned down, because they didn’t know how to use the equipment.” Orthosomnia seems to be one symptom of an industry that grew rapidly and has left consumers with more data than we know what to do with (albeit not always accurate). It is tempting to draw a parallel with the world of social media – we are using a ton of it and we are not yet sure what impact it is having. “Every step change encounters the same thing,” reflects Foster. “It is a massive interest – things have pushed forward so fast that there is a great vacuum behind it.” But the sleep industry is not all gadgetry. At the pleasingly lo-tech end you will find the weighted Gravity Blanket, available in three gradations of heaviness: seven, nine or 11kg. According to the company’s CEO Mike Grillo, it “mimics the feeling of being hugged or embraced”. This “releases serotonin”, he says, “stimulates melatonin, helps decrease cortisol levels, which is linked to stress and anxiety, and that is what induces the calming and grounded effect”. Not bad for a heavy blanket. When it comes to the evidence behind it, “there is still a lot of science to be done”, Grillo concedes – according to the New Yorker, Gravity early on deleted a section from its Kickstarter page claiming it “can be used to treat a variety of ailments”, including insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But it obviously struck a chord: it has raised just shy of $5m on Kickstarter to date. Its original fundraising goal had been $21,500. It is tempting to slot it into the tumultuous present – what had been “used in more niche patient populations for some time”, says Grillo, began to have wider appeal after the 2016 election of Donald Trump “and the Brexit vote in your part of the world”. In a recent article about Gravity in the New Yorker, the writer Jia Tolentino describes how it “enacts a fantasy of immobilisation that is especially seductive in a world of ever-expanding obligations – to work, to monetise, to take action, to perform”. An industry for an anxious age, then, where screens and work have invaded our bedrooms and world leaders sit up into the small hours beep-de-beep-ing. Now, where’s that breathing robot? I might need to spoon it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/john-oliver-hbo-last-week-tonight-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T15:20:01Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on America's corporate tax reform: 'We absolutely blew it'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/john-oliver-hbo-last-week-tonight-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/16/john-oliver-hbo-last-week-tonight-tax","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on America's corporate tax reform: 'We absolutely blew it'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"John Oliver took aim Donald Trump’s recent tax reforms and how corporate tax rates for remain far too low for major US companies. On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, the British comic called taxes “essentially the government’s GoFundMe page” as the US edges closer to the deadline for tax returns. He played footage from a recent speech where Trump claims that his reforms would benefit workers such as cops and pipe-fitters – people Trump said liked him the most. “That is clearly nonsense, because if this bill were really helping the people that like Donald Trump best, it would exclusively benefit Eric Trump, Roseanne Barr and anyone who’s ever looked both ways before whispering, ‘It was the Jews,’” he joked. The corporate tax rate was also lowered from 35 to 21%, although, as Oliver pointed out, most companies have been paying closer to 24% in recent years, even before the reform. Many of the country’s biggest firms also continue to move assets overseas to avoid paying tax in the US. “The good news is that Trump’s tax bill actually forces companies to pay taxes on all the money they’ve stashed overseas,” he said. “The hope is that they will then bring it home in something called repatriation. The bad news is that the tax they’re being forced to pay, which may have once been 35%, has been slashed to as little as eight to 15%, which seems less like a punishment and more like actively rewarding companies for tax avoidance.” The Republicans claim that this will lead to more jobs, but Oliver isn’t so sure. “Anything theoretically could lead to jobs,” he said. “You could say ‘I’m dipping this badger in fudge to create jobs’ and I can’t prove that you won’t create any jobs by doing that. But I can argue that if creating jobs is your main goal, there are probably better ways to do it.” Instead, companies have been rewarding shareholders. Recently Trump claimed that Apple creating 20,000 new jobs was down to his reform, yet as Oliver said, this would have happened anyway and is consistent with their strategy. “We just had a huge chance to reform our tax code and we absolutely blew it, because effective tax reform is not just about lowering rates, it’s about closing loopholes,” he said. Oliver continued: “Our tax code is still full of loopholes, and however much Trump talked about how tax reform would benefit cops and pipe-fitters, it’s worth mentioning that when Trump got behind closed doors, his message seemed to change.” Reports claimed that after the reform passed, Trump told guests at Mar-a-Lago that they would all be getting richer. “Rest assured that Donald Trump’s tax reform continues to let companies engage in sophisticated tax avoidance schemes,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/16/thousands-of-children-miss-out-on-preferred-primary-school-england","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T16:46:12Z","webTitle":"Thousands of children miss out on preferred primary school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/16/thousands-of-children-miss-out-on-preferred-primary-school-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/16/thousands-of-children-miss-out-on-preferred-primary-school-england","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of children miss out on preferred primary school","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thousands of parents in England have been denied a place for their child at their first choice of primary school. Evidence suggests, however, that pressure on reception classes is easing in some areas, including London, where applications were down 2.3% on last year. After an anxious wait documented by many parents on social media, more than half a million families across England were informed on Monday which school their child will be attending in September. Early analysis of local authority data suggests that, in many areas, higher proportions of children gained places at their first choice of school this year. In most areas, about 90% of parents had an offer from their hoped-for school. But thousands were still disappointed, with some failing to secure a place at any of their preferred primaries. Many disappointed parents will now be considering an appeal; others will be wondering how to negotiate new challenges. One father tweeted: “So our littlest has been given a place at primary school. It would have been a lot easier had it been the same primary school as her sister. Looking forward to working out how to be in two different places at the same time.” In London, where demand for places remains high, 86.5% of families were offered their first choice of school, up 0.61% on 2017, while 96% were accepted by one of their three favourites. But 2,314 four-year-olds did not get into any of their chosen schools, down 0.14% on last year. Primary schools have struggled in recent years to accommodate growing numbers of children after a spike in the birth rate, but the population bulge is gradually shifting from primaries to secondaries. Figures published last month showed applications to London secondaries were up 4%. Some London boroughs claim demand for places is also down because of welfare changes and high property prices, which have forced some families to leave the capital. In other boroughs, however, demand remains high and success rates for securing places at preferred primaries are the lowest in the country. The most difficult borough to be accepted by your preferred primary school is Kensington and Chelsea, where just 68% of families secured their first choice – the same proportion as last year. In Camden the figure was 76.55%, and in Hammersmith and Fulham it was 76.71%. Birmingham, where demand for primary places has been high in recent years, also recorded a slight drop in applications. The proportion of parents receiving their first choice rose by 5.5% to 92.9%, but just over 200 children did not receive an offer from any of their preferred schools. According to a Press Association sample survey of 40 councils in England, 28 (70%) reported a rise in the proportion of families receiving their first choice of school; five (12.5%) said there had been a fall, and seven (17.5%) saw no change. Of the 31 local authorities that provided comparable information on application numbers, the majority (27) reported a fall, while four saw an increase. In some areas, almost all four-year-olds got into their preferred school. In Wiltshire, 93.4% were offered their first choice, while the figure was 96% in central Bedfordshire, 95.2% in Cornwall and 95% in Lincolnshire. Parents in East Sussex had more difficulty, with 87.6% winning their first preference, while in Leeds it was 88% and in Essex is was 88.1%. The school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “We’re investing £5.8bn to create even more good schools and good school places – building on the 825,000 we’ve created since 2010 – resulting in nine out of 10 pupils securing one of their top three choices of schools.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2018/apr/13/syria-crisis-corbyn-accuses-may-of-waiting-for-trumps-instructions-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T23:04:23Z","webTitle":"UK calls Russia's Syria chemical attack claim 'ludicrous' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/apr/13/syria-crisis-corbyn-accuses-may-of-waiting-for-trumps-instructions-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/apr/13/syria-crisis-corbyn-accuses-may-of-waiting-for-trumps-instructions-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"UK calls Russia's Syria chemical attack claim 'ludicrous' – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Follow the latest developments on Syria. We’re closing this live blog down now. Here’s a summary of the day’s events: The UK government called Moscow’s accusation that Britain directed the attack on Douma “ludicrous”. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the allegations showed Russia’s “desperation to pin the blame on anyone but their client: the Assad regime”. Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed Moscow had “irrefutable” evidence that the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria was staged with the help of a foreign secret service. He did not provide evidence for the claim. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK-funded White Helmets were behind fake reports about the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for more dialogue with Russia in in a phone call with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin. “The president of the republic called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped up to bring peace and stability back to Syria,” a statement from Macron’s office said. Russia tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve agents and targeted the email accounts of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, according to previously classified intelligence over the Salisbury attack. Ambassador Yakovenko has demanded proof that Yulia Skripal is alive and well. He announced that Russia is lodging an official challenge to the way the UK investigated the incident and claimed evidence was being destroyed. He denied Russia had produce or stored novichok or tracked the Skripals but said he not seen the UK’s latest dossier. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of “waiting for instructions” from Donald Trump adding that military intervention risks “escalating an already devastating conflict”. He also called for a UN-led investigation of the chemical weapons attack in Douma. There are growing calls for the government to give MPs a vote before launching any military intervention in Syria. Labour is actively exploring ways to bring a debate on any military action to parliament, but will have difficulty forcing a Commons vote. Earlier today, we reported that the labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had been granted a security briefing from the government on the Douma attack. That meeting has now taken place. The prime minister, Theresa May, has also spoken to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, though no details of what they discussed have yet been released. Donald Trump’s erratic tweets regarding strikes – and when they will happen – are already impacting tourism, with tour operators weighing in after Europe’s central aviation agency warned commercial airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean. Officials in Cyprus, whose economy is highly dependent on tourism, are heaving a sigh of relief after Britain made clear it was not altering its travel advice to the island. Britons, followed by Russians, comprise the bulk of the 3.4 million holidaymakers expected to visit the destination this year. The Cypriot government’s spokesman, Prodromos Prodomou, says: We may be closer to Syria than anyone else but Cyprus is not involved in what is happening. Nobody has asked to use our airbase in Paphos, for example. What the British authorities decide to do on the sovereign bases is not within the control of the Republic of Cyprus. They are not obliged to give information to us … we have no say in what goes on in them, although – unofficially as a matter of courtesy, let’s say – they will often inform us. The decision of some commercial airlines to reroute flights after Euro Control’s warning was bad publicity, but did not overly affect the island where bookings had been pre-paid. “It was a first. Last year there was no such warning,” said Prodromou, referring to the tomahawk strike Trump ordered after a previous chemical attack in Syria. Over in Cyprus, officials are attempting to kill off speculation Russia would retaliate with an attack against British sovereign bases on the island in the event of US-led punitive airstrikes inside Syria. Speaking to the Guardian, the government spokesman Prodomos Prodromou describes the scenario of a counter-attack as “so remote” it borders on being “crazy”. He says: It is impossible to imagine a scenario where Russia not only hits Britain [ in retaliation] directly but does so in Cyprus,” he said. “It would be crazy to have a confrontation between the US and Russia … the scenario of a counter attack [staged] in Cyprus is a fantasy, a fiction. Cyprus, an EU member state with traditionally good relations with Russia, has found itself caught in the middle as debate over missile attacks has mounted. The former colony is host to two British sovereign bases, including a vital military installation at RAF Akrotiri, where eight typhoon and six tornado fighter bombers are stationed. As Britain’s main forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East, RAF Akrotiri’s front line role as a launch pad makes it a prime candidate for counter attack, analysts say. The Foreign Office says Moscow’s accusation that Britain directed the attack on Douma is “ludicrous”. A spokesman says: Russia has wielded its UN Security Council veto six times since February 2017 to shield the Assad regime from scrutiny for its use of chemical weapons. These accusations from Moscow are just the latest in a number of ludicrous allegations from Russia, who have also said that no attack ever happened. This simply shows their desperation to pin the blame on anyone but their client: the Assad regime. The chemical weapons attack in Douma last Saturday was a shocking and barbaric act that cost up to 75 lives including young children. British UN ambassador Karen Pierce said that Britain was not involved in an alleged deadly chemical weapons attack in Syria, rejecting an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry. Pierce told reporters: This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is the worst piece of fake news we’ve yet seen from the Russian propaganda machine. My colleague Jessica Elgot has learned that both Jeremy Corbyn and Vince Cable are receiving security briefings on Syria today. United Nations war crimes investigators today condemned the suspected use of chemical weapons in the Syrian town of Douma in eastern Ghouta and called for evidence to be preserved with a view to future prosecutions. International chemical weapons experts were travelling to Syria to investigate an alleged gas attack by government forces on Douma which killed dozens of people. The UN international commission of inquiry on Syria said in a statement: Perpetrators of such attacks must be identified and held accountable. We stress the imperative need to preserve evidence, and call upon all relevant authorities to ensure no party tampers with suspected sites, objects, witnesses, or victims before independent monitors and investigators are able to access the area. French UN ambassador Francois Delattre said that the Syrian government’s decision to again use chemical weapons meant they had “reached a point of no return” and the world must provide a “robust, united and steadfast response”. He told the UN security council: In deciding to once again use chemical weapons the regime has reached a point of no return. France will shoulder its responsibility to end an intolerable threat to our collective security. Yousif Al Bustani, 27, from Douma, Syria, had to flee to the Aleppo countryside five days ago following the chemical attack. In response to Donald Trump’s threats of military action, told me: I’m like a large number of Syrian people who is in support of attacking Assad’s regime but not to destroying Syria. This is a criminal regime surrounded by a bunch of gangsters, they have killed people and destroyed cities. Attacking Bashar has been the demand of the Syrian people for more than five years not just today. We want Trump to shell the presidential palace, security sites, army bases and militias bases. We do not consider these sites to be part of Syria but part of the Russian and Iranian occupation of Syria. I have no problem at all if these sites are levelled to the ground, they are the source of all evils. The aim of the attack should not be only attacking the regime, it should force Bashar to step down and to be summoned before a tribunal for all his massacres against the Syrian people, of which some are documented and many others are not. Frankly speaking, I have no confidence in any state especially the US administration, which only takes care of its own interests. The Americans themselves have helped in lengthening the suffering of the Syrian people for more than seven years now by not arming the Syrian rebels with anti air missiles rockets. They did not do anything to protect the Syrian people and at the same time, they did not allow the Syrian people to protect themselves. The Syrian people are used now by the Americans as a means of pressure on the Russians. I have no problem with any state in the world who wants to help in toppling the regime though it is difficult to predict what the Americans can do. US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that Washington estimates that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons at least 50 times during the seven-year-long conflict. She told the UN security council: Our President has not yet made a decision about possible action in Syria. But should the United States and our allies decide to act in Syria, it will be in defense of a principle on which we all agree. All nations and all people will be harmed if we allow Assad to normalize the use of chemical weapons. Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has told the UN Security Council that the United States, France and Britain are only interested in ousting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s government and containing Russia. He said: We continue to observe dangerous military preparations for an illegal act of force against a sovereign state in what would constitute a breach of international law. We call on the leadership of these states to immediately reconsider. The sole thing they have an interest in is to oust the Syrian government and more broadly to contain the Russian Federation. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, addressing the Security Council on Syria, urged all states “to act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances.” He told the 15-member council: Increasing tensions and the inability to reach a compromise in the establishment of an accountability mechanism threaten to lead to a full-blown military escalation. Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle has written a thread on Twitter arguing that joining a US strike would be “folly” and that Britain should pursue humanitarian and diplomatic support while also “suspending sales of arms and chemical weapon precursors”. He points out that Britain approved export licences to Syria for the sale of chemicals between 2004 and 2012. He adds: I have sympathy with the desire to act; to try and enforce both international law and to show Syria that it cannot continue to poison its citizens. But there is no way to bomb Syria into the country we want it to be. RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus is at the sharp end of the British military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Rumour is rife on the island that the installation would be targeted if Russia were to retaliate in the event of US-led military action in Syria. At last count, Britain’s main forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East had eight typhoon and six tornado fighter bombers ready for action. Here’s what we know so far: Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed Moscow had “irrefutable” evidence that the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria was staged with the help of a foreign secret service. He did not provide evidence for the claim. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK-funded White Helmets were behind fake reports about the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for more dialogue with Russia in in a phone call with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin. “The president of the republic called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped up to bring peace and stability back to Syria,” a statement from Macron’s office said. Russia tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve agents and targeted the email accounts of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, according to previously classified intelligence over the Salisbury attack. Ambassador Yakovenko has demanded proof that Yulia Skripal is alive and well. He announced that Russia is lodging an official challenge to the way the UK investigated the incident and claimed evidence was being destroyed. He denied Russia had produce or stored novichok or tracked the Skripals but said he not seen the UK’s latest dossier. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of “waiting for instructions” from Donald Trump adding that military intervention risks “escalating an already devastating conflict”. He also called for a UN-led investigation of the chemical weapons attack in Douma. There are growing calls for the government to give MPs a vote before launching any military intervention in Syria. Labour is actively exploring ways to bring a debate on any military action to parliament, but will have difficulty forcing a Commons vote. Donald Trump has been tweeting today but so far not about Syria. The target for his insults today is the former FBI director James Comey. Ambassador Yakovenko says Russia was not tracking Sergei Skripal in the UK. “We want to know what happened in this country, because Russia was blamed. We want to know the truth,” he said. If Yulia Skripal claims political asylum in the UK that’s a decision for her, he said. “We want to hear her story. We want to have a fully-fledged investigation. Theresa May has said Russia was behind this. We want to see the evidence,” Yakovenko said. “We didn’t produce novichok. We never had it. We never stored it in the army,” Yakovenko added. He added that Russia will send an official request today to the UK challenging its inspection into the Salisbury incident. Yakovenko says he is not aware of any conversations between Putin and Trump since last week’s suspected chemical attack. But he confirms that Putin has not spoken to Theresa May about the incident. Asked more about the claim the Douma attack was staged, Yakovenko denies he was implying British special forces were involved in such an operation. He says the White Helmets were responsible for the “fake” report. On UK claims that Russia had been spying on the Skripals for five year, Yakovenko chuckles. “They always complain when something goes wrong,” he said. Yakovenko is also about the UK’s claim that Russia tested nerve agent on door handles before the Skripal attack. He said the UK has not shared those concerns with Russia. “I didn’t see this, because I was preparing for this press conference,” he said. On Salisbury Yakovenko disputes the UK claim that the OPCW backed the UK’s analysis of the poisoning. The OPCW never confirmed where the nerve agent involved was manufactured. “The report is saying nothing about that,” he said. “All the statements made by Boris Johnson and other people are not correct,” he said. “The report never supported the British version,” he said. Asked why Russia is backing a suspected war criminal in Syria, Yakovenko says Assad was democratically elected and the only legitimate leader in Syria. On Russia’s veto of a UN investigation into the Douma attack, he said the US were proposing an old way of investigating which would not have involved visiting the site of the suspected attack. The planned OPCW inspection is “exactly what we wanted”, Yakovenko said. Yakovenko says Russia will publish its own report into the Salisbury nerve agent attack. He says Russia is currently studying the OPCW full unpublished report into the incident. He refuses to say whether the “quite thick” full OPCW report mentions the nerve agent novichok. The British side are not transparent, Yakovenko claims and suggests the UK is flouting international law over the investigation into the poisoning. Yakovenko demands “proof” that Yulia Skripal is safe. He questions why there have been no photographs of the Skripals or interviews with them since the incident. “What is happening in this country, if the press is supposed to be free?” he asks. Yakovenko claims the UK-funded White Helmets are “famous for staging attacks” in Syria. French President Emmanuel Macron has raised concerns about the deterioration of the situation in Syria in a phone call with his Russia counterpart Vladimir Putin. He also called for more dialogue with Moscow, his office said. Macron, who claims France has proof the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in an attack last week, also expressed regret at Russia’s use of its United Nations Security Council veto on the attack. “The president of the republic called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped up to bring peace and stability back to Syria,” a statement from Macron’s office said. Yakovenko pointed out, at his continuing press conference in London, that France has provided no evidence of proof that Syria was behind the Douma attack. Yakovenko taunted western allies considering military action by playing clips of Tony Blair before and after Iraq war. In a statement, the embassy said: “The infamous aggression against Iraq in 2003 immediately comes to mind, when the then Prime Minister Tony Blair deliberately misinformed the Parliament and the public. It is well known how it ended – with Chilcot inquiry delivering a condemnatory verdict.” On Syria, Yakovenko says Russia has been warning for weeks of the possibility of a staged chemical attack by Syrian rebels. He alleges that the Western-backed White Helmets could have been behind staging the incident. He welcomes the fact-finding mission by the OPCW which is due to start tomorrow. He claims any delay could be used by the west to deliver military strikes to destroy evidence. Yakovenko accuses the UK and France of “mechanically” following America’s lead on Syria. Russia’s UK ambassador Alexander Yakovenko is giving a press conference in London. He complains that the UK has refused consular access to Yulia Skripal after she was discharged from hospital. He claims the UK government is deliberately destroying all evidence on the Salisbury incident. He claims a letter to Boris Johnson about the Skripals has remained unanswered. Russia tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve agents and targeted the email accounts of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia since at least 2013, according to previously classified intelligence over the Salisbury attack made public by the UK on Friday. The UK is making public previously classified intelligence linking Russia to the attack on the Russian double-agent, including claims that Moscow had tested the use of door handles as a way of delivering nerve agents and that Russian military intelligence had targeted the email accounts of both victims since at least 2013. The claims were made in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s national security adviser, to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely rare for the UK to make such intelligence public. In the letter, Sedwill, who has an overview of the work of all the UK spy services, filled in some of the intelligence that Theresa May referred to when she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia was “highly likely” to have been behind the attack. In that news conference Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed Moscow had “irrefutable” evidence that the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria was staged with the help of a foreign secret service, AFP reports. “We have irrefutable evidence that this was another staged event, and that the secret services of a certain state that is now at the forefront of a Russophobic campaign was involved in this staged event,” he said during a press conference. He did not provide evidence for the claim. According to Syrian medics and a statement by the World Health Organisation, more than 40 people died in an 7 April strike on the former rebel outpost of Douma of symptoms consistent with the use of chemical weapons. The US and its allies believe the Syrian regime was behind the attack, but Russia has long insisted it was staged by rebels in an attempt to provoke further Western intervention. Russia’s embassy in the UK says it concerned by reports that the cabinet has agreed to take action against Syria. In a statement it said any airstrikes could hamper the OPCW’s investigation into the possible use of chemical weapons in Douma. It said: “At the request of the Syrian Government the OPCW sent a fact-finding team to Douma. The experts will arrive tomorrow. Syrian authorities will provide all the relevant security guarantees. Russia is ready to assist in ensuring its safety. We are interested in seeing independent experts there, so they can make all the necessary tests without delay. The conditions on the ground, now that the Russian military police is present in Douma, are appropriate for conducting investigation of the alleged incident. Russian services for chemical and radiological security visited the suspected site of the incident and did not find any traces of chemical substances. No persons treated for chemical poisoning were found in local hospitals ... UK statements in favour of an independent investigation clearly contradict those automatically laying the blame on the Syrian government. Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence, or lack thereof, on the ground. Such a decision, if it’s taken, in violation of the international law and the Charter of the United Nations may well mark the latest in the series of the reckless military adventures by the UK ... It’s essential to avoid any steps which could escalate the tensions. Donald Trump and Theresa May last night discussed the need for a joint response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons, according to Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London. In a tweet Johnson suggested that any US-led action in Syria would be coordinated with the UK. Isamael Abdulla, a 31-year-old resident of western Aleppo, says he is constantly monitoring Donald Trump’s Twitter feed. I’m waiting for his most powerful tweet yet in which declares war against Bashar Al-Assad. The problem with the Syrian crisis is the international community’s hesitation. It has refused to halt the killing machine of the Syrian regime and its deadly supporters in Russia and Iran. I’m worried that his tweets are merely negotiating tactics. We are fed up of US red lines that turned to be traffic light warnings. Maybe Trump is waiting for other powers to back his decision, but last time when he attacked Shayrat with 60 missile, he did not wait for any international endorsement. The US administration and the UN only get upset only when there is a chemical attack, as if other sorts of weapons used to kill people are alright. This daily killing should be stopped as soon as possible. The only solution for the Syrian problem is a unified world repsonse to disband the foreign support to Bashar and back the Syrian people who have become refugees all over the world. I support an attack that can change the Syrian regime without causing great loss among civilians. If Bashar stays in power, we will witness more massacres in the future. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he hoped that there would be no repeat of the experience of Libya and Iraq in the Syria conflict. “God forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria following the Libyan and Iraqi experience,” Lavrov told a news conference on Friday, Reuters reports. He said that even the smallest miscalculation in Syria could lead to new waves of migrants and that ultimatums and threats do not help the dialogue. Russia and the United States are using their channels of communications on Syria, according to the minister. Lavrov also questioned the UK claims that the OPCW report into the Salisbury poisoning confirmed its analysis of the incident. He said this was an “overstated” interpretation of the OPCW’s report. The Labour leader has asked for a security briefing - on privy council terms - on Syria, but it is understood no response has been received from Number 10. Labour are also actively exploring ways to bring a debate on any military action to parliament, but will have difficulty forcing a Commons vote. The party does not have any scheduled opposition debates next week. It could potentially force an SO24 emergency topical debate - a technical procedure which would allow the House to vote on whether there should be a vote to authorise military action. But the vote would not be binding on the government, which has shown over the past six months it is minded to abstain and effectively ignore opposition motions. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has told Sky News it will protect its people on the ground in Syria if missiles are launched by the US and its allies. She said: “Russia should protect its people on the ground, of course. We came to Syria at the invitation of the people. You can see their appreciation on the ground.” Zakharova also criticised Donald Trump warning in a tweet that Russia should “get ready” because missiles “will be coming, new and new and ‘smart’”. She said: “I was surprised that such strong messages were sent through social media because this should be a time to phone your partner ... We can resolve all these problems by picking up the phone, not by force.” Bassam Abu Abdullah, an advisor to Syrian Ministry of Information, has again denied that the Syrian army attacked civilians with chemical weapon. Speaking to BBC News he said: “We didn’t use and we will not use any kind of chemical weapons because we don’t have these kind of chemical weapons after 2013. We joined the international agreement on the prohibition of chemical weapons.” Abdullah claimed videos appearing to show the aftermath of the suspected attack on Douma were “fabricated”. He said: “The source of these films said that 10 people died and 600 were injured. Where are these people? Can you show us them? What are their names? Nothing.” “We are ready to receive the investigators from the OPCW and show them anything they want. We have nothing to cover.” On the threat of US-led military strikes he said: “We are not ready to give any opportunity for the US, France or Britain to attack us. We are defending ourselves. We are not attacking British interests. We are not a threat to the national security of the US or France or Britain. This is our right to defend our state. We are combatting terrorists, we are not combatting democratic people. Who left Eastern Gouta? They are terrorists from Jaish al-Islam the Wahhabi movement.” Thousands of Islamist fighters and their relatives left Douma as the last evacuations from Eastern Ghouta continued, AFP reports citing the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The fighters from the Jaish al-Islam group left overnight with thousands of civilians on board 85 buses that took them to areas of northern Syria still held by rebels. The evacuations are part of a deal brokered by Damascus’s Russian ally to re-establish regime control on Eastern Ghouta, a area just on the edge of the capital that had escaped government control since 2012. “After midnight, 85 buses left Eastern Ghouta carrying 4,000 people, both fighters and civilians,” the SOHR. “Over the past few days, most of the Jaish al-Islam fighters have left Douma in four successive waves,” the Britain-based monitor’s head, Rami Abdel Rahman, said. The group was the last in the erstwhile besieged Ghouta enclave to resist the exit proposed by Russia but an alleged chemical attack by the regime on 7 April appeared to break their will. The government has consistently denied the attack and a delegation of experts from the OPCW chemical watchdog arrived in Damascus to investigate. They are expected to start their work on Saturday. “The evacuation operation should wrap up before the OPCW experts enter Douma,” Abdel Rahman said. Russia’s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich has said international relations should not depend on the mood of one person when he wakes up in the morning, according Russian news agency reports cited by Reuters. In an early-morning tweet on Wednesday, Trump warned that missiles “will be coming” in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack by Syrian government forces. Russia is Syria’s most important military ally in the country’s civil war. “We cannot depend on the mood of someone on the other side of the ocean when he wakes up, on what a specific person takes into his head in the morning,” Dvorkovich said at a forum in Krasnoyarsk, according to the Tass news agency. “We cannot take such risks.” In another tweet on Thursday, Trump appeared to cast doubt on at least the timing of any US-led military action. “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!” it said. Trump usually starts tweeting in the next hour or so. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah does not believe the latest Syria crisis will spiral into a wider war, its deputy leader has said, Reuters reports. The heavily armed Shia Hezbollah movement has been a vital military ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the seven-year war. “We rule out the situation developing into a direct American-Russian clash or a wide state of war,” Sheikh Naim Qassem told Lebanese daily al-Joumhouria in an interview. “The conditions do not point to a total war happening ... unless (U.S. President Donald) Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu completely lose their minds,” he said. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogăn has warned Russia and the US against treating the Syrian conflict as a proxy war. “No one has the right to engulf the Mediterranean and the Syrian lands in the fire of their political and military power struggles,” he said at speech in Ankara. Erdogăn has discussed his concerns about Syria in separate phone calls with both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in the last 48 hours. In his speech he said: “We are extremely uncomfortable about the fact that some countries who have confidence on their military power are using Syria as their arm-wrestling field.” He claimed that the international community had used the fight against Islamic state (or Daesh) to support Kurdish separatists. He said: “We see even a single terrorist, whether it be from Daesh or PYD (the Kurdish Democratic Union Party) or under any other name, along our borders as a threat to us and consider it a condition for our survival to do what is necessary.” “Our relations with Russia, Iran and China are complementary to our relations with the West, not an alternative. Yet, this is not an obstacle to us expressing the wrongs of the two sides in other fields. Those who support the murderous Assad regime are wrong. Those who support the PYD terror are wrong. We will fight against both of these wrongs to the end.” France’s foreign ministry has produced a video, translated into English, setting out why it thinks France has a duty to react to the use of chemical weapons in Syria. It also repeats President Emmanuel Macron’s claim in a TV interview on Thursday that France has proof that the Assad regime used chemical weapons in Douma. Such simple and short videos, tailored for social media, are all the rage in modern diplomacy. Here’s the Foreign Office’s take on the OPCW’s report into the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has been tracking reports of military movements of Russia and Syria since last weekend’s chemical attack on Douma. It has this summary: Two Russian Su-24M ‘Fencer’ attack aircraft conducted several low-altitude passes in close proximity to the USS Donald Cook and the French frigate Aquitaine in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea on April 11. The Russian Navy conducted a firing drilloff the Syrian coast in a likely attempt to deter U.S. and allied naval maneuvers near Syria on April 11. Russia reportedly deployed four Tu-95MS ‘Bear’ and Tu-160M ‘Blackjack’ strategic bombers as well as an unspecified number of Il-78M tanker aircraft from the Engels Air Base in Southern Russia. Their final destination is unknown although they may be bound for Syria or theHamedan Air Basein Western Iran. Russia previously targeted locations in Eastern Syria from the Engels Air Base. Russian and regime forces enhanced the air defenses around Syria’s capital, Damascus, where the regime conducted its chemical weapons attack on April 7. Pro-regime forces deployed short- to medium-range surface-to-air missiles, including six Russian Pantsir-S2s, to theMezzeh Military Air Baseand other sites in Damascus. Pro-regime officials also reportedly issued an alert to the Syrian Arab Army to evacuate personnel and assets from military bases across Syria. Regime and Russian aircraft relocatedcloser to heavily-defended commercial airfields across Syria. Aircraft relocated from the Seen (Sayqal), Dumayr, Shayrat, and the T-4 (Tiyas) Air Bases to the Bassel al Assad International Airport in Latakia Province, the Nayrab Air Base outside Aleppo City, and the Damascus International Airport. Iranian proxies, including Lebanese Hezbollah, reportedly began exiting Syria. Hezbollah reportedly relocated a number of fighters from Syria into Lebanon. Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies reportedly also entered Iraq from positions along the Syria-Iraq border, including Abu Kamal in Eastern Syria. Unspecified pro-regime elements reportedly evacuated a branch of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) in Jamraya near Damascus. The SSRC is a Syrian government body responsible for research and development on advanced weapons systems, including ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. Russia’s Black Sea fleet is in closer proximity to the Syrian coast than US forces amid reports that the fleet has been on a heightened level of alert since at least mid-March, writes Peter Beaumont. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has struggled to defend Labour’s call for a UN-led inspection into the Douma attack. Asked on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether Labour would back intervention if the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons confirms chemical weapons had been used she said: “Let’s see what the inspectors come up with. Even in the US there is an understanding that we don’t have all the evidence.” When it was pointed out that Russia had repeatedly vetoed calls for a UN-led investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Abbott said: “There has to be a political negotiation. We would press on trying to bring people to the table. We believe more bombing is not the answer to the crisis in Syria.” “There is a response which falls short of more bombing. We believe there needs to be a coordinated international drive to achieve a ceasefire and a negotiated political settlement.” Asked about the circumstances in which Labour would support military action, Abbott cited the Second World War. But she repeatedly refused to say what circumstances she would back military action now. “There is no evidence to show that further bombing in Syria will make the region more stable,” she said. She was also asked which country posed the biggest threat to world peace: Russia or the US. After trying to avoid the question she eventually said: “It is clear that at this point Russia, its role in Syria, what we believe beyond reasonable doubt its role in the poison gas attack in Salisbury, is a greater threat to world peace than the United States.” A split in the shadow cabinet over military action in Syria has emerged. Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor told the House magazine that “intervention must take place” if the UN concludes the Syrian government was behind the alleged atrocity. Politics Home reports her saying: “If a leader is killing their own they need to be removed. We don’t keep them there. They need to go. He needs to be removed. “Intervention must take place if evidence comes back that the PM or the president or whoever the leader is, is gassing his own people. Get them out. “If a leader is killing their own they need to be removed. We don’t keep them there. They need to go. He needs to be removed.” “But I suppose what we’ve seen is it’s not as easy as that. And I think that’s where Jeremy’s position comes from. It’s not as easy as just removing someone.” Update: Osamar has since clarified her remarks to claim she is not advocating military action in Syria. There are growing calls for the government to give parliament a vote before launching any military intervention in Syria. A Downing Street statement issued after Thursday’s cabinet meeting made no reference to whether MPs should be given a say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP in Westminster have both urged May to give MPs a vote. Ken Clarke, former chancellor and father of the House of Commons, said parliament should be recalled this weekend. “You don’t just waive aside accountability to parliament because it is inconvenient. Saturday or Sunday you could sit,” he told the BBC. In a letter to May, SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said: I am not convinced that the retaliatory airstrikes being proposed by the United States is a proper way forward. Though should the UK government wish to participate then it must only do so if the UK parliament gives its consent. This is a view shared by a cross-party group of MPs who have signed EDM 92 to that effect, and a number of your own colleagues who have put forward this view in the media these past few days. Despite Donald Trump’s slightly more circumspect rhetoric over Syria on Thursday it is hard to escape the drum beat for military intervention. The Times claims the largest US air and naval strike force since the 2003 Iraq war is heading towards Syria. Last night the UK cabinet unanimously backed Theresa May’s warning that Syria’s use of chemical weapons could not go unchallenged, leaving the way open for British participation in military action. Downing Street said senior ministers had agreed it was highly likely the Syrian government was responsible for the “shocking and barbaric” gas attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, which killed up to 75 people. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of “waiting for instructions” from Donald Trump adding that military intervention risks “escalating an already devastating conflict”. In a statement issue early on Friday morning he called for a UN-led investigation of the chemical weapons attack in Douma. Corbyn added: “Further UK military intervention in Syria’s appalling multi-sided war risks escalating an already devastating conflict. “The Government appears to be waiting for instructions from President Donald Trump on how to proceed. But the US administration is giving alarmingly contradictory signals. “Even US defence secretary James Mattis has said we ‘don’t have evidence’ and warned further military action could ‘escalate out of control’.” Meanwhile, Russia has been granted a request for the United Nations Security Council to meet on Friday for fresh discussions on the threat to international peace from air strikes on Syria. And a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is due to start its investigation in Syria on Saturday. On Friday campaigners from the Stop the War Coalition will hand in a letter signed by MPs, trade unionists, celebrities and academics to Downing Street urging May to not take military action in Syria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/13/tom-daley-speaks-out-on-anti-gay-laws-in-commonwealth-nations-after-winning-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T06:26:55Z","webTitle":"Tom Daley speaks out on anti-gay laws in Commonwealth nations after winning gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/13/tom-daley-speaks-out-on-anti-gay-laws-in-commonwealth-nations-after-winning-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/13/tom-daley-speaks-out-on-anti-gay-laws-in-commonwealth-nations-after-winning-gold","fields":{"headline":"Tom Daley speaks out on anti-gay laws in Commonwealth nations after winning gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tom Daley won gold in the 10m synchronised event with Dan Goodfellow and then used the platform to strongly condemn anti-gay laws in 37 Commonwealth countries. The English pair just managed to hold on for victory over their compatriots Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams after a wayward final dive. It is a fourth Commonwealth title for Daley who won his first in Delhi in 2010 when he was just 15. Now 23, much has changed in Daley’s personal life, including his marriage to screenwriter Dustin Lance-Black. The couple announced in February they are expecting a baby but Daley said he still finds it difficult to compete in countries where homosexuality is illegal. He spoke of his hope that by the time of the next Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022 the attitude towards gay relationships in some of the competing nations would have improved. “There are 37 countries where it’s illegal to be who I am out of all the Commonwealth so hopefully we can reduce that number between now and then,” he said. “Coming to the Gold Coast and being able to live as an openly gay man is really important in being able to feel comfortable with who you are when standing on that diving board. For 37 countries that are here participating that’s very much not the case.” Daley, who pulled out of the 10m individual event because of a hip injury, is due to compete at the World Diving Series in Kazan, Russia in May. While homosexuality is not outlawed in the country Daley said he was fearful of being abused but that it would not prevent him from travelling there as he has done several times before. “Going to Russia can be scary because you’ve got to compete in front of lots of people and lots of people know that I’ve got a husband,” he said. “I think you’ve got to face those things and try and make change. There’s lots of things that will take a long time to change but I feel like with the Commonwealth I think we could really help push some of the nations to relax their laws on anti-gay stuff.” Daley and Goodfellow, who are Olympic bronze medallists in the 10m synchronised, took the Commonwealth title with 405.81 points, narrowly ahead of Dixon,and Williams, who scored 399.99. Goodfellow, 21, said: “I dropped my sixth dive which is normally my best dive. Tom’s been struggling with it in training but it’s me that dropped it. I thought the boys were going to do it. They’re amazing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/16/hi-kids-meet-bob-hes-in-the-live-export-industry-and-tortures-sheep-for-a-living","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T02:49:41Z","webTitle":"Hi kids, meet Bob - he's in the live export industry and tortures sheep for a living  | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/hi-kids-meet-bob-hes-in-the-live-export-industry-and-tortures-sheep-for-a-living","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/hi-kids-meet-bob-hes-in-the-live-export-industry-and-tortures-sheep-for-a-living","fields":{"headline":"Hi kids, meet Bob – he's in the live export industry and tortures sheep for a living","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/15/states-not-recording-complaints-made-about-school-chaplains","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T23:41:38Z","webTitle":"States not recording complaints made about school chaplains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/states-not-recording-complaints-made-about-school-chaplains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/states-not-recording-complaints-made-about-school-chaplains","fields":{"headline":"States not recording complaints made about school chaplains","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal and several state governments have stopped counting complaints against the school chaplains program and no states keep records of the faith of those providing pastoral care. Since the federal government handed responsibility to the states for administering the program in 2015 after a high court challenge, several states including New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have not centrally recorded complaints against it. The Turnbull government is expected to extend funding for the program in the 2018 budget, after a group of MPs including Luke Howarth lobbied for it, despite the fact the federal education department has lost oversight and does not record complaints against the program. The program is controversial because in 2014 the Abbott government specified that chaplains could not be secular social workers and must be ordained religious people. Although chaplains are not allowed to proselytise, nothing prevents them speaking about their faith and some religious organisations such as the Anglican church of Noosa openly acknowledge that chaplains refer students and their families to church. Before 2015, complaints against the chaplains program were reported in Senate estimates, along with the breakdown of the faiths of the pastoral care workers. But the high court ruled in 2014 that the commonwealth could not fund the program directly, which meant the commonwealth instead provided grants to state and territory governments to administer it. But after states gained responsibility in 2015, education departments adopted different approaches, with Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory recording complaints centrally and others imposing no such requirement on schools. A spokesman for the NSW education department said the department encouraged parents and students to raise issues locally “where they can be resolved by someone who has sufficient knowledge and authority to decide what should happen as a result of the complaint”. “Any records relating to these complaints are generally held locally and the department does not have a mechanism to report on the total number of complaints made in relation to the program in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017,” he said. Western Australia and Queensland also do not centrally record complaints. A spokesman from the Queensland education department said complaints were “addressed with priority at the local level”. A spokeswoman for the Tasmanian education department said its guidelines suggested parents and students raised complaints at the school level. She said the department had received two complaints in 2016 but there was “no clear evidence of a breach of any agreement or guidelines” and no other complaints had been made since 2014. Spokespeople for the education departments in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory said that no formal complaints had been recorded by the department against the chaplains program since 2014. Federal education minister Simon Birmingham said that the high court had determined that state governments are responsible for running the chaplains program and states were “best placed to ensure it’s being delivered effectively in their jurisdiction”. States and territories are not required to record the faiths of chaplains, and none were able to provide a breakdown. In 2015 federal education department officials told Senate estimates that in the previous year, 2,312 of the program’s 2,336 chaplains were Christian. The rest were adherents of Islam (13), Judaism (8), and there was one each from Bahai, Buddhism and Aboriginal traditional religions. A spokeswoman for the Western Australian education department said the program was voluntary and “the nature of chaplaincy services, where provided, is decided by each school and its community”. In March a group of secular societies wrote to the Australian Human Rights Commission seeking a review of the chaplains program on the basis it may harm freedom of religion because non-religious people cannot be hired for the roles. In a 2015 consultation report the commission reported that complaints had been raised about the chaplains program at almost all of its public meetings. It said while the program varied between schools, many people raised the “implications of government paying religious organisations to provide chaplaincy services in public schools that would otherwise be provided free at a place of worship”. The commission’s president, Rosalind Croucher, who is also sitting on Philip Ruddock’s religious freedom review panel, told Guardian Australia it did not propose to conduct an inquiry into the chaplains program. “We are hopeful that the religious freedom review might be a catalyst for more discussion of the issue,” she said. “The commission exercises its inquiry function sparingly and within the limits of its available resources.” Guardian Australia understands that Labor is likely to retain the chaplains program but return the ability to hire non-religious people to provide pastoral care, as was allowed under the last Labor government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/12/tesla-media-strategy-discrimination-car-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T21:37:27Z","webTitle":"Tesla email reveals company’s effort to silence an alleged victim with cash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/tesla-media-strategy-discrimination-car-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/12/tesla-media-strategy-discrimination-car-crash","fields":{"headline":"Tesla email reveals company’s effort to silence an alleged victim with cash","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tesla had a clear message to DeWitt Lambert, a black employee alleging racial discrimination: take our money and stay quiet. “In terms of settlement, we are willing to pay Mr. Lambert [redacted], but only if we are to resolve this matter before there is media attention, preferably within the next few hours,” the Tesla general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote to the worker’s lawyers last year. “If there is media attention first, there will be no deal.” The message, which a lawyer shared with the Guardian this week, provides a stark illustration of what some say is Tesla’s aggressive legal and media strategy in the face of serious complaints and potential negative press. The controversial PR tactics of Elon Musk’s car company have been on full display this week as the corporation has worked to publicly blame the victim of a fatal crash involving its autonomous technology. In the three weeks since the death of Walter Huang, 38, whose Tesla Model X crashed while in Autopilot mode in California, the company has repeatedly argued that the victim was at fault, not its nascent technology, and it has openly feuded with US investigators about the release of information. The defensive statements amid the current tragedy and the settlement offer in Lambert’s labor dispute provide a window into the way Musk’s firm has tried to silence critics – or publicly attack them. It’s a familiar approach in Silicon Valley, where companies work to block bad publicity by keeping complaints out of court and resolving high-profile disputes behind closed doors. But some say the tactics are particularly intense at Tesla, a firm that often receives fawning coverage from the tech press surrounding Musk’s ambitious projects and celebrity status. Lambert, an electrician hired as a production associate in 2015, alleged in a harassment, retaliation and discrimination lawsuit that he was subject to “repeated racist epithets for months”, including “violent” rhetoric and attacks using the N-word. Last year, Tesla emphatically denied the claims in lengthy statements that sought to cast doubts on Lambert’s character and alleged that his lawyer was engaged in a “media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous narrative”. Lambert’s attorney, Larry Organ, who has faced repeated criticisms from Tesla surrounding his civil rights litigation, shared the attorney’s settlement email with the Guardian as an example of the corporation’s efforts to stop bad press and silence workers with complaints. The March 2017 email from Maron said if Lambert rejected the settlement and spoke out, “we will of course point out all of the facts in the attached document”. The document, according to Organ, attacked Lambert’s character. Organ further said Tesla had offered to have Musk meet Lambert as part of a settlement. “Tesla is a big corporation, and they feel like they can bully people,” Organ said in an interview. “And shut them up with money,” added Navruz Avloni, another attorney representing Lambert. A Tesla spokesperson did not deny the contents of the email, but alleged that Maron was responding to a “breathtaking” demand for money and threat to go public with a story. The company initially refused to provide a statement, but after publication of this story, a spokesperson said in an email: “The characterization of this email exchange is misleading.” He added that Organ’s “demand” was “beyond extreme and totally unwarranted given the facts of the case, and amounted to extortion, so our general counsel instead proposed a resolution that would actually be fair”. Organ told the Guardian the offer they discussed was just under $1m: “It seems to me they put a fairly low value on stealing a man’s dignity.” There are numerous examples of highly combative PR and legal strategies by Tesla in the wake of scandal. This week, attorneys for Huang’s family alleged that Tesla’s Autopilot feature was “defective” and “likely caused Huang’s death” when the car collided into a median. Tesla, however, said it was Huang’s fault: “The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.” Tesla’s statement expressed condolences to the relatives, who gave a television interview about their grief. But the company also said: “The reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.” On Thursday, Tesla also went after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a US agency that accused the company of improperly releasing information about the crash investigation. “It’s been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they’re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety,” Tesla said in a statement announcing it would make an “official complaint to Congress”. Tesla has previously attacked the media in response to reporting on discrimination claims. After a female engineer shared her allegations of harassment with the Guardian, Tesla issued lengthy statements criticizing the woman and ultimately fired her, accusing her of pursuing a “miscarriage of justice”. Tesla has also vehemently denied her underlying claims. Musk has also been personally defensive about claims that his factory is unsafe for workers. After the first fatal crash involving Autopilot in 2016 – when Tesla’s technology did not prevent a car from colliding with a large white truck – the company defended its product. The family of that victim, Joshua Brown, eventually released a statement that said “Joshua loved his Tesla” and that the car was not at fault. Paul Grieco, an attorney for Brown family, said this week he couldn’t comment on whether Tesla paid money or had relatives sign any kind of confidentiality agreement. Tesla also declined to comment. “The parties were able to resolve their disputes amicably,” Grieco said, later adding: “I cannot comment on any of the settlement terms.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/14/the-generation-gap-is-back-but-not-as-we-know-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T23:47:33Z","webTitle":"The generation gap is back – but not as we know it | Brigid Delaney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/14/the-generation-gap-is-back-but-not-as-we-know-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/14/the-generation-gap-is-back-but-not-as-we-know-it","fields":{"headline":"The generation gap is back – but not as we know it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For a while there, in the first part of the new millennium, the generation gap was pretty much assumed to be dead. People in their 40s shopped in the same clothing stores as people in their 20s, and listened to the same sort of music. If you were on the left, you all cheered for Obama, and everyone from those in university dorms to the corner office had the Shepard Fairey posters of HOPE, and all ages were engaged in common political struggles (No invasion of Iraq! No blood for oil!). You’d go to a Bloc Party concert and there’d be a finance dude there in his 40s wearing the same Urban Outfitters jeans as the kid in their 20s, and at dinner parties people in their 30s were taking MDMA, and everyone from the 19-year-olds to those high 37-year-olds leaving the dinner parties would end up at the same late-night bars. According to an article on the merging of generations in 2006 in New York Magazine: “This, of course, is a seismic shift in intergenerational relationships. It means there is no fundamental generation gap anymore. This is unprecedented in human history. And it’s kind of weird.” For the younger generation, how to rebel? How to mark yourself as different? Did age even mean anything anyway? It’s 2018, and if you were a five-year-old in 2006, being rocked to sleep by your hipster dad singing you Arctic Monkeys, then you’d be 17 now. The same age as the Parkland kids – who many are characterising as a “new generation” (this label has been applied to the Parkland kids by outlets including the New Yorker, the New Republic, Christian Science Monitor and Salon). Those who are a couple of years older are entering workplaces and colleges – and you know what? There is a generation gap – just not in the way that we imagined it. It’s not about style. It’s not about about taste in music (“Turn down that racket!”). It’s about language and battles over inclusivity, diversity and power structures. And it’s a whole lot more complicated and confusing than the generation gaps of yore – where the olds were horrified at the Beatles and their long hair. A new conflict? Boots on the ground – what does the new generational conflict look like? Inside the newsroom at the New York Times there is an ideological conflict brewing between the old guard and the “new woke” employees. An article published last week in Vanity Fair titled “Journalism is not about creating safe spaces’: Inside the woke civil war at the New York Times” illustrates the tensions. In the newsroom, the battle lines are being drawn around older hands who believe in reporting a diverse range of views (including those that the left may find offensive), and who think that the reporting of the Trump presidency should be fairly straight down the line. The younger generation were appalled at the 2016 election results and have expressed grievance at the Times hiring for their opinion pages one writer who has expressed scepticism about climate science and a millennial who supports campus free speech. Other grievances within the newsroom that Vanity Fair reports as being split along generational lines include reaction to a reporter being allowed to return to work (in a demoted capacity) after being accused of sexual harassment and the managing editor, Dean Baquet, appearing at the same FT conference as Steve Bannon. According to the Vanity Fair piece “as at many newsrooms and media offices, and in the culture at large, this is a moment of generational conflict not seen since the 1960s”. In Australia this conflict includes debates around who gets to tell what stories. For example – whether a fiction author has the right to depict an experience that is not her own (so a white Australian woman writing the experiences of a queer Indigenous man). This issue came to a head at the 2016 Brisbane writers festival – where the novelist Lionel Shriver gave the keynote address and argued that novelists should be free to to write from the point of view of characters from other cultural backgrounds. In the audience was the writer and engineer Yassmin Abdel-Magied, who found the speech offensive and walked out. She later wrote for Guardian Australia on the experience: “It’s not always OK if a white guy writes the story of a Nigerian woman because the actual Nigerian woman can’t get published or reviewed to begin with. “It’s not always OK if a straight white woman writes the story of a queer Indigenous man, because when was the last time you heard a queer Indigenous man tell his own story? “How is it that said straight white woman will profit from an experience that is not hers, and those with the actual experience never be provided the opportunity?” Or it shows up in a reconsideration of the work of Chris Lilley – once a Gen X icon for Summer Heights High and We Can Be Heroes, but now being chastised and on the nose for depictions of characters such as Jonah from Tonga. The show did not go down too well with critics in the US and UK – with the Huffington Post describing Lilley as “a 39-year-old white guy in a permed wig and brownface. Yes, brownface. In 2014.” Yet when when Summer Heights High first aired in 2007, the brownface went largely unremarked upon. This week it’s The Simpsons that has come under fire for its flip response to anger over the depiction of the long-running Indian character Apu (Lisa says “Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?”) Identity politics and the generation gap Part of this gap between young and old is the rise and mainstreaming of identity politics and intersectionality, a theory originating in black feminism, that calls out identity-based oppression. This theory, around since the late 1980s and 90s and used to describe interlocking and structural systems of power, was coined in 1989 by the academic Kimberlé Crenshaw. It is used to describe, in Crenshaw’s words, the “multiple avenues through which racial and gender oppression were experienced.” So how a black hotel cleaner might experience workplace discrimination is different from how a white, upper-class lawyer might experience it – because other forces of oppression are also at work other than gender discrimination. Intersectionality was once a notion confined to the campus – its concerns did not reach the editorial conference room in the newspaper, in the programming of a music or writers festival, or the writers room of a TV sitcom. But in recent years it has jumped off the page and into real-life discussions about Me Too and Black Lives Matter, for example. Back in 2006 – when the generation gap was pronounced deceased by New York magazine (and a year before Jonah from Tonga was shown on Australian television to an accepting public) – words associated with this movement such as no-platforming, the use of “a violence” as a verb, and woke as an adjective, microaggression, and cisgender heterosexual either did not exist, or had not entered the mainstream. The woke generation (young millennials aged between 18 and 30) brought the theories of intersectionality and identity into debates about a range of human rights issues: campus free speech, trans rights, the Me Too movement, marriage equality, gun control, reproductive rights, Black Lives matter and, in Australia, the Change the Date movement. This new way of looking at the world has resulted in a golden age of protest, dissent and pushing back against societal norms. Marches in the US – such as the women’s march and the one for gun control – have smashed attendance records, while in Australia, the Invasion Day march surpassed all expectations of crowd size. The landscape has shifted dramatically in the past few years, and older people (on the left and right) have found that they have been tripped up and called out by their more woke colleagues or friends or Twitter followers. (The Wall Street Journal, in a piece this week, somewhat gleefully predicted it would be those who policed “wokeness” who would destroy the left). Left-leaning Gen Xer’s thought that by listening to Rihanna, skateboarding to work and going to Coachella, they could defeat the generation gap. Now they are grappling with the idea that they may be causing offence – sometimes inadvertently – through a tweeted microaggression or an offensive Halloween costume or sombrero worn at a tequila party or a positive comment about Bill Leak’s legacy or personality on Twitter after he died. The response – at least online – is punitive if offence is caused. According to the piece in New Yorker on the new campus politics – it’s “flummoxed many people who had always thought of themselves as devout liberals. Wasn’t free self-expression the whole point of social progressivism?” This is a generation gap – it’s just unlike any other we have seen before.

Selena. Freakin’. Gomez. Of course, she’s not the only one. In 2017, the UK’s Royal Society for Public Health released a survey of 1,479 young people analysed on their attitudes to social media and found that Instagram, where personal photos take centre stage, received the worst scores for body image and anxiety. “Instagram easily makes girls and women feel as if their bodies aren’t good enough,” admitted a respondent. But blaming social media for women’s poor body image is easy. Harder to face is that Instagram is just the latest platform for the insidious syndrome of relentless body-hating our culture encourages in women. On this subject, a Glosswitch piece in the New Statesman exhorted feminists to remember the analysis in older tracts like Susie Orbach’s Fat is a Feminist Issue and Naomi Wolf’s The Beauty Myth, that “oppression was structural and bodies were real.” “Once upon a time, we may have been angry about this,” she despaired. Is feminism failing in the fight for the female body? The $160bn global beauty industry is growing at up to 7% a year, more than twice the rate of the developed world’s GDP. My own belief is that it’s hard to escape a cage with a shape that keeps changing. Feminism may have accepted Naomi Wolf’s 1990 dictum that “dieting is the most potent political sedative in women’s history” but in 2018 #cleaneating” and #fitspo don’t admit to being diet cults, even 37m or 54m Instagram posts later. In her latest book, Natural Causes, Barbara Ehrenrich criticises the recent paradigm shift in which “now, health is indistinguishable from virtue”. The last decade has witnessed the emergence of orthorexia – an eating disorder in which a fixation for “healthy eating” is what causes one harm. However the propaganda message redesigns itself, we can’t – we must not – abandon a feminist imperative to own our bodies as sites of our unconditional love. It’s an activist mission that’s inspired Grace Ritter to declare “Weigh Free May”. The 24-year-old student from Perth is now in recovery from an eating disorder that dominated her life for 10 years. She’s created a website and Facebook group, encouraging others to let go of obsessive, aesthetic self-assessment for just one month. Her campaign requires no donation, there are no events beyond your own commitment: “I just wanted to start up a way to get people talking and thinking about ways they could be valuable and things they could do,” she says, “that weren’t about shrinking themselves.” Grace, I am so in. And in the belief that bodily comfort is a feminist act, I’d thought I’d share my own super scientific recommendations for simple ways to celebrate your body in a weigh-free May. My eight feminist ways to love your body again Take an Epsom salt bath. You can buy box of magnesium crystals for about five bucks (£2.50) in the supermarket, and poured into a bathtub of warm water they make a sound like fairy magic. The Epsom Salt Council claims the magical properties of a long soak include relaxing muscles, nursing bruises, softening skin and relieving irritations like sunburn. At the very least, you can relax in the tub safe in the knowledge that somewhere in the world there’s an Epsom Salt Council. Wear comfy slippers. A fancy pair of slippers not only make your feet feel like kissed princesses, they also decrease your risk of catching colds and flu by keeping you warm. Changing into slippers stops you from traipsing gross germs from outside to inside, keeps your carpets cleaner, reduces risk of foot infections, prolongs the life of your socks, prevents floorbound slips, and makes you more productive. Relaxed workers – as it turns out – get more work done. Cuddle a puppy. Puppies are fluffy bombs of love and adoration that keep you warm and cosy and live for your physical presence. They’re also powerful chemical weapons that activate oxytocin in the brain, reducing bodily stress, improving the immune system and lessening the impact of pain. Enjoy casual sex. Researchers from NYU and Cornell University concluded that “if you want to have casual sex, you definitely should” as doing so lowers stress and raises overall emotional wellbeing. Only when people bring their hangups to hookups do they become problematic. And there’s a really easy way not to get emotionally hung up on a sex partner. Have a shower and leave, deleting their number on the way out. What you experienced can live on forever in your own smug smile. Share a cake. Cake is delicious. And according to researcher Penny Wilson from ANU, the consumption of cake also connects us to its social role as “a symbol of joy and celebration; the conveyor of history, culture and tradition; as a token of love, belonging and social occasion”. These are lovely feelings to share with another person. So get someone over and have another piece. Get around in bamboo underpants. They’re so soft! They’re made from sustainable material! They hug your bum like a baby blanket all day and – even better – discourage the proliferation of vaginal thrush. No, they do not resemble any costume of a Vegas showgirl but, girls, anyone who kicks you out of bed for being comfortable is not gonna provide you much comfort in bed. Have a cup of tea. Sure, tea reduces risk of heart attack and stroke, may help protect your bones, can alleviate depressive symptoms and studies suggest it can diminish cancer-risk, but the main reason to have a tea is that it’s tasty. Its dreamy flavours and perfumes are transportive. If you brew a quality teabag of black tea in boiling water for no less than three minutes, no more than five, remove the bag and add milk to taste, take a deep sniff and sip ... hating anything is really hard. And, remember, Celeste Barber is good for you. If ever there was an antidote for the body hating blues, it would have to be the Australian comedian. Her legendary Instagram account doesn’t only mock the falsity of Instaperfection, but inspires a vision of female experience in every way superior for a failure to live up to it. Because we can starve ourselves, measure our pieces, work ourselves into the metal of the gym-machines, suck in our cheeks and become obsessed with our own shame for doing so. But maybe May is a good month to put on our slippers, get comfortable, watch Celeste and observe that eating chips off the floor, dancing around in your pants and spraying yourself in the face with a hose really does look a lot more like fun.

Pesto, which is traditionally made from basil, pine nuts, parmesan, olive oil – and sometimes lemon juice and garlic – has become a staple food in the UK. However, a Which? investigation into pesto sold by Asda, Co-op, M&amp;S, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose found that supermarket own-labels used cashew nuts instead of pine nuts, sunflower oil instead of olive oil and cheaper grana padano cheese instead of parmesan to cut costs. The analysis found the most authentic and traditional pestos on sale were the Asda Extra Special Genovese Basil Pesto, costing £1.39, and the Waitrose 1 Pesto alla Genovese, priced at £2.70. All standard supermarket pestos, with the exception of Waitrose, used thickeners such as potato flakes, bamboo fibres and nut flour; Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Co-op recipes also contained sugar, while Tesco lists water as an ingredient of its standard pesto. Premium pesto recipes, advertised as “pesto alla Genovese”, must contain the traditional quartet of basil, olive oil, pine nuts and parmesan, but some supermarkets added extra ingredients: sugar, vegetable fibres and bamboo were all added to Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco Pesto alla Genovese recipes. Nikki Stopford, director of research at Which?, said: “Pesto has become a staple food in the UK but our research shows that many shoppers may be getting more than they bargain for when it comes to the pesto they are buying – and not necessarily in a good way. “Our advice is not to assume that all pesto contains the same traditional ingredients.

On the left, the pernicious effects of neo-liberal economics has been denounced, while on the right, liberalism’s cosmopolitanism, which has no apparent regard for nation, religion or family, has been decried. The left’s answer has been to demand more social democracy to combat galloping inequality, while the right has called for the return to traditional values, anchored in the “community”. American conservatives, especially among the country’s powerful Catholic minority (which includes six of the nine supreme court justices), have found a new champion for their cause in the Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen. His latest book, Why Liberalism Failed, has been critically acclaimed throughout the conservative press, with the prominent Harvard legal scholar Adrian Vermeule, himself a recent convert to Catholicism, declaring it a “triumph”. Rising inequality, the degradation of the environment, decreasing living standards, increasing loneliness, the destructive polarisation of our political world – Deneen blames liberalism for all the ills currently afflicting society. Surprisingly, he does not attribute these ills to the failures of liberalism, but to its success. Like many conservatives, Deneen sees liberalism not simply as a theory about how to conduct politics, but as an all-encompassing ideology, like fascism and communism, that extends to philosophy, society and the economy. And it is an ideology that has won – which is why, in Deneen’s view, everything that is wrong with the world can be blamed on it. If liberalism is the cause of all our troubles, then the answer, according to Deneen, is to get rid of it altogether. To make this argument work, Deneen lumps together all the various ideas and movements that have been associated with the term “liberalism”, whether they are compatible or not – from classical “check-and-balances” liberalism to New Deal progressivism, from neo-liberal economics to liberal identity politics. What ultimately unites all these strands, in Deneen’s eyes, is rampant individualism, which has been a bugbear for conservatives dating back to the French revolution. Instead of individualism, Deneen says the future lies with radically decentralised, local communities where the true meaning of culture might be found again. By culture, he means “a set of generational customs, practices, and rituals that are grounded in local and particular settings”. Deneen never spells out exactly what these local communities might look like, but it’s clear that what he wants, in reality, is a return to “updated Benedictine forms” of Catholic monastic communities. Like many who share his worldview, Deneen believes that if people returned to such communities they would get back on a moral path that includes the rejection of gay marriage and premarital sex, two of Deneen’s pet peeves. The call for such a return is anti-democratic, and doubly so. First, Deneen believes political decisions should not emanate from within the community itself – the democratic ideal of self-government – but from an outside source, namely God (and a Catholic God at that). Second, Deneen believes the Catholic community has a privileged access to the truth that the rest of the political community – which has already made up its mind on gay marriage and premarital sex – does not. From this perspective, the national community is wrong, and democracy is mistaken. This gets at a broader problem with the sort of critique that Deneen and other conservatives level at liberals. They seem to believe the communities and cultures that liberals share somehow don’t count. Between their museums, concert halls, universities and coffee houses, liberals also have their customs, practices and rituals grounded in particular settings. These “settings” might be found across the globe, much to the distaste of conservatives, but that is not to deny their existence. So it is not that liberals don’t have their own cultural communities, it is that they have communities Deneen doesn’t like. Tellingly, one liberal tradition that Deneen fails to mention is pluralism, which many liberals still recognise themselves in today. Pluralism holds that there are numerous competing and irreducible worldviews, and that the goal of politics is to find a way to make them work together. It is that pluralist project – building bridges between different communities – that is in most urgent need of rediscovery.

Although the same Victrix bolt-action rifle is marketed in the US as suitable for uses including “military” and “law enforcement”, in Australia the Victrix (and similar weapons) are categorised with firearms licensed for hunting and sport. Gun control advocates have dubbed the Victrix guns “high-powered and military-style”. They warn that an increasing range of these guns – which still have design specifications that allow them to be classified as sporting and hunting firearms – have hit the Australian market. Gun Control Australia has called for a rewrite of weapons classifications, which the group says are outdated and do not properly codify modern hi-tech guns. The group’s chair, Sam Lee, has pointed to several examples of category A and B weapons (those licensed for hunting and sport) that come with a box magazine that can be easily modified to increase capacity. She said several weapons manufacturers were pushing models that had the base specifications of hunting or sports-shooting rifles, but with trimmings and capabilities that made them much more dangerous. “They’re importing these firearms at very swift rates,” Lee said. “The category A and B were generally for single-shot and double-shot rifles and shotguns. The categorisation was set up in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre. That’s 22 years ago and that hasn’t kept up with advances in technology. “Gun manufacturers are obviously pushing the boundaries of those categories.” Luca Scribani Rossi, a former Olympic shooting medalist and the managing director of Beretta Australia, which markets the Victrix range, said weapons companies did research and development to improve products, like other industries. “That’s the nature of the game,” he said. “As long as it complies with the law, then I cannot see the argument. “The way I see it is that in Australia we have gun laws and they’re probably the strictest around the world. Any modification that takes [a gun’s] magazine beyond [limits set out in firearms categories] is illegal. If people break the laws they become an offender and they need to be dealt with. That’s not an industry or a manufacturer problem.” Rossi said the Victrix bolt-action rifle was designed for long-range target shooting. When asked about advertisements that listed “military” and “law enforcement” as suitable uses, he said long-range rifles were used for “exactly the same sort of shooting” as military snipers. “I think the firearm industry is the only industry in Australia that is dealt with on emotion, rather than on facts,” he said. “When there are people speeding or drink driving, I’ve never heard calls for a ban on cars that go more than 110km/h.” The Shooting Industry Foundation Australia said the categorisation of weapons was by “form and function”. “All new firearm models are assessed before import and are approved and categorised by the federal government,” Laura Patterson, from the foundation, said. “The reality is that GCA knows nothing about guns, and next to nothing about Australian firearms laws. [Their] frequent, incoherent and damaging comments only inhibit defence, law enforcement and civilian efforts to work together to protect this wonderful country.” The foundation said actions such as a national digital register to track firearms transactions and replace the current paper-based system would improve community safety. Some jurisdictions, including New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territoy, ban weapons that are designed to look like military weapons. Last year NSW banned Desert Tech rifles on that basis. Shooters groups argue appearance bans are pointless, as guns cannot be publicly wielded or displayed. Lee said the ban on military-style weapons should be extended Australia-wide. A Brisbane resident, Michael Cahill, has complained about the billboard showing the Victrix bolt-action rifle, which he said was provocative and inappropriate. Gun Control Australia has called for it to be removed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/14/peter-duttons-department-blocked-white-south-african-farmers-asylum-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T22:04:00Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton's department blocked white South African farmer's asylum bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/14/peter-duttons-department-blocked-white-south-african-farmers-asylum-bid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/14/peter-duttons-department-blocked-white-south-african-farmers-asylum-bid","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton's department blocked white South African farmer's asylum bid","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Dutton’s department blocked a white South African farmer’s asylum bid because its evidence showed “the vast majority of crimes against whites are not racially motivated”. A delegate for Dutton also shut down a second, separate asylum bid by a white South African woman who feared racially motivated persecution, arguing there was no evidence she “had been targeted because of her race or gender or that she would be targeted for this reason upon her return”. To be granted refugee status, an asylum seeker must have a well-founded fear of persecution for one or more of a number of legislated reasons: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. The two decisions, both made by immigration authorities in 2015, appear to be at odds with Dutton’s recent stance in support of protecting white South African farmers. In March Dutton said the farmers deserved “special attention” from a “civilised country” like Australia on humanitarian grounds. Dutton’s comments followed reporting and opinion writing in News Corp newspapers that white farmers in South Africa were being targeted, and was backed by Tony Abbott. It sparked a rebuke from the South African government and was rejected by the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who noted that Australia’s humanitarian visa program was “non-discriminatory”. This week Dutton received a written request from a man in the South African community to “fast track” a quota of South Africans. It came amid reports of government MPs discussing options to take several thousand in one go, likening it to the 12,000 humanitarian visas given to Syrians fleeing the deadly civil war. The first decision to deny a white South African farmer’s asylum bid, which was upheld by the administrative appeals tribunal in September last year, involved a man who asked for protection from the immigration department in January 2015, because he “fears harm on the basis of his race” should he return home. The man told the immigration department he was the victim of a serious attack at his home in 1998, where his wife and another five people were murdered, and he was left with serious injuries. The claim was corroborated by media reporting. But the immigration department knocked back his asylum request in July 2015, arguing there was little evidence of racially motivated crime against white farmers or white South Africans. The department’s stance was only made public because the farmer appealed the decision to the administrative appeals tribunal, which again ruled against the farmer’s application for protection. “The delegate of the department in the decision record dated [July] 2015 referred to country sources which indicate that although white farmers are targeted for crime at a rate higher than other white people in the country, there was also significant crime against black farm workers,” the tribunal’s decision read. “Furthermore, the department referred to sources which indicate that the vast majority of crimes against whites are not racially motivated, but rather are crimes for financial gain.” In ruling on the farmer’s appeal, the tribunal also downplayed the notion of racially motivated violence against white South Africans. It accepted he genuinely feared harm in South Africa, and agreed he had experienced “horrific and terrible” crime himself. “However the evidence discussed above indicates that the motive of the perpetrators of crime is considerably more likely to be based on economic need, and a violent subculture, rather than race,” the tribunal ruled. “Sources also indicate that there is a general level of violence arising out of criminal activity in South Africa, which affects the entire population. “Some groups, such as young black men or women in black townships, are affected disproportionately, with one commentator stating that people in ‘suburbs can buy security that people in townships cannot’.” In the second case, a delegate for Dutton rejected an asylum bid by a white South African woman in March 2015 after the woman asked for Australia’s protection. The woman was not a farmer but said she and her son would be targeted in South Africa “because they are ethnically white South Africans”. Dutton’s delegate argued there was no evidence to support her claims of racial persecution. “The delegate accepted that the applicant had been the victim of crimes in 2002 and 2008, but did not accept she had been targeted because of her race or gender or that she would be targeted for this reason upon her return,” an appeal judgment said. The situation in South Africa has changed since the two decisions were made by immigration authorities. Earlier this year, the nation’s parliament passed a motion that may lead to the seizure of land from farmers without paying compensation. The South African government says it is attempting to redistribute land fairly, but insists no one is being persecuted or having their rights taken away. Dutton was contacted for comment but did not respond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/13/rba-financial-risk-easing-but-high-household-debt-a-concern","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T09:49:44Z","webTitle":"RBA: financial risk easing but high household debt a concern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/rba-financial-risk-easing-but-high-household-debt-a-concern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/13/rba-financial-risk-easing-but-high-household-debt-a-concern","fields":{"headline":"RBA: financial risk easing but high household debt a concern","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The build-up of financial risk in Australia’s households has finally started to ease, but the worryingly-high level of household debt we have accumulated in recent years will take years to wear off, the Reserve Bank says. The RBA has published its latest review of the health of the financial system. It shows the RBA is pleased with regulators’ efforts to strengthen lending standards in Australian in recent years, saying there are fewer concerns about riskier types of new housing borrowing than there were 12 months ago. But it has drawn attention to the high level of household debt, saying it increases the risk of future economic negative shocks being amplified across the economy. “The ratio of total household debt to income has increased by almost 30 percentage points over the past five years to almost 190%, after having been broadly unchanged for close to a decade,” the review says. “Australia’s household debt-to-income ratio is high relative to many other advanced economies, including some that have also continued to see strong growth in household lending in the post-crisis period, such as Canada, New Zealand and Sweden. “Household debt in these economies is notably higher than in those that were more affected by the financial crisis and experienced deleveraging, including Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.” Economists say it is unsurprising that the RBA is continuing to warn about vulnerabilities in household balance sheets, but say most aggregate indicators of financial stress remain low. “Overall ... regulatory measures and broader strengthening of lending standards have contributed to an improvement in the risk profile of new housing lending and the resilience of household balance sheets,” Commonwealth Bank economists John Peters and Michael Workman said. “They have also contributed to the recent moderation in housing market conditions.” The RBA says global economic conditions have remained strong in the past six months, helping to further improve the health of the global banking system generally. The review comes after RBA governor Philip Lowe said this week Australia’s painful run of record low wages growth may have finally troughed, with economic conditions improving in every region across Australia as the remnants of the destabilising wind-down in mining investment finally disappear. He said the economy was likely to grow more strongly over the next two years than it did last year as non-mining investment increased, exports continued to grow, and more people found jobs, leading to a pick-up in wages growth and inflation. “The latest data suggest that the rate of wages has now troughed, with a pick-up evident in the most recent quarter,” Lowe said during a speech in Perth. “A further lift is expected, but it is likely to be only gradual,” he said. The Turnbull government welcomed the expectation that Australia’s run of record-low wages growth may be over, given this week’s news that the government has now trailed Labor for 30 consecutive Newspolls. The RBA says it is keeping a close eye on the health of the home loan market given “the risk from the stock of existing loans remains.” But it says the resilience of household balance sheets has stopped deteriorating, thanks to improvements in lending standards that have “contributed to a significant improvement in the risk profile of new lending over the past couple of years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/25/mountains-and-mountains-of-plastic-life-on-cambodias-polluted-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T22:19:16Z","webTitle":"'Mountains and mountains of plastic': life on Cambodia's polluted coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/mountains-and-mountains-of-plastic-life-on-cambodias-polluted-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/25/mountains-and-mountains-of-plastic-life-on-cambodias-polluted-coast","fields":{"headline":"'Mountains and mountains of plastic': life on Cambodia's polluted coast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Looking down into the water that lies beneath the ramshackle houses of Sihanouk, Cambodia, it is hard to imagine that the sea is there at all. Instead, there is dense layer upon layer of plastic waste clogging the water, piling up around poles that support the wooden homes, carpeting the beach. Floating rubbish in Sihanouk, Cambodia New images of from Sihanouk, in the country’s south west, depict in horrifying detail the extent of Cambodia’s growing problem of plastic pollution and how the tide of unbiodegradable rubbish has become part of the fabric of the lives of communities living in poverty. A woman sweeps her restaurant shopfront Photographer Niamh Peren said she had been “gobsmacked” at the levels of plastic pollution that littered the waters and wharfs of Sihanouk, but emphasised that these mountains of waste also told another story: one is often neglected in the current global discussion around plastic, where poorer countries are often accused of being the biggest culprits in terms of generating plastic waste. “There seems to be no empathy for the fact that for the people living in Sihanouk, there isn’t a water filtration system,” said Peren. “Their tap water is so dirty and undrinkable, that to stay alive they have to buy bottled water and then live among the rubbish it creates because there’s nowhere to put it.” Over the past 15 to 20 years, Cambodia’s water system has improved faster than most of its regional neighbours, though sanitation efforts have mainly been centred in the capital Phnom Penh. However, according to Water.Org, about four million people in Cambodia still lack access to safe water, leaving them with no alternative but to buy endless bottled water, perpetuating the environmentally destructive cycle. The view from a home on the wharf Peren added: “There’s a total blame game that goes on about who generates rubbish and all this plastic but it’s a human story at the end of the day because this plastic waste that all the people here live amongst is unavoidable- they are not about to feed their babies the black muddy liquid that comes out of the taps, it’s poison.” With no systemised waste collection service in the area, - almost every plastic bottle ends up in the water below, along with most other rubbish. With hundreds of families living in these houses on the water, the daily rubbish build up is enormous. Sorted cans are loaded on to a truck at a recycling plant by the Sihanouk port Peren described witnessing fishing boats coming into the wharf after long trips and dumping months of rubbish straight into the water and families living in the shanty houses on stilts doing the same with rubbish from their homes, the majority of which was often plastic packaging and bottles. The plastic bags which also make up the dense blanket of rubbish also speak to Cambodia’s issue with consumption of single use plastic. In urban areas, each person uses an estimated 2,000 plastic bags annually, 10 times more than consumers in China and the EU, and an average of 10m plastic bags are used every day in Phnom Penh alone, according to anti-poverty organization ACRA in 2015. Garbage near the roadside in Sihanouk, Cambodia Nonetheless, in comparison, Cambodia is not as big of a plastic polluter as its Southeast Asian neighbours Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia. These Sihanouk images follow a recent video by British diver Rich Horner which went viral after he documented swimming through a blizzard of plastic pollution in the seas off Bali. Peren said the residents of Sihanouk were caught in a harsh cycle that was being repeated all across the poorer communities in Cambodia. “If you don’t have anyone collecting it, if you don’t have any means to stop it, then this is the reality of what will happen and keep on happening,’ she said. “Every river, every lake just filled with mountains and mountains of plastic as is already the case all over Cambodia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/poor-peoples-campaign-systemic-poverty-a-sin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"America once fought a war against poverty – now it wages a war on the poor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/poor-peoples-campaign-systemic-poverty-a-sin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/poor-peoples-campaign-systemic-poverty-a-sin","fields":{"headline":"America once fought a war against poverty – now it wages a war on the poor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2013, Callie Greer’s daughter Venus died in her arms after a battle with breast cancer. If caught early, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with breast cancer is close to 100%. But Venus’s cancer went undiagnosed for months because she couldn’t afford health insurance. She lived in Alabama, a state that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Venus’s death is not an isolated incident – more than 250,000 people like her die in the United States from poverty and related issues every year. Access to healthcare is just one of the issues facing the 140 million people who live in poverty in the US today. Over the past two years, the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has carried out a listening tour in dozens of states across this nation. We have met with tens of thousands of people from El Paso, Texas, to South Charleston, West Virginia, to Selma, Alabama, where we met Callie, gathering testimonies from poor people and listening to their demands for a better society. On Tuesday, we announced a Poor People’s Campaign Moral Agenda, a set of demands that is drawn from this listening tour, as well as an audit of America we conducted with allied organizations, including the Institute for Policy Studies and the Urban Institute, 50 years after the original Poor People’s Campaign. As grim as the situation was in 1968, the appalling truth is deep inequalities still exist and, in some ways, we are worse off. While our nation once fought a war against poverty, now we wage a war on the poor. The richest 1% in our country own more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, tightening their grip on political power to shape labor, tax, healthcare and campaign finance policies that benefit the few at the expense of the many. A full 60% more Americans now live below the official poverty line than in 1968, and 43% of all American children live below the minimum income level considered necessary to meet basic family needs. In the last eight years alone, 23 states have passed voter suppression laws – gutting the Voting Rights Act civil rights leaders helped secure more than a half century ago. This is the true hacking of our democracy, allowing people to win office who deny healthcare, living wages, cut necessary social programs and push policies that promote mass incarceration, hurt immigrants and devastate our environment. These racist laws hurt not just people of color, but poor whites whose lives are upended by the politicians put in office by the violent extremism that is voter suppression. Coretta Scott King would call all of this violence. She’d say that violence isn’t just killing people with guns, but denying them living wages, allowing them to live in ghetto housing. We rightfully get in the streets and protest when the police shoot unarmed black men, but we must also stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our society. We must no longer allow inattention to violence to keep the poor, people of color and other disenfranchised people down. People are poor not because they are lazy, not because they are unwilling to work hard, but because politicians have blocked living wages and healthcare and undermined union rights and wage increases. Our nation’s moral narrative is shaped by Christian nationalists whose claims run contrary to calls in the Scripture, which is very clear that we need to care for the poor, immigrants and the least among us. If you claim to be evangelical and Christian and have nothing to say about poverty and racism, then your claim is terribly suspect. There needs to be a new moral discourse in this nation – one that says being poor is not a sin but systemic poverty is. The Moral Agenda we announced on Tuesday demands a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws, new programs to lift up the 140 million Americans living in poverty, immediate attention to ecological devastation and measures to curb militarism and the war economy. We call for major changes to address systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative, including restoration and expansion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, implementation of federal and state living wage laws, universal single-payer healthcare and clean water for all. To make sure these demands are heard, poor and disenfranchised people from coast to coast are preparing for 40 days of action centered around statehouses and the US Capitol. Over six weeks this spring, people of all races, colors and creeds are joining together to engage in nonviolent moral fusion direct action, massive voter mobilization and power building from the bottom up. To prepare for the 40 days, poor and disenfranchised people, clergy and advocates will participate in nonviolent direct-action trainings across the country on Saturday. Now, 50 years after leaders of the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to break the silence and tell the truth about the interlocking evils of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative. All over the country, poor people like Callie are joining together, with support from clergy and advocates. As she said on Tuesday in unveiling our demands: “We not going to keep crying. We’re going to march, we’re going to protest and we’re going to vote.” The Rev Dr William Barber and the Rev Dr Liz Theoharis are co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
