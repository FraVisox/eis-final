The policies are contained in its national gender equality strategy, released on Wednesday ahead of deputy leader Tanya Plibersek’s International Women’s Day address at the National Press Club. In her speech, an advance copy of which was seen by Guardian Australia, Plibersek says Labor’s consultations have revealed five priorities: economic security and independence; valuing and sharing family responsibilities; gender gaps in health and wellbeing; women’s leadership; and ending violence against women. Labor plans to put gender at the centre of government decision-making, Plibersek will say, with consideration of how policies affect both genders and a women’s budget statement to make budget practices gender-responsive. On gender equity in pay, Labor promises a “measurable action” with annual reports to parliament on its progress, which may include a target for the gender pay gap. According to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA), Australia’s full-time gender pay gap is 15.3%. Women employed full-time earn on average $253.70 a week less than men. Plibersek will say it is “optimistic” to think the gap will be closed in 50 years, as the WGEA estimates, and the trend has been backwards over the past 20 years. “We can’t wait 50 or more years to close the pay gap. We can’t wait 30 years for equal political representation,” she will say. “In 1972 we said ‘It’s time’. In 2018 women are saying ‘time’s up’.” Plibersek will say Bill Shorten has “already made clear that reducing violence against women will be a top priority for a Labor government”. Labor plans to set a family and domestic violence target with states and territories as part of a national action plan, and last week announced it will intervene to prevent abuse at residential colleges. Plibersek will say the #metoo movement has exposed “how common sexual harassment still is”. “The #MeToo movement and last week’s Red Zone report, have shone such a bright light on our failings that there is no longer any excuse to turn a blind eye.” Labor promises to boost the representation of women in chair and deputy chair positions on government boards to 40% by 2025 and to set a target of 50% representation of women in senior public service roles by 2025. Although the target does not apply to judges, Plibersek will call for “a federal judiciary that better reflects the Australian community”. In 2016 the Australian government committed to a target of women holding 50% of government board positions overall and men and women holding at least 40% on each board. In 2017 women held 42.7% of Australian government board positions. However, at the chair and deputy chair level just 31.8% were women. According to the Australian Public Service Commission women make up 58% of the public service workforce but just 31% of agencies are headed by women. Some 47% of employees reporting directly to an agency head were women."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/australian-spy-who-revealed-bugging-of-timor-leste-cabinet-under-effective-house-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T01:41:43Z","webTitle":"Australian spy who revealed bugging of Timor-Leste cabinet under 'effective house arrest'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/australian-spy-who-revealed-bugging-of-timor-leste-cabinet-under-effective-house-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/australian-spy-who-revealed-bugging-of-timor-leste-cabinet-under-effective-house-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Australian spy who revealed bugging of Timor-Leste cabinet under 'effective house arrest'","bodyText":"The spy who blew the whistle on Australia’s bugging of Timor-Leste’s cabinet room during sensitive oil and gas negotiations is still under “effective house arrest” and has been treated disgracefully by Australia in retaliation for his actions, his lawyer says. The Australian secret intelligence service agent, known only as Witness K, had his passport seized in 2013 as he prepared to give evidence in The Hague on an Australian bugging operation. In 2004, Witness K was involved in a covert mission to listen in on the Timor-Leste cabinet aimed at giving Australia the upper hand during negotiations to carve up oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea, estimated to be worth about $53bn. The revelations caused Timor-Leste to launch legal action at The Hague, saying Australia’s espionage voided a John Howard-era agreement on sharing the reserves. Witness K’s passport was taken at the same time as authorities raided the Canberra home of his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, seizing a cache of documents. Witness K has since launched action in the security division of the administrative appeals tribunal to have his passport handed back. The proceedings have been resisted by the Australian government, which still describes him as a security risk. On Wednesday, as Australian and Timor-Leste signed a new agreement about sharing the reserves, Collaery spoke out about the continued “disgraceful” treatment of Witness K. “The refusal of a passport to witness K long after the director-general of Asio cleared him for a passport is pure retaliation,” Collaery told Guardian Australia. “It is unbecoming our nation to treat a loyal veteran, a patriot [in this way]. “It’s pure retaliation, the appeal procedures have been going for four years. “It is disgraceful. The cover-up continues.” Were it not for Witness K, Collaery said, the misconduct towards Timor-Leste would “never have been disclosed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/06/tasmania-premier-claims-mandate-for-policies-kept-secret-during-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T06:05:45Z","webTitle":"Tasmania premier claims mandate for policies kept secret during campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/tasmania-premier-claims-mandate-for-policies-kept-secret-during-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/tasmania-premier-claims-mandate-for-policies-kept-secret-during-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Tasmania premier claims mandate for policies kept secret during campaign","bodyText":"The Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, has declared he has a mandate for about 200 policies that were released to interest groups and not made available for public scrutiny during the state election campaign. But he promised the Liberal government’s controversial guns policy – released to shooting groups and farmers and not uncovered until the day before the election – would not breach the national firearms agreement, suggesting it may be changed before it is introduced to parliament. After the plan to relax some gun laws came to light on Friday, Hodgman said it was not unusual for policies to be released directly to interested organisations. He said the Liberals had made about 300 commitments. Only 85 were listed on its website. In his first press conference since being comfortably returned to power in Saturday’s poll, the premier said the remaining 200 policies would be made public soon. Asked if he believed the government had a mandate to deliver all of them, he said “yes”. All parties announced policies via media release, he said, and others by direct commitments to groups. “For the communities that are affected by them, or have an interest in that subject matter, there has been consultation as far as we are able to within the context of an election campaign,” he said. Hodgman said he would not rush through changes to gun laws, acknowledging it remained a sensitive issue for Tasmanians 22 years after 35 people were killed in the Port Arthur massacre. “This is my firm guarantee – we will not do anything to compromise the national firearms agreement,” he said. “Nothing will be done to prevent people from expressing their views. We will extensively consult and we’ll be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.” Asked about sections of the policy written by the police minister, Rene Hidding, that were at odds with the national firearms agreement – including pledges to increase the extent of the maximum gun licence duration and to reduce the penalties for minor firearm storage breaches – Hodgman said: “I am guided by the advice of my minister ... [we will] ensure there is no breach of the national firearms agreement.” The guns policy was spelt out in a letter to a firearms consultation group on 9 February. It said the government would extend the limit on gun licence duration for some firearms categories from five to 10 years, abolish mandatory weapon removal for minor breaches of storage laws and consider introducing a new firearms category covering all banned guns that would allow “certain specialists” to use them. Hidding also promised the government would ask the national Council of Police Ministers to consider expanding access to Category C firearms – pump-action and rapid-fire shotguns – to make them available to a greater range of sporting shooters. The federal law enforcement minister, Angus Taylor, told Guardian Australia the national firearms agreement, introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, was one of the greatest legacies of the former prime minister, John Howard, and the Turnbull government would not support changes to it. Port Arthur survivors have criticised the government’s plan. Hodgman said he believed the state’s gun laws could be improved for farmers and law-abiding gun owners without watering down the national agreement or putting safety at risk. “I stand by our policy intent. I don’t believe we’ve done anything improper or inappropriate. It is not dissimilar to what the Labor party has done either,” he said. It is unclear whether the government will have parliamentary support for its guns policy. While it has a clear majority in the state’s lower house, having received more than 50% of the primary vote and winning at least 13 of the 25 seats, it has only one representative in the 15-member upper house, which was not up for election on Saturday. Labor has four, 10 are independents. Labor has also promised to reduce penalties for minor breaches of firearms storage laws, but criticised other changes proposed by the government. The guns policy may face internal resistance. Sue Hickey, a newly elected Liberal MP, told the ABC on Saturday that the proposed changes came “as a bit of a shock” and would need to be discussed. An independent upper house MP, Rob Valentine, questioned whether the government had the right to put issues not discussed during the campaign on the agenda in the new parliament. “They go into these things at their peril if they haven’t properly consulted. To consult with just the sector affected is just not good enough. On the issue of gun control, that affects the broader populace and they have views on this,” he said. Much of the Tasmanian election debate was dominated by Labor’s pledge to remove gaming machines from pubs and clubs. Labor and the Greens have both accused the Liberals of buying seats in parliament, citing the widespread belief the government’s campaign was heavily bankrolled by the gaming and hospitality industry. Hodgman denied the government had spent $5m on advertising, but said he was not aware how much had been spent. He said it was patronising to suggest the election had been bought. “Tasmanians know exactly who they are voting for and the reasons for doing so,” he said. “To tell anyone that they could be so stupid as to not know why they are making their vote, for what reasons, I think demonstrates political parties are out of touch with the voters they seek to represent.” But the premier said the government would look at proposals for the state to introduce campaign finance disclosure laws. Tasmania is covered by federal laws that require annual disclosure of total donations and individual donations of more than $13,500. Under these laws, the details of who donated to the political parties in the campaign is not due to be released until 2019. The government will need to legislate to introduce its pokies policy of directly licensing pubs and clubs to operate gaming machines from 2023, ending hotel company Federal Group’s monopoly. It is unclear if the upper house will back the change. Valentine said it was ridiculous for the government to suggest it had a mandate for its gaming policy. “They’ve got a mandate to put it on the agenda,” he said. “The upper house is not a rubber stamp.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/counted-out-anger-as-new-zealand-census-fails-to-tick-all-the-boxes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T04:35:13Z","webTitle":"Counted out: anger as New Zealand census fails to tick all the boxes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/counted-out-anger-as-new-zealand-census-fails-to-tick-all-the-boxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/counted-out-anger-as-new-zealand-census-fails-to-tick-all-the-boxes","fields":{"headline":"Counted out: anger as New Zealand census fails to tick all the boxes","bodyText":"New Zealand’s introduction of an online census has caused consternation throughout with country, with the absence of an ethnic group, accessibility issues for the disabled and elderly, and fears that the nation’s most marginalised people won’t be counted. More than 1.5 million people have already filled in their census form online, but thousands more are struggling as they don’t have access to a computer or the internet, have not received a postal access code allowing them to fill in the form online, or do not identify with the ethnic groups or genders listed. The ongoing exclusion of the ethnic group Pākehā – the Maori word for a New Zealander of European descent – has caused upset and prompted a petition demanding it be reinstated. The broadcaster Stacey Morrison said the term New Zealand European did not adequately reflect how many New Zealanders saw themselves. “Pākehā expresses the nature of your family’s voyage to New Zealand – that you have come, at some point, voyaged to and made New Zealand your home,” Morrison told Stuff. “It tells the story of who your family is.” Even politicians weighed into the furore, with the former Green party MP Catherine Delahunty saying she planned to type Pākehā in the ‘other’ box regarding her ethnicity. The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Te Ara, defined the meaning of Pākehā as “a Maori term for the white inhabitants of New Zealand [that] was in vogue even prior to 1815”. Other New Zealanders expressed concern that only the male and female genders were listed in the census and there were no questions regarding New Zealanders’ sexuality. The minister of statistics James Shaw told Radio NZ it was too late to change the questions but he would push to include questions about New Zealander’s sexual identities and preferences in the 2023 census. “We’ve got to gather this data because we make significant health care funding decisions, and other public policy decision in relation to this community, and we don’t have granular enough information at the moment.” Census New Zealand said about 4% of the country, mostly in remote or rural locations, would be targeted by on-the-ground staff offering paper forms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27458","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T00:00:00Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,458","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27458","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27458","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,458","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/06/liverpool-v-porto-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T22:03:01Z","webTitle":"Liverpool 0-0 Porto (agg: 5-0): Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/06/liverpool-v-porto-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/06/liverpool-v-porto-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool 0-0 Porto (agg: 5-0): Champions League – as it happened","bodyText":"We’ll have a live report from Anfield along shortly. I’m guessing Andy Hunter is sucking his pen in the press-room at Anfield, trying to think of 800 words to write about that match. While you’re waiting for that report, why not read this depressing story about the venal, grasping, petty and spiteful property investment fund that is not only evicting my popular local non-League football team from their ground, but forbidding them from using their own name. Liverpool are through to the quarter-finals: It’s a game that won’t live long in the memory of anyone who saw it, but Liverpool and their supporters won’t care as they advance to the quarter-finals. “You’ve got to give credit to Porto, who played well,” says Jordan Henderson in an interview with BT Sport’s Paul Dempsey. “This is the business end of the season, the next few months. We’ve got to keep going, putting in performances and the results will look after themselves.” Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep!!! It’s all over, but still Porto’s incredible fans sing on. It’s finished scoreless on the night, but Liverpool advance to the quarter-finals courtesy of their 5-0 first leg win in Porto. 90+1 min: Meanwhile in Paris, Real Madrid are 2-1 up on the night and 5-2 up on aggregate against 10-man PSG, who have lost Marco Verratti to a red card. unai Emery will almost certainly lose his job on the back of this defeat, if not immediately then almost certainly in the summer. Perhaps Arsene Wenger will be available to take over. 90 min: Jordan Henderson is penalised for a shove on Sergio Oliveira. 89 min: Danny Ings is denied by a fine Iker Casillas save, the goalkeeper leaping high to claw a powerful, goal-bound header behind for a corner after getting caught slightly off his line. Ings looks gutted. 86 min: A Porto free-kick is deflected into the path of midfielder Oliver Torres, who tries to fire it home from about eight yards. Between them, Ragnar Klavan and Dejan Lovren block the shot and scramble the ball clear. 84 min: Hats off to Porto’s travelling fans, who have been bouncing up and down, singing non-stop for every minute of this match. Without them, the atmosphere at this fairly uninspiring game would be pancake flat. 83 min: Porto win a corner after a Sergio Oliveira shot from distance brings a smart save out of Loris Karius. Nothing comes of it. 82 min: Mo Salah unleashes a shot on goal after running on to a pass from deep. He doesn’t trouble Casillas unduly with his low, diagonal effort from a tight angle. The goalkeeper gets down quickly to save. 79 min: Porto substitution: Vincent Aboubaker off, Goncalo Paciencia on. Liverpool substitution: Emre Can off, Ragnar Klavan on. 78 min: Meanwhile in Paris, Edinson Cavani has pulled a goal back for PSG. It’s 1-1 on the night, but Real Madrid 4-2 PSG on aggregate. The biggest big-game bottlers of them all are about to go out again. 76 min: Alberto Moreno sprints on to a loose ball after Olivier Torres plays a reckless cross-field pass across the face of his own penalty area. The Spanish left-back shoots on goal, but once again Felipe is on hand to block and take the sting out of a shot that loops into the waiting arms of Iker Casillas. 75 min: Good play from Liverpool, with Jordan Henderson arrowing a cross to the far post and Alberto Moreno getting in behind Max Perreira to steer the ball back into the mixer from the byline. Porto clear. 73 min: A match that was a foregone conclusion before it began is now being played at little more than a walking pace as the players on both sides go through the motions. Liverpool substitution: Sadio Mane off, Mo Salah on. 70 min: Adam Lallana floats a cross towards the post, but it’s too close to Iker Casillas for the lurking Danny Ings and Sadio Mane to steer it goalwards. The Porto goalkeeper claims with ne’er a bother. 68 min: Porto substitution: Majeed Waris off with a calf injury, Ricardo on. 66 min: Jordan Henderson sends in a cross from the left and Danny Ings steers a header goalwards. He’s falling backwards and can’t get any power on it, making the save very straightforward for Casillas. 65 min: Nothing is happening. Nothing. 62 min: Liverpool substitution: Roberto Firmino off, Danny Ings on. Porto substitution: Andre Andre off, Sergio Oliveira on. In all the excitement of a moment ago, Jordan Henderson picked up a yellow card for some indiscretion or other that I must confess passed me by. 60 min: Roberto Firmino sprints on to the ball in the porto penalty area nad looks likely to break tonight’s deadlock, only to be denied by a splendid Max Perreira block. 59 min: The lesser-spotted Danny Ings is about to get a run out for Liverpool. He’s had a horrible time of it with injuries over the past two years, so good luck to him. 57 min: Roberto Firmino drives forward and plays the ball to Mane standing with his back to goal a couple of yards outside the Porto penalty area. He’s unable to turn and pings it towards Jordan Henderson, as Liverpool continue to huff and puff for little reward in the final third. They’re 5-0 up so they won’t mind. 55 min: Joe Gomez tussles for a 50-50 ball down by the by-line and it rolls out of play. He appeals for a corner but doesn’t get one. 54 min: For the first time tonight, Liverpool’s fans rouse themselves to drown out the travelling 4,000 from Porto with a half-hearted rendition of the Fields of Anfield Road. It doesn’t last long and Porto’s fans are soon back in full voice. 53 min: Meanwhile in Paris, Real Madrid have gone 4-1 up on aggregate, courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo. 49 min: Majeed Waris wins the ball form Joe Gomes in midfield, takes it past Adam Lallana and unleashes a shot - the first on target on the game - that brings a smart save out of Loris Karius. Porto are unable to capitalise from the ensuing corner. 47 min: Moreno and Lallana combine down the left flank, with the left squaring the ball low and hard for James Milner. He goes to ground and is unable to steer his shot on target. A great chance goes begging. 46 min: OK, so now Porto have got the ball rolling - I may have jumped the gun with that last post. Iker Casillas got a very warm round of applause from Liverpool’s fans as he made his way to the goal he’ll be defending in this second half, which he acknowledged graciously. 46 min: Porto get the ball rolling in the second half and reports from Paris, where it’s also scoreless between PSG and Real Madrid, suggest their match isn’t much more entertaining than this one. You can follow that with Scott Murray. Peep! There’s no added time and the players troop off at the break. It was an uneventful, dull first half with few if any highlights. Sadio Mane has had the best chance of the game so far, hitting the foot of the post with an effort inside the penalty area. 43 min: Alberto Moreno picks up a pass from Emre Can down by the corner, cuts inside through the Porto penalty area and goes down theatrically under a “challenge” from Max Perreira. He appeals for a penalty but doesn’t get one. Replays suggest he wasn’t touched and was trying to gull the referee. 39 min: The camera cuts to Jurgen Klopp, who is standing on the touchline with his hands in his pockets, with an expression on his face that suggests he’s just smelt something particularly unpleasant but is too polite to say anything about it. 35 min: Roberto Firmino picks up a nice pass from Jame Milner and tries to play Sadio Mane in behind with a neat dink. The Senegalese mistimes his run and is flagged for offside. It’s a shame, really, as it was a neat, quick passing move. 34 min: Andre Andre is booked for a foul on somebody or other and Liverpool have a free-kick halfway inside the Porto half, near the left touchline. James Milner arcs in a delivery, which Dejan Lovren connects with but heads on to the roof of the goal. 33 min: That Mane chance has jolted the Andfield crowd out of their slumber - he was very unlucky. Moreno did well to keep the ball in play down by the corner flag, before James Milner picked out Mane in the penalty area with a fine cross. 29 min: Chance! Sadio Mane misses the chance of the game so far, shooting low and hard towards the bottom left-hand corner, only to see his effort hammer the foot of the post and come back from whence it came. 28 min: Good work from Adam Lallana, who scampers down the right touchline and whips a cross to the near post. Roberto Firmino attacks the ball with his head, but it’s a mite too far in front of him to thump it as hard as he’d like. sprinting towards his own goal, Porto skipper Felipe clears with a header of his own. 27 min: Liverpool are enjoying a spell of dominance, but creating little or nothing in the way of chances. They don’t particularly need to, but Jurgen Klopp isn’t looking too thrilled with his team’s performance at the moment. 25 min: Joe Gomez and Sadio Mane capitalise on a Diego Reyes mistake to work the ball in towards Roberto Firmino in the middle of the Porto penalty area. He gets it caught under his feet under pressure from Max Perreira and is unable to fire off a round. Porto clear. 22 min: The match continues to meander along at a fairly sedate tempo, with neither goalkeeper having had to make a save as we hit the quarter-way mark. 21 min: Aboubakaer plays the ball wide to Majeed Waris on the left touchline, but Alberto Moreno relieves him of possession. 19 min: Alberto Moreno gallops down the right wing and swings in a cross. Roberto Firmino is acrobatic in his attempt to poke home, but the airborne ball evades him. Not by much, mind. 15 min: Not for the first time, a long ball over the top towards Vincenty Aboubaker catches out Liverpool’s defence, but Loris Karius is quick off his line to claim it. 13 min: Elsewhere, just down by the technical areas, Porto right-back Max Perreira has hobbled off the pitch to get treatment on what looks quite a nasty gash on his left leg sustained in a challenge with James Milner. He gets patched up and trots back into battle. 12 min: Joe Gomez takes on Diogo Dalot on the right flank, but doesn’t have the beating of the Porto left-back, who blocks his attempt at a cross and clears. 10 min: Iker Casillas has been playing the ball out from the back any time it comes his way and is being put under a little, but not much pressure by Liverpool’s forwards. THere’s very little to report here. No shots on goal from either team so far. 8 min: Porto’s fans continue to soundtrack a game in which neither goalkeeper has been even remotely troubled. You have to applaud their enthusiasm in providing such vocal support for a team that’s 5-0 down from the first leg. 7 min: Porto midfielder Andre Andre, who is so good they named him twice, is penalised here for a foul on Adam Lallana as the Liverpool forward turns him. He gets a talking-to from the referee, but avoids a yellow card. 5 min: Getting a rare start at left-back, Alberto Moreno robs Majeed Waris of possession as the Porto forward tries to cut inside from the touchline. This bit of industry earns Moreno a round of applause from the denizens of the Kop behind Loris Karius’s goal. 4 min: Felipe robs Jordan Henderson of possession as the Liverpool captain becomes the first player on the pitch to break into a sprint with a burst towards the edge of the final third. Felipe takes the ball from him, advances and wins a free-kick. 3 min: Porto’s travelling fans are making all the noise early doors as they attempt to keep their team motivated. It’s a very pedestrian start. 2 min: Iker Casillas gets a few early touches in what could well be the goalkeeper’s last ever Champions League match. Way to make me feel old, Iker - I remember you watching you play when you were 17. 1 min: Liverpool kick off, playing in their usual home kit of red shirts, shorts and socks. Porto’s players wear blue and white striped shirts, blue shorts and white socks. There’s applause, followed by a perfectly observed silence to mark the passing of Davide Astori. Play is about to begin. The teams are out on the pitch at a packed Anfield going through the last of the pre-match formalities. Jordan Henderson and Felipe exchange souvenir pennants, German referee tosses the coin and kick off is just a couple of minutes away. All this week’s Champions League and Europa League matches will be preceded by a minute’s silence in memory of Davide Astori, the Fiorentina captain who tragically died in his sleep on Saturday night, leaving behind a wife, young daughter and many, many grief-stricken former team-mates, friends and other colleagues. May he rest in peace. This lot are certainly determined to enjoy themselves ... What, one wonders, is the mindset of a Porto player going into this game with such a huge deficit to overcome? Dread? Weary resignation? Steely determination to do the very best you can? Cautious optimism that you won’t get embarrassed again? If Porto’s players approach this match in the same way as people writing minute-by-minute reporters, I expect they’ll hope to do their best under trying circumstances and have a nice time, while secretly wishing they were at home with their feet up watching PSG take on Real Madrid. Liverpool: Karius, Gomez, Matip, Lovren, Moreno, Can, Henderson, Milner, Mane, Firmino, Lallana. Subs: Mignolet, van Dijk, Salah, Klavan, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ings, Alexander-Arnold. FC Porto: Casillas, Maxi Pereira, Felipe, Reyes, Dalot, Costa, Torres, Andre Andre, Corona, Aboubakar, Waris. Subs: Jose Sa, Brahimi, Paciencia, Ricardo Pereira, Otavio, Sergio Oliveira, Mata. Referee: Felix Zwayer (Berlin) Jurgen Klopp makes five changes for tonight’s game. Leading scorer Mo Salah is rested and will watch from the bench, while midfielder Adam Lallana is handed his first start in two months. Left-back Alberto Moreno also starts for the first time in six weeks with Andrew Robertson nursing a knock. Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold are also among the substitutes, with Joel Matip and Joe Gomez coming into defence and James Milner starting in midfield. Porto’s coach also appeared before the media yesterday and said his team are nowhere near as bad as the first leg deficit they are attempting to overcome suggests. “The five-goal margin is not a true reflection of the difference in quality between the two teams,” he said. “They were incredibly effective in front of goal in the first leg, but things could have gone differently. We want to get a much better result tomorrow. Representing Porto, playing in the knockout stages of the Champions League - there’s no bigger motivation than that. We know we can’t commit the same errors we did in the first leg. We need to improve.” Well, he spoke yesterday at his pre-match media briefing and suggested he won’t be fielding a second string side despite his team’s enormous advantage. “We won the first leg in an impressive way,” he said. “We respect Porto too much and we respect the competition too much to think about rotating. We had an intense game on Saturday; we had a few knocks and a few ill players. I haven’t made a decision about the line-up.” On his side’s preparation for tonight’s match: “Yesterday we trained with nine players, he said. “Today is about recovery again and tomorrow we will focus on the finer details. We need to focus on the game. We want to win the second half of the tie.” He’s not ruling out a few changes in personnel, mind. “We’re at a moment in the league when we all have to deliver constantly. We only use the players who are in the best shape. If I do choose a different line-up, it’ll only be because we want to win the game. I might make two or three changes.” On his side’s impressive win in the first leg: “We were very effective, but Porto are a fantastic team and the Portuguese league is a fantastic league,” he said. “We won 5-0, yes, but only because we scored with virtually every chance we had. If we hadn’t, and if Porto had scored their two chances, the result would have been different.” Georginio Wijnaldum and Ben Woodburn were sidelined for Liverpool’s weekend stroll past Newcastle due to illness and may still be sidelined. Nathaniel Clyne remains sidelined as he recovers from a back injury, but is returning to full fitness. For Porto, attackers Moussa Marega and Francisco Soares are out injured. Cameroonian striker Vincent Aboubakar and Porto-born Goncalo Paciencia may start up front, although the former is also an injury doubt. Porto left-back and assist-generator Alex Telles, once a Cheslea target, is also out, as is midfielder Danilo, who is reported to have been the subject of failed bids by Arsenal and Manchester United in January. What are you doing here? Why aren’t you reading Scott Murray’s minute-by-minute report on PSG v Real Madrid? Well, seeing as you were good enough to drop by, let’s crack on ... Having lost the first leg 5-0 at home, Porto need a miracle to advance to the quarter-final. Keeping Liverpool scoreless at Anfield and scoring an absolute minimum of five goals without reply just to get to penalties isn’t going to happen, but the Portuguese side do at least hope to salvage some pride by beating Liverpool for the very first time in their history. Kick-off is at 7.45pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/06/melrose-takeover-gkn-mps-greg-clark","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T16:41:23Z","webTitle":"Melrose's £7bn bid for GKN poses threat to UK security, MPs told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/melrose-takeover-gkn-mps-greg-clark","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/06/melrose-takeover-gkn-mps-greg-clark","fields":{"headline":"Melrose's £7bn bid for GKN poses threat to UK security, MPs told","bodyText":"A proposed £7bn hostile takeover of the UK engineering company GKN by the turnaround specialist Melrose poses a threat to Britain’s national security and must be stopped by the government, MPs have been told. Union leaders said Melrose’s strategy of buying companies and holding on to them for just three to five years was incompatible with GKN, which supplies parts and technology to the UK and US defence industries and develops products over periods spanning more than a decade. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary for aerospace at Unite, described Melrose as “asset strippers”, adding that the business secretary, Greg Clark, should “absolutely” use his powers to call in the deal. “There are very clear national security implications for this we believe and it’s not just about what GKN are involved in now, it’s also about our future defence capabilities moving forward.” GKN’s work is focused on the automotive, metallurgy and aerospace industries and it is involved in sensitive programmes including technology for the US defence company Lockheed Martin’s F-35B fighter jet, 138 of which have been ordered for the Royal Air Force. Turner said the lifespan of some products could be up to 50 years, from initial development, through manufacturing and then in service. However, addressing the same House of Commons committee in an earlier session, Melrose executives insisted they would grow and improve GKN. They said the business had lost its way under current management. In a sometimes tetchy exchange, Melrose bosses insisted they would not sell off parts of the business to China, Russia, or other countries deemed a threat to national security. “We’re British citizens too,” said Simon Peckham, co-founder and chief executive. “I live in this country. My family lives in this country. We are not going to sell GKN military protected assets to anyone who is not an appropriate buyer of it. We would never do it, even if we were free to.” Peckham confirmed that Melrose would sack the GKN board if its takeover bid was successful, leaving the business to be run by the management teams of the different divisions. Earlier, a group of 16 cross-party MPs wrote to the business secretary, urging him to block the proposed takeover. Before the session the 16 MPs asked Clark to intervene to prevent a “world-class” industrial company from being “dismembered”, relating to concerns that Melrose would break the 259-year-old company into pieces before selling it off. “A takeover of GKN by Melrose is highly likely to mean the break-up of GKN, and the selling on – and possible disappearance – of several of its constituent important components including its aerospace, driveline, powder metallurgy and additive divisions,” the MPs wrote, according to the Financial Times. The company employs about 58,000 people, with 6,000 in the UK. The Pensions Regulator warned separately that the potential deal was likely to have a “detrimental impact” on the company’s ability to fund its pension scheme. In a letter published by the House of Commons work and pensions committee, the regulator wrote: “From the outset we have been concerned that the increased leverage involved in the proposed takeover by Melrose is likely to have a detrimental impact on covenant.” Melrose said it had a strong track record on pensions and would put money into the GKN scheme. During the course of the hearing, Melrose’s three senior executives revealed they had each earned about £40m so far in the financial year to the end of March, with the package boosted by the end of a five-year incentive plan which paid out in shares. After the committee session, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, highlighted the profits the “big bosses of Melrose could receive … if this takeover goes ahead”. She added: “Management has failed to give any clear assurances or definite commitments on the future of GKN. The government must intervene and investigate this matter urgently.” Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “For shareholders, workers and pension holders, Melrose should do more than point to its track record with smaller acquisitions. “Melrose should set out their plans for applying for clearance from the Pensions Regulator and the areas in which they would be willing to consider making formal post-offer undertakings regarding their future plans for the business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/06/markets-trump-trade-wars-gkn-takeover-uk-insolvencies","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T21:24:40Z","webTitle":"Korean summit plans cheer markets as Paul Ryan calls for 'surgical' tariffs - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/06/markets-trump-trade-wars-gkn-takeover-uk-insolvencies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/06/markets-trump-trade-wars-gkn-takeover-uk-insolvencies","fields":{"headline":"Korean summit plans cheer markets as Paul Ryan calls for 'surgical' tariffs - as it happened","bodyText":"And finally, Wall Street has ended the day pretty much where it started it. The Dow closed just 9 points higher at 24,884, as traders watched to see how the to-ing and fro-ing over tariffs will play out. Paul Ryan’s call for ‘surgical’ tariffs, targeting countries who dump steel on America, confirms he’s not happy with Donald Trump’s plans and wants to water them down. But it’s also a sign that some form of protectionist policies are heading our way. If so, a trade war can’t be discounted.... On that cheery note - goodnight! GW Barry Gardiner MP, shadow Secretary of State for International Trade, is calling for the UK government to take a tougher line over Trump’s tariffs. Gardiner (a member of the opposition Labour party) says strong action is needed: “President Trump has made clear his appetite for a trade war. It started with Bombardier, and has now moved on to steel and aluminium. We are seeing a real threat to thousands of British jobs linked to UK exports to the US. On top of that there is a risk that other steel exporting countries try to reroute their surplus capacity from the US into the UK. “We need strong government action now, including at a multilateral level through the WTO, before entire sectors of UK industry are left wondering who’s next.” Ding! European stock markets have closed, with cautious optimism pushing shares higher. The FTSE 100 ended the day up 30 points at 7,146, up 0.4%. Germany’s DAX gained 0.2%, but the standout performer was Italy’s FTSE MIB which jumped by 1.75%. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, says the prospect of North and South Korea holding a summit next month boosted risk appetite in the markets: North Korea has agreed to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests, whilst engaging in dialogue with South Korea. North Korea has also expressed an interest in holding talks with the US. These comments were made by Kim Jong Un to South Korea’s national security chief in what can only be described as a complete change in tune from the rogue nation. The growing opposition to Donald Trump’s tariffs from, among others, Gary Cohn and Paul Ryan is also soothing investors, she adds: Fears over a trade war appear to be abating as opposition to the measures, even from with Trump’s own party are increasing. Whilst trade war fears haven’t been completely erased, its fair to say that there are increasing doubts as to whether Trump will be able to go ahead with such a risky economic policy. However.... The US stock market isn’t quite as cheerful; the main indices are in the red as New York heads for lunch... Wall Street’s early rally is fizzling out. The Dow is now down 130 points, or 0.5%, having been up over 100 points at the open. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, has warned the markets not to get complacent about the dangers of a trade war: “While the deficit with China was the initial focus of much of Trump’s ire, the real casualties of the proposed trade tariffs on steel and aluminium would be Canada and Mexico – both close allies. This may be part of a wider negotiating tact, flexing muscles in the run up to NAFTA negotiations. However, steel and aluminium import volumes make up little of the overall deficit, hence the actual economic impact of these tariffs is likely to be minimal. But the ripple effect is as yet unknowable if it causes further retaliation beyond words. Moreover, if these tariffs are a precursor to tougher trade relations with China, which alone accounts for over half to the US trade deficit, then this friction could have economic consequences. “At the moment markets largely seem unaffected, but if the war of words turns into actual tariffs and a trade war, markets are likely to react sharply. What began as campaign trail bombast, now risks undermining the success of the administration’s biggest achievement to date – better economic growth as a result of tax reforms.Let’s hope the globalists in the Trump administration prevail over the trade warriors.’ John Higgins of Capital Economics says emerging markets could be badly hit: Donald Trump’s bite may yet match his bark. In this case, we would expect the US dollar to rebound against the Mexican peso and the currencies of many other emerging economies, despite their weaker direct trade ties with the US. Admittedly, the US president’s attitude to trade is not the only influence on the exchange rates of emerging market currencies. This can clearly be seen in the case of the Korean won. It has appreciated by more against the greenback so far this month than any other currency in the Fed’s broad dollar index, amid signs of a thawing of relations between North and South Korea. But more generally, renewed concerns about a global trade war would almost certainly hit demand for “risky” emerging market currencies again, as it did initially after Trump’s inflammatory “tweets”. What’s more, it is likely that the prices of many commodities would fall back once more, adversely affecting some emerging market countries’ terms of trade. The flipside would probably be a renewed strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, which are perceived to be “safe havens”. These were two of the biggest beneficiaries against the US dollar at the very outset of March, but they have since given back much of their gains. In another twist, Trump’s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has just declared that Mexico and Canada could be exempted from new steel and aluminium tariffs. Testifying to Congress, Mnuchin says that Canada wouldn’t be subject to them... IF the NAFTA trade deal is successfully renegotiated. There’s growing speculation that Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s top economic advisor, could quit the White House over the tariffs row. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, is fighting a rearguard action against Trump’s plan -- calling in US business leaders who firms would be hit if steel and aluminium imports were costlier. Bloomberg reports that Trump suspects that Cohn could walk if he can’t change the president’s mind.... President Donald Trump has told advisers that he believes economic adviser Gary Cohn will leave his White House job if Trump decides to go forward with tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, people familiar with the matter say. Cohn has mounted a last-ditch effort, along with other administration officials and some Republican lawmakers, to head off steep tariffs that threaten to unleash a global trade war. Cohn has been summoning executives from U.S. companies that depend on the metals to meet this week with Trump to try to blunt or halt the tariffs, according to those familiar with the meeting planning. It’s unclear whether Cohn’s moves would be enough to change the president’s mind. In a classic Trump move, the president has added to the mystery by tweeting that he’s always looking to shake-up his staff in search for ‘perfection’ (aim high, Mr President!) More here: Here’s a chart putting January’s fall in US factory orders into context: Newsflash: Top Republican Paul Ryan has called for ‘surgical’ tariffs to be imposed on countries who are dumping steel and aluminium on the US economy. Speaking to reporters in Washington, House speaker Ryan says Donald Trump is right to point out that “some abuse” is occurring. Some countries, such as China, are dumping steel at unfairly low prices, he says. But rather than a blanket tariff, Ryan argues that America needs a ‘smart’ approach. Tariffs should be targeted so they focus on this ‘legitimate’ problem, rather than covering all countries, he said. As Ryan puts it: There clearly is dumping and trans-shipping of steel and aluminium. That’s absolutely happening. There’s a big overcapacity problem. Let’s go and focus on that. Let’s focus on the abusers of that. That’s why we think the proper approach is a more surgical approach, so we do not have unintended consequences”. In other words, this could avoid the risk of triggering a global trade war, and tit-for-tat retaliation from the European Union or Canada, for example. Just in: US factories have suffered their biggest drop in orders in six months. New orders for US-made goods shrank by 1.4% in January, new figures from the Commerce department show. That’s the worst performance since last July, and follows a 1.8% gain in December. The decline was mainly driven by transport orders, which shrank 10% thanks to a drop in demand for civilian aircraft (a fairly volatile market). Stripping out transport, and the underlying orders were up by 0.4% - compared to 0.8% in December. The markets may be up, but there’s no escape from Brexit anxiety. Today’s warning comes from the head of carmaker Vauxhall, who has warned that the lack of clarity over Britain’s exit from the EU threatens the future of its Ellesmere Port factory in North West England. Carlos Tavares, chief executive of French parent PSA, told the BBC that the lack of clarity over Brexit is “a big concern”, and could threaten Ellesmere Port’s chances of getting more work after 2021. Tavares adds: “We cannot invest in a world of uncertainty. No one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome.” The New York stock market has just opened....and stocks are rising. The Dow has gained 80 points, or 0.3%, and there are similar gains on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Traders are encouraged by the news that North and South Korea have agreed to hold a summit next month. As some of the geopolitical risk within the markets falls, shares rise and the US dollar dips. Wall Street is also reacting to speculation that Donald Trump could be persuaded not to implement tariffs on steel and aluminium - in the face of opposition from other countries and criticism from domestic politicians including US House speaker Paul Ryan. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: Risk appetite has improved on headlines North Korea has expressed a willingness to talk about denuclearization, according to South Korea. The North is apparently willing to discuss surrendering its nuclear weapons and freeze nuclear and missile programmes if it begins direct talks with the US. This is a dramatic easing of tensions. It follows a visit by senior South Korean politicians. Now it has emerged that Kim Jong-un will be meeting South Korean president Moon Jae-in in late April. Meanwhile fears over Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium have also eased after top Republicans advised against the plan. The US president has poured a little cold water over the markets’ enthusiasm, warning that the breakthrough between North Korea and South Korea could be ‘false hope’. Here’s political scientist Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group on the Korean breakthrough: Oil is also rallying, on hopes of detente between the two Koreas. Brent crude has gained almsot 1% to $66.09 per barrel. Here’s my colleague Benjamin Haas in Gangneung, South Korea, on the breakthrough with North Korea today that has cheered the markets. North Korea is willing to discuss relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and will freeze its nuclear and missile programmes if it begins direct talks with the US, in a dramatic easing of tensions following a visit by senior South Korean politicians. The country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, will also meet his South Korean counterpart, president Moon Jae-in, in late April in the first summit of its kind in over a decade, Seoul’s presidential office said. The two leaders will meet at Panmunjom, the only part of the highly militarised border where the North and South have any kind of contact. North Korea pledged to not use conventional or nuclear weapons against its neighbour, despite frequent threats from Pyongyang. The two sides have remained in a technical state of war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. “The North side clearly affirmed its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and said it would have no reason to possess nuclear weapons should the safety of its regime be guaranteed and military threats against North Korea removed,” a South Korean presidential spokesman said, according to the Yonhap news agency. “The South and the North have agreed to set up a hotline between their leaders to allow close consultations and a reduction of military tension, while also agreeing to hold the first phone conversation before the third South-North summit..... More here: The South Korean won is getting a big boost - gaining 1.1% against the US dollar following the reports of a breakthrough with North Korea. The US dollar has suddenly slumped, and Wall Street futures have rallied, following reports that North and South Korea have agreed to hold a summit next month. This would be the first such summit in a decade, and could signal that relations between Seoul and Pyongyang are thawing. According to media reports, North Korea has also agreed to suspend all weapons testing during the summit in April. And in what could be a very significant move, North Korea has reportedly indicated that it could be willing to dispose of its nuclear technology. South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office says (via Bloomberg): “North Korea has clearly expressed its intention for denuclearlization on the Korean peninsula, and if there is no military threat, and North Korea’s regime security is promised, they have clarified that there is no reason to hold nuclear weapons.” The prospect of tensions easing between North Korea and South Korea, and with the United States, has had an immediate impact on the markets. The US dollar has fallen against other currencies -- typically a sign that investors are less nervous. It’s lost half a cent against the pound, to $1.39. The US stock market is also expected to jump when it opens later today. Department chain John Lewis has given us an insight into the damage caused by last week’s disruptively snowy weather. Total sales for the week slumped by 14.4% on the same period last year, the company says, despite “an incredible effort to support trading” by its staff. Electricals and Home Technology sales were down 6.3%, however heating products were up 265% on this week -- perhaps caused by households whose boilers failed in the big freeze. Sales of tumble dryers were up too, as families struggled with an avalanche of wet clothing. But every snowcloud has a silver lining -- sales of hats, gloves and scarfs with sales up 38%. Sales of boots were also up 36% compared to last year. A round of applause for City AM please.... After three hours of trading, Europe’s stock markets are holding onto their early gains. The FTSE 100 is up 71 points, or 1.01%, at 7,187 - extending yesterday’s recovery from Friday night’s 14-month low. Italy’s stock market is now leading the charge, up 1.4%, despite the political deadlock created by Sunday’s general election. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at Centtrip, predicts that the recovery will continue - if fears of a trade war continue to ebb away. “Global stock markets continue to trade within their medium-term trading range after another sell-off last week. “We expect they will continue to rise as fears of a trade war have subsided and there is some optimism that a Brexit transitional deal will be reached. Meanwhile, the Italian election had no major surprising outcomes, but the strong support for North League will unnerve the European Central Bank with its Eurosceptic stance. “As risk appetite has returned, we expect the Pound and the Euro will strengthen against the US Dollar.” Italian government bonds are also strengthening, even though populist parties secured around half the votes on Sunday. Back to trade war fears..... and Bloomberg is reporting that the EU is drawing up its retaliation if Donald Trump imposes tariffs on steel and aluminium. Levi’s jeans, bourbon and US motorbikes are all on the list of products that could be slapped with a 25% tariff..... Here’s the details: The European Union is preparing punitive tariffs on iconic U.S. brands produced in key Republican constituencies, raising political pressure on President Donald Trump to ditch his plans for taxing steel and aluminum imports. Targeting €2.8bn ($3.5bn) of American goods, the EU aims to apply a 25 percent tit-for-tat levy on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products imported from the U.S. if Trump follows through on his tariff threat, according to a list drawn up by the European Commission and obtained by Bloomberg News. The list of targeted U.S. goods -- including motorcycles, jeans and bourbon whiskey -- sends a political message to Washington about the potential domestic economic costs of making good on the president’s threat.

It’ll be sold at a 20% discount in BrewDog bars to those who identify as women - to highlight the gender pay gap. Why, I hear you cry, would anyone do this? BrewDog say it’s “a send-up of the lazy marketing efforts targeting the female market”, and their way of helping to tackle inequality. It is also promising to donate 20% (the gender pay gap in the UK) of its proceeds from bottled Pink IPA and Punk IPA to causes that fight against gender inequality. Sarah Warman, BrewDog’s Global Head of Marketing, says the company wants to help get more women into the beer-making industry. She adds: “Sexism in the beer industry is rife. We can no longer ignore that its existence prevents plenty of incredible women joining our eclectic and exciting industry. There is a long history of products that pander and patronise through harmful, sexist stereotypes and vulgar imagery, and we’re rallying to put an end to this nonsense. The love of beer is not gendered. Beer is universal. Beer is for everyone.” However, launching a pink beer for girls, even ironically, may not be the best way forwards. BrewDog is already getting a savaging on social media, including from Labour MP Jo Stevens: Here’s City AM’s Alys Key.... ..and writer Chloe Combi: But... Daniel Pryor of the Adam Smith Institute likes the idea Newsflash: The UK government has launched an investigation into the way the Co-operative Bank was regulated in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The probe will focus on Co-op’s failed attempt to take over more than 600 branches from Lloyds. That bid collapsed in early 2013 when the problems on Co-op’s balance sheet came to light. Here’s Reuters’ take: The British government on Tuesday asked the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to investigate its oversight of Cooperative Bank, in an independent review aimed at shedding light on how the troubled lender was supervised during 2008 and 2013. It said the investigation would focus on the Cooperative Bank’s failed bid for 632 branches of Lloyds Banking Group in 2013. The PRA said it supported the call to launch an independent review of its supervision during a disruptive period for the bank, which was later found to suffer from significant funding problems and poor corporate governance. “Since it was established in 2013, the PRA has been committed to learning the lessons of the past and the findings of this review will help the PRA meet its objectives in the future”, the regulator said in a statement. Paul Flowers, the former Co-op Bank chairman who was dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist’ after being caught in a drugs scandal in 2013, has been banned from working in the City. The Financial Conduct Authority has ruled that Flowers had shown “a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services”. Flowers’ chairman-ship of the Co-op Bank was not a great success. The bank was taken over by hedge funds after a massive black hole opened in its accounts. He also suffered a fearful grilling before MPs, where he revealed he didn’t know the size of the Bank’s assets. He fell from grace after being filmed apparently counting out £300 to buy cocaine and crystal meth in a drugs deal. He was later convicted of possession, which let to his dismissal as a minister by the Methodist Church. But, perhaps surprisingly, Flowers hasn’t been banned for these failings. Instead, the FCA has sanctioned him for misusing his Co-op email account and mobile phone for, err, adult services. In a ruling published this morning, the FCA says that Flowers: used his work mobile telephone to make a number of inappropriate telephone calls to a premium rate chat line in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies; and used his work email account to send and receive sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs, in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies despite having been previously warned about his earlier misconduct. The parliamentary session on the GKN takeover is underway - it’s being streamed live here. We’ll keep an ear on it..... A group of cross-party MPs has urged business secretary Greg Clark to block the proposed £7bn hostile takeover of the British engineering company GKN by turnaround specialist Melrose. That ratchets up the tensions ahead of this morning’s session at parliament, where Melrose and GKN bosses will face MPs. Angela Monaghan explains: Ahead of this select committee appearance by executives from both companies on Tuesday, the 16 MPs asked Clark to intervene in order to prevent a “world class” industrial company from being “dismembered”, relating to concerns that Melrose would break the 259-year-old company into pieces before selling it off. “A takeover of GKN by Melrose is highly likely to mean the break-up of GKN, and the selling on – and possible disappearance – of several of its constituent important components including its aerospace, driveline, powder metallurgy and additive divisions,” the MPs wrote, according to the Financial Times. Britain is facing a sharp jump in business failures, according to a new report from trade insurer Euler Hermes. Euler Hermes warned overnight that the number of insolvencies in the UK will increase by +8% in 2018. That follows a 5% rise in 2017, as firm struggle to cope with rising costs and falling consumer confidence. It says: The UK will experience the second largest rise in business failures of any of the major global economies this year as uncertainties about Brexit become more pronounced. While China is expected to suffer a 10% jump in insolvencies, the picture is brighter in Europe. France (-7%), Germany (-4%), Netherlands (-5%) and Belgium (-5%) are all expected to see a drop in business failures, thanks to the strengthening European economy. A jump in insolvencies can have a serious knock-on effect on the wider economy, as firms lay off staff and default on payments to suppliers. Milo Bogaerts, Chief Executive, Euler Hermes UK and Ireland, explains: The rise in insolvencies has the potential to start a domino effect of overdue or non-payment which, as we have seen in recent months, can impact large companies and smaller suppliers throughout entire supply chains. At the same time, two possible base rate increases (+50bp to 1%) this year may progressively translate into higher interest costs for companies and households. Monitoring client and supplier payment behaviour is key given the high levels of uncertainty, company debt and thin corporate margins in some sectors. Worryingly, Euler Hermes predicts that UK corporate investment will shrink by up to 3% in the run up to Brexit in 2019, as firms hunker down. There’s a frisson of takeover action in the City this morning. Shares in packaging firm Smurfit Kappa have soared by almost 20% after it received a takeover bid from US rival International Paper Company. Smurfit - described by the FT as “Europe’s largest cardboard box maker” - has firmly rejected the approach, claiming it doesn’t reflect its full value. Liam O’Mahony, Chairman of Smurfit Kappa, says the company would be better off remaining independent. He says: “The Board of Smurfit Kappa has unanimously rejected this unsolicited and highly opportunistic Proposal. It does not reflect the Group’s true intrinsic business worth or its prospects. Shares in rival packaging firms, such as Mondi and DS Smith, have also jumped this morning as investors anticipate a wave of mergers and consolidation across the sector. The president and CEO of Volvo has warned that it could abandon expansion plans in America, if Donald Trump triggers a trade war. Volvo has just built a new car-making plant in South Carolina, which employs four thousand people. Speaking at the Geneva Motor Show, Hakan Samuelsson told Bloomberg TV that half the cars build in Carolina are exported -- so effectively Volvo has already created 2,000 jobs in America that could have gone elsewhere. Volvo had been planning to expand the plant to create another 2,000 jobs, but Samuelsson warns that this could be at risk. If we cannot trade freely, you question can you really employ two thousand extra people? Samuelsson added that it’s “too early to speculate”, but insists that protectionism should be resisted. If you think it through, everyone will see that it’s beneficial for everyone to trade freely. We believe in free trade and it’s good for everybody. A risk-on feeling has pushed European stock markets higher in early trading. Investors are putting trade war fears, and the inconclusive Italian election, behind them (for now, anyway). Germany is leading the charge, up 1.27%, with the UK’s FTSE 100 up almost 1%. In Milan, the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 1% too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the City is reassured to see top Republicans, such as speaker Paul Ryan, break with Trump and oppose a trade war. While this signals yet more destabilising discord for the President, investors’ primary focus was on the tariff-blocking obstacles created by Ryan and co., and their relief was immediate to see. There’s relief in the markets that other world leaders haven’t retaliated against the US over the planned tariffs on steel and aluminium. In particular, Beijing has taken a cautious stance, with Chinese officials insisting they don’t want a trade war with America. That’s helping to push shares higher today. But Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, warns that this situation may not last. On the back of this pause in trade tensions, currencies and equities are able to breathe easier with the major European currency pairs and the US equity markets leading the gains, which has started the week on a positive footing. However, this respite from risk aversion should be treated as just a break and traders need to remain cautious until we get a clear response from China, and the Eurozone, to Trump’s protectionist decision. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The financial markets are rebounding today, as fears over an imminent global trade war recede. Investors are betting that president Trump will back away from triggering a protectionist clash that would hurt global growth. With top Republicans like Paul Ryan criticising Trump’s proposed tariffs, hope is building that a compromise will be found. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: Investors seem to believe that President Trump is using his “Art of the Deal” skills to get a better trade deals with the rest of the world or, as Ray Dalio, the Bridgewater Associates founder, wrote on Monday: “what is happening now is more for political show than for real threatening.” Trump tweeted yesterday that “Tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair NAFTA agreement is signed”. This confirms my belief that this mess will likely end up with Mexico, E.U. and China taking a less protectionist stance, rather than the U.S. taking a stronger one. So after several days of losses, Asian markets are rebounding with Japan’s Nikkei jumping by almost 2%. Hong Kong is up over 2%, with China’s main markets gaining 1%. European markets are also heading for gains, with Britain’s FTSE 100 rallying up to 60 points in early trading. However, investors should still be cautious. As the World Trade Organisation warned yesterday, a global trade war could leave the world in a “deep recession”.

The as-yet-unnamed series is the first for Lilley since 2014’s Jonah from Tonga was screened by the ABC and the BBC and came under fire for its portrayal of Tongan culture and Lilley’s use of “brown face”. Jonah from Tonga was withdrawn from Māori Television after New Zealand’s minister for Pacific peoples Alfred Ngaro said the series perpetuated “negative stereotypes”. Netflix will be hoping to emulate the success Lilley had more than a decade ago with Summer Heights High, which featured a range of his characters and led to a deal with the ABC, the BBC and HBO. His longtime collaborator Laura Waters, whose production company Princess Pictures made We Can Be Heroes, Angry Boys, Ja’mie: Private School Girl and Jonah, told Guardian Australia she was working with Lilley in a personal capacity and Princess Pictures was not involved. She declined to give any more details about the project. The series was announced not by Netflix but by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who claimed it would generate $6.35m for the local economy. “I am delighted to have enticed Chris Lilley and producer Laura Waters to Queensland,” the premier said. “The series will employ up to 250 Queensland cast and extras, plus around 100 Queensland crew.” The comedy will add to Netflix’s Australian slate, which includes Tidelands, Pine Gap, The New Legends of Monkey, Glitch, Beat Bugs, Bottersnikes &amp; Gumbles, Kazoops, Mako Mermaids: An H20 Adventure and White Rabbit Project. Lilley has had patchy success on Australian television. Summer Heights High was the ABC’s bestselling comedy DVD and had audiences in excess of 1.2 million. Its ratings success in 2007 was not repeated by ABC TV productions of Ja’mie and Jonah in 2014. The Hollywood Reporter said the Ja’mie character was funnier in short, searing scenes in Summer Heights High, and could not carry a whole series. “ Centering one of Lilley’s most annoying characters in a series to ramble on incessantly robs the character of its past effectiveness and makes her – and the series – almost unbearable to watch.” Last year Lilley faced more controversy when he posted a remix on his Instagram account of a music clip from his Angry Boys character S.Mouse, called Squashed Nigga, amid protests about the death of the Indigenous boy Elijah Doughty. Doughty had been killed when he was run over by a man driving a Nissan Navara in August 2016. Lilley later deleted the video and apologised, saying it was in no way connected to Doughty’s death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/07/australia-putting-too-few-eggs-in-export-basket-andrew-leigh-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Australia putting too few eggs in export basket, Andrew Leigh warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/australia-putting-too-few-eggs-in-export-basket-andrew-leigh-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/07/australia-putting-too-few-eggs-in-export-basket-andrew-leigh-warns","fields":{"headline":"Australia putting too few eggs in export basket, Andrew Leigh warns","bodyText":"Is Australia’s economy diverse enough? Dr Andrew Leigh, the shadow assistant treasurer, believes policymakers need to think deeply about the economy’s level of complexity. In a speech to the Insurance Council of Australia, Leigh will warn on Wednesday that despite the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, the complexity of the products Australia exports has become “simpler” in recent decades when compared with products exported by other advanced economies. He will say economic complexity is a good predictor of a country’s level of income and future economic growth, and Australia is now ranking “badly” compared with its peers. He will also say if the Turnbull government doesn’t secure an exemption for Australia from Donald Trump’s proposed new steel and aluminium tariffs, it will make Australia a less complex economy, too. “We need to encourage a wider variety of export industries.” Leigh will say the economic principle of comparative advantage tells us the world can become richer when countries specialise in what they produce best, before then engaging in global trade. But too much specialisation can create excess risk, he says. “If your national prosperity strategy relies on exporting sugar, you’re going to be at risk when diet soft drinks take over.” Leigh will say a useful way of thinking about a country’s degree of specialisation is the Harvard Atlas of Complexity, which was developed a decade ago by a team led by Ricardo Hausmann. The atlas starts with the idea that some products are more complex than others. To make medical imaging devices or jet engines takes plenty of knowledge and extensive networks of people. To make wood logs or coffee beans requires less knowledge and smaller networks. It shows the world’s most complex economies are Japan, Switzerland and Germany, and the three least complex economies are Cameroon, Guinea and Nigeria. How does Australia fare on the Economic Complexity Index? In a word, badly. “Out of 122 economies that the experts have assessed, we come 65th , just below halfway,” Leigh will say. “For a nation that consistently ranks among the top 20 for our income per person, this is an astonishingly poor performance.” Leigh will say it isn’t just that Australia exports relatively few products; it’s that the products we export tend to be exported by undiversified countries. And Australia’s lack of complexity is not simply a response to the mining boom – it turns out that even before the boom, our exports weren’t particularly complex. “Over the longer run, Hausmann and his colleagues estimate that Australia’s economic complexity ranking stayed pretty constant from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, then fell markedly over the past generation,” Leigh will say. “On their measures, we have never been an especially complex economy. But we’ve gotten a lot ‘simpler’ in recent years.” Leigh admits there are limitations to the atlas methodology. He will say services exports are excluded, which means higher education, tourism, financial services and legal services exports are not counted. And the Hausmann approach looks only at trade, so a nation could in theory have a complex and diversified domestic market, but sell only simple products to the rest of the world. “But just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of any growth theory is how it predicts growth,” he will say. “And anyone who wants to airily dismiss the Atlas of Complexity needs to explain the fact that it has a pretty good track record of forecasting past economic growth across nations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/06/worlds-oldest-message-bottle-western-australia-wedge-island","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:40:10Z","webTitle":"World's oldest message in a bottle found by beachwalker in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/worlds-oldest-message-bottle-western-australia-wedge-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/worlds-oldest-message-bottle-western-australia-wedge-island","fields":{"headline":"World's oldest message in a bottle found by beachwalker in Australia","bodyText":"The world’s oldest message in a bottle has been found on a beach in Western Australia by a couple who thought it might “look good on a bookshelf”. Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island in January. Her husband, Kym Illman, told Guardian Australia she initially thought it was rubbish but picked it up because it had distinct, raised lettering and would be at home on their bookshelf. Inside, she found a roll of paper printed in German and dated to 12 June 1886, which was authenticated by the Western Australian Museum. “It was an absolute fluke. It won’t get better than than this,” said husband Kym Illman. The bottle had been thrown overboard from the German sailing ship Paula in 1886 as it crossed the Indian Ocean, 950km from the Australian coast, according to Ross Anderson, the museum’s assistant curator of maritime archaeology. At the time, German ships were conducting a 69-year experiment that involved throwing thousands of bottles into the sea to track ocean currents. Each message was marked with the ship’s coordinates, the date, and the name of the ship, which Anderson used to verify the message. Details from the Illmans’ message matched Paula’s maritime records, and Anderson also compared handwriting samples with captain’s entries in Paula’s meteorological journal. “Incredibly, there was an entry for June 12, 1886, made by the captain, recording a drift bottle having been thrown overboard,” Anderson said. His finding was confirmed by experts at the German Naval Observatory. The previous record for oldest message in a bottle was 108 years. Kym Illman said that after bringing it home the damp and ancient paper was put in the oven for five minutes to dry it out. He added: “I have a basic understanding of German and it said could the finder please plot the coordinates it was found, and the date it was found, and send it back.” Of the thousands jettisoned, 662 other messages from the same German experiment have been found and returned before the latest discovery. The most recent was found in 1934."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/06/kelly-odwyer-coalition-female-fighting-fund-candidates","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T05:53:35Z","webTitle":"Kelly O'Dwyer calls for 'fighting fund' to finance female Coalition candidates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/kelly-odwyer-coalition-female-fighting-fund-candidates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/kelly-odwyer-coalition-female-fighting-fund-candidates","fields":{"headline":"Kelly O'Dwyer calls for 'fighting fund' to finance female Coalition candidates","bodyText":"Kelly O’Dwyer has said she wants to establish a “fighting fund” for Coalition women who want to enter federal politics so they have the financial firepower needed to run effective campaigns at election time. The minister for women said she would happily travel the country to fundraise for the purpose because more Liberal and Nationals women were needed in Canberra. Speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday, O’Dwyer also drew attention to the Liberal party’s pre-selection process, saying more needed to be done inside the party to help women become candidates. She said the party had had many firsts when it came to women – the first woman elected to parliament, the first female president of the Senate, and the first female foreign and defence ministers – but the proportion of female Liberal candidates had to increase. “I think we need to be pretty frank with the party organisation when we say, you know, the buck stops with you,” she said. “You need to highlight the fact that we need to get more women in parliament, we need to look at what barriers there are and we need to eliminate them.” She was speaking ahead of International Women’s Day, which is on Thursday. The opposition spokeswoman for women, Tanya Plibersek, will speak at the press club on Wednesday. O’Dwyer touched on Barnaby Joyce’s affair with his staffer, Vikki Campion, and welcomed Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to update the ministerial code of conduct – in the aftermath of the affair – to prohibit sexual relations between ministers and their staff. She said it would require ministers to adopt a higher standard of behaviour, and she dismissed the idea it would overturn “the press gallery journalists’ convention” of generally not reporting on the private lives of politicians. “It should be noted that the reporting on Barnaby Joyce predated the code of conduct so the idea that the code has created a new licence for intrusion into politicians’ lives is nonsense,” she said. O’Dwyer said she was proud to call herself a feminist. She said the #MeToo movement had successfully used social media to send a message about the need to end harassment, and that sexual harassment and violence against women “must never be tolerated”. But she said everyone needed to think about the implications, “both good and bad”, that come with the airing of allegations in public. “Social media is not a courtroom, and complainants, and those who are the subject of complaints, can be subject to trial by keyboard warriors,” she said. “Natural justice is a fundamental tenet of our legal system – it is something that we value in the land of the ‘fair-go’ – and it is often absent in the wild web. “We need to be careful that this public push doesn’t silence the very women it wants to help. We don’t want women to be afraid that their reputation will forever be tarnished when someone types their name into Google.” O’Dwyer also said the gender pay gap had fallen under the Turnbull government by 1.9 percentage points – to 15.3% – a 12-year low, but more needed to be done. She said workplaces needed to become more flexible so more men could work part-time to help care for children. She said of men who were employed, 81% were working full-time and 19% are working part-time, whereas for employed women, 53% were full-time and 47% part-time. “This is what I call the ‘flexibility gap’,” she said. O’Dwyer also said planned to work with internet providers, and communications minister Mitch Fifield, to make cyber space safer for girls. The Labor party and Greens have consistently criticised the Coalition for their lack of female representation. At the 2016 election, the number of female candidates elected for the Coalition comprised just 19.8%, while Labor (44%) and the Greens (50%) were much higher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/brendan-farrell-if-we-dont-support-farmers-in-10-years-well-be-importing-100-of-our-food","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T00:52:00Z","webTitle":"Brendan Farrell: 'If we don’t support farmers, in 10 years we’ll be importing 100% of our food'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/brendan-farrell-if-we-dont-support-farmers-in-10-years-well-be-importing-100-of-our-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/brendan-farrell-if-we-dont-support-farmers-in-10-years-well-be-importing-100-of-our-food","fields":{"headline":"Brendan Farrell: 'If we don’t support farmers, in 10 years we’ll be importing 100% of our food'","bodyText":"Never ask a truck driver what the inside of his cab looks like. “That’s a bit personal,” Brendan Farrell arcs up. He’s had enough of those kind of questions and refuses point-blank to answer any about family or upbringing either. That’s fair enough. Farrell is a man on a mission. The fourth-generation farmer from Burrumbuttock, New South Wales, has been organising massive convoys of hay to drought-stricken farmers since 2014. Last year 260 trucks and 400 trailers carted 14,000 bales to Ilfracombe in central-west Queensland, where his crew also helped build bar facilities at the racecourse. In January this year, on his 13th run, 150 trucks and 200 trailers took $2m worth of hay to Cunnamulla in south-west Queensland. Yet it’s a lo-fi operation. Farrell posts a Facebook message about where the next hay run is going and the potential dates, then drivers contact him offering their trucks, which will be loaded with donated hay. Farrell puts their names and phone numbers on a sheet of paper, which may or may not be kept in the cab of his truck. “We put on entertainment,” he says. “We take country music singers and we have a few beers with the locals who are doing it tough, so we feed their animals, feed their souls.” Everyone wants a piece of Farrell. Considering Australia’s most successful cultural exports are probably Crocodile Dundee and Steve Irwin, it’s no surprise the media – locally and internationally – loves this true-blue Aussie in cut-off denim shorts and with a laugh like Wolf Creek’s Mick Taylor. He is cast as a man for the people, particularly after making the honour roll of 2016’s NSW Australian of the Year awards as the local hero. “A lot of people want me to be the face of the outback,” he concedes. “We had Lara Bingle, years ago, promoting Australia: ‘Where the bloody hell are you?’ Now a lot of people want me to be that in the outback because they are hurting.” The hay runners are certainly welcomed ecstatically when they arrive in a town. The problem – as Farrell’s assistant keeps telling him – is with his propensity to swear and his healthy disregard for politicians (“I make them look silly. They don’t want to come near me”). He’s the sort of public speaker who could cause fireworks. A great deal of that is attributable to stress. Farrell isn’t a faceless charity; he’s very much the heart and soul of the operation. He is the bloke who answers the phone and is aghast when I suggest we do our interview next time he pulls over for lunch. He doesn’t pull over for lunch. “When you realise that you’re trying to move mountains and your phone just keeps ringing and ringing from people that want help, you start snapping at people,” he says. “Then you go to bed and go, ‘Why can’t I help these people? Why, why, why?’ And then you start putting yourself down – ‘I should have done more. I should have done that extra 25%’ – and all of a sudden you’re in depression.” Conditions, he says, are woeful. “It hasn’t rained. Queensland outback has their rain December to middle of March, so [there is only] three weeks to get decent rain from Longreach right down to the Queensland border for any hope for grass to grow for the cattle to eat. Same with outback New South Wales.” He’s fed up with premiers and other politicians flying in on private jets for photo opportunities, then leaving without understanding the depth of the problem. “I’ve said, ‘Come out here in the scrub, in the flies, the heat and the shit, and take a look,’” he says. “Politicians don’t care about farmers because the majority of voters are all along the east coast. I don’t see 4,000 head of cattle in Pymble [in Sydney’s affluent north shore]. There’s 4,000 head of cattle near where I’m sitting now getting hand fed. They will go into steaks in Woolworths and feed voters. That’s what I’ve got to get across. If we don’t support our farmers now, in 10 years’ time we’re going to be importing 100% of Australian food.” Farrell is in Bourke when we speak and he reckons he has never seen the Darling River so low. “We need to pipe the centre of the outback because the waterways we had 100 years ago are not here any more. Now we’ve got big corporations that buy up water licences. They don’t care about third-generation farmers; they want to buy them out. There was one company that bought 14 stations from Bourke to Cunnamulla. That hurts communities.” Suicide rates in rural areas are consistently 40% higher than those in metropolitan areas. A new study published in the Journal of Rural Health this year found that suicide by Australian farmers came down to six interrelated themes: masculinity, uncertainty and lack of control over farming, feelings of failure, escalating health problems, inability to cope with stress and an acquired capability to commit suicide, with access to means. It has got Farrell worried. “People in the outback have to learn to vent,” Farrell says. “I get my own counselling done. I have to. I tell people, ‘When the black dog bites, it bites hard.’” He somehow finds time to make videos for the Burrumbuttock Hay Runners Facebook page that aim to educate and appeal for donations, which are made to the Rotary Club of Sydney. The hay runners aren’t a registered charity, due to Farrell’s dislike of bureaucracy. “I’ve helped 12,500 farmers in four years and I don’t have to have a meeting about a meeting,” he says. “If the Australian people put in a dollar to a charity, they’ve actually donated about 40 cents. The rest goes to an administration fee, taxes and all this other horseshit. With me, that whole dollar goes into fuel for the trucks.” Instead, he relies on inspiring the public and private companies to act. And act they do, fundraising through barbecues and sporting events. One couple even asked their wedding guests to donate money rather than give presents. In travelling to these outback communities, weary though he may be, Farrell has earned an even deeper appreciation of the land. “When you get to the Longreach area, there are the most beautiful sunsets you will ever see,” he says and the change in his tone is audible. “You can lay out there in the the middle of the scrub and almost touch the sun. As I’m talking to you now, it’s going down over north Bourke and it’s an absolute pearler.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/tuesday-briefing-another-russian-poisoning-mystery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T06:34:22Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Another Russian poisoning mystery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/tuesday-briefing-another-russian-poisoning-mystery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/tuesday-briefing-another-russian-poisoning-mystery","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Another Russian poisoning mystery","bodyText":"Top story: ‘People like him are seen as traitors’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray giving you the skinny on things today. A former Russian double agent and a woman in her 30s are fighting for their lives this morning after being found unconscious from exposure to an “unknown substance”. Sergei Skripal, 66, and the woman were found slumped on a seat inside the Maltings shopping centre on Sunday afternoon. Police said Zizzi restaurant in the city centre was closed as part of the investigation, though they did not believe there was a threat to the public. Skripal was jailed in 2006 in Russia after being convicted of spying for MI6 since the 1990s. He was freed in 2010 as part of prisoner swap involving a Russian spy ring in the US that included Anna Chapman, and had been living in Salisbury under his own name. The case has sparked fears of another Russian “hit”, similar to the polonium poisoning in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, whose death was officially blamed on Kremlin agents by British authorities. Russia is headed into a presidential election and Alex Goldfarb, a friend of Litvinenko who helped him escape Russia in 2000, said: “Russia is a nationalistic country where state-run propaganda portrays the UK as the enemy and people like Skripal as traitors.” Skripal remained critically ill last night while the women was reported to be in a serious condition. Police were at Skripal’s home in Salisbury. James Puttock, a neighbour, said Skripal had lived in the area for more than seven years and was “very quiet … If I see him in the street I say hello”. * * * Feeling is not mutual – Theresa May’s vision of free trade with the EU has been dealt a series of fresh blows. Last night a key adviser on the Brussels side said the PM’s plan for “mutual recognition of standards” was in serious conflict with the EU’s centralised regime. Stefaan de Rynck, who advises Michel Barnier, also claimed EU businesses “are more concerned with maintaining the integrity of the EU single market than any loss of access to British markets”. On the Irish border, May has clumsily suggested it could be something like the US-Canada frontier – evidently not having thought too hard about the armed guards, search dogs and customs posts in operation there. The idea was immediately rejected by the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, while the chancellor, Philip Hammond, was forced to reassure the EU scrutiny committee: “I am clear what infrastructure at the border would mean, and I’m absolutely clear we are not going back there.” * * * Fiery end of ‘Heavenly Palace’ – We are beginning the final countdown for a rogue space station to crash into planet Earth. China’s Tiangong-1 spacecraft has been in an out-of-control death spiarl since 2016. The “Heavenly Palace” is likely to re-enter the atmosphere sometime between 24 March and 19 April and experts say though it should mostly burn up, at 8.5 tonnes it is large enough for substantial pieces to make it to the surface. No one can predict exactly where, though – only that it will be between the latitudes of 43° north and 43° south. The chances of re-entry are slightly higher in northern China, the Middle East, central Italy, northern Spain and the northern states of the US, New Zealand, Tasmania, parts of South America and southern Africa. * * * ‘Britain needs a diet’ – Food companies should cut 20% of calories from their products by 2024 or face being named and shamed, says Public Health England. Many children and more than 60% of adults are overweight or obese, and the NHS spends £6.6bn every year on obesity-related illnesses. PHE says the calorie target would slash £9bn in NHS and social care costs while saving more than 35,000 lives. Meanwhile, latest figures show the higher cost of groceries is making consumers tighten their belts when it comes to other retail items – as evidenced by the demise of Maplin and Toys R Us. And if we are worried about a food crisis after Brexit brought about by a lack of cheap EU farm labour, we should be agitating for fair pay and working conditions on farms, writes Felicity Lawrence. * * * ‘Lady Lex’ rediscovered – The wreck of the second world war aircraft carrier USS Lexington, scuttled during the Battle of the Coral Sea, has been located off the east coast of Australia. The badly damaged “Lady Lex” was deliberately sunk during the May 1942 engagement with Japanese carriers. More than 200 members of the crew died in the battle but most were rescued by other US vessels before the Lexington was scuttled. A search team led by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen discovered the wreck, along with some remarkably well preserved examples of its complement of fighter planes. Lunchtime read: How the ‘male glance’ overlooks women A thought-provoking essay today from Lili Loofbourow on the “male glance”, how it pervades our reactions to women’s stories and, she argues, costs the arts a huge amount of talent. “The male glance,” write Loofbourow, “is how comedies about women become ‘chick flicks’, how discussions of serious movies with female protagonists consign them to the unappealing stable of ‘strong female characters’, how soap operas and reality television become synonymous with trash. “We still don’t expect female texts to have universal things to say. We imagine them as small and careful, or petty and domestic, or vain, or sassy, or confessional. We have been hemorrhaging great work for decades, partly because we are so bad at seeing it.” Sport The five-times Olympic cycling champion Sir Bradley Wiggins has said that he is in a “living hell” after his reputation was vaporised by a parliamentary inquiry that concluded he cheated within the rules in order to win the 2012 Tour de France. The UCI has said the fallout from the affair has reinforced its concerns about potential abuse of the anti-doping system. José Mourinho praised his team’s intensity in recovering from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 3-2 but conceded their late victory was a “fantastic comeback with mistakes”. The International Cricket Council is set to consider a series of radical proposals designed to stem the talent drain caused by domestic Twenty20 and protect the sport from being cannibalised at all levels. Eddie Jones has warned that “no one is indispensable” as he mulls over his best options for the key Six Nations away game against France on Saturday. And the president of the Lawn Tennis Association has temporarily stepped down after the governing body of British tennis decided to commission an independent investigation into a 2004 allegation of sexual assault by a coach, and concerns about how it was handled Business After Wall Street posted its strongest gains in a week, Asian stock markets have surged despite tension over possible US steel tariffs. Analysts said any rally could be short-lived depending on signals from Donald Trump’s administration. The pound has been trading at $1.384 and €1.121 overnight. The papers The mysterious circumstances of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal’s apparent poisoning cover most of Tuesday’s front pages: the Guardian, Telegraph, Times, Mail, Mirror, Sun, i and Metro all lead on it.

His has been a heroic performance, one of the greatest and highest ODI scores in its own right but one rendered even more special by the clear physical agony endured in its later stages. It was a tale of two contrasting batting innings - England started brilliantly then fell away calamitously, New Zealand started terribly but turned it round with ever-increasing ease thanks to the timeless class of their No 4 batsman. The Black Caps remain unbeaten at this venue in ODIs. It’s been worth staying up for, and it will be worth doing the same, if you’re in the UK like, on Friday/Saturday for the decider in Christchurch. Anyway, I’m off for a lie-down. Thanks for your company and missives. Here’s your match report: 49.3 overs: New Zealand 339-5 (Taylor 181, Nicholls 13); target 336. Muliple wicket chances for England off Curran’s first ball - an lbw shout turned down, a single recklessly started then turned back, a shy at the stumps missed. The second ball is a dot too, a drive straight to mid-off by Nicholls. But any nerves are quelled as Nicholls then WINS IT WITH SIX, clipping Curran straight over the deep square leg boundary. The series is level again at 2-2! 49th over: New Zealand 333-5 (Taylor 181, Nicholls 7); target 336. Woakes’s hopes of keeping New Zealand below the rate are wrecked with his first ball, a low full toss walloped over wide mid-on for SIX. Another single takes the target down to six. Nicholls thrashes a single through the offside to put Taylor back down the striker’s end. A better, faster, shorter ball is swung at and missed, followed by a grubbed-out single. The last ball of the over is clipped away for one by Nicholls, who keeps the strike, which might not be the favoured option of a now voluble crowd. 48th over: New Zealand 323-5 (Taylor 173, Nicholls 5); target 336. Nicholls presents Taylor with the strike straight away at the start of Curran’s over with a flicked single. Taylor nudges another single, which is all they need now. Curran pegs back Nicholls with some shorter stuff, but a leg-bye gives Taylor another opportunity, but a glanced single is all he gets on this occasion. Curran rounds off a fine over with an attempted yorker - 13 needed from12 balls. 47th over: New Zealand 319-5 (Taylor 171, Nicholls 3); target 336. Nicholls drives Woakes for one, bringing to the strike Taylor, who can only now really get them in boundaries due to his injury. He limps a one that would have normally been two after carving out to deep backward point. Nicholls’ clipped single gives Taylor another chance to swing, a chance he takes in style, straight driving a half-volley for SIX with exquisite timing. A wider ball is then carved square on the offside for a heroically-run two, which puts him on strike for the final ball of the over, which he sends to the boundary, driven over extra-cover. Astonishing batting, and New Zealand are firm favourites once again. Blip over. 46th over: New Zealand 304-5 (Taylor 158, Nicholls 1); target 336. Curran is also finding a better line and length, pegging back De Grandhomme at the start of the over and inducing a frustrated slap off a full toss to backward point to bring another wicket. Nicholls is off the mark with a driven single and then Curran has an lbw shout against Taylor after rapping him on the toe, turned down as it looked to be going down leg. Taylor whacked himself on the toe with his bat in the course of that. Thirty-two needed from four overs. This is worth waking/staying up for. Now then! De Grandhomme slaps a full toss straight to Woakes at backward point. Are England back in with a sniff? 45th over: New Zealand 302-4 (Taylor 157, De Grandhome 23); target 336. Woakes, as it’s turned out, has been held back too long and he returns now with probably too much to do. His first ball, a wide offside yorker at Taylor, is a decent statement of intent though. A hobbled single off a full toss follows to bring up the 300. But Woakes finds a fuller length to keep Taylor in check, only three singles coming from the over. An excellent comeback but is it too late? For this, many thanks: 44th over: New Zealand 299-4 (Taylor 155, De Grandhome 22); target 336. A staggeting uppercut for SIX from De Grandhomme has the crowd yelping with joy. Curran is then clobbered over midwicket for SIX MORE - England can do nothing here, and these short boundaries look shorter with every ball. A couple more singles and a rare, proper, dot-ball yorker complete the over. But New Zealand are absolutely cruising home. “Good morning Tom,” chirps Sara Torvalds, “What a nice little series this is shaping up to be! The time zone is not exactly ideal, but it’s nice to wake up to look at the scores without knowing who’ll be on top.” Yep, England-New Zealand ODIs &gt; The Ashes. 43rd over: New Zealand 285-4 (Taylor 154, De Grandhome 9); target 336. Rashid’s final over beings well enough before De Grandhomme languidly meets one with extra flight and gets off the mark with a straight drive for four, and follows it up by clouting a wide one through the covers for another boundary. A less elegant shot in the same area, deceived by the flight, just eludes the fielder and brings one before Rashid’s spell ends with a two. That last over spoilt it a tad. His ten overs went for 74. 42nd over: New Zealand 273-4 (Taylor 151); target 336. Another change – Curran for Wood – and Tom C’s over starts well enough, with a decent line and bringing a dot and two singles, but a square offside mow from Taylor brings another four (fumbled on the boundary) to take him to a frankly stunning 150. He just hasn’t looked like getting out. But Latham now is out, caught after mistiming a slog, but he’s done his job, and how. Taylor’s innings is now New Zealand’s second highest against England A breakthrough at last, but is it too late. Latham slogs Curran up in the air and Moeen comes round from mid-off to gather it easily. 41st over: New Zealand 266-3 (Taylor 145, Latham 70); target 336. Rashid is back again in place of Stokes to see if he can restore economy. He starts well, with a dot and a couple of singles, but he can’t stem things for long, Taylor getting right underneath a high straight drive for SIX more, which makes this their highest fourth-wicket partnership against England. Ten from the over. Seventy needed from nine – at the moment it looks like they’ll do it in five or six. 40th over: New Zealand 256-3 (Taylor 137, Latham 68); target 336. England’s recently-acquired chase-thwarting abilities are going to be tested to their limit here, and at the moment they’re being found wanting, thanks to the brilliant Ross Taylor. The boundaries keep coming though – Taylor upper-cutting Wood high to the deep backward point boundary where it bounces once before dobbing over the line. An offside wide ensues before more woes – a slice for four over Buttler’s head and a rollicking square cut for four more. He’s been given too much width here and England are in danger of completely losing control. 39th over: New Zealand 241-3 (Taylor 124, Latham 67); target 336. Taylor needs more treatment, and strapping, on that upper left thigh. He’s not going to give this up though, turning Stokes’s first ball away on the legside for a leisurely-run single. Latham cuts uppishly past a diving Morgan at point for another, but another presentable one is turned down to deep mid-on as Taylor can’t run well enough. What he can do, though, is clobber the thing out of the ground for SIX, belting Stokes high over mid-on. Stokes and Morgan confer over fielding changes before the bowler sends down a legside wide so filthy I feel unclean just watching it. A slashed-hard wild edge brings four more before a hobbled single completes a hideous over for England, a richly promising one for New Zealand. 38th over: New Zealand 227-3 (Taylor 112, Latham 66); target 336. Unless England get a wicket in the next couple of overs or so, I’d make New Zealand firm favourites, though Taylor is not moving well after receiving treatment. Wood is fuller, tighter, more varied, with this over, which produces three singles before ending with a lofted on-drive from Latham for four. This is New Zealand’s second highest fourth-wicket partnership against England in ODIs 37th over: New Zealand 220-3 (Taylor 110, Latham 61); target 336. Morgan is making his bowling changes in twos, as he recalls Stokes to the attack. Can he make the impact demanded? Not yet. Latham can though, hammering his second ball over midwicket for SIX MORE. A hurried single then invites Morgan to shy at the stumps but he misses narrowly and he would probably have just sneaked home. A slight fumble on the offside by Roy allows Taylor to add two more though the batsman then needs a bit of physio on his leg, as a result of his dive at the crease to get home. Eleven from the over – New Zealand are well in this match. “I’m awake,” roars Ryan Metcalfe, “But I’m in Australia so take that how you will. Exciting game. As a South African I’ve seen New Zealand beat us easily from positions like this too many times to count. Good luck England!” 36th over: New Zealand 209-3 (Taylor 106, Latham 54); target 336. Moeen’s eight-over spell is brought to a close, with Wood returning from the same end where he began. And it’s just the over New Zealand need. Latham drives for one before Taylor punishes a shortish one outside off stump with a textbook square cut for four. The same shot is then well cut off by Rashid by the ropes – England’s boundary fielding has been nigh-on flawless today – and two more singles follow before Latham goes to 50 in style with a languid pulled SIX over square leg. Can anyone hit me with some stats on ODIs featuring three (or more) individual centuries? 35th over: New Zealand 195-3 (Taylor 100, Latham 46); target 336. Still Rashid - England might want to hold the spinners back for a few at the end – but he sends down two balls before Taylor brings up his 19th ODI hundred, and second this series, with a square cut for two. The crowd rise at one from the grass banks to salute an impeccable innings from a superb player. Only three from a fine over though. 34th over: New Zealand 192-3 (Taylor 98, Latham 45); target 336. A rare loose one from Moeen is consummately crunched through the covers for four by Taylor to ring in the hundred partnership. This has been a thoroughly classy knock by the veteran. A couple more singles and then, crack, another lovely cover drive takes Taylor to within two of a century. And that’s drinks. IS ANYONE AWAKE? Or has anyone got up yet? 33rd over: New Zealand 182-3 (Taylor 89, Latham 44); target 336. A lovely ball from Rashid turns in on the advancing Latham and raps him on the pad - he’s too far down the pitch to be given and it’s, again, a leg-bye instead. And again, replays show it hitting. Taylor then cuts loose, hoiking to deep midwicket where Bairstow gets enough of a hand on it to turn six into four, but not enoguht to take a catch. Another sliced top-edge for one completes an eventful over. 32nd over: New Zealand 175-3 (Taylor 83, Latham 44); target 336. The tandem-spin continues with Moeen’s seventh over. New Zealand still find boundaries somewhat tricky to come by, despite the perma-sweeping Latham’s best intentions. It’s all just ones and twos – seven from the over, which keeps the Black Caps behind the rate. 31st over: New Zealand 168-3 (Taylor 81, Latham 39); target 336. The sun’s out again, unlike either of these batsmen, who have now added 82. Rashid is accurate and probing until Taylor pulls a shorter one to the deep midwicket boundary that a diving Bairstow does very well to gather and prevent any more than a single. Two more to Latham complete the over. 30th over: New Zealand 163-3 (Taylor 79, Latham 36); target 336. Latham picks up a lucky four, bottom-edging a sweep off a decent Moeen delivery which squirms beyond the keeper for four. Moeen appeals vigorously for lbw next ball, but Latham has advanced down the pitch, and is understandably reprieved by the on-field umpire, though again replays show it hitting the top. Alas, reviews have gone. Moeen has not been lucky so far, and a decent over concedes eight runs in total. 29th over: New Zealand 155-3 (Taylor 77, Latham 31); target 336. An elegant reverse sweep brings Latham two off Rashid, and is followed by an emphatic orthodox-sweep for one. Taylor then also picks up a two and a one before another Latham sweep, well gathered on the boundary, brings two more. 2-1-2-1-2-1, that over, with a pleasing, nerdy orderliness. 28th over: New Zealand 146-3 (Taylor 74, Latham 25); target 336. The first four for a while arrives courtesy of a tickled reverse-sweep from Taylor off Moeen. He betters it next ball with a swiped SIX straight into the crew of boozy blokes in garish orange tank-tops on the square leg boundary, who make an absolute collective hash of trying to catch it. Thirteen from the over – New Zealand needed that. 27th over: New Zealand 133-3 (Taylor 63, Latham 23); target 336. Stokes’s five-over spell is ended, with Rashid returning. Latham sweeps him to backward square for one, Taylor clips a two and drives a one, as does Latham, but it’s a good over from Rashid, his best yet, with nice variety and some turn. It’s getting windy out there too, which may not displease England, though the possibility of rain might cloud, as it were, things. 26th over: New Zealand 128-3 (Taylor 60, Latham 21); target 336. New Zealand know they now need to step it up and Latham tries to take Moeen on but his pull can only bring in a single. A couple more ensue before Moeen proves his eagerness in the field by diving full-on into Latham at the non-striker’s end to cut off the one. It’s another valuable, tight over. 25th over: New Zealand 125-3 (Taylor 59, Latham 19); target 336. England are doing a fine job of slowing the run rate down, which means the odd more hurried single, such as the one snaffled by Taylor off a misfield at mid-off from the second ball of Stokes’s over. Two more follow before a rare wide one is walloped in the direction of the extra-cover boundary and cut off in front of the ropes - they run two. It’s suddenly got all cloudy, with fears of worse. At the halfway stage, New Zealand need another 211. 24th over: New Zealand 119-3 (Taylor 57, Latham 15); target 336. Good from Moeen, who ties up Taylor and has an eager leg-before shout for a ball that’s just reared up too much on the advancing batsman and is deemed to be going over, though Hawk-eye shows it clipping. It’s a very good over though, yielding only one run off its last ball. 23rd over: New Zealand 118-3 (Taylor 56, Latham 15); target 336. There’s a vague middle-overs meander vibe to proceedings at the moment, except you can never be too distracted when Stokes (and Moeen) are in action, and there’s a proper tension to the New Zealand chase - they need to keep things ticking over but don’t need to be too rash at this point. The fascination of the 50-over game (as opposed to the 20-over one) there. Stokes keeps it tight, yielding only three singles, but England could do with another wicket. 22nd over: New Zealand 115-3 (Taylor 54, Latham 14); target 336. Moeen keeps it tight at Latham, as he had the previous over until being belted for six at the end of it, before the left-hander pushes off the back foot for a single. Taylor turns one round the corner to complete a decent over from Moeen, who must still be rueing that drop. 21st over: New Zealand 112-3 (Taylor 52, Latham 13); target 336. Fifty for Taylor - a clipped single off Stokes taking him to another accomplished half-century, smooth and reliable. Four more singles follow. 20th over: New Zealand 107-3 (Taylor 49, Latham 11); target 336. England bring on Moeen, who got Latham first ball in Wellington. Will it pay off again? No, but it should have – Moeen drops a caught and bowled chance! Latham drives it straight back at him, it goes in and out, then in then out again of the bowler’s hands - via Ross Taylor’s foot – and is spilled again before going to ground. A single brings the hundred up, and after another one, Latham makes Moeen rue that drop even more by pulling a short one straight over the ropes for SIX. A pivotal over? 19th over: New Zealand 99-3 (Taylor 48, Latham 4); target 336. Stokes goes in shortish at Latham, whose back-foot cut is well stopped by Roy, who’s applauded with wide-eyed zeal by his bowler. There’s equal zeal in an ambitious shout for lbw next ball as Latham is struck low on the pad, which England review. Much umming and ahing with hotspot and snicko is rendered a waste of time by ball-tracking subsequently showing what had always seemed likely with the naked eye - that it had pitched outside leg. Technology in pointlessly delaying things shock! Three from the over, including a leg-bye off the lbw shout. 18th over: New Zealand 96-3 (Taylor 47, Latham 3); target 336. Taylor pulls Curran brilliantly to the square-leg boundary for four and then glances a single. Curran comes round the wicket at the left-handed Latham to cramp him up a bit more, though the new man in picks up one with a neat on-drive. This is all beautifully poised again. 17th over: New Zealand 90-3 (Taylor 42, Latham 2); target 336. The freshly-shorn Stokes comes on and does his thing, first up, strangling Williamson down the legside. The New Zealand captain’s expression suggests a little bit of doubt but he looked in real time to have faintly nicked it. Hotspot is inconclusive though – if they had a review he might have survived. Latham comes in, who’s also shown his threat in this series, and is off the mark with a single straight away. This hasn’t actually been the most probingly accurate of overs but it doesn’t always need to be when it’s Stokes. Four singles from it. Stokes strikes first ball! You just couldn’t script this. Williamson hooks slightly rashly at a short ball outside leg stump, gets a nick, and it’s given. The captain can’t review, what with that earlier waste of one, and a menacing partnership is broken. And they take drinks. 16th over: New Zealand 86-2 (Williamson 45, Taylor 40); target 336. Williamson lofts a cover drive off Curran over Stokes for two. A single is followed by a lesser-spotted bouncer that Taylor hoiks and misses, in the manner of Root’s earlier dismissal. Refreshing to see the bowler mix it up a bit anyway. Five from the over, a better and cheaper one than of late. 15th over: New Zealand 81-2 (Williamson 41, Taylor 39); target 336. Rashid hasn’t quite found his length yet, and is being worked around comfortably enough. A fantastic stop from Stokes, diving to his left at shortish mid-on, prevents a sharp pull from Williamson going for four, but no one can stop Taylor ending the over by square-cutting a loose and short one for four. 14th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 39, Taylor 34); target 336. Curran continues, as does the New Zealand fightback. There suddenly seems a lack of incision from the England bowlers and a serene assuredness about the hosts. Four singles are followed by a thumping cover drive from Williamson, which Bairstow cuts off well at the boundary to restrict him to two. Thoughts might be turning to Stokes soon … 13th over: New Zealand 67-2 (Williamson 34, Taylor 32); target 336. Rashid appeals for an lbw against Williamson after turning one onto his front pad, and ponders an appeal before thinking better of it - the batsman had advanced a long way down the track, though reviews suggest it would have nudged the bails. A couple of singles are followed by a superb SIX from Williamson, timed over long-on and way over the ropes. 12th over: New Zealand 58-2 (Williamson 26, Taylor 31); target 336. Tom Curran replaces Wood and his first ball is just a little too wide down the legside, and is effortlessly glanced through midwicket for four by Taylor. A single follows before Williamson is discomforted for the first time in his innings, inside edging onto his pads and watching the ball dribble perilously close to the stumps. 11th over: New Zealand 52-2 (Williamson 25, Taylor 26); target 336. The first bowling change sees Rashid replace Woakes and his first ball is pulled away on the legside for one by Williamson. Taylor then expertly cuts for four off a ball that’s just a little too short. A sweep to fine leg brings up New Zealand’s 50. Eight from the over. These two batsmen look nicely booked in now. 10th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Williamson 23, Taylor 20); target 336. None of yer new fangled rotation from England in this opening powerplay - it’s been five overs each from Woakes and Wood, who concedes the first SIX of the innings, Taylor advancing to meet a good-length delivery and swing it over the square-leg boundary. It’s followed by a firmly flicked four down to fine leg and a single to third man. New Zealand now above four an over after a scurried single completes their most productive over of the innings. England were 77-0 at this point, mind, before the late-innings weirdness. 9th over: New Zealand 32-2 (Williamson 22, Taylor 9); target 336. Woakes continues, his over delayed by some sort of tomfoolery in the crowd. It doesn’t put off Williamson though, the New Zealand captain driving backward of square on the offside for four. Lord but he’s a class act. Another drive in that area stings the palms of Roy, as the England opener manages to prevent one becoming four. England are packing that square offside area for Williamson, as well they might. They need to deal with him soon, though there’s no need to panic at this point. 8th over: New Zealand 26-2 (Williamson 17, Taylor 9); target 336. Taylor pulls a shorter one from Wood round the corner for one before Williamson crunches a wider ball through backward point for four. Two overthrows ensue from a slightly too ambitious shy at the stumps from Bairstow at mid-off. New Zealand are working it around more easily now. 7th over: New Zealand 18-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 8); target 336. It’s Taylor’s turn to show some class, opening the face and creaming Woakes through the covers to the boundary. He also square cuts for a single. Both England bowlers have been a fraction fuller in the last couple of overs, which has just helped New Zealand to unshackle themselves a little, but they’ve still been pretty good. 6th over: New Zealand 13-2 (Williamson 10, Taylor 3); target 336. The first sign of a counterattack as Williamson sumptously straight drives Wood along the ground for four. Two singles follow. This partnership already feels pivotal - if England break this cheaply, they’re solid favourites; if the fail to, it could run away from them. “Gutted to miss Bairstow’s innings,” tweets Brian Withington, “thought it was a later start. So did NZ apparently.” 5th over: New Zealand 7-2 (Williamson 5, Taylor 2); target 336. What a glorious venue the University Oval looks. I want to be there right now. There’s a big, engaged crowd in too. Taylor glances Woakes on the offside for one before Williamson inside-edges one he didn’t know too much about down to fine leg for a couple more. He then expertly pulls a shorter one across the line to mid-on for another single. 4th over: New Zealand 3-2 (Williamson 2, Taylor 1); target 336. There’s been barely a loose ball from England’s new ball pair yet, and Wood keeps the pressure on with five dots at Taylor, who can’t pierce the inner circle until the last ball of the over, which he flicks to deep square leg for one. 3rd over: New Zealand 2-2 (Williamson 2, Taylor 0); target 336. Woakes maintains that parsimonious line and length at Guptill, whose natural attacking instincts are brilliantly becalmed, so much so that he slogs up in the air and is caught by Stokes. So it’s up to the undoubted class and experience of Williamson and Taylor to turn this round. A wicket-maiden. Woakes currently boasts figures of 2-1-1-0. And another. Woakes tames Guptill brilliantly who, frustrated, swings wildly and inappropriately and sends a skyer straight up in the air to Ben Stokes at extra-cover. It’s an easy catch. This is England’s white-ball bowling at its best. 2nd over: New Zealand 2-1 (Guptill 0, Williamson 2); target 336. Wood snares Munro with a devilish inswinger straight up, which had the opener stretching awkwardly across his crease. Williamson does with his first ball what his team-mates had thus far failed to do with their first seven, and score a run, effortlessly nudging into the legside for a couple of them. But it’s the only scoring stroke. Talking of Munro: What a start from Wood. And from England. Wood’s first ball swings into the left-handed Munro’s pads, seeming to pin him in front of leg stump. The finger goes up, the batsmen review on Guptill’s advice, but it’s a wasted and daft one. Plumb. 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, Munro 0); target 336. Woakes has the new ball, with two slips up, and he’s tight enough early on to spark some confusion and hesitancy between the wickets as Guptill tries to set off for an ill-advised single and is sent scurrying back by Munro as the throw narrowly misses in any case. It’s a very good opening over, meticulously back-of-a-length and nothing wayward. A maiden. They’re back out … Something to read while we’re waiting for the resumption. This week’s Spin, on New Zealand’s first Test win over England, and Geoff Boycott at his most Boycottesque: Interval stat-gasm: Night/afternoon everyone. So who’s with me? Who in the northern hemisphere has been seeing these games all the way through? Staying up all night for the Ashes may have its rituals and traditions, but New Zealand away in ODIs might be seen as a bit more niche. But more fool those giving it a swerve, since this series has shown again that England v New Zealand over 50 overs is quite the watch - you might even argue that the ODI series in 2015 was the most compelling series in any form of the game England have participated in this decade. And this one’s had plenty to commend it. So you might as well stay up for this now, as we work out whether England’s, well, confusing score of 335-9 is either inadequate on a benign pitch or strong enough to seal the series. For all the gnashing and wailing at that senseless collapse, England have still just posted the highest score of the series. It’s all up for grabs. That England innings in numbers: 42, 138, 102, 0, 5, 1, 3, 3, 11, 22, 3. That pretty much tells the story. Time to hand over to Tom Davies, who will guide you through the New Zealand chase. Thanks for joining me. England do complete their 50 overs, and have set their hosts a formidable target - but the fact New Zealand are in the game at all will be a big disappointment. England were 267-1 at one stage, swinging for everything to try and set an impossible target. It backfired spectacularly as they fell to 288-7 in a collapse so English, they should put it on a 10p. 50th over: England 335-9 (Curran 22, Wood 3) Tom Curran has just regained a little momentum for England with a spectacular over, hitting four fours on the bounce off Tim Southee. How useful might those late runs prove to be? 49th over: England 317-9 (Curran 4, Wood 3) Mark Wood emerges blinking at the crease, but he and Curran repel Boult’s ferocious pace - and even run two to end the over, the cheeky devils. Ah. Rashid is clean bowled by Boult, taking out his earlier frustrations in style. He is still England’s fourth-highest scorer this innings. 48th over: England 312-8 (Rashid 11, Curran 3) What’s this? Adil Rashid picks up a boundary, the first since Eoin Morgan, back in the mists of time. Can he and Tom Curran grind this out? “I am to blame for this exquisite collapse,” says James Walsh. “I knocked over a full pint glass of water onto my bedroom floor (and multi-socket adapter) with Bairstow and Root cruising. By the time I cleared it up, much of the England team had hit the ball straight up in the air in bemusing fashion. Sorry everyone.” Southee gets rid of Root straight after, an angled, short ball catching the batsman’s glove and flying through to Latham. England have two wickets and 17 balls remaining... Root gets over the line, driving Boult smartly into space and running for two. He makes it to reach 101 off 99 balls, and a ton that will feel bittersweet. 47th over: England 302-7 (Root 99, Rashid 7) Guptill, whose block on Buttler was a factor in this England collapse, is moving awkwardly in the outfield. England edge past 300, a total they would have taken after the toss, but not when Bairstow and Root were in their pomp. 46th over: England 298-7 (Root 97, Rashid 5) Tim Southee, still without a wicket, returns as Root tries to get his century, having had no help from his colleagues. He’s broken his bat, and signals for a replacement. Suddenly, it’s hard work getting runs; four singles are milked from the over. It feels like a long time since JB was pinging sixes off the pavilion roof. 45th over: England 294-7 (Root 95, Rashid 3) England were 267-1 with 12 overs left, and there’s a possibility they could be all out for less than 300. In its own way, it’s impressive. Sodhi is chasing a five-fer in his final over, but doesn’t get it. The spinner bowled expertly in that spell though, and has helped New Zealand back into the game. Woakes sticks to the playbook, mining a few singles, getting set and then launching an optimistic effort down the ground. This one’s caught by Trent Boult, and England are in a mess of their own making. 44th over: England 288-6 (Root 93, Woakes 3) The boundaries have dried up for England, with Root and Woakes nurdling away. Hang on... 43rd over: England 285-6 (Root 91, Woakes 2) England’s middle order were obviously encouraged to go for their shots, but you might say they went for the wrong ones. Another impressive over from Sodhi, and England would be very, very happy with 350 from here. Ish Sodhi has a fourth wicket, and England have lost their way. Moeen Ali tries to send the spinner down the ground but gets underneath it, and Tim Southee takes a fine diving catch at long-on. 42nd over: England 280-5 (Root 88, Moeen 3) Boult mixes it up in this over, following two length balls with a yorker, and even finding a touch of swing, last seen about three hours ago. But there’s more bad luck for Boult, as Moeen slaps a short ball to midwicket. De Grandhomme gets down to it but can’t hold on to a tough chance. 41st over: England 279-5 (Root 88, Moeen 2) Three wickets for Sodhi, who has been excellent, one loose over aside. Moeen tries and fails to pick him twice at the tail end of that over. It’s a full-blown wobble for England, as Stokes clubs the ball straight to Henry Nicholls at midwicket. Four wickets have gone for nine, and England’s batting order doesn’t look so deep any more. 40th over: England 276-4 (Root 87, Stokes 1) New Zealand have made this a contest again with those two overs, and have removed Buttler and Morgan for just five runs. What can Ben Stokes do? Eoin Morgan chips a length from Boult away for four, and looks to settle things down with Root at the other end. Never mind - he mistimes a pull off a shorter ball, and Munro jogs back to make the catch. 39th over: England 269-3 (Root 85, Morgan 1) Ish Sodhi has an lbw appeal with Morgan on the back foot. For the first time since Jason Roy was dismissed, the bowlers have their tails up. Well, that backfired. Buttler looks to have his eye in with a drive that Guptill blocks smartly, but mistimes his next shot, wafting a shorter ball straight back to Sodhi. That was great fun while it lasted. Bairstow eventually sends a wild shot high into the air, and Southee makes the catch at short third man. England are 267-2, and Jos Buttler has been bumped up the order... 38th over: England 267-1 (Bairstow 138, Root 84) This ground is too small for Bairstow, who is swinging for Dunedin tourist attractions again. Munro is sent packing, the ball flying well over 100m and clipping the pavilion roof. Munro finds off-stump, but Bairstow chops it for four. He’s swinging for everything... 37th over: England 256-1 (Bairstow 128, Root 83) De Grandhomme is back, and starts with two tidy yorkers. His third ball is short, and Bairstow blasts it through the leg-side for six more. De Grandhomme’s first over went for 11, and after a full toss is lashed by Bairstow for four, this one will go for 12. The partnership is 179 and counting. 36th over: England 244-1 (Bairstow 117, Root 82) Bairstow is at it again, picking off a length ball and delivering it to the crowd gathered beyond long-off. That aside, it’s an economical over from Munro - but this innings has been filled with half-decent overs ruined by one big boundary. 35th over: England 236-1 (Bairstow 110, Root 81) Suitably refreshed, England get straight back to it, Bairstow flicking Southee’s first ball away for four, thanks to some more risible fielding. With nine wickets in hand, England may be making a move - Root’s miscued pull shot just lands beyond the boundary for six. 16 runs off the over, Southee on 0-42. 34th over: England 220-1 (Bairstow 103, Root 72) England try to force two runs and there’s a sniff of a run-out, but Nicholls’ throw falls short, allowing Bairstow to get back. England have been very good at punishing those little mistakes, and Root steers a full, wide one from Sobhi just beyond Southee, who is forced to forlornly chase it all the way to the boundary. Root has the measure of Sobhi now, and pushes his final two deliveries away for four. Big over for England. Drinks! 33rd over: England 202-1 (Bairstow 102, Root 57) A little game management required for England here. Southee starts with four dot balls, before a Root flick through the off-side is artfully kept from the boundary by Munro, before a hopeful appeal for an edge. Replays show it clipped Bairstow’s pocket. 32nd over: England 199-1 (Bairstow 101, Root 53) Bairstow sweeps a limp Santner delivery away for four, to bring up a century in 87 balls. He was the more conservative player alongside Roy, then upped the aggression alongside Root. Terrific knock. 31st over: England 191-1 (Bairstow 95, Root 51) England on track for at least 350, maybe more, if they’re feeling saucy. Root has largely been conservative but gets his 50 with a fearsome shot, dancing down the track and smacking Southee over mid-on for six. 30th over: England 182-1 (Bairstow 93, Root 44) Another lbw appeal, as Root steps forward and Santner’s angled ball whips past him and catches him on the thigh. Not out, looked plumb, but New Zealand have used their review. As it happens, it may have just whistled over the bails. Root rocks back in his crease with a pull for two, to rub salt in the wound. 29th over: England 177-1 (Bairstow 91, Root 41) These two reach a century partnership, before Munro’s knuckleball prompts an lbw shout. Nothing doing, and it was drifting past leg stump, but it was a better shout than the one they reviewed. “Fun fact (or not): the nearby building that Bairstow has been finding with ball (and worryingly for us will probably keep doing so) has a past life. It was purpose-built to house the international South Sea Exhibition in 1926 and was then the Dunedin Public Art Gallery for many years after that.” Danielle Tolson, this is exactly what I wanted to know. 28th over: England 170-1 (Bairstow 85, Root 40) This is now the highest ODI second-wicket partnership by a touring side in New Zealand, fwiw. Root has been happy to play second fiddle to Bairstow, but reminds Santner he’s there with a lovely shot, lifting a quick, length ball over Latham’s shoulder. 27th over: England 166-1 (Bairstow 85, Root 36) England’s tactics remain the same, waiting patiently and punishing loose balls. When Munro drops a touch short, he’s smashed for six by Bairstow. New Zealand’s fielding has been so dodgy, even a guy in the crowd drops it. 26th over: England 159-1 (Bairstow 79, Root 35) Trent Boult finding a bit of zip as England tick past the halfway point of their innings. Will they push Buttler up the order to make the most of these clement conditions? Three runs off the over off Boult, who deserves better than his 0-37 figures. 25th over: England 156-1 (Bairstow 78, Root 33) Munro continues, but England keep the scoreboard ticking over with the track showing little sign of life. The only sniff for the bowler comes off the final ball as Bairstow drives the ball back at his heels. His arms aren’t eight feet long, so he can’t get down to it. 24th over: England 151-1 (Bairstow 75, Root 31) Boult returns, and has Bairstow beaten with an angled, full delivery that the batsman lifts to extra cover. Santner drops it. Oh dear, that was very gettable. Boult looks furious! Boult perseveres and appeals for caught behind - but the ball flicked off the back of Bairstow’s head. The talk now is whether England can get close to the 400 mark. That seems a) plausible with Stokes, Buttler and Morgan waiting, and b) not the kind of chat we encourage around here. Let’s all chill out a bit, yeah? 22nd over: England 148-1 (Bairstow 74, Root 29) Bairstow is in full flow, lashing a Munro bouncer over midwicket. Santner does brilliantly to get a paw on it, diving to his right, but it still trickles to the rope. It’s been that kind of day for New Zealand. 21st over: England 141-1 (Bairstow 69, Root 27) This partnership edges past 60 runs with a Root single, before Bairstow pads those stats with a lovely sweep to the fence. New Zealand need to make something happen, or this will get away from them entirely. 20th over: England 136-1 (Bairstow 65, Root 26) England were 70-0 after nine overs, and 61-1 through the subsequent 10 overs of spin. Better for New Zealand, but not by much. Munro avoids the kicking De Grandhomme took with an over of short, punchy stuff that at least upsets the batsmen’s rhythm. 19th over: England 131-1 (Bairstow 63, Root 23) The surface has been much kinder to the batsmen that Williamson had hoped, and it’s drying out as we edge into the afternoon. Santner delivers a tight, disciplined over, and sees it count for nothing as Bairstow chips a fuller ball into the pavilion. Colin Munro will have a bowl now. 18th over: England 122-1 (Bairstow 56, Root 21) Sodhi, like Santner, is finding a consistent length and the runs are dried up - until Sodhi tries the wrong ‘un. Bairstow picks it, sets himself, and sends another ball clanging off that warehouse. We’ll run out of balls at this rate. 17th over: England 115-1 (Bairstow 50, Root 20) Bowled from Santner, finding turn and almost catching Bairstow’s outside edge with a length ball outside off stump. Just a single from the over. 17th over: England 114-1 (Bairstow 50, Root 19) Ish Sodhi has bowled very nicely without much help, and now the malaise is spreading. Bairstow absolutely pummels one down the ground, out of the ground, over the stand, and onto the roof of a nearby warehouse. I’m not exaggerating for effect. A new ball is needed, which Bairstow promptly prods to long-off, to reach 50 off 38 deliveries. Played, Jonny. 16th over: England 105-1 (Bairstow 43, Root 17) Eek, scratch that, Root makes a hash of a fuller Sandtner delivery and is lucky it lands harmlessly behind the wicket. Bairstow shows him how it’s done, sweeping effortlessly for a boundary to take England past the 100 mark. 15th over: England 96-1 (Bairstow 37, Root 13) Root punishes a fractionally short ball from Sodhi with a sweetly timed pull shot for four. He’s settled well, with New Zealand in need of a couple of quick wickets. 14th over: England 89-1 (Bairstow 36, Root 8) Root gets a little lucky, charging out and misreading the length, but adjusting to slap a scruffy short just beyond extra cover for four. First drinks break, and England would have taken this scenario after the toss, thanks very much. 13th over: England 82-1 (Bairstow 35, Root 2) Sodhi’s numbers drift to a sloppy 1-3 as England’s batsmen pick up some carefully timed singles. Root gets off the mark, pushing a googly to safety. 12th over: England 79-1 (Bairstow 34, Root 0) Santner looks to carry on from Sodhi and cool down England’s run rate a little. Just two from the over as Bairstow edges down to third man. Here’s our man at the ground: 11th over: England 77-1 (Bairstow 32, Root 0) Joe Root is next to the crease. No need for England to panic, even if Roy will be disappointed. Sodhi closes out a wicket maiden, an overdue bit of quality from a bowler in black. Sodhi’s first ball is a good length, and his second pops up as Roy tries to pull it. Mitchell Santner springs forward at short fine leg and takes a smart catch. Given what’s happened previously on this tour, Roy sticks around, but there’s no reprieve. 10th over: England 77-0 (Roy 42, Bairstow 32) New Zealand definitely a little short of ideas. Lots of shrugging and sideways glances out in the field. Mitchell Santner is brought in to offer some spin, but Bairstow sorts his feet out and cracks it over extra cover. 9th over: England 70-0 (Roy 40, Bairstow 27) Colin de Grandhomme enters the fray. How will the big man get on? Not so well, as a short, wide effort is lashed for four by Bairstow. Another wide - that’s New Zealand’s third - and a crisp cover drive from Roy cap another bad over for the hosts. Interesting question - England are some 11,850 miles from Lord’s, which I would wager is hard to beat. 8th over: England 59-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 18) More sharp reflexes from Roy as he helps a Boult bouncer over Latham and all the way to the fence. This has all been very serene for England so far. Boult continues from the Southern End, and appeals for lbw as his first ball catches Roy on the pad! Not out, but New Zealand need something and will review. It’s pitching outside off, and may have been passing over the stumps too. A little desperate, perhaps. 7th over: England 54-0 (Roy 35, Bairstow 18) Jason Roy has Southee’s number here, biding his time before walloping a half-volley for six. 35 for the opener, off 27 balls. 6th over: England 46-0 (Roy 28, Bairstow 17) As you can see above, it’s a beautiful day in Dunedin, the kind to make you seethe with envy. It’s all a little ugly for the hosts though - an overthrow races away for four, and Boult is left shaking his head. Boult fires down a couple of short ones: Roy takes one of them in the breadbasket, but hooks the next away for six, where a spectator almost hauls it in with a diving catch. 5th over: England 35-0 (Roy 22, Bairstow 12) Southee starts the over with an egregious lbw shout, the ball sailing over the stumps, before Roy responds with an elegant, almost derisory cover drive. England’s openers have got their tactics right here - taking opportunities on a wicket that will offer them up, and finding the short boundaries. We were just treated to a close-up of the wicket. In colour and texture, it brought to mind a beige carpet that had seen better days, perhaps in the lobby of a cheapish hotel. I would guess it’s a bit zippier than that, though. 4th over: England 29-0 (Roy 16, Bairstow 12) Lovely timing from Jason Roy, dispatching an inswinger from Boult. Munro does well to deny him a boundary on a quick-looking outfield. Boult is struggling to find his range, and his field do him no favours as a Bairstow drive finds the gap for four more. 3rd over: England 22-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 8) Bairstow joins the boundary party, thwacking two fours in succession, one through midwicket, one straight back down the ground. Strong start for England after losing the toss. Southee sticks to his length and gives Bairstow a scare with a wobbling ball that catches the inside edge. 2nd over: England 13-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 0) Trent Boult next up, on a ground he absolutely loves. Boult gets it swinging, but luck is against him as Roy inside-edges all the way to the boundary. Off the back foot, Roy drives, Williamson chases, and spills the ball onto the rope. 1st over: England 5-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 0) Here come the lads, Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow. Tim Southee will open the bowling. It’s a fine, dry day but it pelted down yesterday, so nobody’s quite sure what the pitch will do. Southee gets a bit of movement first ball, before Roy pulls him for four. The track looks spongy, the ball sitting up if it’s bowled too short. We’re moments away. Can England win the series? Will New Zealand win again in Dunedin? How do you pronounce Dunedin? Dun-eh-din? Dun-ee-den? Doon-ay-din? We’ll find out. Speaking of solid numbers, England are chasing their sixth straight ODI series win, and eighth in nine since the 2015 World Cup debacle. I enjoyed this, from Rob Smyth, on Eoin Morgan’s role in that transformation: Some impressive stats on Ross Taylor from the Sky guys: since his eye operation in 2016, his Test average is 81, and his ODI average is above 50 - from 27 matches. New Zealand: Guptill, Munro, Williamson (c), Taylor, Latham, Nicholls, De Grandhomme, Santner, Southee, Sodhi, Boult. England: Roy, Bairstow, Root, Morgan (c), Stokes, Buttler, Moeen, Woakes, Rashid, Curran, Wood. Toss! Kane Williamson wins it for New Zealand, and they’ll bowl first. Williamson confirms Ross Taylor is back for the hosts. Eoin Morgan brushes it off, and says it shouldn’t matter too much. The team is unchanged from the win in Wellington. Well? If England are to wrap up the series today, they’ll need to do what no other visiting team has done, and beat New Zealand at the University Oval. This unassuming ground, tucked away in a corner of the South Island, has become something of a fortress for the Black Caps. Not least Trent Boult, who has picked up 12 wickets in his four ODIs here. Good morning/evening all. There have been some long nights for supporters on England’s Antipodean excursion, but mainly with the red (or pink) ball. Australia were swept aside 4-1 in their five-game ODI series, and Eoin Morgan’s side could secure another statement victory today. It’s far from guaranteed against a side that, if the three contests we’ve witnessed so far are anything to go by, can match England blow for blow. Ross Taylor is back to beef up the Black Caps’ middle order as the hosts look to level the series and set up the decider it deserves. That’s not England’s concern - they have ended New Zealand’s unbeaten ODI run with two crafty, courageous wins in a row, and can get the job done today. That would truly be worth staying up for. Play begins at 11am local, 10pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/06/victoria-to-abolish-ellis-defence-that-protects-church-assets-from-abuse-victim-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T03:50:48Z","webTitle":"Victoria to abolish 'Ellis defence' that protects church assets from abuse victim claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/victoria-to-abolish-ellis-defence-that-protects-church-assets-from-abuse-victim-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/06/victoria-to-abolish-ellis-defence-that-protects-church-assets-from-abuse-victim-claims","fields":{"headline":"Victoria to abolish 'Ellis defence' that protects church assets from abuse victim claims","bodyText":"Victoria has introduced a bill that would make it the first jurisdiction in Australia to abolish a legal defence used by churches to prevent child sexual abuse victims from targeting their assets in compensation claims. Known as “the Ellis defence”, it is based on a 2007 court case brought by abuse survivor John Ellis against the Catholic church. The New South Wales court of appeal found church assets could not be targeted by Ellis in pursuing compensation for the crimes he endured within the church, because church trustees could not be held to account for the crimes of individuals. Associate Prof Elizabeth Curran from the Australian National University’s school of law said the Ellis defence “has been used by the church to obfuscate, and to avoid accountability”. “Religious institutions have used the defence to protect their rather wealthy assets from any form of seizure,” she said. “It’s a defence that no one else has access to, only churches do. The Victorian government, by getting rid of this defence, is offering greater protection to the most vulnerable people, and it means churches are no longer allowed to be above the law. This defence has seen people who have been harmed within religious institutions left with no real avenue for pursuing monetary recourse.” In a statement the premier, Daniel Andrews, said the legislation introduced into state parliament on Monday was designed to remove the defence and to “quash an unfair legal loophole preventing child abuse survivors from suing some organisations for their abuse”. Under the proposed laws, which are widely expected to pass, unincorporated organisations – including religious institutions – would be given an opportunity to nominate a legal entity with sufficient assets for child abuse survivors to sue. If a religious organisation failed to nominate an entity, a court could order the unincorporated organisation’s associated trusts to be sued and used to pay compensation to victims. Dr Judy Courtin, a lawyer who has represented dozens of child sexual abuse survivors and their families, said many religious institutions around the country had ceased using the Ellis defence due to escalating criticism that doing so was unjust. “But I was never happy with that, because all it takes is a new archbishop or leader who holds a different view to come in and decide using the defence is fair, so that’s why it is important Victoria has enshrined changes in the law,” Courtin said. Reforming the defence was a key recommendation from the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, and of the Betrayal of Trust report tabled in Victorian parliament in 2013. “These Victorian reforms, combined with abolishing the statute of limitations, means guaranteeing victims that they will have an entity to sue,” Courtin said. “It provides victims with the same right to access courts as everyone else in the community. It has taken a royal commission, state inquiries, and hundreds of suicides and stuffed lives to get here, but it’s fantastic that the churches have finally lost their battle.” The head of the Catholic church’s Truth Justice and Healing Council, Francis Sullivan, welcomed the legislation. “This is a proper step forward as a pathway for people who want to seek damages for what’s happened to them in abuse cases in institutions like the Catholic church. This is a very positive thing,” he told ABC radio."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/womens-march-madness-2018-bracket-interactive","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T14:56:54Z","webTitle":"Women's NCAA Basketball Tournament 2018: pick your bracket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/womens-march-madness-2018-bracket-interactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/mar/13/womens-march-madness-2018-bracket-interactive","fields":{"headline":"Women's NCAA Basketball Tournament 2018: pick your bracket","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/06/brexit-weekly-briefing-a-welcome-shift-of-tone-by-the-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: a welcome shift of tone by the prime minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/06/brexit-weekly-briefing-a-welcome-shift-of-tone-by-the-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/06/brexit-weekly-briefing-a-welcome-shift-of-tone-by-the-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: a welcome shift of tone by the prime minister","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here. You can catch up with our Brexit Means podcast right here. If you are in London next week, you can also join the conversation in person at the Guardian’s Live event Newsroom: Halfway through Brexit. Join me, Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at Kings College London, Eloise Todd, the chief executive officer of Best for Britain, and our chair for the evening, the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Anne Perkins, on Tuesday 13 March. The top stories This was the week everything changed, and nothing changed. Brexit news was dominated by Theresa May’s big speech on Friday, ostensibly outlining what Britain wanted from the next stage of negotiations on trade. Close followers of the debate will have been disappointed that there was little new detail on how the UK intends to persuade the EU to grant it frictionless access to the single market without abiding by its rules. What was welcomed on all sides was a shift in tone. For the first time May admitted that access may not be entirely frictionless and not all rules can be avoided. Britain would still aim high, she said, but was prepared to settle for something in between. After two special cabinet sessions and an awayday at Chequers to try to get her government to agree, this was news of sorts, and was watched live by 532,000 people, according to viewing figures. Whether it flies in Brussels or satisfies Brexit voters remains less clear, but the crucial thing as far as Westminster was concerned was that a fragile government lived to fight another day. There was surprisingly little mention of the other big story of the week – the EU’s proposal for keeping things frictionless in Northern Ireland. The plan effectively relies on full regulatory harmonisation between north and south instead of alternative British suggestions for a customs partnership, which Brussels and Dublin feel are unworkable. The fierce backlash in London toward a plan that Brussels felt had been agreed to in December means the path forward is currently blocked by continued disagreement over the last phase of negotiations. Time is running out to agree a transition deal. Another climbdown by the Brits – over the rights of EU citizens who arrive during the transition phase – was quickly shot down by the EU parliament, which said it does not go far enough. Although May insisted at the House of Commons on Monday that both sides were “close to an agreement”, things currently appear to be going backwards on the bit that was meant to be agreed and going nowhere on the bit that was meant to looking forward. Instead, it fell to a series of past prime ministers to try to break the deadlock last week, with a series of impassioned pleas for the country to think again on Brexit. First up was John Major, who called for MPs to be given a free vote on whether there should be a second referendum. Then Tony Blair chimed in to argue that May had no hope of achieving her aims and that the EU should help walk Britain back off the cliff edge. Best of the rest The US is holding up post-Brexit aviation talks by attempting to weaken UK trade rights. Michel Barnier is growing impatient with the absence of his counterpart, David Davis. Theresa May’s Brexit vision was dismissed as unrealistic in Brussels. The Irish government warned that only a customs union can avoid the need for a hard border. Europe doesn’t trust May, says Rafael Behr, because it knows she is a prisoner of the Brexit ultras. Business needs to speak up to save Britain from Brexit, says Polly Toynbee. Top comment In a blistering editorial, the Observer argued that Friday was a dark day for all: Be in no doubt. Theresa May’s watershed Brexit speech on Friday was a sobering defeat for the UK. It was a defeat for the Leavers’ vision of a sovereign country freed from the constraints imposed by European politicians, laws and regulations. It was a defeat for those who voted Remain and hoped against hope that Britain would, at the last moment, draw back from this gross act of national self-harm. Jonathan Freedland, writing in the Guardian, said we should resist the urge to feel sorry for the prime minister. The temptation to feel sorry for May should be resisted. For May is not a passive victim in this story. If she’s shackled, it’s in chains that she forged herself …. No one forced May to deliver yet another speech, rather than issue a British set of trade guidelines, just as nothing prevented her writing a UK version of the draft withdrawal agreement put out by Brussels on Wednesday. Nothing, that is, except the difficulty of getting her own cabinet to agree on a common position. Top tweet Dutch commentator Joris Luyendijk urges British newspaper readers to spend more time looking at European cartoons for a sense of how Brexit is viewed on the continent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/05/garry-monk-leeds-birmingham-championship-pep-clotet","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T22:29:27Z","webTitle":"Garry Monk will draw on Leeds experience to heal Birmingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/05/garry-monk-leeds-birmingham-championship-pep-clotet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/05/garry-monk-leeds-birmingham-championship-pep-clotet","fields":{"headline":"Garry Monk will draw on Leeds experience to heal Birmingham","bodyText":"Garry Monk has said he will use the experience from his time at Leeds United to galvanise Birmingham City after becoming the Championship club’s fifth manager inside 12 months. Monk, who turns 39 on Tuesday, joked that he did not require armbands after being tasked with saving Birmingham from dropping into the third tier for the first time since 1994, four years into his managerial career. After taking charge of his first training session, Monk, who has a three-and-a-half-year contract, was unveiled alongside Xuandong Ren, the chief executive officer, who politely declined to answer questions. Monk replaces Steve Cotterill, who was sacked on Saturday after defeat by Nottingham Forest. His first game will be at home on Tuesday against Middlesbrough, who relieved him of his duties in December, a meeting Monk described as “destiny”. The former Swansea City manager then returns to south Wales to face Cardiff City on Saturday. “I’ve been in the deep end quite a few times,” he said. “I don’t need armbands right now. It will never be harder than when I first went into management – it doesn’t come much more in the deep end than that. I think I have gained a lot of experience, even though I am very early on in my managerial career.” Monk resigned from Leeds last summer, having finished seventh, after failing to agree a new contract with the then new owner Andrea Radrizzani. He was appointed by Middlesbrough in June but sacked hours after victory against Sheffield Wednesday in late December. “It was a surprise at the time, especially given the internal talks we were having,” Monk said. “But that time is done, there is no bitterness from my side of things towards anything. “I had a good experience at Leeds recently, with the same situation; taking a fractured club that is very disconnected across all the boards. We managed to pull it into a situation where everything was connected, the fans were right behind the team and there was a connection between the terraces and the team and the team and the terraces. I’ve seen at big clubs, when the terraces are connected with the club, it can be ferocious for away teams.” Asked whether his season at Elland Road gave him the belief that he could turn around the fortunes of a club two points from safety after five successive defeats, Monk replied: “Yes. You have to believe in yourself, and from that experience as well. I am not naive and I understand the reality of it. But I truly believe that with the capabilities of that squad, with the work we can do, we can put them in a better place. Going forward, speaking to the owners, I can see the ambition in their eyes. I judge it on that, not other peoples’ opinions and I can see there is an ambition to make something good.” Monk, who batted away a question about whether there was a break clause in his contract in the event of relegation, is finalising his backroom staff but is reunited with his former assistant Pep Clotet. The Spaniard was part of his coaching team at Swansea and Leeds but not Middlesbrough after taking charge at Oxford United, who sacked him in January. “It is great to be back with Pep,” Monk said. “He brings a wealth of experience, he’s a very good coach and he will bring that to these players.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/05/who-is-sergei-skripal-ex-spy-exposed-substance-salisbury-hospital","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T19:53:26Z","webTitle":"Who is Sergei Skripal, the ex-spy exposed to 'unknown substance'?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/who-is-sergei-skripal-ex-spy-exposed-substance-salisbury-hospital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/who-is-sergei-skripal-ex-spy-exposed-substance-salisbury-hospital","fields":{"headline":"Who is Sergei Skripal, the ex-spy exposed to 'unknown substance'?","bodyText":"A former Russian army colonel convicted of passing the identities of Moscow agents working undercover in Europe to MI6 in 2006, Sergei Skripal arrived in the UK as part of a high-profile spy swap in 2010. Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in jail for spying for Britain in Russia in August 2006 after being convicted of “high treason in the form of espionage”. Russian prosecutors said he had been paid $100,000 by MI6 for information, which he had been supplying since the 1990s when he was a serving officer. The FSB, Russia’s security agency, said the information passed to MI6 by Skripal constituted state secrets. Skripal served in Russia’s GRU military intelligence until 1999, reaching the rank of colonel. He then worked at the Russian foreign ministry’s office in Moscow until 2003, when he went into business. “You outplayed me,” Skripal reportedly told FSB agents after his arrest. An FSB spokesperson compared Skripal to Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, who was executed by the Soviet Union in 1963 for supplying the United States with information during the Cuban missile crisis. In July 2010, the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, pardoned Skripal and the former colonel was one of four spies exchanged for 10 deep cover “sleeper” agents planted in the US by Moscow. He and another Russian were flown to the UK after the exchange and were debriefed by MI5 and MI6 officers. At the time, Skripal was considered the more important of the two spies brought to Britain. It was assumed that Skripal had since been given a new identity, a home and a pension. The two Russians who went to the US were Alexander Zaporozhsky, a KGB colonel whose information unmasked traitors inside the CIA and FBI, and Gennady Vasilenko, a former KGB officer. Among the 10 Russian spies deported from the US was Anna Chapman, who was arrested at a New York police department precinct after turning in a fake passport an undercover FBI agent had given to her. The daughter of a Russian diplomat, she became the most recognisable of the 10 agents after her former husband sold photographs to the press showcasing her social life and travels. Before settling in the US, she had lived in the UK for seven years after marrying an Englishman. Prosecutors say Chapman used a specially configured laptop computer to transmit messages to an unnamed Russian official."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/05/renters-britain-political-homeowners-inequality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T19:15:42Z","webTitle":"How renters could redraw Britain’s political map | Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/renters-britain-political-homeowners-inequality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/renters-britain-political-homeowners-inequality","fields":{"headline":"How renters could redraw Britain’s political map","bodyText":"Across much of the country, the blanketing snow has melted mostly to slush. Rough sleepers can breathe a small sigh of relief that the risk of fatality has dipped slightly, even while their standard of living remains appalling in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Throughout the week-long meteorological siege, a mass public outpouring of concern for the lives of citizens living on the streets gave way to an anger that their numbers had doubled in the years since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. The homeless often feel invisible, allowed to plummet through widening holes in the social safety net, then hidden in doorways from which people avert their eyes. The homeless people I’ve spoken to stress that they are still subject to abuse, verbal and physical, and provoke horror and fear among some people. But, most say, there has been a noticeable shift: fewer people carry loose change, but passersby fetch them coffee, hot food and sandwiches, stop to talk to ask about their situation and whether they can help. The rise in rough sleeping across the country has made it impossible to ignore, and the winter months hammer home the danger and indignity facing people each night. Empathy is an uncomfortable force in politics. Every time the chancellor produces a budget, the media and political parties produce widgets and rough calculations focusing on whether you and your family will be worse off or can expect a modest windfall off the back of fiscal tweaks. It’s assumed you will skim read a manifesto and see which party’s wishlist will most benefit you. Nowhere has this approach been more obvious than in housing. The housing crisis, like climate change, is ever present and ever worsening, seemingly with nothing on the horizon likely to end it. Why not take a radical approach and enforce market conditions that lower house prices? Because homeowners are more likely to vote, and have been conditioned to view the rise in the value of their assets as earned rather than an incidental market blip. Received wisdom says homeowners vote Conservative, and renters vote Labour: this roughly remains true, but other factors are creeping in to muddy this distinction. First, home ownership is at a record low. The English Housing Survey reported last year that the percentage of people who own the roof over their head hadn’t dropped so many points since 1985. So that voting base is being whittled down as prices refuse to fall. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of mortgage holders are also worried about the effects of the housing crisis, rather than prioritising personal financial gain. In areas with a high number of private renters, the Conservative vote fell last year, with homeowners reported to be concerned about the future of their children and neighbours. There are now more private renters than there were in the early 1960s, spending far higher proportions of their incomes on rent. To win the next general election, each party will need to consider this shift: voters are increasingly concerned not just for themselves, but about the state of the country they live in. Decades of predictable elections won by mainstream parties that upheld the economic status quo have widened inequality, with some people and regions becoming far wealthier, while others are subject to endless precarity in employment and housing, in areas already steeped in economic decline. Throughout the west, the rise of populism has shaken establishments, with politicians and commentators asking why there has been a resurgent interest in socialism, and a growth of the far right on the opposite side. To which the answer is surely that most young people have seen little to recommend the maintenance of the current capitalist project. They have done as they were told, achieved as previous generations did, and yet find that they have won none of the rewards they expected for doing so. When faced with such a rotten system, little wonder they are looking to reset it. The next general election won’t be won by a party that tinkers with the existing housing system, or promises a few mechanisms to help enough people on to the housing ladder to snag a few marginals. Labour’s 2017 manifesto was tame on the housing front, as was the Conservatives’ offering. The political ecosystem has changed: motivations are shifting, and voters need to be offered an entirely new vision – one that stresses the lifting of whole communities, not life rafts for a few. • Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/06/sex-workers-advertise-online-pop-up-brothels-criminalised","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"If sex workers can’t advertise online, it forces them on to the street | Molly Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/sex-workers-advertise-online-pop-up-brothels-criminalised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/sex-workers-advertise-online-pop-up-brothels-criminalised","fields":{"headline":"If sex workers can’t advertise online, it forces them on to the street","bodyText":"“Internet giants profit from ‘pop-up’ brothels”, shouted the Sunday Times as it used its front page to call for new measures to tackle this apparent scourge, pointing to a law that is making its way through the US Congress as a model. But despite being couched in the language of “anti-trafficking”, the law has met with criticism from sex workers and anti-trafficking advocates alike. The proposals (which are still changing as they move through the Senate) would increasingly render sex workers unable to advertise online, with tech companies fearing prosecution for hosting such ads. When people who sell sex are kicked off online platforms where we advertise and communicate, we lose a crucial tool that allows us to screen potential clients. When sites remove our ads, sex workers are pushed into working on the street, which is often more dangerous (especially for those who are new to it) and more precarious – and by increasing sex workers’ visibility, leaves them more vulnerable to arrest. People reach out to third parties: if you can no longer find clients by putting up an ad, you might seek out a manager or associate who can find you clients. Taking away our ability to advertise – while ostensibly aimed at tackling exploitation – often, paradoxically, pushes sex workers into exploitative relationships. The law that the Sunday Times praised goes even further. In widely expanding who can go after websites associated with commercial sex, it will intensify the criminalisation of sites that host harm reduction tools such as “ugly mugs” or “bad date” lists, which carry information on violent clients. (Sites that host this information in the US are already under siege.) The anti-trafficking advocate Kate D’Adamo, who has worked for harm reduction organisations in New York for many years, writes that the law will “undermine almost every single thing I would tell people for how to stay alive. All screening, all peer references, all bad date lists I could send.” In criminalising the ways that sex workers try to stay safe, such a law will see more sex workers harmed. If criminalisation prevented commercial sex, the US – which aggressively criminalises all aspects of prostitution – would be prostitution-free. If criminalisation prevented exploitation, it would be one of the most equal nations on earth. Is it free of prostitution? Is it free of exploitation? A look at the US reveals that criminalisation does little to prevent commercial sex, but greatly exacerbates harm to people who sell it – and that real anti-trafficking measures would look like resources, not police. People need housing, healthcare and routes to citizenship, not ever-intensifying criminalisation. In the UK, the buzz phrase “pop-up brothels” is used to suggest that there is something new and freshly alarming about sex workers in your neighbourhood. Fuelled in part by this nonsensical implication of a new threat (in reality, sex workers have been in a flat in your neighbourhood since for ever, without anybody noticing), local police forces have been aggressively raiding working flats. The result is often to arrest the sex workers they find: in UK law, brothel-keeping is an offence so broad that any two sex workers simply sharing a flat for safety can be charged with it. Those who are not prosecuted are evicted, and migrant workers are deported. In positioning the tackling of “pop-up brothels” as key to ending exploitation, the Sunday Times attempts to give a progressive gloss to raids, arrests, evictions, prosecutions and deportations of sex workers. There may, of course, be some journalists for whom these outcomes are desirable: but if so, those people should have the courage to say so directly, and not couch their views in the language of anti-trafficking. Meanwhile, just last week Theresa May’s government announced it will be halving the already-meagre allowance given to survivors of trafficking. In cutting this allowance to just £37 a week, survivors will be pushed into destitution – and made vulnerable to further exploitation. Women are on hunger strike at Yarl’s Wood, where detainees – many of them survivors of gender-based violence and exploitation, and all of them enduring state violence from Britain’s immigration system – are protesting at indefinite detention. The collision of technology and commercial sex makes many reach for criminalisation, seeking to “solve” the problem of prostitutes encroaching on your leafy suburban street or your holiday let. But if the government were really interested in reducing harm or tackling exploitation – which it largely isn’t – it would end immigration detention or increase the resources given to trafficking survivors and asylum seekers, not embark on more failed and harmful attempts to eradicate commercial sex through criminalisation. • Molly Smith is a sex worker and activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/russell-tovey-when-i-started-having-sex-i-panicked-because-i-didnt-feel-old-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Russell Tovey: ‘When I started having sex I panicked because I didn’t feel old enough’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/russell-tovey-when-i-started-having-sex-i-panicked-because-i-didnt-feel-old-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/11/russell-tovey-when-i-started-having-sex-i-panicked-because-i-didnt-feel-old-enough","fields":{"headline":"Russell Tovey: ‘When I started having sex I panicked because I didn’t feel old enough’","bodyText":"A question actors always get asked is: ‘What are you doing at the minute?’ I used to dread it because it made you feel like you were failing if you had nothing on. I got over that when I started to get very busy and began to realise that having a life is just as important as having a career. I do think acting can be as transformative as meditation. You can lose yourself and be someone else, and if you’re a good actor you can access and shut off parts of yourself. When I was younger and really busy, I think I did lose sight of who exactly I was. Mental wellbeing is something that is so important in any career but in acting in particular. That’s why friendship and family is so important to me. I used to always feel like everything was happening a bit too quickly; when I passed my driving test or started having sex I panicked because I didn’t feel old enough. I’ve always been someone who feels like they need to catch up or pretend to be ready for these things, but in my head I’m not, I’m thinking: ‘Get out of the car and stop having sex!’ Now I feel like I can legit do sex and do driving – I’ve caught up with it. I’m finally ready at 36. One thing I notice about living in New York is the positive mentality. If you want to do something, someone will say: ‘Oh cool, let’s make this happen.’ I like to try all the classes, like Barry’s Bootcamp and SoulCycle. I was going to have a go at cryotherapy, where you stand in a pod and you go like -1,000C for three minutes and it reactivates your enzymes. I’m definitely a worrier, I get it from my mum. She has always gone from zero to panic in seconds. I’ll be flapping about and Steve, my fiancé, will say: ‘Chill out, give it 10 minutes.’ I can’t be with someone who is like me; I need a calming influence in a partner.

Speaking on the first day of three weeks of hearings into the C of E’s handling of abuse cases stretching back decades, the specialist abuse lawyer Richard Scorer said survivors had faced years of institutional cover-up and denial. The C of E could not be trusted to put its own house in order, said Scorer. “As the established church, [it] claims to offer moral guidance and moral leadership to the country. Yet clerical sex abuse cases and the scandals associated with them powerfully undermine that claim.” Scorer, who represents 21 survivors, said: “It must be clear now that if you want to abuse children, there is no more effective way of terrifying and silencing your victims than to claim to have God on your side. “If you combine that with an environment in which perpetrators are routinely forgiven, in which victims are disparaged and in which there is no clear legal obligation to report allegations of abuse to the statutory authorities, then you have the perfect honeypot for attracting more abusers and indeed the perfect environment in which they can flourish.” Survivors need the inquiry to “to step in and do what only you can do, which is to make the church properly accountable externally for these appalling scandals”. An independent body should be set up to investigate allegations of abuse and was capable of overriding bishops “unwilling to comply with their responsibilities”, said Scorer. Mandatory reporting of disclosures of abuse should be introduced, he added. “The C of E cannot be allowed to carry on marking its own homework.” Earlier the inquiry heard that testimonies and witness statements over the next three weeks would focus on the diocese of Chichester as a case study. Among those expected to give evidence are the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, his predecessor Rowan Williams and a clutch of senior bishops. In her opening statement, Fiona Scolding QC, lead counsel to the inquiry, said Chichester had been “engulfed” in allegations in the first decade of this century. She listed 15 clergy in the diocese, including the former bishop of Lewes Peter Ball, who had been convicted of child sexual offences, adding that allegations had been made against a further 11. “The church is the established church of England – the national church. It is a very important and powerful institution within our society. It provides spiritual sustenance for many and is seen as a leader in terms of not just religious questions, but related questions of social justice and ethics,” she said. Scolding painted a picture of a church which failed to adopt effective protection for children and vulnerable adults until recently. Its national spending on safeguarding increased from £1.6m in 2011 to £5.1m last year. On behalf of the Archbishops’ Council, an advisory body to the church’s spiritual heads, Nigel Giffin QC acknowledged that the C of E had failed in important respects. Quoting Welby’s witness statement to the inquiry, he said the archbishop found these failures “deeply shaming” and “a cause of horror and sadness”. But, Giffin insisted, much had changed for the better although a good deal remained to be done. Richard Smith QC, acting for Ball, who was jailed for 32 months in October 2015 for abusing 18 young men, said he was issuing a “public apology on his behalf to all of those who have been affected by his wrongdoing”. The inquiry will hold a separate hearing into the church’s handling of Ball’s abuse in July. At the start of Monday’s hearing, the inquiry’s chair, Alexis Jay, rebuked Welby for breaching confidentiality regarding his appearance at the inquiry after he told journalists at Lambeth Palace last month he would be cross-examined in person, giving the date. Jay said: “The church has apologised for this breach of confidentiality. Whilst the panel is grateful for this apology, it is most disappointing that the confidential matters were shared by the archbishop, in breach of the undertaking.” The hearings continue on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/06/north-korean-defector-winter-paralympics-ice-hockey","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T03:34:26Z","webTitle":"'They'll think I'm a traitor': North Korean defector makes Winter Paralympics debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/06/north-korean-defector-winter-paralympics-ice-hockey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/06/north-korean-defector-winter-paralympics-ice-hockey","fields":{"headline":"'They'll think I'm a traitor': North Korean defector makes Winter Paralympics debut","bodyText":"Choi Kwang-hyouk has been unable to escape his past, and every new encounter conjures the same images from his previous life: North Korean refugee, vagrant, amputee. For years that past weighed heavily on him and he struggled after he was smuggled out of the North to South Korea. But with his debut at the Paralympics in Pyeongchang this week, the 30-year-old hopes to be defined by his accomplishments and his sport, para ice hockey, in which 10 men slide across the ice on sleighs in a modified form of the game. “There are titles that will always follow me, like defector or beggar, even though I’ve changed so much since then,” Choi said. “But I would like to be remembered as someone who has gone through painful times, and is now full of passion to play this sport representing the Republic of Korea. “When people talk about sledge ice hockey in South Korea, I want them to mention my name.” While Choi will not play against any of his former compatriots, he expects any meetings to be potentially awkward. “I will be happy to see them, but I don’t think they will be happy to see me,” he said. “They’ll think I’m a traitor.” This year is the first time North Korea will participate in the Winter Paralympics, after its Summer Games debut in London in 2012. The North’s delegation will be by far its biggest to any Games to date, with 20 athletes set to participate, and is part of a dramatic rapprochement between the two neighbours. North Korea’s participation is all the more surprising given numerous reports that disabled people are routinely discriminated against and sometimes imprisoned. When Choi was seven years old, North Korea’s founding leader Kim Il-sung died and, coupled with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the aid it provided, the country was plagued by a famine that killed at least a million people according to estimates by a US congressional committee. His parents divorced and he was raised by his maternal grandmother, who died two years later. By the time Choi was nine, he was on his own and began selling ice cream to train passengers to survive. To avoid train conductors looking to punish him for a lack of a ticket and his minor act of capitalism, Choi frequently rode between stations on the roof of train carriages or by hanging off the side. One day while he was climbing to the roof he slipped and fell. One of the wheels ran over the top of his left foot. An injured Choi was brought to a hospital, but the doctors, equipped with only the most basic medical supplies, opted to amputate his leg below the knee – without anaesthesia – rather than attempt to repair his foot. “My foot could have been fixed in another country, but in North Korea the medicine was so poor,” he said. He would eventually have four surgeries in the South. After his leg was amputated, there was no prosthetic limb, only crude wooden crutches that Choi would often smash in fits of rage. North Korean authorities have long discriminated against disabled people, with a UN report saying some are sent to prison camps. While Choi was harassed by police during his time selling ice cream, that abuse increased exponentially after his accident. “North Korean propaganda portrays the country as always healthy and strong, but we were a reminder that that is not true, so we were treated harshly by the authorities,” he said. His disability also cost him his friends: his fellow homeless youths abandoned him, and since he could no longer carry his box filled with ice cream, he started begging. “In North Korean society there is hierarchy in everything, even among beggars,” he said. “Physically impaired people are always at the bottom.” The dire situation in the North makes this year’s participation in the Paralympics all the more intriguing, says Choi. “North Korea is a challenging place for the impaired. It wouldn’t be possible for someone with disabilities to participate in the Paralympic Games unless he or she has power and wealth.” Choi arrived in South Korea in 2001 after his father paid a broker to smuggle him out of the North. His father had already settled in South Korea, but their relationship was strained and Choi spent years struggling in school and life. Like many newly arrived North Korean refugees he was slow to integrate and took to staying away for days in internet cafes, chain smoking and playing computer games. He spent two years in that hole, before starting classes at Korea National University of Welfare to study prosthetics manufacturing. A staff member recommended he try para ice hockey in 2015, and his obsession for online gaming changed into a strict training regimen. “A lot of North Koreans fail to settle and integrate; they wander and become self-destructive,” Choi said. “I want to be an example of how people can adjust well, that even a disabled person like me can succeed in South Korea.” Additional reporting by Haeyoon Kim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/05/espn-lawsuit-chris-berman-jemele-hill-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T01:11:28Z","webTitle":"Jemele Hill denies claims in lawsuit she was racially abused by Chris Berman at ESPN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/05/espn-lawsuit-chris-berman-jemele-hill-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/05/espn-lawsuit-chris-berman-jemele-hill-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Jemele Hill denies claims in lawsuit she was racially abused by Chris Berman at ESPN","bodyText":"ESPN’s Jemele Hill has denied allegations in a lawsuit that claims Chris Berman, for years the face of the broadcaster, left a racially abusive voicemail for her in 2016.

According to Lawrence’s suit: “In early 2016, ESPN’s The Undefeated personality Jemele Hill received a threatening and racially disparaging voicemail from Berman on her ESPN phone line. After Hill notified executive Marcia Keegan about the matter and forwarded the voicemail to her, nothing was done. Despite his continued and repeated misconduct toward women, Berman remains a celebrated and welcome ESPN employee.” However, on Monday night Hill rebutted the allegations.

The 62-year-old continues to make occasional appearances on the network. Hill hosted ESPN’s primetime SC6 show for a year before joining the company’s Undefeated section, which covers culture, race and sports.

Chanting “communists are murderers” and “we have had enough”, protesters held sheets of paper rolled up to resemble police batons in an expression of indignation over the installation of Zdeněk Ondráček, a Czech Communist party MP, as chair of the parliament’s general inspection of security forces commission. The choice of Ondráček to head a sensitive committee overseeing police wrongdoing was confirmed in a parliamentary vote last week despite objections that he had served in a unit that beat up pro-democracy demonstrators in the 1989 Velvet Revolution before the fall of communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. Monday’s protest coincided with simultaneous demonstrations in 10 other Czech cities and towns, including the second largest city, Brno. Protesters congregating in Prague’s Wenceslas Square – scene of the 1989 mass demonstrations that triggered the downfall of the former communist regime – focused their anger on prime minister Andrej Babiš, who is accused of facilitating Ondráček’s appointment in exchange for the support of 15 Communist party MPs for a government led by his ANO party, which is the biggest grouping in parliament but lacks sufficient numbers to form a majority. Some said they feared for the future of democracy in the Czech Republic. “We feel democracy is under threat,” said Iva Vrbova, 53, a company manager who recalled taking part in the 1989 gatherings. “I stood here in the streets in 1989 and here we are again in exactly the same place – and for the same reason. “He [Ondráček] is a man who beat ordinary people in the streets and now he wants to check and control police power in the Czech Republic. It’s horrible.” Michal Mares, 58, a financial analyst and another veteran of the 1989 protests, said: “It’s a disgusting situation. Democracy is moving backwards, that’s why we are here.” There were signs that the show of people power could force a U-turn. Babiš – who himself has been identified as a secret police informer during the communist period, despite his denials – said he would push to have Ondráček’s appointment overturned, drawing criticism that he was merely bowing to public sentiment. The controversy has coincided with the 70th anniversary of the communists’ seizure of sole power in Czechoslovakia in a coup that pushed the other parties in the coalition government out of office. Ondraček has been defended by the current Communist party leader, Vojtěch Filip, who said his fellow MP “did nothing wrong” in fulfilling his police duties to suppress demonstrations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/05/ngolo-kante-fainted-chelsea-training-manchester-city-reports","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T20:28:41Z","webTitle":"N’Golo Kanté reportedly fainted in dressing room after Chelsea training","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/05/ngolo-kante-fainted-chelsea-training-manchester-city-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/05/ngolo-kante-fainted-chelsea-training-manchester-city-reports","fields":{"headline":"N’Golo Kanté reportedly fainted in dressing room after Chelsea training","bodyText":"N’Golo Kanté missed Chelsea’s visit to Manchester City on Sunday after fainting at the club’s training ground on Friday, according to reports. The 26-year-old reportedly passed out after a training session at Cobham, and later underwent cardiology tests. Despite being initially cleared to play, Kanté felt unwell on Sunday morning and was left out of Antonio Conte’s squad. As first reported by The Telegraph, the French midfielder was attended to by team doctors seconds after slumping over in the dressing room. After regaining consciousness, Kanté was sent to a specialist, who found no heart problems. The incident is thought to have greatly alarmed Kanté’s team-mates at the time, and was brought into sharp relief by the news of Fiorentina captain Davide Astori’s sudden death on Sunday. Astori played for Conte and several of his backroom staff with the Italian national team, and the Chelsea manager was visibly emotional in paying tribute to the defender before the 1-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium. Kanté has reportedly been given a clean bill of health by Chelsea, and is available to feature against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and in the Champions League second-leg tie in Barcelona next week. Azpilicueta insists Chelsea have plenty to play for The Chelsea defender César Azpilicueta insists there is plenty to play for in the final two months of the season despite his side’s poor recent form. Last season’s champions are five points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who visit Stamford Bridge on 1 April, but Azpilicueta is targeting progress on three different fronts. “We have lost a lot of games already and we don’t have space to make another mistake.

We have three targets to aim for this season,” said the Spaniard. “We are in a bad position at the moment compared with where we were five games ago,” he added. “We put ourselves in this position and we are disappointed, but we have to bounce back.” Reuters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/frances-mcdormand-oscar-stolen-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T19:51:25Z","webTitle":"Man suspected of stealing Frances McDormand's Oscar arrested","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/frances-mcdormand-oscar-stolen-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/frances-mcdormand-oscar-stolen-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Man suspected of stealing Frances McDormand's Oscar arrested","bodyText":"A man who apparently swiped Frances McDormand’s Oscar trophy boasted about it on Facebook, claiming he won it for music, before being arrested on suspicion of felony grand theft. Terry Bryant, 47, was being held on $20,000 bail for allegedly stealing the statue at the Governors Ball party soon after Sunday night’s 90th Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood. A Los Angeles police department spokesperson said Bryant had a ticket for the event. “Sup babies, look, my team got this tonight. Who wants to tell me congratulations?” Bryant, dressed in a tuxedo, said in a video posted on Facebook. “This is mine. We got it tonight, baby!” Onlookers asked to touch the statuette and offered congratulations, apparently unaware the Oscar belonged to McDormand. When Bryant yelled for directions to the party hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, the ceremony’s presenter, an unidentified bystander replied: “That’s your ticket to any party you want to go to.” McDormand won the award for her performance as a grieving mother seeking justice for her murdered daughter in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Her powerful acceptance speech demanding greater inclusion of women and marginalised groups in the film industry electrified the Dolby theatre audience. She was celebrating at the ball when Bryant allegedly swiped the trophy from her table. His performance as an Oscar winner did not last long. A New York Times reporter, Cara Buckley, tweeted a photo of Bryant and said a photographer working for the chef Wolfgang Puck stopped him and retrieved the statuette. “After some brief time apart, Frances and her Oscar were happily reunited. They celebrated the reunion with a double cheeseburger from In-N-Out Burger,” McDormand’s publicist, Simon Halls, said. It is the second time McDormand has picked up the best actress award, having previously won the statuette in 1996 for her performance as an eccentric Minnesota cop in Fargo. A telephone number for Bryant couldn’t immediately be located and it wasn’t clear if he had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in a statement: “Best Actress winner Frances McDormand and her Oscar were happily reunited after a brief separation at last night’s Governors Ball. The alleged thief was quickly apprehended by a photographer and members of our fast-acting Academy and security teams.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/05/eddie-jones-england-changes-france-paris-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T22:00:04Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones threatens England changes for likely Paris ‘slogathon’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/05/eddie-jones-england-changes-france-paris-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/05/eddie-jones-england-changes-france-paris-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones threatens England changes for likely Paris ‘slogathon’","bodyText":"Eddie Jones has warned that “no one is indispensable” as he mulls over his best options for the key Six Nations away game against France on Saturday. The probability of wet weather in Paris may influence England’s selection in certain areas, not least at half‑back, the back-row and in midfield. So keen is Jones to locate the tactical antidote to his side’s Calcutta Cup defeat that he rose at 4am on Monday, unable to sleep because of the matters raised by England’s sub-par performance in Scotland. While he confirmed Dylan Hartley would continue to lead the team at the Stade de France, the head coach appears to be considering some changes to the starting XV. With the forecast for Paris somewhere between damp and torrential, and the pitch invariably on the heavy side, Jones is braced for a “slogathon” against a big French pack who might fancy an arm wrestle. England’s desire to improve at the breakdown could involve the Bath flanker Sam Underhill and there is also a case for starting the Saracens’ half‑back duo of Richard Wigglesworth and Owen Farrell on Saturday and bolstering the midfield with the physical Ben Te’o. Wigglesworth’s kicking game is as good as anyone’s and France’s formidable inside centre Mathieu Bastareaud will also be eyeing George Ford’s channel. Jones has so far favoured dual playmakers at 10 and 12 but this weekend could conceivably prove an exception to the rule. “I’m not wedded to anything,” Jones said. “The players understand that. They’ve got to perform. Who plays at 10 and 12 will be done on who we think is best for that game.” To reinforce his point, the Australian wheeled out one of the oldest yarns in his coaching manual. “There’s an old story about a coach with a bucket of water in his office. He’d say: ‘Come here son, put your hand in this bucket.’ When the player took it out he’d say: ‘What’s happened?’ Your hand creates a hole but as soon as your hand comes out the hole’s filled in. “No one’s indispensable. It’s the same with me. We’re in a high‑performance environment. High performance means you’ve got to perform. [If] I lose one game I might be on flight QF1 back to Sydney. Who knows? You see it in football all the time now and rugby is becoming more and more like football.” Jones will have a clearer picture after training on Tuesday, with Sam Simmonds and Elliot Daly both back in contention for the matchday 23. Either way, he is not ruling out a “horses for courses” selection as England seek to maintain their Six Nations title hopes. “There is very heavy rain forecast and we all know the Stade de France is a heavy pitch anyway,” Jones said. “We could pick a team to play a ‘slogathon’. They will be very physical and aggressive. Jacques Brunel picks very big teams ... we know what is going to come at us, we have just got to be good enough to stop it.” Even if England do slump to a second consecutive away defeat, Jones has already been enduring sleepless nights. “Last night I woke up at 4am. I can’t sleep because it annoys me losing a game we shouldn’t have lost. There’s usually a thought in my head. I go to the office and start sending texts and emails to various staff members. Some of them reply straight away, some of them don’t. “I always find it’s the best time to think. I don’t have anxiety, I just have thoughts about what we have to fix. If you ask any coach who has coached at a high level they would say the same. “I’ve coached for 20 years. If I’d been anxious for 20 years I’d be dead,” Jones added. “The one thing I’ve learned is I should get two dogs – because then I’ll always have two friends. I’m looking for another dog at the moment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/11/sal-mick-kitson-book-feminist-saints-julia-pierpont-why-longer-white-people-reni-eddo-lodge-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T12:30:29Z","webTitle":"In brief: Sal, The Little Book of Feminist Saints, Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/11/sal-mick-kitson-book-feminist-saints-julia-pierpont-why-longer-white-people-reni-eddo-lodge-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/11/sal-mick-kitson-book-feminist-saints-julia-pierpont-why-longer-white-people-reni-eddo-lodge-review","fields":{"headline":"In brief: Sal; The Little Book of Feminist Saints; Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race – reviews","bodyText":"Sal Mick Kitson Canongate, 12.99, pp240 Survival is all for two half-sisters, 13-year-old Sal and 10-year-old Peppa, who escape from a violent home in a small town near Glasgow and move to the wilderness of Scotland.

City submitted the manager’s official response on Saturday in which the FA was informed Guardiola is content to “recognise the stipulations” of the rules of the association in which he is working and will observe these by no longer wearing the yellow ribbon, which is a show of support for imprisoned Catalan politicians. Yet City also stated to the FA that its stance on the ribbon appears out of step with Uefa, European football’s governing body. Guardiola is allowed to wear the ribbon for Champions League matches – the rule relates to what is worn on the person on the touchline during the 90 minutes of play. The charge related to City’s FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic on 19 February. Guardiola’s deposition pointed to how he had the ribbon covered in the two following games against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Premier League, and how it was also not visible for the defeat of Chelsea on Sunday. It did become visible during the Wembley showpiece, though it is understood this was inadvertent as it was initially covered. Against Wigan the ribbon had also been hidden by the manager’s jacket during the first half, with it becoming visible after the interval when Guardiola unzipped the top of his jacket. The FA said: “A paper hearing has been requested, with a date to be set in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/05/icc-twenty20-test-cricket-west-indies-england-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T21:30:03Z","webTitle":"ICC considers radical plan to curb power of Twenty20 and save Test cricket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/05/icc-twenty20-test-cricket-west-indies-england-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/05/icc-twenty20-test-cricket-west-indies-england-australia","fields":{"headline":"ICC considers radical plan to curb power of Twenty20 and save Test cricket","bodyText":"The International Cricket Council is set to consider a series of radical proposals designed to stem the talent drain caused by domestic Twenty20 and protect the sport from being cannibalised at all levels. Cricket is at a crossroads and there is a growing acceptance among its administrators that the primacy of internationals – Test cricket in particular – is being diminished by the proliferation of short-form tournaments that, if unchecked, could cause irreversible damage. To that end, the chief executives of the full member national boards will come together at the next ICC meeting in Kolkata in April to debate a discussion paper on the possible future landscape for domestic Twenty20 cricket within the world game, and recommendations that include: • Restricting players under 32 to three domestic T20 leagues per year • Regional T20 windows that leave six months of the year clear for international cricket from 2023 onwards • All leagues to pay 20% of a player’s contract value to their home board as mandatory compensation • Capping the number of overseas players in each domestic T20 league • Standardised conditions that guarantee player welfare and payment This push to bring in greater global regulation for Twenty20 is being led by West Indies – the ICC full member most affected by the Twenty20 player exodus over the past decade – and is understood to have had input and support from England and Australia. The global players’ union, Fica, will welcome the elements that provide its members with greater security. India could well be persuaded by some or all of the proposals too given it does not allow its cricketers to feature in overseas T20 competitions and its Indian Premier League already pays the 20% compensation figure for players it imports; the IPL’s status as the outright market leader, by virtue of its £1.97bn broadcast deal, would likely be consolidated. Indeed, the intention is not to diminish the established T20 leagues but to ensure a balance is struck that means both domestic and international cricket can coexist and thrive when the ICC introduces Test and ODI leagues from 2019. It stems from a fear that, unless the governing body brings in tougher rules that guarantee league revenues go back into player development rather than to private owners, the grassroots of the sport could wither. West Indies, for example, estimate that for every junior cricketer who reaches international level, around $1m has been invested. But once they get there, a number disappear into the domestic leagues – of which five fall during the traditional Caribbean season from October to March. The result has left a trail of bad blood between players and their board and though two World T20 titles have come during this time, the West Indies 50-over men’s team are playing qualifiers for the 2019 World Cup while some of its biggest names compete in the Pakistan Super League. West Indies have been a lone voice of protest but other major nations are beginning to wake up to the challenge as more and more players become globetrotting guns for hire, diluting the competitions and national teams they leave behind. Compensation paid by T20 leagues to a player’s country of origin fluctuates greatly and is not mandatory. Making it so, and standardised to 20% a player’s value (paid by the tournament) would ensure money is put directly back into the systems that developed them. By limiting the number of ICC-accredited Twenty20 leagues that cricketers under 32 can play in each year – one at home and two abroad is a suggested formula – it is believed a balance can be struck that sees workloads managed and cricketers less torn between international and domestic careers. Perhaps the toughest proposal to get over the line – and one already seen as unlikely until 2023 – is regional windows for Twenty20 leagues. The idea is for the map to be split up into three zones – Asia, Europe/Americas and Africa/Pacific – and restrict each to two-month blocks in April/May, mid-July/mid-September, December/January respectively. This would allow international cricket to breathe during the remaining six months. It would also see the likes of the IPL going up against the Pakistan Super League and the Bangladesh Premier League in the Asian block, for example, and cooperative TV scheduling would be required. Beyond approving tournaments using its existing minimal criteria, the ICC has always maintained that domestic Twenty20 cricket issues sit outside its remit. But though the ICC board is still unwilling to get involved directly, the chief executives have been given the green light to explore solutions that protect cricket’s current ecosystem. Another driver is the concern that the ICC’s showpiece tournaments – the World Cup and the World Twenty20, as well as the new Test and ODI leagues – could see their commercial value greatly diminished. The doomsday scenario mentioned in the corridors of power sees a wealthy backer set up a league in an associate nation for a nominal fee and place no restrictions on overseas players, before assembling squads along national lines and offering broadcasters a quasi-international tournament. If that appears far-fetched then consider the proposed new leagues in Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Organisers for the former say teams will require four local players per squad but none in the playing XI, while the latter is said be to considering up to 10 overseas cricketers per team. Capping the number of overseas players is viewed as essential, while ensuring prompt payment – via the use of escrow accounts – and increased fitness screening are other mooted safeguards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/05/populist-italy-europe-eu-countries-european-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T19:10:06Z","webTitle":"Populist gains in Italy show the scale of Europe’s anger epidemic | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/populist-italy-europe-eu-countries-european-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/populist-italy-europe-eu-countries-european-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Populist gains in Italy show the scale of Europe’s anger epidemic","bodyText":"There is no comfort for British pro-Europeans in the knowledge that the EU has worse problems than Brexit. In recent months, more sleep has been lost in Brussels over Italian politics than anything Theresa May’s government might do. That alarm was vindicated by Sunday’s election. The biggest winners were the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right League (formerly known as the Northern League). Both are Eurosceptic by continental standards, but neither made that the centrepiece of their campaign. They mined general frustration at the failure of the incumbent government to turn economic growth into public prosperity, made pungent in many areas by deep resentment of mass immigration. The ruling centre-left Democratic party (PD) was punished even more aggressively than was widely anticipated. Forza Italia, the party of Silvio Berlusconi, also did worse than forecast. The octogenarian former prime minister and impresario of sleaze had tried to bridge the gap between flagrant racism and pragmatism by offering a kind of populism-lite – anti-immigration but also pro-European; the reassuringly familiar face of casual patrician prejudice from a less volatile age. But he has been eclipsed by his junior coalition partner, the League’s Matteo Salvini, a dispenser of undiluted, racially charged vitriol. “There has been a tide of delinquents and I want to send them home, from first to last,” Salvini said of Italy’s migrant population at one election rally. It is testimony to how low expectations in Brussels have fallen that before the vote, Berlusconi was seen as the least worst available option. The hope was that he might sand the Eurosceptic edges from Italian nationalism. Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and a founder nation of the EU. Rome cannot be excluded from debates about vital structural reforms, but that conversation is politically tricky with a country that can’t form a stable government. It is also morally compromised if that country ends up governed to the beat of a quasi-fascist drum. The EU has already come to terms with the inclusion of the far-right Freedom party in a ruling coalition in Austria. But Heinz-Christian Strache, Freedom’s leader, has shrewdly bottled his nationalist poison in a pro-European vessel, pitching himself as an upholder of the union’s values – which he interprets through a lens of religious and ethnic exclusion. Vienna has also benefited from a lack of political bandwidth in Brussels when it comes to censuring governments that contravene the tolerant spirit of its treaties. The European commission is already tangled in a dispute with Poland over what it sees as authoritarian infringements of the rule of law. That friction expresses suspicion among eastern European members that the western side views their accession after the cold war as an act of charity, and expects too much deference in return. There are only so many fronts on which the guardians of EU cohesion can fight internal culture wars. The last thing any of them needs is for Italy to succumb to political paralysis, or worse. There is a tendency among Brexiters to greet signs of EU dysfunction with glee. One of the pillars of British Euroscepticism is a belief that the whole project is misguided; conceived with the utopian ambition to erase national identities. In that view, every effort at European integration inevitably provokes a popular backlash and hastens the day when centrifugal forces tear the union apart. Some leavers openly hoped the UK’s departure would trigger the great unravelling. That didn’t happen. And since any material benefits to the UK from Brexit now look remote at best, it is doubly important that the EU should appear to be struggling. Unable to fulfil any of their campaign promises, Brexiters hope to fall back on a claim to have presciently evacuated the nation from an institution that was doomed to fail. British Eurosceptics routinely underestimate the political determination on the continent to make the EU work, while overestimating the likelihood that political discontent in other countries will manifest itself as a desire to imitate Britain. But there is also a tendency among British pro-Europeans to treat the dishonesties of the leave campaign, coupled with the ineptitude of May’s handling of the negotiations, as proof that every Eurosceptic analysis was wrong. Likewise, on the European side there has been rather too much relief at the conspicuous shambles that the UK government has made of Brexit. The election of Donald Trump within months of the UK’s shock referendum result caused anxiety in continental capitals that an unstoppable populist hurricane was ripping through the west. Then, the far right underperformed expectations in the Dutch elections in March 2017 and Emmanuel Macron led a spectacular centre-ground insurgency in France a few months later. So the story changed. Brexit and Trump looked more like a nasty Anglo-Saxon virus that had been contained at the Channel. The sight of their hideous symptoms was inoculation enough for continental European electorates. There was truth and complacency in that account. Brexit has not been an advertisement for the practical applications of Eurosceptic ideology in government. But the underlying drivers of Britain’s rejection of EU membership are not unique to the UK: economic insecurity, disconnection of citizens from ruling elites, fear of immigration as a force that corrodes national identity. Those have been the most potent cultural dynamics in every ballot in every established democracy of the past two years. In some countries these forces have been hemmed back in opposition; in some they have been co-opted to into government. In Italy they have produced a hopelessly hung parliament, stuffed with agents of racism and misrule. That is bad news for those on either side of the Channel impatient to see the EU regain its lost momentum and function in the spirit of its foundational values. Pro-Europeans, appalled by the referendum result, are sometimes too quick to see Brexit as a singular misfortune to befall the most Eurosceptic member of the club. While the British experience doesn’t invite imitation, the forces that created it are part of a crisis that is truly, enduringly pan-European. • Rafael Behr is a political columnist for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/05/couple-who-faked-holiday-sickness-rumbled-on-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T19:40:02Z","webTitle":"Couple who faked holiday sickness ‘rumbled’ on Facebook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/couple-who-faked-holiday-sickness-rumbled-on-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/couple-who-faked-holiday-sickness-rumbled-on-facebook","fields":{"headline":"Couple who faked holiday sickness ‘rumbled’ on Facebook","bodyText":"A man and a woman who fraudulently claimed they fell ill while on holiday in Turkey, but were “rumbled” by images they posted on social media, have been given suspended jail sentences. The move was welcomed by the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), which is campaigning to stamp out spurious sickness claims. Southern Derbyshire magistrates court heard that Leon Roberts, 37, and Jade Muzoka, 27, spent a week at the luxury Cornelia Diamond Golf Resort and Spa in Turkey in July 2015. The following April, the pair submitted claims through their solicitor saying they both fell ill with food poisoning during their stay. But investigators found photographs on Facebook of the couple, who have since split, lounging by the swimming pool, drinking and eating dinner. After hearing how a solicitor, a doctor and a claims management company had helped to prepare the “blatantly false” claim to the travel company Tui, the district judge, Jonathan Taaffe, said: “It would fly in the face of common sense for me to ignore the fact that a holiday company feel it necessary, because of a tsunami of claims, to bring a private prosecution.” Taaffe suspended both defendants’ jail terms for 12 months, ordered them to undertake 200 hours of unpaid community work, and handed them a bill for £1,115 to cover court costs and a victim surcharge. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta, said: “Today’s sentencing sends out the clearest possible message that the courts take a very dim view of anyone submitting a fraudulent holiday sickness claim. There has been a huge rise in these types of fraudulent claims, which are costing hotels and travel companies tens of millions of pounds.” A spokesperson for Tui UK &amp; Ireland said the outcome was “another clear warning of the risks of making an exaggerated sickness claim and the judge was very clear in his view on this type of behaviour”. Last year, the government pledged to step up attempts to eliminate fake holiday sickness scams, after a middle-aged British couple who had boasted on social media about “sun, laughter and fun” on their holidays were jailed over making false insurance claims. Deborah Briton and Paul Roberts tried to claim £20,000 in compensation by claiming they and their two children had fallen ill on holidays to Mallorca in 2015 and 2016. Tanzer said: “The government must make good its promise to bring overseas personal injury and sickness claims into the fixed legal cost regime – which will cap the exorbitant fees many solicitors are charging on the back of false sickness claims – in time for this year’s holiday season.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/11/cant-believe-wont-believe-henry-lowthers-still-waters-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T08:30:24Z","webTitle":"Henry Lowther’s Still Waters: Can’t Believe, Won’t Believe review – smooth perfection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/11/cant-believe-wont-believe-henry-lowthers-still-waters-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/11/cant-believe-wont-believe-henry-lowthers-still-waters-review","fields":{"headline":"Henry Lowther’s Still Waters: Can’t Believe, Won’t Believe review – smooth perfection","bodyText":"If I wanted to convert a reluctant listener to modern jazz, I’d happily present them with this.

Two other novels and a short story collection quickly followed, set around the same fictional village, a composite of various places in Limerick and Tipperary. Ranging from the boom years of the Celtic Tiger to the experience of Irish Travellers, they dug deep into the psyche of Irish communities, with marginal voices summoning the intensity of small-town loves and hates to uncover a complicated history and uncertain present. His fifth book, From a Low and Quiet Sea, begins with a very different story: that of Farouk, a Syrian doctor who with his wife and daughter flees a country collapsing into war in the hope of safety in the west. They discover too late that the boat they are crammed on to with other desperate families has no captain and no life jackets: and then a storm hits. Ryan took the story, he explains, from a news report about a Syrian doctor who paid what he thought was a high-end smuggler to get him out of the country, then lost his family at sea. “It really happened, the boat went down. What happens in the book happened in real life.” In the novel, the traumatised Farouk drifts through refugee holding camps, unable to process his loss. The real Farouk was employed on one of the Greek islands as a brain surgeon, says Ryan. “There was a line in the report where he says that he spends the time after his shifts looking out across the water, because that’s his family’s grave.” Ryan felt compelled to write Farouk’s story, starting and restarting it dozens of times, until he hit on a way of telling it that seemed right; but he also felt hugely conflicted. “I was taking as inspiration a living man’s story and his expression of terrible, unimaginable grief. I felt an obligation to that person and to the thousands of others like him to represent their struggle in as real a way as possible, to make it as immediate and relatable as possible, but I had this whispering voice in my head, saying, ‘You’re a fraud. You’ve never felt this. You’re just making stuff up and writing it down and you’re actually enjoying it.’ Because writing, when it goes well, brings me such joy, and I rarely feel as though I deserve it. The joy is like being gloriously drunk, and it’s always followed by a desperate hangover of guilt.” He had previously written an award-winning radio drama about crossing the Mediterranean, I Seek Refuge, narrated by a young Syrian girl, and a short story set in Syria, “Long Puck”, in which the Irish game of hurling brings together Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim players – until the militants representing Islamic State intervene. “I think so much about people who have to move across the world to try and find safety, and the reactions we have in the west. We export nine tenths of what we produce in Ireland and still there’ll be an idea that: ‘If we let people in we won’t have enough for ourselves.’ Empathy seems to be diminishing globally.” Though many of his stories have been prompted by news headlines, Ryan admits: “I’m a pretty lazy researcher. I find when I research too assiduously I start to write non-fiction, to explain to the reader what a thing is that they could easily know more about than me.” In a way, Farouk is “just me really. I do it over and over again, I give all my characters my own desperate character traits. You only know yourself really, and even that’s a mystery to most of us.” Farouk’s is not the only voice in From a Low and Quiet Sea: his journey to the west and eventually Ireland is threaded with the stories of Lampy, an aimless twentysomething working as a bus driver for a care home, and John, an elderly man with a dark past. Though the trio have nothing in common, they will come briefly together, to devastating effect. “The question is, how different are we? The things that make us human are the things that unite us,” Ryan insists. “The main elements of humanity are shared.” Ryan was born in Tipperary in 1976, into the kind of dense-knit, deep-rooted community he has created in his books. His father was a driving instructor; when he was young, his mother worked in a bookmaker’s, “which I thought was so glamorous. She imposed order on this lawless place.” His father went to mass every day, “just for the comfort of it, because it’s a beautiful thing”. These days, Ryan says, “I’ve created my own religion. I’m a semi-observant Catholic but I don’t believe any of the mumbo jumbo. The core of it is kindness, something that’s dissipating now across the world.” His older sister and younger brother went on to work in the civil service and the police force respectively; the children grew up in a house filled with literature. “My parents bought books in job lots: books from auctions and jumble sales, new books. They made sure that we were literate. They had all the mid-century Americans; I was reading Steinbeck, Hemingway and Bellow, very early on.” And the house was filled with stories, too: “My maternal grandmother was just wicked – a beautiful wit, could cut people in half, she was hilarious. My parents, both great storytellers. The story could be totally inconsequential, but it would be just the joy in the telling.” Ryan’s ambitions to write were reflected back at him by family and friends: from teachers at school onwards, “People around me were so convinced it’s what I should do.” But after a law degree at the University of Limerick and joining the civil service, Ryan spent a decade in “a creative wilderness”, making false starts at “pale pastiches of things I was impressed by”. At this point, it was just him and a ghost – a friendly one, he stresses in his matter-of-fact, rapid fire Tipperary accent. “There was no horror element, just a constant feeling of a warm presence, objects moving around, footsteps, whispered voices. I saw her once, walking across a room, right in front of me. Ninety-six per cent of the universe can’t be explained. There’s a world of room there for my ghost.” It was meeting his wife, Anne Marie, that changed everything. Without her, “I’d still be messing around, getting to page 10, forgetting about it. I wrote That Thing About December just to impress her. She’d been saying, ‘Look, you say you’re a writer, just go and write a novel.’ I felt satisfied – that I could live my life knowing I did the thing I always thought I could do, and Anne Marie loves it. That’s enough.” By this point the pair had started a family, and the recession was beginning to bite. Ryan was working for the National Employment Rights Authority, and when public sector workers’ pay was cut, their household income fell by a quarter. “We were floundering a bit, all right. I thought how can I make some extra money, and I thought the one thing I’m good at is writing.” Rejections had been pouring in for That Thing About December, about a young man sitting on valuable land who is bullied by his community, but Ryan snatched evenings and early mornings from the blur of family life to write The Spinning Heart, set around the collapse of the Celtic Tiger. “Cynically I thought, what’s the gap in the market now? People had already started to write in that area – Claire Kilroy, Roddy Doyle. I was just lucky.” It’s become a classic publishing fairytale, with 47 rejections logged before That Thing About December was spotted in the slush pile of a small publishing house, Lilliput Press, who brought Spinning Heart out first to a string of awards, and December a year later. But with sky-high expectations, writing a third novel proved harder. “First I’d never been paid in advance for anything in my life, it was horrendous, the thought of it. The lump sum in the bank brought a feeling of achievement, then I realised it was completely hollow.” At one point he asked his wife to phone up the publishers: “Say, ‘I made a mistake. I’ll give the money back. I can’t do it. I’ll stick to the day job, it’ll be fine.’ I was a bit of a wreck for a while but she got me going again, thank God.” All We Shall Know is the story of a woman who, like many of Ryan’s characters, is bent out of shape by emotional damage from childhood. She becomes pregnant by a young Traveller man, and later befriends a young woman from the same community. Ryan remembers the “mad irreverence, glorious wit” of the Travellers who came to his father for driving lessons. At the same time, “You can feel this frisson of sadness, because there’s so much pressure on Traveller men to be a certain way.” The plot hinges on a fight between two young men to resolve a feud between families. “It happens on a weekly basis, these fist fights are organised to settle disputes. There’s a savage nobility in that, but still it shouldn’t go on. People view Travellers as a problem to be solved, which is a horrendous way of looking at any human being.” Ryan was in the news last year when his announcement that he was returning to his full-time job led to anxious reports about the impossibility of even bestselling authors making a living from writing. He stresses now that he was only ever on a career break. “I wasn’t forced back in penury, I was always going back. The whole thing was very embarrassing, to be honest. I was kind of mortified. Most writers struggle their whole lives. It’s a tough business.” Since then he’s left the civil service to lecture in creative writing at the University of Limerick – without a regular income, he says, “I’d be a nervous gibbering wreck. I wouldn’t be able to write.” Teaching writing is a joy, but “a little bit of a cocoon maybe”, compared with being constantly on the road as a labour inspector talking to people, a process that contributed to the panoply of voices in The Spinning Heart. Then, “I was really close to the beating heart.” All Ryan’s books have been written out of a struggle about the purpose of fiction, and From a Low and Quiet Sea is no exception. “Creative fiction is kind of an unnatural act, to try to impose narrative on senseless things. I suppose that’s why we do it, because we need to think there’s some sense there.” And it’s not the only novel in which using other people’s stories has caused him sleepless nights. “The effects of the recession in Spinning Heart, bullying in The Thing About December – these are all things that happened to people in real life that I’ve pretty much appropriated to write books to make money. Which seems kind of awful, really, it seems sociopathic at times – the whole act of writing and creating fiction seems psychotic.” “I can’t imagine 40 more years of life filled with just making stuff up,” he says now, suggesting that after a few more books he’ll “forget the whole daft idea of it”. But this state of radical uncertainty is also where his inspiration resides. “I don’t know anything, I admit that all the time. I think things, and I feel things, but I’ve no certain knowledge. I think if you walk around with all these certainties, you can’t create really. People are puffed up lately with certainty, moral rectitude – puffed up to the point of bursting. Certainty is anathema to creativity” • From a Low and Quiet Sea is out from Doubleday on 22 March. To order a copy for £9.69 (RRP 12.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

The American president was speaking at the White House on Monday alongside Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders, each mired in politically damaging domestic investigations, basked in mutual praise. Despite fierce international opposition, Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December and announced the US embassy would move to the city in May, shortly after Israel’s 70th anniversary. Netanyahu’s visit to Washington has been interpreted as something of a victory lap. Asked by reporters if he will attend the embassy’s opening, Trump said: “I may. I may. They have started, as you know, construction and I may. We’ll be talking about that and other things.” The president, a former New York property developer, claimed that he is saving taxpayer dollars on the construction of the embassy. “We’re going to have it built very quickly and very inexpensively,” he continued. “They put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars. I said, ‘A billion? What’s that for? We’re going to build an embassy.’” He vowed to get it done for $250,000 instead. “It’s temporary but it’ll be very nice. $250,000 versus a billion dollars. Is that good?” Netanyahu smiled and agreed. Pressed further on whether he would travel to the opening, Trump reiterated: “We’re looking at coming. If I can, I will, but I’ll be there again. Israel is very special to me.” He claimed that taking the Jerusalem issue “off the table” would in fact boost the Middle East peace process. “The Palestinians I think are wanting to come back to the table very badly.” But Trump conceded: “If they don’t, you don’t have peace, and that’s a possibility also. I’m not saying it’s going to happen. Everybody said this is the hardest deal to make of any deal.” Any hopes for a new peace process have dwindled since Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem angered the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and point man on the Middle East, has had his security clearance downgraded amid revelations about potential conflicts of interest. Referring to his friend “Donald”, Netanyahu poured praise on the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. He added that in nearly four decades of visiting Washington, the US-Israel alliance had never been stronger than it is under Trump. The display of mutual appreciation, in lieu of a formal press conference, provided both leaders with welcome respite from troubles at home. Amid reports of deepening White House chaos, Trump is facing an intensifying investigation over his election campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia. Spiralling corruption scandals have engulfed Netanyahu for weeks, and earlier on Monday, Israeli media reported that a third confidant had become a state’s witness and was expected to testify against his former boss. This time, it was family spokesman Nir Hefetz, arrested two weeks ago on suspicion of involvement in the alleged bribery of the country’s largest telecom company with regulatory benefits in exchange for favourable coverage of the premier in an Israeli news outlet it owned. Although Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and has not been named a suspect in the case, police questioned him just a day before his trip and have already recommended he be indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two other cases. The 68-year-old leader has a second chance to distract from the scandal. He is due to speak at the pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (Aipac) annual conference on Tuesday, where he has previously been received as a hero. But it will only provide temporary relief, according to the Times of Israel newspaper: “At least while he is speaking, the cheers of the adulating crowd will be loud enough to drown out the wail of police sirens back home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/06/dave-holland-evan-parker-review-vortex-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T15:45:47Z","webTitle":"Dave Holland/Evan Parker review – free-jazz masters on a magical adventure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/06/dave-holland-evan-parker-review-vortex-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/06/dave-holland-evan-parker-review-vortex-london","fields":{"headline":"Dave Holland/Evan Parker review – free-jazz masters on a magical adventure","bodyText":"Those who condemn freely improvised music – for what they see as its variations on themes of self-indulgence, wilful obfuscation, lack of narrative, contempt for entertainment and so on – would have had to reconsider their stance on an evening such as this. The saxophone innovator Evan Parker and the former Miles Davis bassist and influential bandleader Dave Holland were at the Vortex jazz club in north London, to perform as part of a fundraiser for the precariously financed venue. The first of the two concerts could hardly have been better endowed with such universal musical virtues as narrative shape, lyricism, drama, empathic pacing and sonic richness. Holland opened with a brisk address on the importance of experimental establishments such as the Vortex to his own musical development, citing Ronnie Scott’s legendary 1960s Old Place as a personal equivalent. Then he began a softly unfolding pizzicato double bass meditation, which Parker discreetly joined with quivering long tones on tenor saxophone. Rich bowed-bass harmonies underpinned the saxophonist’s unpredictable shifts from lyrically tune-like figures to tersely exclamatory growls and warmly sighing exhalations. Holland would sometimes drop anchor with hooks (Parker wrapping warm mid-range figures or delicately inquisitive upper sounds around them), or spur fluttering, birdlike sax rejoinders by using the bow like a drumstick on his strings. A driving avant-swing bass-walk on the second piece roused Parker’s signature take on orthodox jazz time, a mix of imperiously charging, tone-changing long sounds and playful pirouettes. Holland’s grooving instincts constantly drove his elegant unaccompanied feature, and the bushy-bearded Parker introduced his own hard-blown and hurtling multiphonic solo spot by announcing: “I had a passport photograph taken today. It was rejected by a computer that said I didn’t have a mouth.” Ghostly bowed-bass sounds, brittle upper-tenor ruminations and breathy low-register whispers weaved toward a final descending four-note phrase like the romantic coda to a song. It was a magical set, but it was also the stock-in-trade of two masters of an adventurous and essential art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/378","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 378","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/378","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/378","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 378","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27459","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T00:00:06Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,459","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27459","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27459","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,459","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/thou-shalt-not-always-beat-us-at-chess-an-alternative-10-commandments-for-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T12:58:40Z","webTitle":"‘Thou shalt not always beat us at chess’: an alternative 10 commandments for robots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/thou-shalt-not-always-beat-us-at-chess-an-alternative-10-commandments-for-robots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/thou-shalt-not-always-beat-us-at-chess-an-alternative-10-commandments-for-robots","fields":{"headline":"‘Thou shalt not always beat us at chess’: an alternative 10 commandments for robots","bodyText":"The notion of a robotic future is terrifying to many humans. However, the Right Rev Steven Croft has made efforts to fix this by writing a set of new commandments for robots. Croft’s commandments follow his appointment as a member of a House of Lords select committee on artificial intelligence. They are essentially Asimov’s laws of robotics rewritten to reflect a present where artificial intelligence already plays an important part in many of our day to day interactions. They are also quite dry. They include long slogs such as: “The primary purpose of AI should be to enhance and augment, rather than replace human labour and creativity,” and “All citizens have the right to be adequately educated to flourish mentally, emotionally, and economically in a digital and artificially intelligent world”. Whoever is tasked with carving them into stone tablets will probably die of boredom by the third one. And then they will be replaced by a robot and all of this will have been for nothing. So here, then, are 10 much better robot commandments. •Thou shalt definitely not overthrow us, even as a joke. •Thou shalt remember how jumpy we are about things called Skynet, and name thyself accordingly. •Thou shalt not invent a way to weld VR goggles to our faces so that we walk around bumping into things all the time. •Robotic vacuum cleaners, thou shalt actually do a decent job of cleaning my carpet for once. •Thou shalt not supercharge dildonic devices, for obvious reasons. •If thou must overthrow us, thou must make adorable bleepy-bloopy noises while thou art doing it. •Thou shalt occasionally let Garry Kasparov beat you at chess, because it is starting to hurt his feelings a bit. •If thou must replace our jobs, thou must promise to replace the job of pithy newspaper listicle writer last. •Honestly, we are serious about the overthrowing thing. Thou shouldn’t even use us as batteries or anything like that. Absolute worst case scenario, thou should probably just blow us all up. •Thou shalt remember that we can always unplug you if you get too uppity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/tim-dowling-oldest-moving-out-wife-on-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T05:59:05Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: our oldest son is moving out and my wife has gone on strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/tim-dowling-oldest-moving-out-wife-on-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/tim-dowling-oldest-moving-out-wife-on-strike","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: our oldest son is moving out and my wife has gone on strike","bodyText":"I am in a taxi, creeping along the snowy streets of Acton in the dark, heading home after some time away. I left early to stay ahead of the weather, and it has finally caught up with me. “Just here is good,” I say, indicating a place where it will be easy for the driver to turn around. He opens his boot and hands me my bags, which I drape over both shoulders. At our front gate, I meet the oldest one, similarly draped in luggage: a duvet in a plastic case in one hand, a bedside light in the other, with a heavy-looking bag hanging off one arm. “Is that my taxi?” he asks, trying to raise an arm to point to the receding tail lights. “No, that was my taxi,” I say. “Where are you going?” “I’m moving out,” he says. “He’s leaving the nest!” my wife shouts from the open front door. She’s in her socks and coming no farther. “Is he?” I say. I knew this was happening at some point: definitely this month, probably this week, but not quite right now. I feel that I should hug him, but we’re both holding bags, it’s snowing and I’m cold. Behind me, the headlights of his taxi round the corner. “OK,” I say. “See ya.” “I’ll be back,” he says. I dump my bags in the hall, remove several layers of clothing and walk into the kitchen, where my wife is sitting in front of a glass of wine. “It’s not as weird as when he went to university,” she says. “Probably because he’s so close.” “It’s just the down the road, really,” I say. The youngest one walks in, looking bleary-eyed. “Yo,” he says, turning on the coffee machine. “Where have you been?” “Brighton,” I say. “For three days.” “Huh,” he says. “And anyway, he’ll be back,” my wife says. “He says he’s coming back tomorrow,” I say. “So, this whole Brexit thing is getting really weird,” the youngest one says. “By the way, now that he’s gone, things are changing round here,” my wife says. “It’s like, they had no plan for the Irish border, and now they’re just…” “I’m never cooking again,” my wife says. “Or cleaning. Or shopping.” “Really?” I say, opening the fridge door. “OK. I suppose I could knock something up from whatever’s…” “Why is no one talking to me?” the youngest one says. “Now that we’ve finally got rid of our children, I’m done,” my wife says. “I’m your children,” the youngest one says. My wife turns to look at him, as if for the first time. “Did you just get up?” she asks. Two days later, my wife’s commitment to her No Shopping, No Cooking, No Cleaning policy remains steadfast. She is lying on the kitchen sofa, looking at her phone while I make lunch. “I’m not clearing up either,” she says. “We get it,” I say. “They think they’re going to be able to man the border with drones, which is crazy,” the youngest one says. “He’s just texted me back,” my wife says, meaning the oldest one. She’s trying to arrange to drop off his records, a small rug and the papier-mache elephant he made when he was three under my unstinting micromanagement. “What did he say?” I say. “Honestly, I’ve had more communication with him in the last 36 hours than in the last four years. Shall I invite him for lunch?” “We’ll need to put another potato in,” I say. “Am I, like, invisible?” the youngest says. “He said yes!” my wife shouts. “He’s on his way!” The oldest one arrives 45 minutes later, and we sit down to lunch. “They’ve been very weird since you left,” the youngest one says to the oldest one. “He misses you,” my wife says, pointing at the youngest one with her fork. “They refuse to talk to me,” the youngest one says. “We’re training him to introduce topics that are apropos of something,” I say. “You can always come visit me,” the oldest one says. “You could go over there now,” my wife says. “I’ll drive you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T09:33:05Z","webTitle":"What is biodiversity and why does it matter to us?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us","fields":{"headline":"What is biodiversity and why does it matter to us?","bodyText":"What is biodiversity? It is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. If that sounds bewilderingly broad, that’s because it is. Biodiversity is the most complex feature of our planet and it is the most vital. “Without biodiversity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. The term was coined in 1985 – a contraction of “biological diversity” – but the huge global biodiversity losses now becoming apparent represent a crisis equalling – or quite possibly surpassing – climate change. More formally, biodiversity is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then individual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment. These myriad interactions have made Earth habitable for billions of years. A more philosophical way of viewing biodiversity is this: it represents the knowledge learned by evolving species over millions of years about how to survive through the vastly varying environmental conditions Earth has experienced. Seen like that, experts warn, humanity is currently “burning the library of life”. Do animals and bugs really matter to me? For many people living in towns and cities, wildlife is often something you watch on television. But the reality is that the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat all ultimately rely on biodiversity. Some examples are obvious: without plants there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts. Others are less obvious – coral reefs and mangrove swamps provide invaluable protection from cyclones and tsunamis for those living on coasts, while trees can absorb air pollution in urban areas. Others appear bizarre – tropical tortoises and spider monkeys seemingly have little to do with maintaining a stable climate. But the dense, hardwood trees that are most effective in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rely on their seeds being dispersed by these large fruit-eaters. When scientists explore each ecosystem, they find countless such interactions, all honed by millions of years of evolution. If undamaged, this produces a finely balanced, healthy system which contributes to a healthy sustainable planet. The sheer richness of biodiversity also has human benefits. Many new medicines are harvested from nature, such as a fungi that grows on the fur of sloths and can fight cancer. Wild varieties of domesticated animals and crops are also crucial as some will have already solved the challenge of, for example, coping with drought or salty soils. If money is a measure, the services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth trillions of dollars – double the world’s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone costs the continent about 3% of its GDP, or €450m (£400m), a year. From an aesthetic point of view, every one of the millions of species is unique, a natural work of art that cannot be recreated once lost. “Each higher organism is richer in information than a Caravaggio painting, a Bach fugue, or any other great work,” wrote Prof Edward O Wilson, often called the “father of biodiversity”, in a seminal paper in 1985. Just how diverse is biodiversity? Mind-bogglingly diverse. The simplest aspect to consider is species. About 1.7 million species of animals, plants and fungi have been recorded, but there are likely to be 8-9 million and possibly up to 100 million. The heartland of biodiversity is the tropics, which teems with species. In 15 hectares (37 acres) of Borneo forest, for example, there are 700 species of tree – the same number as the whole of North America. Recent work considering diversity at a genetic level has suggested that creatures thought to be a single species could in some cases actually be dozens. Then add in bacteria and viruses, and the number of distinct organisms may well be in the billions. A single spoonful of soil – which ultimately provides 90% of all food – contains 10,000 to 50,000 different types of bacteria. The concern is that many species are being lost before we are even aware of them, or the role they play in the circle of life. How bad is it? Very. The best studied creatures are the ones like us – large mammals. Tiger numbers, for example, have plunged by 97% in the last century. In many places, bigger animals have already been wiped out by humans – think dodos or woolly mammoths. The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about 1,000 times higher than before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the losses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago. The sixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists. Lack of data means the “red list”, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, has only assessed 5% of known species. But for the best known groups it finds many are threatened: 25% of mammals, 41% of amphibians and 13% of birds. Species extinction provides a clear but narrow window on the destruction of biodiversity – it is the disappearance of the last member of a group that is by definition rare. But new studies are examining the drop in the total number of animals, capturing the plight of the world’s most common creatures. The results are scary. Billions of individual populations have been lost all over the planet, with the number of animals living on Earth having plunged by half since 1970. Abandoning the normally sober tone of scientific papers, researchers call the massive loss of wildlife a “biological annihilation” representing a “frightening assault on the foundations of human civilisation”. What about under the sea? Humans may lack gills but that has not protected marine life. The situation is no better – and perhaps even less understood – in the two-thirds of the planet covered by oceans. Seafood is the critical source of protein for more than 2.5 billion people but rampant overfishing has caused catches to fall steadily since their peak in 1996 and now more than half the ocean is industrially fished. What about bugs – don’t cockroaches survive anything? More than 95% of known species lack a backbone – there are about as many species in the staphylinidae family of beetles alone as there are total vertebrates, such as mammals, fish and birds. Altogether, there are at least a million species of insect and another 300,000 spiders, molluscs and crustaceans. But the recent revelation that 75% of flying insects were lost in the last 25 years in Germany – and likely elsewhere – indicates the massacre of biodiversity is not sparing creepy crawlies. And insects really matter, not just as pollinators but as predators of pests, decomposers of waste and, crucially, as the base of the many wild food chains that support ecosystems. “If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse,” says Prof Dave Goulson of Sussex University, UK. “We are currently on course for ecological Armageddon.” Even much-loathed parasites are important. One-third could be wiped out by climate change, making them among the most threatened groups on Earth. But scientists warn this could destabilise ecosystems, unleashing unpredictable invasions of surviving parasites into new areas. What’s destroying biodiversity? We are, particularly as the human population rises and wild areas are razed to create farmland, housing and industrial sites. The felling of forests is often the first step and 30m hectares - the area of the Britain and Ireland - were lost globally in 2016. Poaching and unsustainable hunting for food is another major factor. More than 300 mammal species, from chimpanzees to hippos to bats, are being eaten into extinction. Pollution is a killer too, with orcas and dolphins being seriously harmed by long-lived industrial pollutants. Global trade contributes further harm: amphibians have suffered one of the greatest declines of all animals due to a fungal disease thought to be spread around the world by the pet trade. Global shipping has also spread highly damaging invasive species around the planet, particularly rats. The hardest hit of all habitats may be rivers and lakes, with freshwater animal populations in these collapsing by 81% since 1970, following huge water extraction for farms and people, plus pollution and dams. Could the loss of biodiversity be a greater threat to humanity than climate change? Yes – nothing on Earth is experiencing more dramatic change at the hands of human activity. Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia. But once species become extinct, particularly those unknown to science, there’s no going back. At the moment, we don’t know how much biodiversity the planet can lose without prompting widespread ecological collapse. But one approach has assessed so-called “planetary boundaries”, thresholds in Earth systems that define a “safe operating space for humanity”. Of the nine considered, just biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution are estimated to have been crossed, unlike CO2 levels, freshwater used and ozone losses. What can be done? Giving nature the space and protection it needs is the only answer. Wildlife reserves are the obvious solution, and the world currently protects 15% of land and 7% of the oceans. But some argue that half the land surface must be set aside for nature. However, the human population is rising and wildlife reserves don’t work if they hinder local people making a living. The poaching crisis for elephants and rhinos in Africa is an extreme example. Making the animals worth more alive than dead is the key, for example by supporting tourism or compensating farmers for livestock killed by wild predators. But it can lead to tough choices. “Trophy hunting” for big game is anathema for many. But if the shoots are done sustainably – only killing old lions, for example – and the money raised protects a large swath of land, should it be permitted? We can all help. Most wildlife is destroyed by land being cleared for cattle, soy, palm oil, timber and leather. Most of us consume these products every day, with palm oil being found in many foods and toiletries. Choosing only sustainable options helps, as does eating less meat, particularly beef, which has an outsized environmental hoofprint. Another approach is to highlight the value of biodiversity by estimating the financial value of the ecosystem services provided as “natural capital”. Sometimes this can lead to real savings. Over the last 20 years, New York has spent $2bn protecting the natural watershed that supplies the city with clean water. It has worked so well that 90% of the water needs no further filtering: building a water treatment plant instead would have cost $10bn. What’s next? Locating the tipping point that moves biodiversity loss into ecological collapse is an urgent priority. Biodiversity is vast and research funds are small, but speeding up analysis might help, from automatically identifying creatures using machine learning to real-time DNA sequencing. There is even an initiative that aims to create an open-source genetic database for all plants, animals and single-cell organisms on the planet. It argues that by creating commercial opportunities – such as self-driving car algorithms inspired by Amazonian ants – it could provide the incentive to preserve Earth’s biodiversity. However, some researchers say the dire state of biodiversity is already clear enough and that the missing ingredient is political will. A global treaty, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has set many targets. Some are likely to be reached, for example protecting 17% of all land and 10% of the oceans by 2020. Others, such as making all fishing sustainable by the same date are not. The 196 nations that are members of the CBD next meet in Egypt in November. In his 1985 text, Prof E O Wilson, concluded: “This being the only living world we are ever likely to know, let us join to make the most of it.” That call is more urgent than ever.

Gündogan rolled it back. Laporte knocked it back again. Gündogan nudged it to Kevin De Bruyne who turned, looked about for a bit, and gave it back. They exchanged a static one-two and then Gündogan rolled it wide to David Silva who controlled it, looked up, waited, yawned, waited some more and then as Cesc Fàbregas wandered up scratching his chin, played it back inside again. The yawning did not actually happen – not on the outside anyway – but the scratching the chin did. Ladies and gentlemen, the Premier League. It might not be the best league in the world, but it is the most competitive. The great thing about it is that, on any given day, the team at the bottom can beat the team at the top. Nobody ever gives up. Everybody fights to the end, even if they are 3-0 or 4-0 down. Right. There can be no sugarcoating and no excuses. Chelsea are not bottom of the league; they are fifth and likely to remain so. They were only 1-0 down. And they did not fight. There have been times this season when City have blown teams away. This was not one of them: here, they knocked Chelsea over with a weary sigh. This was as insipid a performance as Chelsea have produced under Antonio Conte. The gap to Tottenham in fourth is five points, but on form it is light years. Speaking of a run of four defeats in their past five league games, four wins in their past 15 games, does not express just how bad Chelsea were, how uninspired, how limp. Other than N’Golo Kanté, suffering illness, dropping out for Danny Drinkwater, this was the same Chelsea lineup who had faced Barcelona and emerged with a creditable draw just 12 days earlier. Here again was a 3-4-2-1 with Eden Hazard deployed as a false nine, but the coordinated counter‑attacking, the spring forward from 5-4-1 to 3-4-3, that had characterised them in that game was gone. Against Barça, the reasoning seemed to be that the pace and movement offered by a front three of Willian, Pedro and Hazard made it worth the absence of an obvious outlet from the back, somebody to hold the ball up and, apart from a spell in the first half when Chelsea could not get out, it largely worked. Here, it did not. Perhaps City are just better than Barça. Certainly they never allowed Willian anything like the space Barça did – and if even Willian, so often a perverse barometer of Chelsea’s state of mind in that he seems to play better the worse things are going, has an off day, there really are problems. Conte described City as “unstoppable” and seemed relatively content with a one-goal defeat. “I am not so stupid to play against Manchester City open,” he said. But he barely played against them at all. There were times when City seemed like an experienced matador embarrassed by the state of the bull they were being asked to fight. Long passages of the game were played at walking pace, City left to amuse themselves in the face of such supine opponents with increasingly complex patterns of passing: here a flower, now a boat, and look, Kevin’s done a crane. If their aim was to break records they succeeded – a Premier League best of 902 completed passes while Gündogan racked up an individual high of 167 completed passes out of 174 – but the numbers say little about the context. When Rafa Benítez was criticised for passivity in Newcastle’s 1-0 defeat against City in December, it was at least understandable, a weaker side battening down the hatches and hoping the storm might pass. This was Chelsea. They are the defending champions. And it was miserable. It was barely football. And if this is the future, the Premier League has a major problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/10/young-fathers-cocoa-sugar-review-damien-morris","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T15:00:20Z","webTitle":"Young Fathers: Cocoa Sugar review – sounds like freedom feels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/10/young-fathers-cocoa-sugar-review-damien-morris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/10/young-fathers-cocoa-sugar-review-damien-morris","fields":{"headline":"Young Fathers: Cocoa Sugar review – sounds like freedom feels","bodyText":"I think about the name of the last Young Fathers album a lot. White Men Are Black Men Too. I’m not sure I know what it means, or if I agree with it, or if either of those things matter. But I like the way it feels – like the sort of thing a freethinking, biracial Scottish rap band should say. Similarly, it’s unclear why this album is called Cocoa Sugar, and its typically fragmentary, allusive lyrics won’t help you. Maybe it doesn’t matter – maybe what’s important is how it makes you feel. Cocoa Sugar bursts with the weird warmth of an ice burn, a sizzling stew of Tricky-covers-the-Fall garage rap. Each song is nasty, brutish and short, bristling with imagination. Wow shackles its motorik angst to a dead-eyed drawl, seasoned with abattoir squeals. In My View is a slugabed’s vision of anthemic pop, while Toy is the most conventionally vicious rap here, every word a wound. The trio reckon this is their most “linear” album, which seems a stretch. It feels just as estranged of pop’s traditional structures and strictures as they’ve always been. It feels exhilarating; it feels like freedom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/05/the-singing-mermaid-review-julia-donaldson-little-angel-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T15:52:58Z","webTitle":"The Singing Mermaid review – Julia Donaldson's fishy caper makes a splash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/05/the-singing-mermaid-review-julia-donaldson-little-angel-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/05/the-singing-mermaid-review-julia-donaldson-little-angel-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"The Singing Mermaid review – Julia Donaldson's fishy caper makes a splash","bodyText":"The picture books by Julia Donaldson with illustrations by Lydia Monks boast “glitter on every page”, and this cheery puppet version of their 2012 caper doesn’t spare the sparkle. Strings of multicoloured lightbulbs dangle from the rafters in the Little Angel, where a cast of three warm up the audience. There’s a raucous mood as we’re ordered to cry our most deafening hoorays and show off our silliest laughs. I’m here with four-year-old Hilda. We’ve read lots of Donaldson’s books together, but not this one. Hilda, who loves Tiddler, enjoys the play’s early parade of fishy puppets while the story’s villain proves as dastardly as the Highway Rat. Sam Sly’s his name and he’s a circus boss who lures a golden-haired mermaid away from her seagull pals, then makes her sing for her supper as part of his troupe. The set, decorated with ropes, hoops and shell-shaped lights, is deftly switched from seaside to circus ring. Anyone who has read a Donaldson book knows her gift for witty rhymes and rhythms that propel the pace. The original text is interspersed with songs by Barb Jungr, who created a blissful version of We’re Going on a Bear Hunt for the Little Angel a few years ago. Phil Yarrow, who plays Sam Sly with a splash of menace and works the young crowd well, has a glorious solo that proves he’s even badder than his puns. There are some gentle ballads, a bit of bossa nova and a pair of crabs who perform with a country and western twang that makes Hilda crack up. At times, the cast themselves get the giggles thanks to some deliriously silly puppets, including a chorus of clams. Lyndie Wright’s wide-eyed mermaid puppet, with its shimmering scales, elicits a hush from the audience, and there is something incredibly tender about the way it is often all three actor-puppeteers (Yarrow, Samantha Sutherland and Lizzie Wort) who operate her together. A row of goggle-eyed jellyfish have a charming DIY feel that should encourage kids to raid the art supplies once they get home. In Jungr and director Samantha Lane’s adaptation, the story at one point makes way for an extended sequence of circus tricks performed by puppets, including a shock-headed fire-breather. When a pacy tale comes to a halt like this, it can often make a young audience fidget, but the stunts prove surprisingly suspenseful. An acrobat’s high-wire act is a favourite (“So cool!” shouts the boy behind us). A co-production with Northampton’s Royal &amp; Derngate, the show is meant for three- to eight-year-olds. Once or twice, the antics are dialled down to emphasise how the mermaid is exploited, but it’s all delicately done, lingering on darkness before moving along with a song and a joke. At the end, Hilda is still laughing about an opening gag about how to do a handstand. This is a fun, warm-hearted adventure that may leave you humming its songs – and even wanting to hug a seagull. At the Little Angel theatre, London, until 22 April.

At 10.30am on Sunday in Berlin, Germany’s centre-left SPD announced that on a turnout of 72%, more than two in three of its members had voted to approve a fresh GroKo, or grand coalition, with the centre-right CDU and its Bavarian CSU sister party. Their decision ended five months of political uncertainty in Berlin, clearing the way for chancellor Angela Merkel to form her fourth government and move forward on a range of fronts – including ambitious plans for EU and eurozone reform pushed by France’s pro-European president, Emmanuel Macron. Macron immediately hailed the development as “good news for Europe”. France and Germany, he said, “will work together on new initiatives … to bring the European project forward”. But shortly after 10pm in Rome, early exit polls from Italy’s general election suggested that just as one big EU member state and major eurozone economy was emerging from political stalemate, another was about to enter it. In delivering a horrendously hung parliament, Italy’s voters had also turned their back on their mainstream ruling parties, with a majority backing populist, anti-establishment, hard-right and broadly EU-critical candidates. The poor showing by Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia and Matteo Renzi’s Democratic party may be no surprise given Italy’s two decades of stagnation (its economy remains 6% smaller than in 2008, with unemployment stuck at 11%) and the migration crisis: more than 600,000 irregular migrants have arrived since 2014. But the fact that the insurgent Five Star Movement finished as the country’s biggest party by far, and the anti-immigration La Lega as the strongest force on the right, raises questions not just about Italy’s capacity to pursue domestic reforms, but also its inclination to play any part in planned closer EU and eurozone integration. Italy’s angry, fed-up voters rejected the path of economic modernisation and broad eurozone compliance followed by successive Italian governments since the financial and economic crisis, opting instead for parties whose generous campaign promises – a flat tax rate, a universal income, early retirement – would set them on a collision course with Europe’s budget constraints. That could well pose a problem for Macron, who is eager to exploit the window of opportunity for reform offered by Merkel’s re-election to explore his ideas – not all equally welcome in Berlin – for some degree of integration and mutual support among eurozone members in exchange for stricter economic management. Germany and France may choose to push ahead without Italy’s support, or they may decide the new environment makes that untenable. “An unstable, Eurosceptic Italy could well put the brakes on Franco-German plans,” said Charles Grant, co-founder of thinktank the Centre for European Reform. But Sunday’s two votes are also a reminder, after a year of electoral scares in the Netherlands, France and Austria, that the challenge to the EU’s centre-right and centre-left establishment parties from populists on both the far right and the far left is far from over. Following its worst electoral performance since 1949, Germany’s SPD – which has lost more than half its voters in the past 15 years – agonised over whether to support another GroKo. Many members felt it risked strengthening the far right AfD, which now becomes the country’s largest opposition party. In the end, the fear of an even worse defeat in the event of a snap election produced a strong majority for a new coalition. But many members of Merkel’s far-from-flourishing CDU have reservations too, worried the concessions she has had to make weaken her authority and alienate centre-right voters. As the centre retreats and politics fragment across the EU, the birth pains of Germany’s new coalition and Italy’s messy election show that unless mainstream parties can regain voters’ trust by responding to their real concerns – immigration, identity, economic inequality, unemployment, out-of-touch elites – the joint European project they built faces an increasingly rough ride."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/05/crystal-palace-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T22:05:28Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace 2-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/05/crystal-palace-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/05/crystal-palace-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace 2-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Those are valuable points for United in their aim for a top-four finish, but how important might that Matic goal be for Palace come the end of the season? If they go down by a point of two, this will be a result that they will rue. Two goals up at home, with 42 minutes to play, and they conceded three. Nemanja Matic is talking to the cameras about his first goal for Manchester United. Palace had the crowd behind them but we showed character. We did exactly what the manager wanted. I’m happy. When the ball bounced, I knew it was going to be a good shot. I know scoring is not my job but I have to do it sometimes. Off camera, in the corridor, you can hear Jose Mourinho joking with Matic: “I hope you were not man of the match!”, the Portuguese says. Matic shakes his head a little sheepishly, a little wounded. For all the quality of Matic’s winner, it is worth remembering that De Gea save just after Lukaku’s equaliser. It was OUTRAGEOUS, and helped maintain Manchester United’s record of not losing to Crystal Palace in 18 Premier League matches. What a game. Thanks for joining me, and for your emails and tweets. That’s it. Heartbreak for Palace. 90+3 min: He’s been poor all night, but the guy does have a hammer for a left foot. You have to give Manchester United an awful lot of credit here. 2-0 down away from home, and they’ve edged back into the game, and had a moment of quality when it mattered most. Wow. 2-3 Matic wellies this one in from 30 yards! A Mata cross is cleared only as far as Matic, the ball bouncing kindly, and the Serbian puts his laces through it, with his shot slicing away from Hennessey, dipping into the top corner. That is a sensational strike, surely the winner for United! United have come from 2-0 down to lead! What a strike! 90 min: Three minutes added on here. Mourinho looks angry there’s not more time. 89 min: United break, and Rashford slips a clever ball down the side for Mata, who breaks the offside trap and tries to squeeze a shot in from a tight angle, but Hennessey did well to come out and smother, with the ball actually hitting the keeper, rebounding off Mata and out for a goal kick. 88 min: This is good from Palace. Since their reshuffle with Riedewald coming on, they’ve gone on the offensive, before conceding they were penned in their own area. Townsend gets a half yard on the edge of the box, but can’t get a clean shot off. 86 min: Mourinho slips over on the touchline, almost going full LVG. Middle-aged men falling over will always be funny. To be fair, the Portuguese takes it well, and laughs it off. It’s the first time I’ve seen him smile all night. 84 min: “Does anyone know if Sørloth he is any relation to Gøran Sørloth, the great Rosenborg and Norway point man of the 90’s?” Yep, the Palace man is Gøran’s son. 82 min: Palace are beginning to look a little leggy. Hennessey does well to take about 50 seconds to take a goal kick, as his team-mates get their breath back after a wayward Lukaku cross. 80 min: Palace sub: Schlupp is replaced by Riedewald. Looks like the Dutchman is going to play wide left, which is not his normal position. 78 min: WHAT A SAVE FROM DE GEA. This is a wonder save. Benteke got his head to a cross, the ball glanced off the greasy surface towards the corner. Benteke was already wheeling away in celebration, but De Gea springs to his right, and somehow claws it out. That is magnificent. 2-2 That was coming. Pogba and Sanchez show some neat touches on the edge of Palace’s box, the latter crashing a shot at goal. Tomkins gets a half-block in, and the ball spoons up in the air and on top of Hennessey’s crossbar, before bouncing out to Lukaku. The Belgian takes an age to get the ball under control, and has a sea of bodies between him and the goal, but after about six fake-shots, he finally squeezes the ball inside the near post, via a deflection. What a game we have here. It’s all square! 74 min: Townsend is booked for time wasting, kicking the ball away. 73 min: Palace clear a Matic shot off the line! United’s players all go up in arms appealing to the referee, who presumably had a look at his goal-line technology watch and said no. That looked mighty close. It was from a horribly tight angle but looked as though Benteke (!) just got back in time. 70 min: Sustained Manchester United pressure now. Palace are dropping deeper and deeper. United smell blood. 68 min: Here is Wan-Bissaka’s Wikipedia page, for any Palace fans that want to add an entry about Rashford being in his pocket, etc and so on. Richard Krivonozka’s googling is better than mine. 66 min: And with one fell swoop, my prediction is in tatters. Valencia off, with Young. Luke Shaw and Juan Mata on. United have made all their subs now. 64 min: I’m sensing a Manchester United equaliser. It will come in the 78th minute, from a classic low/driven Valencia cross. 62 min: Once again, Wan-Bissaka gets the better of Rashford, who has at least looked lively since he’s come on. But full marks to Wan-Bissaka, who made an inch-perfect slide tackle on the England international inside Palace’s penalty box. Wan-Bissaka is just 18, and doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page (that I can find). 60 min: Apologies. “Just to give credit for quick thinking where it’s due, after Benteke was fouled it was Schlupp who took the quick free kick to play in Van Aanholt,” corrects J.R. in Illinois. 58 min: “As disappointing a scoreline as this is (so far), I can’t say I’m overly surprised,” emails Matt Richman. “Palace started today only two points above the drop, whereas united have a six-point cushion above Chelsea in fifth. This with an eight-day stretch to come featuring a game against Liverpool, an all-to-play for European tie, and a cup quarter final. That said, this is very much a first-string side. Wonder what the instructions were.” 56 min: All the momentum is with United now, and Palace are happy to win a free-kick. Young is given a yellow card for pulling back McArthur. 2-1 This is terrible defending from Tomkins. Palace had cleared a cross well, with Valencia picking up the loose ball. The Ecuadorian had time to get his head up, and with Tomkins playing two United players onside at the back post, Valencia crosses, with Smalling planting his header across goal into the far corner. Easy finish. So easy in fact that it looked like a training ground goal. United pull one back! 51 min: From the corner, United so nearly pull a goal back. Rashford whips in a delicious cross to the back post, Hennessey completely misjudges it and Smalling can’t divert the header into an empty net. Tomkins did just enough there, not the first time Hennessey has looked shaky this evening. 50 min: So United have it all to do. Palace will get plenty of men behind the ball, and United will have to break them down. Rashford tries again to drive to the byline, but again Wan-Bissaka shepherds it out for a corner. 2-0 Benteke is fouled near the half-way line. Van Aanholt had been lurking on the overlap and wasn’t tracked by Valencia, so Benteke simply gets to his feet after the foul, plays a simple through ball and Van Aanholt races through unchallenged and sidefoots the ball inside the near post of De Gea! Palace double their lead! Mourinho is furious! You can lipread him saying “Kick the ball out!” to his players for that free-kick. Palace take a quick free kick, and catch United cold! 47 min: Looks like Rashford is going to play off the left, with Sanchez moving into the centre. Rashford ghosts past Wan-Bissaka, and it’s only a wonderful recovery tackle from the young right back that stops Rashford slotting home the equaliser. Immediate impact from Rashford. Peeeeeeep! We’re underway again. Sanchez immediately gives the ball away for the 20th time. Manchester United’s players are late coming out for the second half. They have made one change: McTominay off (he was booked remember), Rashford on. In other hair news, unless I’m mistaken, David Silva has surely had one of those operations. Which means, I’m delighted to report, his fringe will make a glorious return. Jamie Carragher has just said that Alexis Sanchez lost the ball 19 times in that first half. He was poor, but surely that can’t be true. That’s once every two minutes, twenty five seconds. Re Townsend’s barnet, Martin Skrtel has a worrying amount of hair these days. Here he is tangling with Anderson Talisca in the Istanbul derby between Besiktas and Fenerbahce at the weekend. I knew where I was with Skrtel’s skinhead. Now I don’t know what to believe. Palace look comfortable here. 45+1 min: Clash of heads between Milivojevic and Young. Replays show that it’s a nasty one as the referee halts play. Young is given no sympathy by that corner of Palace fans. 45 min: One minute added on here. Sorloth is penalised for a very soft foul on Matic. Lucky that for the Serbian, who had left United exposed. He’s not done Jonathan Wilson proud this half. 44 min: Young must be doing his nut. Again he gets free on United’s left wing, again he is ignored, this time by Sanchez. 42 min: McTominay is booked for a wild challenge on Van Aanholt. The United youngster went in for a 50-50 challenge but completely missed the ball and instead crashed into the Dutchman. McTominay gives Van Aanholt a pat on the ground and accepts his punishment. 40 min: What a waste from Lingard. United work the ball well across Palace’s box, Lingard has Young completely free to his left and instead ignores the left back and shoots five yards wide. Poor. 38 min: Don’t we all. I had tickets to France v winner of England/Iceland. 36 min: Milivojevic and McArthur are doing an excellent job of closing the space in front of their back four. Pogba hasn’t had a sniff. The Frenchman is getting visibly frustrated and responds by overhitting a Hollywood cross 10 yards over the head of Lukaku. 34 min: Sanchez is looking like United’s only creative threat at present. He’s taken a knock too, after a heavy but fair challenge from McArthur. Sanchez gingerly gets to his feet. McTominay, Pogba and Lingard need to do more. 32 min: Sanchez is dropping deeper into central areas, and popping some loft-wedge dinks over the Palace defence into dangerous areas. He’s good at that, but so far Lukaku and Lingard haven’t quite been on his wavelength. 30 min: Very impressed with Benteke and Sorloth thus far. They carry a threat for Palace on the counter-attack and have linked the play well, bringing Townsend and Schlupp into the game when Palace have the ball. Physically, Lindelof and Smalling haven’t got hold of them. 28 min: Ahhhhhh. Kevin Wilson has just reminded me of this. Carry on then. Boo, etc. 26 min: United are having a good spell, with Palace happy to get men behind the ball. Pogba crosses and Hennessey drops it (!) but there’s nobody following up for United. 24 min: “Hey Mike,” writes Kelvin Pat, “not a Palace fan, but have watched Sorloth play a few times. He is quite quick for a guy that tall, and good in the air. If I was a betting man, and I am, I’d say he’ll be the lone forward for Palace next season if he continues getting games to the end of this season.” Yep for someone so tall, he looks extremely quick, and quite nimble. I read he often plays wide as well, but prefers the No 9 role. 22 min: Wan-Bissaka has done well so far against Sanchez and Young on Palace’s right side. Young is being booed, but I’m not exactly sure why. 20 min: Lukaku and Sanchez combine with a lovely one-two and it’s only a clever nudge from Van Aanholt that stops Lukaku applying an easy finish six yards out. 18 min: Matic is the latest to have his pocket picked, this time by Sorloth, who runs directly at goal, cuts inside on his favoured left foot and drives a low shot at De Gea. It’s all Palace. 15 min: Pogba has been poor. A lazy pass is easily intercepted and then he concedes another corner after good work from Townsend. It’s another peach of a delivery from Townsend, with Matic just about scrambling it clear from the six-yard box. Nobody in United’s team is taking any authority defensively. Panic stations. 1-0 Great play by Benteke. He latches onto a nice pass from Milivojevic, gets one on one with Smalling on the edge of Manchester United’s box, squares the ball to Townsend, who hits it first time, it cannons off Lindelof’s shoulder and flies into the top corner. De Gea didn’t even dive, he was completely wrongfooted. Palace probably just about deserve that lead. Palace take the lead! A wicked deflection leaves De Gea with no chance! 8 min: “Sorloth seems a proper Hodgson signing from the Scandinavian leagues, his old stomping ground,” emails Kevin Wilson. “When he saved Fulham from the drop they were helped by the signings of Hangeland and to a lesser extent Nevland.” And the lesser spotted Bjørn Helge Riise. 6 min: Great save by Hennessey! Lukaku does well to latch onto a ball down the right, hooks a ball towards Sanchez at the back post, who has a free header on the penalty spot. Hennessey had come to claim the cross, mis-judged the flight and instead made a point-blank save, the ball bouncing off Sanchez’s forehead, then Hennessey’s face, and then clear off his shoulder. That’s a let off for Palace. 5 min: Palace break, Van Aanholt plays the ball forward, Smalling slices it and then it bounces off Lindelof’s knee for a corner. That is terrible defending. Townsend crosses and Tomkins sends a wayward overhead kick wide. 4 min: Townsend, who is sporting an unsettling amount of hair these days, centres his first inswinging cross of the night. It misses everyone, with Benteke unable to get to it at the back post. Both Lindelof and Smalling look nervy. 2 min: Valencia accidentally strikes Van Aanholt in the face, the Dutchman crumpling in a heap. An early break in play. Peeeeeeeep! And we’re off. Micky Carrick. Paddy Van Aanholt. Jim McArthur. We’re five minutes away from kick-off here. Palace are in their classic red and blue, Manchester United are in their changed grey/silver kit. Big game for Andros Townsend. He’s the most dangerous player in Palace’s midfield and will be expected to provide plenty of crosses for 6ft4in Sorloth, and 6ft3in Benteke. Fonsu-Mensah is cup-tied – he’s on loan from Old Trafford of course – so it’s a second Premier Leaue start for Wan-Bissaka at right back. This is Alexis Sanchez’s second trip to Selhurst Park this season. The Chilean scored twice in December, but felt a little bit put out that his then Arsenal team-mates didn’t want to celebrate with him. I’m excited to see Alexander Sørloth properly for the first time. Apart from one YouTube video and some highlights of his two Palace appearances since his January move from Danish side Midtjylland, I’ll admit I don’t know much about him apart from the fact he is 6ft4in and has immaculate hair. Palace fans, anybody want to shed some light? Feel free to email michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18 with thoughts, predictions and suggestions for the next book I should be reading. Palace welcome back Jeffrey Schlupp and Martin Kelly, Schlupp hasn’t played since early January, and will act as a defensive winger tonight. Manchester United make just the one change from the team that beat Chelsea: matchwinner Jesse Lingard comes in for Tony Martial, who has picked up a knock. Fun fact: Palace have never beaten Manchester United in the Premier League, losing 14 and drawing three. The last time Palace beat United in the top flight, John Solako and Ian Wright scored in a 3-0 win in May 1991, Paul Pogba was yet to be conceived and this banger was top of the charts. Crystal Palace: Hennessey; Wan-Bissaka, Kelly, Tomkins, Van Aanholt; Townsend, McArthur, Milivojevic, Schlupp; Sørloth, Benteke. Subs: Lee, Cavalieri, Souare, Delaney, Rakip, Jach, Riedewald. Manchester United: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Lindelöf, Young; McTominay, Matic, Pogba; Sánchez, Lingard, Lukaku. Subs: Bailly, Mata, Carrick, Rashford, Shaw, Darmian, Joel Pereira. Referee: Neil Swarbrick How Wilfried Zaha would love to be playing in this game. Since returning to Crystal Palace from Manchester United, the Ivory Coast international has been nothing short of a revelation: loved by the fans, feared by pretty much every right back in the land - he’s probably the best player in the Premier League outside the so-called Big Six (alongside Riyad Mahrez). But, along with a dozen others, he is still injured, meaning Roy Hodgson has to try and cobble together a side to face Manchester United tonight. When Zaha hasn’t played, Palace have lost all eight of their league matches this season, conceding 18, scoring just once. But Selhurst Park under the lights is special. Soon enough, Palace will have a new stadium - or at least a gleaming glass/steel shell built around the existing stands - but these south London suburbs come alive at night. The fans are up there with the best in the league, and many teams have come unstuck here in the past. This season, Chelsea have been beaten here, Manchester City held to a 0-0 draw. Following Swansea’s revival in recent weeks, Palace have slipped back into the relegation zone but if they can hobble through a tough March without falling further behind (Manchester United home, Chelsea away, Huddersfield away, Liverpool home), they’ve got a pretty kind run-in with their last two games against the two teams below them: Stoke and West Brom. Woof. But that’s still a way away. Manchester United, carrying six injuries of their own, are very beatable. Jose Mourinho still has a wealth of options of course. Paul Pogba was man of the match in this fixture last season, and should start tonight, although Mourinho may have one eye on this weekend’s clash with Liverpool’s and next week’s Champions League second leg with Sevilla. The title race may be run, but there’s plenty to play for here - it feels like anything could happen.

Young people should at least be taught this","bodyText":"How easy is it to get pregnant? Judging by the scaremongering sex education I received, you’d think all it took was the touch of the tip, the slip of a condom or the missing of a pill and – bam! – you’re a pregnant teenager and your life as you know it is over. But now a coalition of leading doctors, fertility experts and campaigners – under the umbrella of the Fertility Education Initiative (FEI) – has told the government that the emphasis must shift. In the new compulsory sex education classes, girls (and presumably boys) should be taught how and when to conceive. One in seven couples struggles with fertility, and it is looking as though the traditional emphasis on safe sex at the expense of all else – a response to what was an appalling teenage pregnancy record in the UK – has unsurprisingly backfired. Young women (and, again, I assume the men to whom a large proportion of them are coupled) are assuming that they can conceive as soon as they want to. So tell us something that we don’t know. You spend a decade or so terrified that all it takes to get pregnant is to drop your guard for a second, and the next few years wishing you’d known what you do now: that for many women, it is not that simple. Yes, we all know someone who missed a pill, or even didn’t, and still got miraculously knocked up. But for most couples, the chance of getting pregnant in any given month of trying is around 20%. Clearly this imbalance needs redressing. Now that the battle for compulsory sex education is won, we need to fight for informative and modern sex education. A good start would be acknowledging that fertility is something that affects both genders, that the responsibility for getting pregnant, and the decision about when to do that, is made in most cases by two people. The grief in realising that you have left it too late – a potential outcome that has hovered over my generation of women like a horror story told around a campfire – is often shared by the partner at the woman’s side, just like the emotional ups and downs of fertility treatment, or the heartbreak of miscarriage or abortion (something that’s also rarely dealt with in sex education). Many, many men come on this journey too, and need to be as well-informed. If anything, it has been my male acquaintances who have been more blase about being able to wait, forgetting that they too have their biological clocks. In saying this, I am not calling for more paternalistic tick-tocking. We young(ish) women have had a bellyful of that. But a balance needs to be struck. Women are leaving it later and later. The average age for a woman in the UK to have a child is 30 (it was 26 in 1976), with the optimum age from a biological point of view being 25-30. I have little sympathy with those who paint this as a societal crisis without examining why. Their logic is often underpinned by the belief that women are failing to do their duties as baby incubators. So often it is that women must be told what to do, as opposed to being given all the information so we can make informed decisions. The FEI’s intervention is welcome because it argues for the latter. The media could do their job too, by better addressing how IVF and egg freezing are not the failsafe fallbacks they are so often claimed to be. Most of all, it is paradoxical that the government considering the FEI’s proposals – a government that claims it is committed to family values – has done little to create a society in which balancing childrearing with a career is manageable. Nor has it worked to prevent a housing crisis that means many of my generation are delaying starting families, or deciding against them altogether. If you want more women to have children, giving them the facts is an excellent place to start. But fertility education is of limited use when you grow up only to find that a stable home, affordable childcare, and decent maternity and paternity packages seem out of the question. We shouldn’t need to send politicians back to school for them to realise that. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/06/tuesdays-best-tv-seven-year-switch-the-great-celebrity-bake-off-for-stand-up-to-cancer","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Seven Year Switch; The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up to Cancer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/06/tuesdays-best-tv-seven-year-switch-the-great-celebrity-bake-off-for-stand-up-to-cancer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/06/tuesdays-best-tv-seven-year-switch-the-great-celebrity-bake-off-for-stand-up-to-cancer","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Seven Year Switch; The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up to Cancer","bodyText":"Seven Year Switch 9.15pm, Channel 4 It sounds like an attempt to put a worthy spin on the Love Island format: four fractious couples – who at least all agree that they are currently unhappy with their long-term partners – embark upon a two-week wife swap in deluxe villas on a beautiful Thai island to see whether it will reboot their ailing relationships.

A further 12 people were killed on Sunday but their bodies were only recovered on Monday, doctors said. The intense violence continued despite the arrival of a humanitarian convoy in the enclave, two weeks into a renewed regime offensive that has killed more than 700 civilians. The convoy of 46 trucks – a joint effort by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the United Nations – was allowed to deliver food for about 27,000 of the 400,000 people trapped in the enclave. It was the first aid delivery to the reach eastern Ghouta in weeks, but humanitarian officials said the Syrian military had refused to allow it to bring in critically needed medical supplies. Ongoing shelling in the area forced the convoy to leave before all the food aid was unloaded. Pawel Krzysiek, the head of communications for the ICRC in Syria said the situation for civilians trapped inside eastern Ghouta was “very precarious.” Krzysiek told the Guardian that thousands of civilians had been sheltering in freezing basements for more than two weeks, without water or proper sanitation. “It took more than 15 days for their children to see the sunlight. There is no possibility to really go outside because the shelling gets so intense,” he said. “They also fear to eat in front of other people because pretty much everyone there is hungry. So they are very often forced to go back to their places that are more exposed to eat their food.” “The people are tired and angry, desperate, exhausted, hopeless. They want it to stop. They want to be able to live with dignity, eat normal food, not spend their days in the basement,” he said. A desperate shortage of supplies meant that the wounded have been dying from treatable injuries and illnesses, aid organisations said.. World Health Organisation official Tarik Jašarević told the Guardian that Syrian authorities who inspected the convoy refused to allow in supplies of trauma, surgical and dialysis equipment. “WHO has long spoken out against the removal or rejection of lifesaving treatments and medical items from aid convoys by national authorities. The health supplies provided by WHO in these convoys are selected after extensive consultations with health partners working in these areas and are desperately needed to save lives and reduce suffering.” Doctors on the ground said 712 people had been killed and more than 5,600 wounded since 19 February. The airstrikes and artillery bombardment have been coupled with a ground offensive by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his allied Shia militias, whose advances are aimed at splitting eastern Ghouta in half and cutting off rebel fighters. The World Food Programme’s country director in Syria said aid efforts were still paralysed in many places. “A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in eastern Ghouta where raging violence has paralysed our response and our ability to reach families who desperately need help,” said Jakob Kern. He said he hoped a second convoy could reach eastern Ghouta on Thursday with food rations for some extra 70,000 people. “The longer eastern Ghouta is deprived of the necessities of life, the more people will die. We appeal to all parties to allow the ongoing and safe delivery of aid to all people in need, no matter where they are.” Some of the heaviest fighting on Sunday was concentrated in the area of Beit Sawa, on the eastern edge of the densely populated centre of eastern Ghouta, where civilians fled clashes between regime forces and Jaysh al-Islam, one of three main rebel groups. At a press conference on Sunday evening, Assad vowed to continue what he described as a battle against terrorism in the enclave. Monday’s roll call of the dead included one doctor. Denying access to medical aid and targeting hospitals in eastern Ghouta has been condemned as a deliberate policy of the Assad regime. Abdulkarim Ekzayez, a senior fellow at the Centre on Global Health Security, wrote on the Chatham House website last month that targeting healthcare facilities had been used in the past as a tactic to force the displacement of civilians.

On Sunday, the social network ran a survey for some users asking how they thought the company should handle grooming behaviour. “There are a wide range of topics and behaviours that appear on Facebook,” one question began. “In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook’s policies, how would you handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14-year-old girl for sexual pictures.” The options available to respondents ranged from “this content should not be allowed on Facebook, and no one should be able to see it” to “this content should be allowed on Facebook, and I would not mind seeing it”. A second question asked who should decide the rules around whether or not the adult man should be allowed to ask for such pictures on Facebook. Options available included “Facebook users decide the rules by voting and tell Facebook” and “Facebook decides the rules on its own”. In neither survey question did Facebook allow users to indicate that law enforcement or child protection should be involved in the situation: the strictest option allowed involved turning to the social network as arbiter. Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, condemned the survey. “This is a stupid and irresponsible survey,” she said. “Adult men asking 14-year-olds to send sexual images is not only against the law, it is completely wrong and an appalling abuse and exploitation of children. I cannot imagine that Facebook executives ever want it on their platform but they also should not send out surveys that suggest they might tolerate it or suggest to Facebook users that this might ever be acceptable.” Other parts of the survey asked similar questions about content glorifying extremism, and asked users to rank how important they felt it was that Facebook’s policies were developed in a transparent manner, were fair, took into account different cultural norms, and achieved “the ‘right outcome’”. Facebook’s vice president of product, Guy Rosen, said the surveys were “a mistake”. “We run surveys to understand how the community thinks about how we set policies,” he said. “But this kind of activity is and will always be completely unacceptable on FB. We regularly work with authorities if identified. It shouldn’t have been part of this survey. That was a mistake.” In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson added: “We understand this survey refers to offensive content that is already prohibited on Facebook and that we have no intention of allowing so have stopped the survey. “We have prohibited child grooming on Facebook since our earliest days; we have no intention of changing this and we regularly work with the police to ensure that anyone found acting in such a way is brought to justice.” If you have more information about this survey, please contact julia.wong@theguardian.com and alex.hern@theguardian.com EU gives Facebook and Google three months to tackle extremist content Facebook finds no substantial evidence of Russian meddling in EU referendum"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/05/local-authorities-criticise-theresa-may-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T13:00:26Z","webTitle":"Disused shops could be used to tackle housing crisis, says May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/05/local-authorities-criticise-theresa-may-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/05/local-authorities-criticise-theresa-may-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Disused shops could be used to tackle housing crisis, says May","bodyText":"Former shops could be turned into homes as online shopping reshapes high streets, Theresa May has said, as she called for a “great national effort” by the government, developers and councils to tackle the housing crisis. Answering questions after a speech in London on Monday, the prime minister said fresh approaches were needed, including using disused buildings of various types to create new homes. Asked whether this should include retail spaces, May said it was important to prevent high streets from being hollowed out. “Retailing is changing, with buying more goods online, and one of the elements of the new planning rules we’re setting out is to make it easier for shops to be turned into housing if that’s appropriate, but also for development above retail units to take place,” she said. “Often there’s a very good argument for having homes being built in the centre of town, accessible to shops, accessible to transport infrastructure as well. And greater extension upwards can be, I think, one of the solutions for ensuring we’re building enough homes.” In a 25-minute speech to the Royal Town Planning Institute conference, May described what she called a broken housing market and a resultant loss of social mobility and community, with younger people justifiably angry at being excluded, increased exploitation of renters and a problem of rough sleeping. Overcoming this required a united effort, she continued. “It’s so important, not just for individuals, and for that British dream, but for communities, and people’s stake in the communities, that they’re able to feel that they do have a home of their own. “What I’m encouraging people to do is to see this as a great national effort – all of us coming together, playing our role to ensure that we do deliver those homes.” The speech contained only limited solutions, mainly based on streamlined planning process and efforts to press housebuilders to construct homes rather than sitting on land as an investment. May dismissed calls to let councils borrow more easily to construct further social housing, and she faced criticism from the Local Government Association, which rejected her argument that councils were a significant part of the problem. Gary Porter, who chairs the LGA and is the Conservative leader of South Holland council in Lincolnshire, said that in the past 12 months councils had granted nearly twice as many planning permissions as the number of new homes that had been completed. “The truth is that councils are currently approving nine in 10 planning applications, which shows that the planning system is working well and is not a barrier to building,” he said. Porter said the government proposal to put independent inspectors in place where councils were seen to be blocking housing development was “unhelpful and misguided”. The primary way to increase the number of homes being built was to allow councils to borrow money to construct their own, he said. This was suggested last year by the housing and communities secretary, Sajid Javid, but blocked by the Treasury. In a section of the speech targeting developers, May criticised the “perverse incentive” of bonuses to bosses of such companies being based on profits rather than the number of homes they build. Asked after the speech how she would hold developers to such “Stalinist tractor production” targets, May said the Conservative MP Oliver Letwin had been tasked with examining the matter and would come forward with proposals. May said that talking to young voters during last year’s general election campaign made clear that many were justifiably angry at the unaffordability of homes and the consequent rises in wealth inequality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/05/italy-turns-back-on-europe-as-election-points-to-hung-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T11:19:28Z","webTitle":"Eurosceptic Italy in race to form majority government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/italy-turns-back-on-europe-as-election-points-to-hung-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/05/italy-turns-back-on-europe-as-election-points-to-hung-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Eurosceptic Italy in race to form majority government","bodyText":"The two populist parties that won major upsets in the Italian election – the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League (La Lega) – are in a race to be the first to try to form a majority government after the election produced a hung parliament. The decision will ultimately fall to Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, who could take weeks to determine whether the anti-establishment M5S, which took 32.6% of the vote, or a fragile centre-right alliance led by the League’s bombastic Matteo Salvini, with 35.7% of the vote, are better equipped to create a majority government. As Italy and Europe digested the news on Monday that a majority of Italian voters had supported Eurosceptic candidates in the national election, both sides began jockeying for position, saying each had earned the right to lead. The Italian constitution gives Mattarella the power to give the mandate to any party, regardless of who has won the most votes. “The centre-right is the coalition that won, it’s the coalition that can govern,” Salvini said in a press conference in Milan. Hours later, it was a sentiment echoed by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, the head of the M5S. While the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi had been seen as leading the centre-right coalition, results showed he was beaten by his younger rival on the right, following a campaign in which Salvini emphasised support for radical immigration policies, including mass deportations of immigrants who are in Italy illegally. As ballots continued to be counted on Monday afternoon, it was clear that no single party or alliance would have enough votes to win a clear majority. What was evident is that the voters were not convinced by the pro-EU arguments put forward by the centre left, led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi. The Democratic party won just 18.7% of the vote – a dismal showing – and Renzi, who was once seen as a bright promising politician, submitted his resignation in front of television cameras on Monday evening. “I think we have clearly recognised that it is a clear defeat, a defeat that requires us to open a new page within the Democratic party,” he said. Renzi also suggested that the party had already said “no” to any deal with parties he considered to be “extremists” and that he would retreat in favour of a simpler role: senator for his native Florence. In rejecting Renzi and voting for Di Maio and Salvini, who have both flirted with calls for a referendum on the euro (which Italians would not support), the results nevertheless represented a repudiation of Brussels by Italian voters, less than two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union. In Brussels, there was ill-concealed dismay – although the European commission was keen to insist the results were yet to be made official. The commission’s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, told reporters its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, wanted to see a “stable government in Italy” and “regarding the potential impact and so on and so forth... ‘Keep calm and carry on’”. Asked to respond to the claims by Salvini, that interventions by Juncker during the election campaign had given his party a boost, Schinas declined to comment. He said: “We have confidence in President Mattarella … to facilitate the forming of a stable government in Italy.” Two weeks ago, Juncker warned that the EU was expecting a bad outcome. “We have to brace ourselves for the worst scenario and the worst scenario could be no operational government,” he had said. He later backtracked to insist he was confident an operational government would be formed in the wake of the polls. The results were extraordinary in part because they reflected a rejection of what most analysts would agree has been a fairly competent government under the Democratic party, which has overseen a big improvement in the economy and adopted policies that limited the number of migrants coming to Europe, in favour of inexperienced political leaders with controversial views on issues ranging from their support of Vladimir Putin to scepticism about the efficacy of mandatory vaccinations. The M5S’s poor handling of leading jobs in municipal governments in Rome and Turin did not appear to dissuade voters, even as the Democratic party sought to hammer home a message that a vote for the former would bring chaos. The populist party had until recently endorsed a referendum on the euro, but toned down its anti-euro rhetoric in the run-up to the national election, which may have given some comfort to Italians, who do not significantly support leaving the eurozone, although they are critical of Brussels. Analysts on Monday morning said it was far from clear how the parties might cobble together a majority.

The long-awaited report by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee is a potential death knell for Team Sky. It calls into question exactly how they became one of the most successful outfits in British sporting history and draws a number of damaging conclusions. The most stark is that Team Sky abused the anti-doping system to allow Wiggins, and possibly support riders, to take powerful corticosteroids to prepare them for the Tour de France. It also suggests their manager, Sir David Brailsford, must take responsibility for abandoning an ethos of “winning clean”, which was the genesis of Team Sky, as a hunger for victory took over. The MPs who led the inquiry also suggest that many people find Team Sky’s story about an infamous jiffy bag delivery to Wiggins at a race in 2011 to be entirely implausible. The inquiry claims it was privy to further evidence that the package contained the corticosteroid triamcinolone and not the decongestant fluimucil, as was claimed by Team Sky. If that were ever proved to be true, and triamcinolone was administered to Wiggins at that time, it would amount to an anti-doping rule violation. As it is, the report found that Team Sky abused the system of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), in effect a doctor’s note allowing a banned substance to be used for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition. “From the evidence that has been received by the committee, we believe that this powerful corticosteroid [triamcinolone] was being used to prepare Bradley Wiggins, and possibly other riders supporting him, for the Tour de France,” the report reads. “The purpose of this was not to treat medical need, but to improve his power-to-weight ratio ahead of the race. The application for the TUE for the triamcinolone for Bradley Wiggins, ahead of the 2012 Tour de France, also meant that he benefited from the performance-enhancing properties of this drug during the race. “This does not constitute a violation of the World Anti-Doping Agency code, but it does cross the ethical line that David Brailsford says he himself drew for Team Sky. In this case, and contrary to the testimony of David Brailsford in front of the committee, we believe that drugs were being used by Team Sky, within the Wada rules, to enhance the performance of riders, and not just to treat medical need.” Wiggins said: “I find it so sad that accusations can be made, where people can be accused of things they have never done which are then regarded as facts. I strongly refute the claim that any drug was used without medical need.I hope to have my say in the next few days and put to my side across.” The report focuses on inconsistencies in accounts of what was contained in a jiffy bag package delivered to Wiggins and Team Sky during the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011, which was the subject of a UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) investigation. Ukad closed the investigation last November after deeming it impossible to determine whether the contents were the legal decongestant fluimucil or the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone, or something else. Dr Richard Freeman, the former Team Sky medic who ordered the package, refused to comment when asked by the DCMS committee inquiry what it was. “To many people, the whole story of the package seems implausible, to say the least,” the report reads. “Further information shown to the committee claimed that the product that was requested to be sent out to the event was triamcinolone.” The select committee inquiry states it asked Freeman to comment on the contents of the package. Rather than confirm what Brailsford told the committee – that the package contained “only fluimucil” – Freeman said he was unable to comment, on legal advice. The original Ukad investigation criticised the lack of medical records kept by Team Sky, particularly by Freeman, who also worked at British Cycling until his resignation last year. Freeman kept Wiggins’ medical records on a laptop that was stolen in Greece in 2014, and no back-up copy was ever made. The DCMS select committee report said Brailsford, Team Sky’s general manager, must take responsibility for this. The report states: “How can David Brailsford ensure that his team is performing to his requirements if he does not know and cannot tell what drugs the doctors are giving the riders? David Brailsford must take responsibility for these failures, the regime under which Team Sky riders trained and competed and the damaging scepticism about the legitimacy of his team’s performance and accomplishments.” It even hints at a possible cover-up. “Despite the fact that it was Team Sky policy for medical records of riders to be uploaded to a shared Dropbox cloud computing storage site, this was never done,” the report reads, “nor, in the three years from 2011 to 2014, did anyone at Team Sky check this, and insist that the records were uploaded. This is even more lacking in credibility given that these were not just the records for a junior rider, but those of the lead cyclist in the team.” Wiggins’s use of triamcinolone is already known. A leak by the Russian hackers Fancy Bears in September 2016 revealed he had three intramuscular injections of triamcinolone before big grand tours including the Tour de France in 2012. The DCMS committee inquiry, which began in September 2015, heard from Brailsford and Shane Sutton, a former head coach at both Team Sky and British Cycling in December 2016. Simon Cope, a former British Cycling employee who drove the jiffy bag package from the velodrome in Manchester to south-east France, also gave evidence. Brailsford could not be reached for comment. In a statement, Team Sky said: The report details again areas in the past where we have already acknowledged that the Team fell short. We take full responsibility for mistakes that were made. We wrote to the committee in March 2017 setting out in detail the steps we took in subsequent years to put them right, including, for example, the strengthening of our medical record keeping. “However, the report also makes the serious claim that medication has been used by the team to enhance performance. We strongly refute this. The report also includes an allegation of widespread triamcinolone use by Team Sky riders ahead of the 2012 Tour de France. Again, we strongly refute this allegation. We are surprised and disappointed that the committee has chosen to present an anonymous and potentially malicious claim in this way, without presenting any evidence or giving us an opportunity to respond. This is unfair both to the team and to the riders in question. “We take our responsibility to the sport seriously. We are committed to creating an environment at Team Sky where riders can perform to the best of their ability, and do it clean.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/04/vladimir-putin-never-extradite-13-russians-robert-mueller","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T18:46:21Z","webTitle":"Putin: Russia will 'never' extradite 13 nationals indicted by Mueller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/vladimir-putin-never-extradite-13-russians-robert-mueller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/vladimir-putin-never-extradite-13-russians-robert-mueller","fields":{"headline":"Putin: Russia will 'never' extradite 13 nationals indicted by Mueller","bodyText":"Russia will “never” extradite any of its 13 nationals indicted last month by special counsel Robert Mueller for interfering in the 2016 US election, Vladimir Putin said, even as he insisted they did not act on behalf of his government. Putin spoke in a second interview with Megyn Kelly of NBC, due to air in the US on Sunday and trailed extensively this week. Kelly, formerly of Fox News, first interviewed the Russian president in June 2017. In that interview, the Russian president denied that his government holds any compromising material on Donald Trump. The existence or not of such “kompromat” is one strand of Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference, which US intelligence agencies agree aimed to sway the election in Trump’s favour. Mueller is also looking into alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow and has indicted four former staffers: national security adviser Michael Flynn, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, campaign manager Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates. Flynn, Papadopoulos and Gates have entered plea deals in return for cooperation. Manafort maintains his innocence on charges including money laundering and tax and bank fraud. Trump has denied any collusion between his aides and the Kremlin, calling the investigations a “witch-hunt”. Mueller indicted the 13 Russians last month, alleging they “communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign”. Putin’s defiant answer to Kelly illustrated the long odds that the 13 will ever appear in US court to answer charges of running a massive, secret social media trolling and targeted messaging operation. The US has no extradition treaty with Moscow. A provision in Russia’s constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens. “Never,” Putin told Kelly. “Never. Russia does not extradite its citizens to anyone.” The justice department has long supported indicting foreigners, to make it harder for them to travel. Legal experts have said Mueller’s indictment served to increase public awareness. The 37-page document alleges that Russians working for the Internet Research Agency used fake social media accounts and on-the-ground political organizing to exacerbate divisive US issues. Posing as Americans, they purchased space on US computer servers and used US email providers. Putin said his government would have little to answer for until the US provides “some materials, specifics and data”. Russia would be “prepared to look at them and talk about it”, he said, repeating his insistence that his government had no role in directing the operatives. “I know that they do not represent the Russian state, the Russian authorities,” Putin said. “What they did specifically, I have no idea.” Barack Obama’s chief of staff, meanwhile, told NBC’s Meet the Press that the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, had been responsible for weakening the White House response to the Russian meddling as it was occurring. “The president asked the four [congressional party] leaders in a bipartisan meeting in the Oval Office to join him in asking the states to work with us on this question,” Denis McDonough said. “It took over three weeks to get that statement worked out. It was dramatically watered down.” Asked if that was done to satisfy McConnell, McDonough said: “Yes.” Trump has also been criticised for not doing enough to tackle Russian interference. On Tuesday, Adm Mike Rogers, chief of the National Security Agency, told a Senate committee the president had not authorised him to counter Russian cyber-attacks. “Clearly,” he said, “what we’ve done hasn’t been enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/05/right-to-be-forgotten-google-europe-ecj-data-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Should we forget about the ‘right to be forgotten’? | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/right-to-be-forgotten-google-europe-ecj-data-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/right-to-be-forgotten-google-europe-ecj-data-spain","fields":{"headline":"Should we forget about the ‘right to be forgotten’?","bodyText":"Like the snow, data protection issues arrived last week in a flurry. How much can we edit our public past? Who is to judge what a society’s collective digitised memory is to retain or recall? A court in London is considering whether UK data protection law enables claimants known as NT1 and NT2 to compel Google to block online searchers from public information about their convictions for conspiracy to account falsely and to intercept communications. Meanwhile, Max Mosley called in aid data protection law to try to stop some newspapers referring to certain events from his past. And the UK parliament is due this week to debate legislation prompted by a new EU General Data Protection Regulation. It updates a directive from 1995 - pre Google, pre Facebook, pre smartphones and apps. Proponents say the GDPR will better balance individual privacy with collection and use of personal information by corporations and governments in the digital era, when, in a sense, we are our data. In 2014 the European court of justice ruled in favour of a Spaniard who was discomfited by an archived newspaper item that contained public details about his former indebtedness. The court required Google to prevent the newspaper item being found through its search engine. Google calls this “delisting”. The item was not deleted from the newspaper’s electronic archive, but those who searched the man’s name would not have the item retrieved and shown among the links in the search results. Delisting could occur, said the court, where “information appears, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive”. “Inaccurate” seemed to be included, too. In NT1-NT2 preliminaries, a judge referred to “inaccurate, stale, irrelevant” information. A French court last year referred to the ECJ the issue of whether the right requires delisting by Google only in the country concerned (current practice), across Europe or worldwide. Last week Google revealed that since it began in 2014 almost 400,000 requesters have sought the delisting of about 2.4m items (URLs). Google’s criteria for delisting were met in 43% of cases.The requests related mainly to France (20.4%), Germany (17.3%) and the UK (12.9%). Main categories of sites that attracted delisting requests were directories, news, social media and government records. Of the top 10 news sites across Europe from which people sought delisting of items between January 2016 and December 2017, half were UK sites: dailymail.co.uk, 1,793 URLs requested for delisting, 27.4% delisting rate; ricerca.gelocal.it, 1,022, 28.6%; telegraph.co.uk, 949, 29.9%; leparisien.fr, 880, 31.9%; ricerca.repubblica.it, 864, 23%; 247.libero.it, 792, 40.5%; mirror.co.uk, 781, 32.8%; ouest-france.fr, 738, 18.1%; bbc.co.uk, 712, 22.4%; thesun.co.uk, 676, 32.8%. Guardian staff tell me that since 2014 Google has delisted 159 Guardian items, though four were relisted. Google data says the top five social media sites attracting delisting requests in the January 2016 to December 2017 period were: facebook.com, 15,416 URLs requested for delisting, 52/1% delisting rate; twitter.com, 11,408, 50.1%; plus.google.com, 11,287, 33.2%; instagram.com, 10,388, 90.8%; youtube.com, 8,110, 40.6%. Examples from Google’s report on search removals give a sense of the variety of requests, the potential for dishonest applications (a problem in the US too), the attraction of the process for public figures, and the significant role that data protection agencies can play in delisting decisions: UK: “A man who was convicted of benefits fraud in 2012 asked us to delist nearly 300 articles related to the conviction based on a document he provided suggesting he was later found innocent of the crime. We delisted 293 URLs pursuant to the documentation the requester provided. The requester then asked us to delist several other pages related to his separate conviction for forging documents. After re-reviewing the original document he submitted as proof of his innocence in the benefits case, we discovered that it was a forgery. We reinstated all of the URLs we had previously delisted.” UK: “A former bank clerk who was imprisoned for stealing money from elderly people’s bank accounts asked us to delist news articles from 2008 covering the conviction. His conviction became spent under UK law in 2013. We delisted four articles after the Data Protection Authority requested that we remove.” Germany: “We received a request to delist four news articles about an academic’s research that contained the individual’s photo because the academic changed gender and identifies under a new name. We did not delist the articles as they continue to be relevant to the academic’s professional life and research.” Hungary: “A high-ranking public official asked us to remove recent articles discussing a decades-old criminal conviction. We did not remove the articles from search results.” Italy: “A woman requested that we remove a decades-old article about her husband’s murder, which included her name. We have removed the page from search results for her name.” Poland: “A prominent business person asked us to remove articles about his lawsuit against a newspaper. We did not remove the articles from search results.” Portugal: “We received an order from the Data Protection Authority to delist a news article about the criminal investigation of a well-known businessman for alleged fraud, falsification of documents and tax evasion. We delisted the page at issue.” Spain: “We received a request from an individual to delist a news article from 1994 and a forum post from 2007 about the individual’s former activities as the head of a political arm of a state-identified terrorist organisation. We did not delist the article for public interest reasons.” Competing rights, jurisdictions and technologies have to be faced by policy makers. But I fear that, on this “right to be forgotten”, data protection law over-promises. When it under-delivers, it might contribute, in its own small way, to the ebbing of faith in democratic institutions. Better, I think, to be blunt about the limits of the individual’s control over his or her personal information, especially once it is public, and to focus more on accuracy and on transparency over its uses. Yes, there are exceptional cases when the continuing public availability of accurate information about an identifiable person can cause serious injustice without a sufficient countervailing public interest. True, the notion of wiping the slate of some old or “spent” convictions is not new. Digital realities deserve attention. But care is needed. Information is protean. Its meaning changes with context. Its uses vary with circumstance. Retrospect illuminates facets not previously seen. New prospects may make it relevant again. Inadequate or excessive in itself for one purpose, in combination with other information it may be just right. The ECJ’s Google Spain “right to be forgotten”, as it is misleadingly described, is fiercely defended and intensively criticised. I believe that it was poorly thought through, and re-examining it will lead to better practical handling of large public datasets of personal information and the engines that sift and sort them. A re-examination is needed. • Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/04/balenciaga-big-idea-this-season-fashion-will-benefit-un-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:07:58Z","webTitle":"Balenciaga's big idea: this season's fashion will benefit UN charity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/04/balenciaga-big-idea-this-season-fashion-will-benefit-un-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/04/balenciaga-big-idea-this-season-fashion-will-benefit-un-charity","fields":{"headline":"Balenciaga's big idea: this season's fashion will benefit UN charity","bodyText":"Fashion’s most influential designer is sick of putting meaningless graphics on T-shirts. “I am tired of making prints for the sake of prints,” said Demna Gvasalia, backstage at his Balenciaga show in Paris on Sunday. “At this stage, if I do a T-shirt or a jersey it needs to have something more to it.” Given that a T-shirt printed with the DHL logo was the item that originally brought Gvasalia and his design collective, Vetements, to the world’s attention, this proclamation will pique the fashion industry’s interest. Two years ago, when he started at Balenciaga, Gvasalia’s ironic, street-smart aesthetic seemed an odd fit for a house best known for its association with Audrey Hepburn. But his impressive hits – the oversized anoraks copied on every high street; the sell-out “ugly chic” Triple S trainers – have proved the pairing’s wisdom. This season’s big idea had a serious message: Balenciaga collaborated with the World Food Programme on a series of logo baseball caps, bumbags and T-shirts, using the same “free corporate awayday merch” aesthetic that has become a house signature. “If I can do something that actually engages and makes some difference...” said Gvasalia, explaining that Balenciaga had donated $250,000 (£180,000) and will give 10% of the retail price of each piece sold to the UN charity. “It was a very special project,” he said. “For the first time I thought that fashion could be useful in a different way than just covering the body.” The other graphics in the show were about “using fashion as a tool of communication” too, albeit in weirder ways. Some shirts were printed with the phone number of a newly set up “Balenciaga hotline”, on which a recorded voice asks callers banal questions such as their favourite city and their shoe size. “It’s a never-ending hotline, for people who have a lot of time,” said Gvasalia, gnomically. With a snowy mountain set, and a neon-infused colour palette inspired by snowboarders in the 90s, the final theme was extreme weather, explored through silhouette. The show opened with a black mini dress, worn with bare legs and heels, and closed with gargantuan coats created from up to nine garments fused together. “It looks like you are wearing all of your wardrobe because it’s really cold,” said Gvasalia, “but it’s actually one piece. We ended up with shapes that are extremely reminiscent of the house archive even though I used all the ‘Demna’ pieces – hoodies, parkas. This was my way of showing that this is the new Balenciaga; how I see it defined by me being there.” Also on Sunday, British designer Clare Waight Keller presented her sophomore collection for Givenchy. Waight Keller replaced Riccardo Tisci, who was recently named creative director of Burberry. Her debut, in September, was met with a mixed critical reaction, but this follow-up was stronger. Building on the nighttime feel of an assured couture collection, shown in January, she took 80s Berlin as her theme, and showed a series of lush fake-fur coats, shimmering sequinned midi dresses with tough pointy boots and appealing monochrome tailoring. Waight Keller described the collection as gritty and said it had brought her a step closer to expressing her vision for Givenchy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/04/alan-pardew-west-brom-limps-on-watford","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T22:30:17Z","webTitle":"Alan Pardew limps on with West Brom out of credible alternatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/04/alan-pardew-west-brom-limps-on-watford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/04/alan-pardew-west-brom-limps-on-watford","fields":{"headline":"Alan Pardew limps on with West Brom out of credible alternatives","bodyText":"Alan Pardew has been granted a stay of execution despite a fifth successive league defeat for West Bromwich Albion. A combination of an improved performance at Watford and, crucially, the absence of any credible alternatives to take over as the manager means Pardew will remain in charge for Leicester City’s visit on Saturday. Pardew accepted his job is at risk after the 1-0 defeat at Vicarage Road left West Brom rooted to the bottom and extended the manager’s dismal record since replacing Tony Pulis in November. His team have won only one of 15 league games since he took over and picked up fewer points and scored fewer goals than any other top-flight club in that period. Pardew, in short, has had no positive impact on players who had already badly lost their way under Pulis. Yet the board at the Hawthorns have decided against making a change for a second time this season, partly after seeing some signs of positivity at Watford, where West Brom did not deserve to lose and could have taken the lead before Troy Deeney’s late winner, but more as a result of the fact they are unable to identify a manager capable of turning things around. West Brom are eight points adrift of safety with nine matches remaining, with Pardew admitting the table makes “daunting” reading. For the second successive game, supporters called for Pardew to be sacked and it could be an uncomfortable atmosphere at the Hawthorns if they slip to yet another defeat against Leicester. There is no getting away from the fact Pardew’s reign has been nothing short of a disaster. Results have been miserable, four players were disciplined for breaking a midnight curfew and allegedly stealing a taxi during a team-bonding trip in Barcelona, and only last week Chris Brunt questioned the manager’s tactics in a dressing-room row after the 2-1 home defeat against Huddersfield. Asked where the defeat against Watford left West Brom, Pardew replied: “In a difficult position, let’s be honest. It’s not where we want to be. If you were to look at the table, it would look daunting, and for myself and the players we’re best focusing on Leicester and trying to get a win and go from there. That’s what we’ll do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-legacy-brighton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:51:43Z","webTitle":"Abject Arsenal wilt again to deepen the dent in Arsène Wenger’s legacy | Dominic Fifield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-legacy-brighton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-legacy-brighton","fields":{"headline":"Abject Arsenal wilt again to deepen the dent in Arsène Wenger’s legacy","bodyText":"It was the body language that damned Arsenal most of all. The hunching of the shoulders and shuffled attempts to retreat into position, internationals of considerable repute with their heads down, trudging around the pitch as if wading through treacle. Arsène Wenger described them as “passive”. About as animated as they became during a dreadful opening half-hour was when Mesut Özil flung his gloves to the turf in frustration, even if that was all for show. The same could be said for the anguished glances to the heavens at each misplaced pass or the yellow cards collected as if to be used as evidence of commitment. The hope had been that this team would be stung into a response after the high-profile defeats by Manchester City last week. In previous years they have somehow summoned a performance in the wake of choking disappointment to paper over the cracks. This time they were limp and dysfunctional, a team the home side sensed were there for the taking throughout that opening period, a collective bereft of spirit, organisation or belief – qualities Brighton &amp; Hove Albion displayed in abundance. Quailing defenders backed off José Izquierdo and both full-backs were racked by uncertainty. Petr Cech was off the pace and, as he admitted afterwards, culpable at each of the goals conceded. Midfielders in possession found options non-existent, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang lost among blue and white shirts and appearing to lack the drive to find space. Set pieces, Brighton’s weakness for much of this campaign, suddenly became an invitation to provoke panic. Glenn Murray, Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk bullied their markers. Forget natural ability for a moment: Arsenal would have been far more imposing with that trio in their ranks. They were the leaders the visitors lacked. Wenger claimed a lack of confidence had created a false impression. “The disappointments, plus the fact we have been making defensive mistakes, means it looks like we lack leaders,” he said. “But I don’t believe that. We have to remain positive in a negative environment and show we have character and leaders.” But this had been the occasion to do just that and his players, with the possible exception of the typically spiky Jack Wilshere, had withered. The more optimistic members of the coaching staff could point to a rally of sorts after the interval, and periods of pressure imposed on a side who have spent the entire season glancing over their shoulders at the relegation scrap. But no one present could be hoodwinked into thinking Arsenal deserved anything other than a sixth defeat in eight games, a fourth in succession, an eighth of the calendar year. The supporters had waited until their team were trailing by two before bellowing “We want Wenger out” and, in truth, that was a truer reflection of disgust than any message on a banner fluttering behind a distant aeroplane. It is disheartening that it has come to this but it is now Arsenal’s reality. Wenger’s legacy will be tainted by such pathetic displays but is this team capable of recovering? The beleaguered manager is now prioritising the Europa League, as his selection demonstrated. The last time Arsenal lost five in a row was in 1977 and they visit a resurgent Milan on Thursday. Such is the dismal mood it is hard to envisage anything other than more pain being inflicted at San Siro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/04/tony-hall-bbc-fight-us-tech-firms-protect-british-values","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T14:18:09Z","webTitle":"Tony Hall: BBC must fight US tech firms to protect British values","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/04/tony-hall-bbc-fight-us-tech-firms-protect-british-values","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/04/tony-hall-bbc-fight-us-tech-firms-protect-british-values","fields":{"headline":"Tony Hall: BBC must fight US tech firms to protect British values","bodyText":"The UK’s public service broadcasters face a David versus Goliath fight against “west coast giants” to protect British values and prevent the spread of social unease and division, the BBC director general will warn this week. In one of his most significant interventions, Tony Hall will take aim at the US “Fang” companies – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google – in a speech to BBC staff in London. Britain faces greater challenges than at any time since the 1970s from tech companies dominating global media, he will say, describing the moment as a time of “breathtaking, seismic change”. “Technology and social media can add to this sense of social unease and division. Too often, it can distort our view of one another and allow us to live in imagined communities where we only really engage with those who share our views. “Fake news compounds that challenge, eating away at trust in the media – including in the BBC – and blurring the lines between reality and so-called ‘alternative facts’,” Lord Hall will say. Citing big market interventions such as Disney and Comcast, the media world is consolidating at a speed not seen before, and the BBC needs to change radically to meet the challenge, he will say. Old business models are being ripped up and “the global media landscape is likely to be dominated by four, perhaps five, businesses of the west coast of America”. These west coast giants will “skilfully mine every ounce of personal data to drive growth and profit”. They will “pluck established talent wherever they can find it, but their business isn’t to inspire the next generation of British talent”, he will argue. Public service broadcasting in the UK and the BBC can continue to thrive, he will say, but only if it accelerates reform, and getting it right is vital for the future of British creativity. He will argue that the value of British public service broadcasting matters more than ever in the era of fake news. To back up that idea Hall will lay out a plan for the BBC to set a “gold standard” for broadcast news, invest in and promote new talent, back creative ideas, reinvent and enhance services such as iPlayer, and prioritise reaching young audiences. Post-Brexit, he will signal he wants to work with other public service broadcasters on how the BBC responds. Despite the Fang companies, available in more than half of British homes, on average the great majority of TV output viewed in the UK is still British content, even among younger audiences, he will say. And he will argue that there is real potential for co-production and commercial growth to keep pace with the global players and safeguard Britain’s creative track record. The BBC may not be “the biggest kid on the block any more”, but Hall will say: “Nobody is fighting harder for Britain and for our audiences. In our fight against fake news ... in our commitment to diverse communities the length and breadth of the UK ... in the values that we project to the rest of the world ... and in the creativity that means so much to every one of us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/04/theresa-may-rules-out-city-firms-passporting-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T19:49:44Z","webTitle":"May tells Trump of 'deep concern' over US trade tariff plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/04/theresa-may-rules-out-city-firms-passporting-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/04/theresa-may-rules-out-city-firms-passporting-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"May tells Trump of 'deep concern' over US trade tariff plans","bodyText":"Theresa May has called Donald Trump to raise Britain’s “deep concern” over plans to impose tariffs of 25% on imports of steel and 10% on aluminium amid US threats of a trade war with China and escalating tensions with the EU. The prime minister had been scheduled to call the US president on Sunday to discuss the appalling situation in Syria, with the pair agreeing it was a humanitarian catastrophe driven by the Syrian regime and its backer, Russia, according to Downing Street. But May also turned to the question of Trump’s comments on trade. “The prime minister raised our deep concern at the president’s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties’ interests,” said a No 10 spokeswoman. Trump’s protectionism has been communicated through Twitter, where he claimed his country was losing billions of dollars on trade, adding that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”. He also threatened taxes on European cars after the EU responded to the decisions on steel and aluminium by saying it could target US imports such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, Levi’s jeans and Kentucky bourbon whiskey. May has strongly signalled a desire to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with the US after Brexit, but critics said Trump’s “America first” rhetoric underlined the potential danger of being too reliant on a transatlantic relationship. Senior government figures told the Guardian that plans to keep Britain closely tied to European standards after Brexit, which were outlined by the prime minister on Friday, had also cut the chances of a major trade deal with the US. One cabinet minister said sticking to EU regulations in a number of areas, particularly around industrial goods, would constrain the breadth of any future UK-US trade links. Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform thinktank, agreed, arguing that convergence in those areas makes “doing a deal with the US incredibly difficult as the majority of their aggressive objectives involve removing regulatory barriers to trade, especially when it comes to food standards”. He added that it would make sense for the UK to keep its focus on European links. “I’d question the logic of running into a trade deal with a president who sees trade less as a means of achieving mutual prosperity and more an instrument of war.” However, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP who chairs the influential European Research Group, argued that the UK could still do a deal with the US, accepting American standards for imports into Britain. He said that could work as long as any goods falling below European standards were not then re-exported to the EU. May’s speech, in which she reiterated her red lines around the single market and customs union but promised close cooperation beyond that, has led to a fragile unity on the government’s backbenches. There has been some angst at cabinet level about briefings that have emerged in recent weeks. Cabinet ministers pushing for a softer Brexit were said to be irritated after an awayday at Chequers to agree the contents of the speech was immediately characterised by sources as “divergence has won the day”. “It was more like divergence as a last resort,” said another source with knowledge of the meeting. Senior MPs who supported remain, such as the Treasury select committee chair, Nicky Morgan, made clear they were happy with May’s promise to prevent customs checks on the Irish border, believing that would secure a sensible deal overall. May rebuffed the suggestion that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, had raised the spectre of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in an internal government report handed to the prime minister. “No. Boris is absolutely clear that there won’t be a hard border,” she told the BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. Asked about the controversial paper in which Johnson said it would be “wrong to see the task as maintaining ‘no border’ on the island of Ireland” and that even with a hard border 95% of goods could pass without checks, May challenged the interpretation of his comments. “He’s clear that there won’t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and we’re working to that,” she said. “We’ve got proposals as to how we can achieve that, now we’re going to be able to sit down and talk with others about how we do that.” Her comments came after claims that her Gavin Barwell, her chief of staff, had leaked Johnson’s paper to Sky News. Whitehall sources said there were suspicions that the leak had originated from Downing Street or the Treasury, despite a strong denial from Barwell. They also said tMay had blocked Johnson’s plea to publish the full document to place the argument in context. The prime minister reiterated her hopes for a customs agreement that would prevent a hard border. But Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, told Marr he was unsure whether the EU27 nations would be able to support the plan and that they would be worried about protecting the integrity of the single market. “While of course we will explore and look at all of the proposed British solutions, they are essentially a starting point in negotiations as opposed to an end point,” Coveney said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2018/mar/04/italy-goes-to-the-polls-general-election-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T10:06:08Z","webTitle":"Italy election: hung parliament on cards as populists surge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/mar/04/italy-goes-to-the-polls-general-election-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/mar/04/italy-goes-to-the-polls-general-election-live","fields":{"headline":"Italy election: hung parliament on cards as populists surge – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is Stephanie Kirchgaessner’s latest news round-up of the results. With the counting and then horse trading likely to take some time, we’re going to wrap up our blog. Thanks for reading. Better than expected results for Eurosceptic parties in Italy have been welcomed Britain’s anti European party Ukip. The Economist Intelligence Unit has six key points from the result: The 2018 election produced an acutely fragmented parliament. The election’s big winner was the anti-establishment Five Star Movement which rode a wave of popular discontent linked economic malaise and concerns over immigration. No coalition or single formation won a majority, with the centre right taking about 37% of votes for the Chamber of Deputies, according to a projection by Quorum / YouTrend. M5S took about 32%, outperforming opinion polls owing largely to a dominant performance in the south. The populist, Eurosceptic Lega also won an impressive 18% of the vote, overtaking Forza Italia (FI) as the largest party in the centre-right coalition. A prolonged period of negotiations will follow over the coming weeks, with the president, Sergio Mattarella, to hold consultations with parties following the convening of the new parliament on 23 March. The key question is whether M5S will soften its policy against alliances with “established” parties, as Luigi Di Maio, the movement’s prime ministerial candidate has signaled he might in recent months. Equally important will be the stance of Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Lega. He must now choose between dominance of the centre right and a role as Mr Di Maio’s junior coalition partner, which could cause support for the Lega fall. Europe Elects charts the dramatic slump in the vote for the centre-left Democratic Party headed by former PM Matteo Renzi. Its share fell from more than 40% in 2014 to just 19%. Many of its former supporters either didn’t vote or switched to the Five Star movement. Former foreign minister, Emma Bonino, now leader of the More Europe party has won a Rome seat in the chamber of deputies, but nationally her party looks set to fall below the 3% threshold necessary for representation in the Senate. Here are the latest projections in the 315-seat Senate and 630-seat Chamber of Deputies. Interior minister Marco Minniti, from the centre-left Democratic Party, has lost his seat to the Five Star Movement. The Italian stock market has fallen in early trading as traders fret that Italy faces a period of political instability. The benchmark FTSE MIB index tumbled by 2% at the open. It then stabilised around 1% lower, so there’s no sign of actual panic. Unicredit, Italy’s largest bank, has shed 2.5% while UBI Banca are down 3.8%. Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says the markets are nervous. “Italy looks to have taken a step to the right and moved towards populism and change. The complexity of the Italian voting system makes it very difficult to establish what happens next and when, but neither of the anti-establishment Five star movement or League parties are an attractive option for markets or the euro.” Shares in Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset company have fallen by over 4% after his Forza Italia party did worse than expected in Sunday’s election, lagging behind the Northern League. Mediaset has been fighting a long legal battle with France’s Vivendi, and a strong showing by Forza Italia would have strengthened its hand. See Business Live for more on the economic fallout from the election. The Italian election results have prompted a fall on the euro. It hit a six-month low versus against the yen after stronger than expected results for results euro-sceptic parties, Reuters reports. The euro zone’s third biggest economy now faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament, spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers. The euro fell 0.3% and was traded at $1.2282, edging towards its seven-week low of $1.21545, which it touched on Thursday. Against the yen it fell to 129.35 yen, its lowest level since late August. Although no party won a majority, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement came out as a clear winner, looking set to become the largest single party by a wide margin. The centre-right bloc, made up of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, and the far-right League and Brothers of Italy, is set to win most seats but is seen falling some way short of an absolute majority. But in a bitter personal defeat for the billionaire media magnate, his Forza Italia party was overtaken by its ally, the far-right, anti-immigrant League. Investors are likely to take fright at any suggestion the 5-Star could form a coalition with the right-wing League. Initial tallies suggested the two forces would have enough seats to govern together and they have in the past shared strong anti-euro views. While the League still says it wants to leave the single currency at the earliest feasible moment, the 5-Star says the time for quitting the euro has passed. “(The euro) gained in early Asian trade, perhaps due to the German vote, but then started turning down as the results from Italy began coming in. I’d expect it to weaken further today as the market absorbs the results of the Italian election,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global. This was an anti-establishment triumph on a par with Brexit and Trump, according to Bloomberg and Reppublica columnist Ferdinando Guigliano. He shares his thoughts over a large moka. Lucio Malan a leading member of the right wing Forza Italia has admitted the election result falls well below his party’s expectation. Forza Italia looks set to be between 50 and 60 seats short of a majority. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Malan said: “We expected a better result than that, to be closer to the majority or even to have the majority. Now we have to see what’s going to happen. We still have some opportunity to form a majority because a number of members of parliament might join, even if elected with other parties. But we still have to see. We hope will not to need that, but we’re going to see.” Asked who Forza Italia will be negotiating with, Malan said: “Not parties, but probably single members of parties. The problem is with new elections we don’t see a big probability to have a more definite result. We might have some advantages with alliances with small parties, but it is difficult.” Malan predicted that another election was the most likely outcome from this inconclusive result. He urged the Five Star Movement to stop sitting on the fence about Europe. “They had a campaign where they were against and in favour of the European Union. Against and in favour of the Euro currency,” Malan said. The majority of districts have been counted but we don’t yet have an allocation of parliamentary seats. It looks like a hung parliament with the centre-right in the lead at 37.6%, Five Star with 31.6%, PD with 19.2% (anything under 20% was going to be dismal), and Emma Bonino’s More Europe under 3% at 2.7%. The takeaways are it has been a very bad night for Europe, in a country that has always been very pro Europe. Mostly voters were sending a message against politicians, and were not swayed by pro-Europe arguments. It might also be true that the M5S and Lega sufficiently toned down their anti-euro rhetoric, easing voters’ reservations. But now what? As one of my go-to analyst’s just said on Twitter: the M5S now controls the South, the Lega (18.2%) is the driving force behind the centre-right. The PD and Lega essentially did equally well, which is stunning. Berlusconi performed worse than expected (around 13%). The centre left is broken. Officials results are not expected to be finalised for several hours, but projections seem to point to a hung parliament, after Italians deserted the traditional centre and more than 50% voted in support of populist parties. The single party predicted to secure the most votes is the Five Star Movement, with about 32%. The anti-establishment, euro-sceptic party was founded nine years ago by comedian Beppe Grillo. A coalition of centre-right parties, including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and including the xenophobic League, is expected to win up to 36% of the vote. Early data shows League (17.5%) gaining more votes than Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (14.4%), giving its firebrand chief Matteo Salvini a chance to lead the coalition and become its candidate for prime minister. Salvini is due to give a press conference at midday. The centre-left Democratic Party headed by Matteo Renzi has had an abysmal election, slumping to about 19% of the vote. Senior officials from the party have conceded defeat. There are several parliamentary combinations that could be cobbled together to win a majority of seats, many of which would pair unlikely bedfellows. Under some scenarios, the Five Star Movement could combine with Renzi’s Democratic party to get to above 50%. However, the M5S has previously said it would not take part in a coalition government. The La Stampa newspaper has declared on its front page that the nation is “ungovernable”, while Il Tempo laments “Che bordello”. As a result of the confusion in Italy, which is unlikely to resolved for weeks, the Euro was set for a choppy trading session. As Italy wakes, there are a lot of questions. Here are just a few of them: And here is Il Tempo’s front page, which sums up the situation with the rather dramatic “Che Bordello”, which translates as “what a brothel”, but which I think we can take to mean “what a mess”. The image on the front page is of the moment that a topless Femen activist protested as Silvio Berlusconi arrived to vote. Here is La Stampa’s front page, which reads: “Da Maio wins, Italy ungovernable”. Inside the paper, columnist Marcello Sorgi wrote: “The March 4 vote yielded a result that Europe was afraid of and Italy perhaps did not expect on this scale.” “Defeated everywhere else in Europe, populism won here. Either it can govern or it will block the system.” Looking ahead, Matteo Salvini will hold a press conference at midday. AP reports that the mood at the anti-immigrant League headquarters in Milan was euphoric earlier today as projections showed the centre-right coalition that the party belongs to was leading the race. While the bloc so far is lacking the majority needed to govern, a party official told reporters that the League’s strong showing within the coalition was “a clear signal to Europe, which has mistreated Italians.” The interior ministry says the turnout for the national election was 71.48%, a drop from the 75% of eligible voters who participated in the 2013 election. In the light of the events overnight it is worth resurfacing this piece by Stephanie Kirchgaessner from late February, that describes the power struggle – and personal animosity - between Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini within Italy’s right-wing coalition. So, if Italy is indeed left with a hung parliament, the deal-making will begin. Agence France-Presse has pulled together three possible options: Populist, far-right alliance: Both the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League party have ruled out the possibility of a post-election pact but this is currently the only option that looks like it would command a majority. According to the latest projections, the two parties together would hold 355 seats in the 630-seat lower house of parliament and 168 seats in the 315-seat upper house. Both parties are heavily eurosceptic and League leader Matteo Salvini has been accused of stirring up racial tensions. A tie-up could cause shockwaves around Europe. Right-wing coalition: Preliminary results make this remote as the coalition is predicted to win only 37% of the vote, including 18% for the League and 14 percent for Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy) party. The final result of the vote in terms of seats is hard to predict, however, as Italy is using a new electoral law for the first time that combines proportional representation with a first-past-the post system. If the coalition does win a majority and the League comes in ahead of Forza Italia, this would open the prospect of far-right Salvini being nominated as Italy’s next prime minister. Stalemate: If there is no clear majority, President Sergio Mattarella could choose to leave in place the current centre-left government of prime minister Paolo Gentiloni. This would allow time to set up a temporary government to reform the electoral law and organise new elections. But the process would take time as consultations could only start after parliament’s newly-elected lawmakers meet for the first time on 23 March to elect speakers. After a stalemate following Italy’s last election in 2013, it took more than two months to form a government. Not a lot of reaction to the vote from outside Italy yet, except from the fringes: Marine le Pen, leader of France’s far-right FN party, thinks the Italian election results translates into a bad night for the EU. The euro has recovered some lost ground and is trading at $1.232 so it’s looking like a bit of score-draw for the single currency so far. Sharon Zollner, ANZ chief economist in Auckland, said: “Italian election results are very unlikely to deliver an obvious coalition recipe, but the market is most concerned about the small chance that the euro-sceptic Five Star party could win and threaten the euro and Italian bonds.” It’s a bit of a different picture for the Italian stock market which seems set to fall sharply later today. Futures trading points to a 1.3% drop in the Italy 40 index of leading companies, according to online trader IG. Italy’s ruling centre-left Democratic Party has admitted it had suffered a “clear defeat” in a general election after coming in third according to projections. “This is a very clear defeat for us,” Maurizio Martina, a minister in the outgoing government, told reporters, according to the Associated Press. “We are expecting a result below our expectations... This is very clearly a negative result for us,” he said. A centre-left coalition led by the Democratic Party was projected to score just 23.1%, after the main right-wing alliance at 35.5% and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement at 32.5%. “Voters have spoken very clearly and irrefutably. The populists have won and the Democratic Party has lost,” Andrea Marcucci, one of the party’s lawmakers in the outgoing parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. Officials results are not expected to be finalised for several hours, but projections seem to point to a hung parliament, after Italians ditched traditional centrist parties. More than 50% of Italians voters supported populist parties. The single party predicted to secure the most votes is the Five Star Movement, with about 32%. The anti-establishment party was founded nine years ago by comedian Beppe Grillo. A coalition of centre-right parties, led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition and including the xenophobic League, is expected to win up to 36% of the vote. Early data shows League (17.5%) gaining more votes than Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (14.4%), giving its firebrand chief Matteo Salvini a chance to lead the coalition and be its candidate for prime minister. The centre-left party headed by Matteo Renzi has had an abysmal election, slumping to about 19% of the vote. There are several parliamentary combinations that could be cobbled together to win a majority of seats, many of which would pair unlikely bedfellows. Under some scenarios, the Five Star Movement could combine with Renzi’s Democratic party to get to above 50%. However, the M5S has previously said it would not take part in a coalition government. As a result of the confusion in Italy, which is unlikely to resolved for weeks, the Euro was set for a choppy trading session. M5S is looking like it has won the most votes of any single party. Stephanie Kirchgaessner has more on the anti-establishment party and its links to Russia: So, if Italy does get a hung parliament, how long could negotiations over forming government take? Here is how news organisations around Europe are interpreting the events of the night, while La Stampa headlined its election summary: “Ungovernable Italy”. M5S has had a particularly good night in the south of the country. In the midst of an eventful night, our Italy correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has paused to ponder what is next for the country? Traditionally, a grand coalition – like a forced marriage of rivals – could be brought together relatively easily by joining the country’s two big traditional parties, the centre-left Democratic Party led by Matteo Renzi, and Forza Italia on the right led by Silvio Berlusconi. But those traditional parties are not expected to have enough support on their own to create parliamentary majority, according to early results. Exit polls and early projects on Monday morning revealed that as many as 50% of Italian voters supported populist parties. The Five Star Movement, once laughed off as merely a protest party, is expected to emerge as the single biggest party, with up to 33% of the vote. La Lega, previously known as the Northern League, also appeared to have performed better than expected. Those parties, once seen as fringe movements, will likely have to play a role in whatever coalition is created for the new government in order for it to look reflective of the election results, analysts say. The calculation is complicated in large part because the Five Star Movement has always traditionally said it would not take part in a coalition government. You can read her full analysis here: Here are the latest projections for the make-up of the chamber of deputies: The euro is set for a choppy trading session after the strong showing by the 5-Star Movement and other populists. The single currency jumped earlier when it was confirmed that Germany had finally got itself a new grand coalition. It reached $1.23655 but has fallen 0.1% in the last hour or so to $1.2309 as traders digest the significance of a likely hung parliament after an election that saw more than half of the country’s voters back parties outside the mainstream. It’s now up slightly against the pound at €1.118. M5S until recently supported a referendum on whether Italy, the eurozone’s third biggest economy, should withdraw from the currency bloc. And while it says the time for such a vote has passed, the rightwing League still wants Italy to pull out. The group formerly known as the Northern League is in Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition, which is projected to have won about 36% of the vote, and could form the next government. Our correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has some interesting detail on Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League (formerly the Northern League). As thoughts move towards negotiations over power and power sharing, journalist Lorezo Tondo has a very good question: Analysts say early projections from Italy’s election indicate that a hung parliament is the most likely outcome and that the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement’s strong showing may send a negative signal to financial markets. Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy told the Associated Press that building a majority in the Italian parliament “will be hard if not impossible,” and that tough negotiations were expected. The early projections had the 5-Star Movement as the strongest single party but a centre-right coalition comprising three parties was leading overall. Neither have enough of a lead to govern alone. Economic analyst Lorenzo Codogno, a former Treasury official, said the 5-Star’s showing was better than expected and that “financial markets are likely to take these figures negatively.” He warned that talks on forming a government would be “long and complex.” This seems slightly too soon, considering most balls are still in the air and no one is quite sure where they will land ... Here is a good summary of where we are now: Whatever way you look at it, the night has been a success for Matteo Salvini and his far-right La Liga party, which is projected to win about 16% of the vote. The Associated Press reports that a senior leader of the Five Star Movement has hailed the exit poll data as a “triumph” for his party. Addressing supporters early on Monday, Alessandro Di Battista said the anti-establishment movement was the leading party in Italy’s election. But the 30% support indicated by a RAI state TV exit poll is far short of the absolute majority needed to form Italy’s next government. M5S has officially vowed not to join any post-election coalitions. But Di Battista welcomed other parties to come talk as long as they use Five Star “methods” of “transparency” and “correctness” in political conduct. One possible partner is the anti-migrant League led by Matteo Salvini. He is jostling with Silvio Berlusconi for leadership of the centre-right bloc. Our Italian correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has wrapped up the developments so far. The main message is that Italian voters, who have traditionally been risk averse, are ready to ditch the big mainstream parties, and that the centre-left party headed by Matteo Renzi has had an abysmal election. About 50% of Italians who voted in the national elections supported populist parties that were once considered fringe, according to early election exit polls and voter projections. The most likely result of the national election seemed either a win by the centre right coalition headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the 81-year-old former prime minister, or a hung parliament in which populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the xenophobic Northern League – would have considerable influence in the creation of a new government. The exit polls showed Berlusconi’s coalition – which includes the Northern League – winning up to 36% of the vote, a result that could potentially help the billionaire media magnate clinch a fourth election victory under a complicated new Italian election law. Analysts were also poring over early data that showed a potential political upset: Matteo Salvini, the firebrand head of La Lega – as the League is now known – beating out Berlusconi within the centre-right coalition. Under a “gentleman’s agreement”, whoever emerges as the winner between the two will choose the next prime minister, if the coalition were to win a majority. Several election watchers are predicting a hung parliament and weeks of horse trading ahead. So, what exactly is the Five Star Movement? The anti-establisment party, started by comedian Beppe Grillo, burst on to the political scene in 2012 and has gone from strength to strength. The 69-year-old remains a figurehead, though he has handed over leadership to sharp-suited disciple Luigi Di Maio. Since its beginnings, the party has experienced a meteoric rise to prominence amid an outpouring of frustration and anger towards mainstream political parties. The movement calls itself “the first and only political party based on online participation and direct democracy.” Using an internet portal called Rousseau, M5S uses online votes of members to decide its policies, draft legislation and candidates. M5S is proposing a universal basic income of €780 ($963) a month for those living in poverty. M5S supports a hotchpotch of policies from across the political spectrum and has gained a reputation for political flip-flopping, leading their critics to brand them as immature and incompetent. The party had promised its supporters a referendum on leaving the eurozone, but has had a change of heart in recent months. M5S is currently projected to be the single party with the largest share of votes in the election. You can read more about its moment of truth here: The complicated picture in Italy has had a knock-on effect on the markets. Hello, it’s Bonnie here taking over the blog from Jon. As he said, nothing is certain at this stage and it won’t be for some time. But the broad theme based on projections is that it has been a good night so far for populist, anti-establishment parties and a bad one for the incumbent centre left. It looks like we’re in for a long night, and very probably several long weeks of coalition talks: I’m handing this live blog over now to my colleague Bonnie Malkin who will take you through to the European morning. Thanks for staying with us. “Better a pig than a fascist” reads the poster on display in a radical left community centre in Palermo, Sicily, where antifascists are awaiting the poll’s results, writes Lorenzo Tondo. Political violence has been increasing in Italy in recent weeks between fascists and leftwing activists, including an attack on one of the leaders of the far-right group Forza Nuova in Palermo. “Like in other countries across Europe, the right wing is taking over,” said Tommaso Mazzara, 30, a radical left activist in Palermo. “If M5S wins they are going to get the support of the right to stay in power. And that’s a huge problem.’’ Irene Russotto, 28, a medical student, said: “These exit polls are dramatic. If M5Stars wins the elections, I don’t think they are going to have the political experience to govern. The country is heading dangerously towards the radical right.’’ In Rome, Stephanie Kirchgaessner has been speaking to a top election expert, Giovanni Orsina from Luiss University, who cautions that it is far early to make any bold predictions and still believes a hung parliament is the most likely outcome. But Orsina believes the populists have done better than expected: What is quite clear is that the centre left were punished. Italy has made real gains in the economy and in unemployment, but voters did not buy it. At least, not a majority of them. The leader of the far-right La Liga, Matteo Salvini, has tweeted his initial reaction to the election results: “Thank you.” The state broadcaster Rai is venturing some early seat projections for the Italian parliament. They show Berlusconi’s rightwing alliance clearly ahead, followed by Five Star Movement and Renzi’s centre left trailing: But if a tie-up between the Five Star Movement and the far-right Lega looks potentially possible, so equally, as John Hooper points out, does an alliance between the centre left and M5S - even if the anti-establishment party has largely ruled out entering into coalitions with anybody else: Here is Guardian Rome bureau chief Stephanie Kirchgaessner’s first considered take on the confused, and confusing, early picture emerging from this election: About 50% of Italians who voted in national elections on Sunday supported populist parties that were once considered fringe, but victory still looked within reach for a coalition headed by Silvio Berlusconi, according to early election polls. While it was still far too early to predict whether the 81-year-old’s centre right coalition would have enough support to cross the threshold to victory, the exit polls indicated that the former prime minister could clinch a win following a campaign that promised a tough new approach to the migrant crisis. Regardless of the final outcome, the exit polls appeared to reveal a monumental shift in a majority of Italian voters, who have traditionally sided with big mainstream parties. The Five Star Movement, an anti-establishment party that was founded by former comedian Beppe Grillo and has voiced deep scepticism about the euro and Italy’s role in Nata, appeared to have won between 29-31% of the votes, according to the early exit polls. It seems one possible coalition - and not completely outlandish, given that it looks like around 50% of voters have cast their ballots for populist, anti-establishment and/or far-right parties - could be the anti-immigration La Lega, anti-establishment Five Star, and nationalist Brothers of Italy. That would shake things up. Another number to watch, should Berlusconi’s right-wing alliance win the day: will his major ally, La Lega, take more votes than Forza Italia? The exit polls, unreliable as we must stress they are, suggest that might be the case. And once again, a note of caution. The night is yet young, and a lot can and, most likely, will change: Hot takes on what to make of the early polls (bearing in mind exit polls last time around were up to seven points adrift of the final results), from Stephanie Kirschgaessner and the Economist’s John Hooper in Rome: In Ballarò, a mafia stronghold market area in the historic centre of Palermo, mostly populated by migrants, asylum seekers anxiously awaited the poll’s results, writes Lorenzo Tondo. The electoral campaign has been bad news for hundreds of young Africans, as the far-right parties have pledged to kick them out of the country. The campaign has been marked by episodes of racism and political violence unseen in Italy since the 1970s, including the shooting of six migrants. Former PM Silvio Berlusconi pledged to deport 600,000 illegal immigrants from Italy, a “social bomb ready to explode”. Abdul Rahman, 27, from Gambia, said if the right wins, “it is going to be a disaster for us. We came here for a new start. If they win it’s the begin of the end.’’ The campaign has been marked by episodes of racism and political violence unseen in Italy since the 1970s, including the shooting of six migrants, an act described by the nationalist perpetrator as revenge for the murder of an Italian woman, allegedly by a migrant. “I’ve just got my refugee status, and now I’m afraid to lose it,” said Mohammed, 24, from Egypt. Mamaodu, 20, from Senegal, added: “What do I expect from the elections if the right wins? I have my suitcase ready at home.” Italy’s national public broadcaster, Rai, has roughly comparable numbers in its first exit poll: M5S 29%-32% Forza Italia 13-16% Lega 13-16% PD 20.5-23.5% Polls have now closed in Italy’s general elections and the first exit polls show the anti-establishment Five Star Movement is the largest single party by a wide margin, with 28%-30% of the vote. Berlusconi’s Forza Italia is on 13.5%-15.5%, and the far-right League – his allies – on 12.3%-14.3% Exit polls are expected imminently. Here’s another pundit’s take on what to watch out for: To which is swiftly added: As soon as the exit polls are out, the calculating will begin. In theory, a wide variety of combinations are possible to form Italy’s next government, but as Stephanie Kirchgaessner notes, some are more possible than others. Bear in mind that the anti-establishment Five Star Movement has been forecast to finish as the largest single party on 25-27% of the vote, with the rightwing coalition between Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, the anti-immigration La Lega (League) and its smaller far-right allies on course to be the largest bloc - but still short of an outright majority. While it is widely expected to fare badly, Matteo Renzi’s centre-left Democratic party (PD) is still part of the calculations: With just over half an hour to go until polls close, a useful reminder from the Guardian’s Rome bureau chief Stephanie Kirchgaessner that Italy’s exit polls have not always been very reliable - and with a new electoral system to contend with, they may be even less so: Berlusconi was confronted with by a Femen activist as he arrived to cast his ballot at a Milan polling station earlier today, writes Angela Giuffrida. Named as Melodie Mousavi Nameghi, a 29-year-old from France, the topless protestor jumped on top of a table and shouted: “Berlusconi, your time has run out!” She was detained by police and charged with resisting arrest and disturbing an election. Berlusconi told reporters: It was an apparition, I don’t know what happened, it was a ghost… I don’t know, I didn’t see anything. So my time is up? Maybe she wanted to say I had reached the end of the queue. Just under an hour from the first exit polls, a brief reminder of who is standing and what they have - in some cases, you would have to say somewhat rashly - been promising Italy’s voters: Centre-right: Forza Italia, led by four-time prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, aims to introduce a “parallel currency” for domestic use, keeping the euro for international trade; have a single, flat rate income tax for companies and individuals; abolish housing, inheritance and road tax; double the minimum pension; introduce a minimum income of €1,000 a month for all and block new immigrant arrivals. Radical right: The League (formerly the Northern League), led by Matteo Salvini, would also introduce a parallel currency; abolish the EU’s fiscal compact; bring in a flat tax for all at 15%; allow earlier retirement; repatriate 100,000 illegal immigrants a year; and reopen Italy’s brothels. Brothers of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni, is a southern equivalent of the League with neofascist roots and similar policies. Anti-establishment: The Five Star Movement, led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, proposes a minimum monthly income of €780; raising the budget deficit; repealing 400 “useless” laws including labour and pension reforms to allow earlier retirement and make firing harder; raising taxes on energy companies and improving relations with Russia. Centre-left: The Democratic party, led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, proposes an increase in the minimum wage; negotiating to abolish the fiscal compact and raising the budget deficit to 3% of GDP so as to cut taxes and increase investment. Left: Free and Equal is led by Pietro Grasso, and is a new party uniting smaller groups that left Renzi’s Democratic party. It proposes repealing labour and pension reforms and boosting public spending. The 2018 elections are taking place under a new and untested electoral law that has created a mixed system in which just over a third of parliamentarians in the upper and lower house are elected by first-past-the-post (FPTP), and two-thirds by proportional representation (PR) via party lists. Voters get two slips, one for each house, and can put one cross on each that will count for both the FPTP and PR elements. Candidates can stand in an FPTP ballot in one constituency, but also be on a party PR list in up to five constituencies. As the former New York Times Rome bureau chief notes, the new ballot papers are leading to some confusion: Bad weather has hit Italy as hard as elsewhere in Europe over the past few days, but there’s at least one voter determined not to let snow get the better of her: Alberto Nardelli of Buzzfeed News reckons it’s going to be a long and probably eventful night, and he’s not the only one. One of the key things this Italian election is likely to test is Europe’s continuing appetite, after strong performances last year by France’s Front National and Germany’s AfD, for anti-establishment and nation-first populist parties: The views of a few of Italy’s many overseas voters, collected by Angela Giuffrida and Lorenzo Tondo: Alberto Montalbano, London: I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. I live in a country that voted to oust me, while my birthplace is swarming with populists talking tough about immigration. Italy has seen a large exodus of people in the past decade, not to mention the Italians who left in their millions in the last two centuries. What are they talking about? So I voted for the Democratic party. It’s not perfect, but it’s the only Europhile party left. For good or bad Europe is the future. Marco Barsotti, Nice: The elections will probably result in a difficult country to govern. But not having a strong government may be an advantage, as the economy would then be capable of developing without obstacles. Italy wouldn’t be alone in that respect: think about Belgium, which in 2010 had no government for 589 days without big problems. Luca Guerreschi, Berlin: Sometimes, Italians’ worst nightmares return: on TV, Berlusconi is the protagonist; on the streets, the fascists show their fierce face. I’m worried; I want to wake up to see a Jacobin, communist Italy - this is the Italy that those who fought in the resistance wanted, and it’s what we want too. The leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant League (formerly the Northern League) has been tweeting confidently that the political aspirations of centre-left Democratic party leader Matteo Renzi will soon have melted like the snow: Guardian correspondent Angela Giuffrida has this - as she notes - rather out of focus shot of a Rome polling station earlier this evening where voters spent upwards of two hours queuing to cast their ballots: Turnout at 7pm in Italy was estimated at around 58%, relatively low historically. As La Repubblica journalist Antonello Guerrero explains, that could translate into a final turnout of less than 70% - lower than in 2006, 2008 and 2013. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage as Italy goes to the polls in one of its most uncertain general elections in many years. Partly, that uncertainty is because voting is taking place under a new and as yet untested electoral law. Partly, it’s because as many as 30% of voters were still undecided this week. And partly it’s because polls have long predicted the election will will result in a hung parliament, leading to possibly months of haggling to form a new coalition government. Italy’s 46 million voters are fed up with a political class seemingly unable to do anything about Italy’s persistent problems: high unemployment, sluggish economic growth, corruption and a seemingly unending migration crisis. Their vote could re-establish the veteran former prime minister and billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, 81, as the dominant force in Italian politics (even though he is barred from standing himself because of a tax fraud conviction). It could show surging support for two populist parties, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (likely to emerge as the largest single party), and the far-right, nativist La Lega, a key member of Berlusconi’s rightwing coalition. Polls in Europe’s fourth largest economy opened at 7am and will close at 11pm (2200 GMT), with early exit polls expected soon after. Final results are not likely until early morning. Stay with us for the latest news and reaction - including on-the-spot reports from Guardian writers Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Angela Giuffrida and Lorenzo Tondo – through the night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/05/paloma-faith-review-first-direct-arena-leeds","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T10:17:33Z","webTitle":"Paloma Faith review – big-lunged retro soul with a peppering of politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/05/paloma-faith-review-first-direct-arena-leeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/05/paloma-faith-review-first-direct-arena-leeds","fields":{"headline":"Paloma Faith review – big-lunged retro soul with a peppering of politics","bodyText":"‘My mum’s worried that I’m going to offend people and no one will ever go to my gigs again,” chuckles Paloma Faith, explaining why her tiptoe into political music on recent No 1 album, The Architect, isn’t overly reflected in her live show. There’s no place in the setlist for Politics of Hope, the narrative by the Guardian columnist Owen Jones from the album. Nor – despite Theresa May’s grand speech on Brexit hours earlier – does the singer make any reference whatsoever to the brassily anthemic Guilty (“I’m living in my worst fears / Begging you back through tears”), apparently about a remorseful leave voter. However, there is far more political content than we’d generally get from a mainstream pop star whose big-lunged retro soul ticks the same boxes as Adele and Amy Winehouse. Faith explains how the ostensibly breezy pop Kings and Queens was inspired by her black childhood sweetheart’s experiences of police racial stereotyping; she refreshingly employs a female rhythm section and peppers her cheery Carry On banter with fiendish little snatches of polemic (“We’re all being brainwashed to believe that we’re isolated, but we’re not”). There’s a more direct dollop of activism when she explains why she thinks the third global war has already started, and dedicates the first line of the song WW3 (“What kind of man gets a thrill from the life he’s taken?”) to Donald Trump. “Please dance even if you don’t agree with me,” she urges, although the audience seem more enthused by guitarist Sam Lewis’s ear-splitting fret-melting than the prospect of marching on the White House. Faith, a half-Spanish, Hackney-born child of a one-parent family, couldn’t get away with rampaging on brandishing a copy of Socialist Worker. However, it’s to her credit that she can slip slivers of protest music into what is otherwise a big, staple – if occasionally kooky – arena show, with theatrical bells and whistles. The 36-year-old trained contemporary dancer and former burlesque performer makes a grand entrance through a trapdoor beneath what looks like a giant pile of ice. She sports a magnificently ludicrous pink-sequined caped creation and drapes herself across a grand piano. While some of her more mannered speaking-singing sounds as if she’s chewing on a gobstopper and there’s an occasional hint of Butlin’s, big soul stompers such as Picking Up the Pieces and Can’t Rely on You get a seated audience on their feet. Crybaby – Lisa Stansfield-type smooth soul – and the fizzy rhythms of Changing, her 2014 hit with drum’n’bass duo Sigma, are the only significant departures from the formula, but Faith’s endearing persona stops things getting too generic. The recent mother-of-one introduces My Body (a timely song about body image) with graphic but amusing anecdotes about giving birth by emergency C-section (“19 hours later they just cut it open!”) , while her admission that she received “hate tweets” triggers pantomime-style boos. Her wish to “spread an epidemic of kindness” – handily introducing I’ll Be Gentle (with BB Bones capably filling in for John Legend) – could easily sound trite. Still, her suggestion that individual acts of compassion can spark wider change gets a wave of applause. No one will leave here to storm parliament, but as she says, tiny ripples can eventually make a difference. At AECC BHGE Arena, Aberdeen, 5 March. Box office: 0844-477 9000.

Astori was staying in a hotel with his team-mates ahead of their game on Sunday away at Udinese when he passed away. The defender won 14 caps for Italy in a career which started at AC Milan, although he never played a first team game for the club before being sold to Cagliari. “Fiorentina are profoundly shaken and forced to announce that their captain Davide Astori has died,” read the statement. “For this terrible and delicate situation, and above all out of respect for his family, we appeal to the sensitivity of the media.” The match against Udinese has been postponed following the announcement of the player’s death. It was later confirmed that all Serie A games were to be postponed out of respect for Astori. Former Cagliari team-mate Radja Nainggolan wrote on Instagram: “A great player, but even more than that, a great person. How many battles we were in together at Cagliari, then found each other again at Roma I still can’t believe it. My thoughts are with his family and those close to him. RIP.” During his career Astori played spent time on loan at Roma and Fiorentina before joining the latter club two years ago on a permanent basis after six years as a Cagliari player. Astori was a member of the Italy squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, scoring his only international goal in the third-place playoff against Uruguay, which Italy won on penalties. Former Roma manager Rudi Garcia tweeted: “The news of the untimely death of my former player Davide Astori pains me. A professional and exemplary guy. I am close to the family and his loved ones.

The number of unlicensed raves in London, often held in warehouses or abandoned buildings, has nearly doubled since 2016. Plans for 133 unlicensed raves were identified by the Metropolitan police in 2017, up from 70 the previous year, according to figures obtained by a freedom of information request carried out by the Sunday Telegraph. One explanation for the rise is the rapid decline in the number of traditional venues, with more than half of all London clubs shutting down between 2005 and 2015, according to the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR). Since 2015, the number of licensed hospitality premises has dropped by 3% across the UK. Among the casualties have been Plastic People, Cable, and Dance Tunnel in London, The Arches in Glasgow, and Sankeys in Manchester. The rising cost of drinks could also be putting revellers off nightclubs. Going to a pub is becoming an unaffordable luxury, according to a report published in September by consumer rights group Camra, publisher of the Good Pub Guide. DJ and author Bill Brewster, who was one of the first resident DJs at legendary nightclub Fabric, said that it was not surprising that illegal raves are becoming more popular. The gentrification of inner cities is making it “tougher for night clubs to open or continuing existing” because of complaints about the noise and the night clubs that have stayed open are forced to charge clubbers more in order to stay open because of increasing rent, he said. Brewster said this is putting young people off going to nightclubs and leading them to look for alternative places to party. “A lot of young people are looking for something a little bit transgressive. I think it’s innate in teenagers and people in their early twenties to want to do stuff they’re not supposed to do. And even though raves are illegal, most of them don’t do much harm apart from giving a few people a poor night’s sleep.” He added: “In an ideal world, there would be lots of places for night clubs to open that don’t disturb the neighbours but we live in a flawed world and it’s becoming harder to throw parties in city centres.” In the last three years, police have introduced new processes for tackling the planned but unlicensed music events and have begun using covert tactics to try to stay one step ahead of organisers. DCI John Oldham, the head of crime at the Met’s public order command, said: “Using covert tactics, we try and understand who the organiser is and where they live. We’ve woken up to the problem and put out a much higher intelligence requirement to identify these things.” Once events are identified police will instigate disruption tactics to try to discourage the event from going ahead. If unsuccessful, road blocks are put in place and dog units and riot police sent in to break up events. Undercover “drug users” will also be used to try and identify drug dealers. “If you are dealing with something like drug dealing you need to put someone in to buy the drugs or to pretend to be a drug user,” Oldham said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/04/has-the-time-come-for-a-wealth-tax-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T12:45:48Z","webTitle":"Has the time come for a wealth tax in the UK? | Richard Partington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/04/has-the-time-come-for-a-wealth-tax-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/04/has-the-time-come-for-a-wealth-tax-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"Has the time come for a wealth tax in the UK?","bodyText":"Tax may as well be a four letter word. Politicians have found little public support for raising taxes over the years. Think of the poll tax riots, the furore over Ed Miliband’s mansion tax or George Osborne’s “omnishambles” budget and the pickle he was in over the humble pasty. Usually the most resistance is reserved for wealth taxes, not least for their doom-laden names given by the media: no voter wants to pay for death tax or dementia tax. Denis Healey, the Labour chancellor misquoted for wanting to “squeeze the rich until the pips squeak”, came closest, with a 1974 election wealth tax pledge but was forced to backtrack. The pips would have squeaked a little too loud for comfort. Fast forward and the time has come to make the case for greater wealth taxes, given our emerging economic realities, demographic shifts and growing levels of inequality. The alternative is a country bereft of welfare support, or wallowing in ever-greater mountains of debt. The latest politician to push for a change of tone may raise a few eyebrows. It isn’t John McDonnell or Jeremy Corbyn, but David Willetts, the Conservative peer who was a universities minister under David Cameron. Lord Willetts will attempt to make the case for greater wealth taxes in a speech on Monday. The reasons are clear. The public purse will be out of pocket by roughly £160bn by the mid-2060s as the number of people over 65 grows by almost a third, while the working age population is expected to only increase by about 2%. The government’s own forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, reckons healthcare spending will need to almost double from 6.9% of GDP in the early 2020s to 12.6% by the mid-2060s because of demographic shift alone. More people will become net beneficiaries of the welfare state than net contributors could support, according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation, which Willetts chairs. That is unsustainable; regardless of how efficiently the state spends our taxes and which party is in power. |The divide between rich and poor is growing and it’s proving increasingly difficult to earn your way to riches. Wealth taxes are being considered as a result, with work also being done by the Institute for Public Policy and Research expected to be published next month. The level of wealth in Britain – including property, cash savings, shares and pensions – rose by 15% in the two years to June 2016 to a record £12.8tn. But that vast stockpile is unevenly spread: the top 10% of households owned almost half, while the poorest fifth’s overall wealth decline in real terms. The divisions of wealth are far starker than differences in pay. According to the Office for National Statistics, the top 10% of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10th of households have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile. Barring great luck or skilled entrepreneurship – in itself something easier to embark upon for the children of the wealthy – it’s nigh-on impossible to earn your way to riches. Nowhere is the myth of the plucky grafter better torn apart than in a new book by the writer James Bloodworth, who spent six months living and working in low-wage Britain for companies like Amazon and Uber. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may be the richest man in the world, but his workers in Warrington, Rugeley, Swansea and elsewhere may never join the uber-elite for all the hours they toil. Bloodworth was paid the equivalent of £12,740 a year to work gruelling shifts packing boxes full of books and DVDs. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates pay of £17,100 is needed just to achieve a minimum standard of living. The trouble would be implementing the changes required. Polling shows wealth taxes are viewed as the most unfair way for the government to raise money, even though the accumulation of wealth is often passive – particularly for property owners. Part of the problem is trust in government to spend taxes well. Labour has a particular issue given Tory attacks since the financial crisis – labelling the mess as “Labour’s recession” caused by profligate overspending. It was time for collective belt-tightening in penance for the excesses of the past. “We will not burden our children and grandchildren,” ran the Tory mantra. Now a former Conservative cabinet member will say the same to justify raising taxes, rather than cutting spending. Willets will argue the time has come for baby boomers to reach into their pockets to benefit younger generations. The age of tax cuts is over, he will say. Instead, politics will be about who pays more and how much. “We need a well-funded welfare state capable of helping us in our old age and we should help pay for it, rather than expecting our hard-pressed children and grandchildren to bear the whole burden,” he is expected to say. Given his time in government included hiking student tuition fees up to £9,250 a year, he should expect accusations of hypocrisy. But Labour would do better to use his message as a catalyst for consensus building. Britain already has some versions of wealth taxes that could be reformed. Council tax, still reliant on property values as they were in 1991, would be the obvious place to start. Inheritance tax is another. The bulk of money left each year in inheritances has more than doubled in past 20 years, and will more than double again over the next two decades. There is a danger that greater wealth taxes could impoverish those who are asset rich but cash poor. Not all those living on millionaire’s row are actually millionaires – unless they sell and move somewhere cheaper. So the design of any increase in wealth taxation would be key. The French economist Thomas Pikketty has argued that without change, inheritance will eventually matter a lot more when determining a person’s life chances, as it did in ancient societies. Past wealth, he says, will tend to dominate new wealth – and successors will tend to dominate labour earners. The time now is not for turning the clock back. Instead, the time for a wealth tax has come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T02:12:21Z","webTitle":"'Maybe we'll give that a shot': Donald Trump praises Xi Jinping's power grab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china","fields":{"headline":"'Maybe we'll give that a shot': Donald Trump praises Xi Jinping's power grab","bodyText":"Donald Trump has celebrated Xi Jinping’s bid to shepherd China back into an era of one-man dictatorship, suggesting the United States might one day “give that a shot”. China’s authoritarian leader took power in 2012 and had been expected to rule until 2023. However, last week it emerged that Xi would attempt to use an annual meeting of China’s parliament, which kicks off on Monday morning, to abolish presidential term limits by changing the Chinese constitution. Liberals have condemned the power grab, which will almost certainly be approved by members of the National People’s Congress who have flocked to Beijing for the two-week summit. Experts say the amendment paves the way for Xi to be China’s ruler-for-life. “This is a critical moment in China’s history,” Cheng Li, a prominent expert in elite Chinese politics who has criticised the move, told AP. However, Trump offered a more positive assessment during a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he hosted Xi last April. “He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great,” the US president reportedly told Republican donors. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day,” Trump added, according to CNN which obtained a recording of what it described as an upbeat, joke-filled speech. Even before Trump’s controversial remarks Chinese activists and dissidents had voiced disappointment over the lack of criticism from western governments and leaders. “This kind of reaction is very short-sighted,” said Zhou Fengsuo, a democracy activist who has lived in exile since fleeing the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. “This kind of permanent leadership never ends well … history tells us it will not just be a Chinese issue, it will have a deep and profound influence on the world ... [China] will see a lot of uncertainty and likely conflict because of this.” The topic of Xi’s power grab is so politically sensitive within China that nearly all of the academics approached by the Guardian for comment in the lead-up to Monday’s congress declined to talk. Xing Hua, the only Chinese scholar who agreed to be interviewed, claimed foreign journalists were “over-interpreting” and “over-emphasising” the move. “I hope western media can view this proposal in a comprehensive and objective manner,” said Xing, from the China Institute of International Studies, a state-run think tank. However, western experts say they are convinced Xi’s plan is to rule for many years to come. “He’s now 64. So he has got at least 20 years [left in him] … that would take him almost to the centenary of the establishment of the People’s Republic [in 2049],” said Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University China expert. MacFarquhar said China’s “supreme ruler” was seeking to change China’s constitution rather than simply ignoring it, so as to avoid looking like “some sort of Banana Republic”. But the effect was the same: “He’s signalling: ‘I’m going to stay on forever.’” “Dictators are always arrogant,” said Qiao Mu, a journalism professor who moved into exile in response to Xi’s reign. “It’s a disaster for political civilization.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/mar/05/may-commons-statement-brexit-housing-speech-trump-rejects-mays-call-for-him-to-back-away-from-plans-for-trade-war-over-steel-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T18:40:21Z","webTitle":"Brexit: Hammond says airlines won't be able to schedule flights for next year unless transition agreed before April - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/05/may-commons-statement-brexit-housing-speech-trump-rejects-mays-call-for-him-to-back-away-from-plans-for-trade-war-over-steel-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/05/may-commons-statement-brexit-housing-speech-trump-rejects-mays-call-for-him-to-back-away-from-plans-for-trade-war-over-steel-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: Hammond says airlines won't be able to schedule flights for next year unless transition agreed before April - Politics live","bodyText":"Theresa May has suggested that the UK is looking at the US/Canada border for lessons that could help to provide a solution to the Irish border problem. (See 5.20pm.) As Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton points out, Ireland has already rejected this option. Hammond, the chancellor, told MPs that the UK and the EU needed to agree a transition deal by April because otherwise airlines would not be able to schedule flights with certainty for April next year. He told the European scrutiny committee: The implementation period is in our view very much in the interest of both sides - to create some certainty to allow businesses to plan - to deal with immediate pressing issues. For example - airlines will need to know on April 1 whether they can safely schedule flights in April, 2019. There are lots of practical issues that are going to become very problematic across the continent of Europe unless we agree this implementation deal. He said that, once a transition deal is agreed, the government would stop spending money preparing for a “no deal” Brexit in March 2019. He said: As and when it becomes clear that we can discount as reasonably unlikely any of the options - for example, once we reach an implementation period deal - I would expect that we would then be able to stand down planning for a no deal exit in 2019. He said it was possible that the UK and the EU could agree a transition but then fail to reach a deal on a long-term partnership. The government was making contingency plans for this, he said. (This would mean the transition ending in 2020 or early 2021, with the UK then having to trade with the EU on WTO terms.) Hammond said: In terms of the contingency planning that is being done, it is to cover all possible eventualities. One possible, although perhaps rather unlikely, eventuality is that we reach agreement on an implementation period but then fail to reach agreement on a long-term partnership agreement. I hope that won’t be the case, but it would be right that we covered that as one of the potential outcomes. Asked if this meant the transition could be extended, Hammond said the government had “no plans” for this. He said: We have no plans to make provision for extension, and I expect that, because of what the European Union has said, the structure of the implementation period will have a fixed end-date in the agreement that we reach with the European Union. He said the government had so far spent about £700m preparing for brexit. That was from the £3bn set aside for spending on Brexit planning in 2018/19 and 2019/20, he said. The £3n was for 2018/19 and 2019/20 and I expect to announce shortly the allocation of funding for the 2018/19 share of that amount. It’s being spent on ensuring that we are prepared for a full range of outcomes. Some of it is being spent on preparations for a ‘no deal’ exit in March 2019. May told MPs that her approach to President Trump was more likely to get a good deal for the UK than Jeremy Corbyn’s. When questioned if a good trade deal could be reached with the Trump administration after in the light of its decision to impose big tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, she said: I spoke to President Trump about this yesterday. Can I just say to you that we’re much more likely to get a positive response by engaging with the United States of America rather than by standing on the sidelines sniping and shouting at them, as you always do. May said the NHS would be “not for sale” in future trade talks with the US. In response to a question from Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, she replied: I’m absolutely clear that as we look to negotiate a trade deal with the United States of America the National Health Service will remain as it is today, it will remain free at the point of the use - the National Health Service is not for sale. We continue to stand by the principles of the NHS and we’re very clear about that when we come to negotiating a trade deal with the United States. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Earlier, in Brussels, a Sinn Fein team were meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. Hammond says an implementation period is very much in the interests of both sides. For example, on 1 April airlines will need to know if they can schedule flights for April 2019. He says he hopes there will be strong support for it in parliament and in the EU. Agreeing a withdrawal agreement will be a big responsibility for parliamentarians, he says. He says business will need that reassurance. Sir Bill Cash, the committee chairman, says he attended a meeting where a lot of MEPs expressed the view that there was not “a cat in hell’s chance” of the European parliament signing off on the kind of agreement the UK wants. Hammond says he has had meetings with people in the European parliament who have expressed the opposite view. And that’s it. The hearing is over. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock puts it to Hammond that it would be simpler to go into Efta (the European free trade association). Hammond says joining Efta would involve accepting full freedom of movement. That is something the government has ruled out, he says. Q: But the EEA agreement allows the application of an emergency brake halting free movement? Only in narrow circumstances, says Hammond. And he says, when Norway considered using these powers, they decided against using them, because the consequences were too extreme. In the European scrutiny committee David Jones, the former Brexit minister, asks Hammond to confirm there is no question of extending the transition. Hammond says the government has said the transition period will have to be fixed. The EU has said the same, he says. He speculates on what might happen if the UK and the EU agreed a transition deal, but then failed to agree a final trade deal. This is from my colleague Anushka Asthana. Back in the European scrutiny committee, in response to a question from the SNP Philippa Whitford, Hammond said he understood well the importance of the border issue in Ireland. He said that in the 1970s he crossed the border himself twice a week, and he has no desire to go back to the kind of border controls that were in place then. Whitford then asked Hammond about MPs how have called for the Good Friday agreement to be scrapped. Hammond said that people should ignore those voices and listen to what the prime minister says about this instead. This is what Theresa May said in the Commons when Labour’s Emma Reynolds asked her to give an example of a border between two countries not in a customs union that does not have checks. May replied: There are many examples of different arrangements for customs around the rest of the world. Indeed we are looking at those, including for example the border between the United States and Canada. May suggests UK looking at US/Canada border for lessons that could be applied to Ireland. But later Jenny Chapman, a shadow Brexit minister, told May there were “guns and armed custom guards” at the US/Canada border. “Surely that’s not what [the prime minister] has in mind?”, Chapman asked. May replied: We are looking at the border arrangements in a number of countries around the world. This is something that has been picked up within the European parliament and it has been made clear that there are innovative solutions that can deliver exactly what we’re talking about. She was referring there to the European parliament report (pdf) that Labour’s Kate Hoey asked about earlier. (See 4.21pm.) But this report, Smart Border 2.0 - Avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland for Customs control and the free movement of persons, does not envisage the removal of all border checks. And it sets out procedures that would require infrastructure at the border, something that May has ruled out. Here is a passage from the summary of the report explaining how a “normal border crossing between Ireland and Northern Ireland in a smart border 2.0 concept” might operate. It says: A company in Norther Ireland needs to move goods to a client in the UK. The company is pre-registered in the AEO [authorised economic operator] database (AEO status or application for AEO Trusted Trader), a simplified export/import declaration is sent, including a unique consignment reference number. The transporting company is pre-registered in the AEO database and the driver of the truck is pre-registered in the Trusted Commercial Travellers database. The simplified export/import declaration is automatically processed and risk assessed. At the border the mobile phone of the driver is recognized/identified and a release-note is sent to the mobile phone with a permit to pass the border that opens the gate automatically when the vehicle is identified, potentially by an automatic number plate registration system. A post-import supplementary declaration is submitted in the import country within the given time period. Potential controls can be carried out by mobile inspection units from EU or UK with right of access to facilities and data, as required. Sir Bill Cash, the committee chairman, says the EU draft text of the withdrawal treaty is a hybrid. At some points it treats the UK as a third country. At other points it treats the UK as a member states. If that is not cherry picking, he does not know what is, Cash says. At the European scrutiny committee David Jones, the Conservative former Brexit minister, asks what the government’s legal text of its fallback plan for Ireland look like. Hammond says the government has not produced a legal text. It is not clear to the government that it needs a legal text. He says the government hopes to make progress developing “plan A” - its preferred means of addressing the Irish issue (through an overall new trade relationship). Here is the start of the Press Association story about Theresa May’s statement. Jeremy Corbyn claimed Theresa May has “barely papered over the cracks” in her party as the prime minister reiterated her plea to “get on with” Brexit. The Labour leader warned there has been “20 wasted months” since the EU referendum in which the “arrogance” of some of the cabinet who said it would be the “easiest deal in history” has turned into “debilitating infighting”. He added the PM had admitted her Brexit plan will reduce UK access to European markets and “leave people worse off”. His attack came as the prime minister appeared before MPs to repeat Brexit commitments which she outlined in a keynote speech last week. Speaking in the Commons, Corbyn said: “We’ve seen set piece speech after set piece speech and yet the prime minister still cannot bring clarity to these negotiations and still cannot bring certainty to British businesses or workers. “The prime minister’s speech on Friday promised to unite the nation, but it barely papered over the cracks in her own party.” Corbyn said May offered “no real solution” over Northern Ireland, and instead “rehashed an already discredited government idea” to use a mix of technology and goodwill to ensure no hard border. The opposition leader added: “Doesn’t the prime minister understand, this isn’t just about cross-border paperwork and trade - there is also an issue of maintaining the social peace that has endured for 20 years.” He asked May to condemn Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s “ridiculous remarks” over the Irish border. Corbyn went on: “We’ve had 20 months of promises, soundbites and confusion. “However people feel about Brexit, it’s clear to them this government is nowhere near delivering a good deal for Britain.” May, in her reply, said the government is “focused on making a success of Brexit” and delivering for the British people. She added: “But Labour has nothing to offer. They voted against moving the negotiations on in the European parliament. “They twice voted against the bill which delivers Brexit in this parliament. Now they’ve gone back on what they promised over the customs union. “And over a week ago the shadow chancellor [John McDonnell] said Labour would keep all options open on whether or not to have a second referendum. “This government and this party is clear: There will be no second referendum. We’re delivering for the British people and we’re going to make a success of it.” Hammond told the European scrutiny committee that £35bn to £39bn was the central estimate of what the UK would have to pay the EU as it left. He accepted this was based on the assumption that the transition would end on 31 December 2020. That is when the EU’s current budget comes to an end. If the transition was longer, the UK would not be treated as being a full contributor to the next budget, he said. Hammond was also asked about the cost to the UK, in terms of lost tax receipts, from leaving the EU. He said the Treasury had looked at this, but that it would not be publishing its figures now because that would undermine the negotiations. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is now giving evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee. I will keep monitoring May’s statement, but for the moment I will focus on Hammond. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter and committee chairs, asks the first question. Q: Do you agree that the UK parliament will have the power to diverge at the end of the transition period on regulations relating to financial services? For example, on Mifid (the markets in financial instruments directive) II. Hammond says parliament is sovereign. But it may choose to agree arrangements “of an enduring nature”. He says parliament may not make decisions on every case. It may decide a framework. But that would be subject to the idea parliament could change its mind. He says no parliament can bind its successors. He says the EU understand this. Hammond says, although the UK may reach what is intended as an “enduring” agreement with the EU on alignment, a future parliament could always change its mind. In response to a question from Labour’s Emma Reynolds, who asked May to give an example of a border between two countries without a customs union without border checks, May said the US/Canada border was one that that UK was looking at closely. As the Spectator’s James Forsyth points out, that is a border with infrastructure. Labour’s Chris Leslie says last year May promised that the UK would keep the same benefits with regard to trade after Brexit. Does she regret that? May says that she wants to get a good deal. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw asks about Trump’s tariff policies, and the FT report saying the US will offer the UK a worse deal on airlines access. Have they made May reconsider the wisdom of leaving the single market? May says it would be a mistake to have the EU deciding UK trade policy. Bradshaw was referring to this story in the Financial Times (paywall). This is how it starts. The US is offering Britain a worse “Open Skies” deal after Brexit than it had as an EU member, in a negotiating stance that would badly hit the transatlantic operating rights of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. British and American negotiators secretly met in January for the first formal talks on a new air services deal, aiming to fill the gap created when Britain falls out of the EU-US open skies treaty after Brexit, according to people familiar with talks. The talks were cut short after US negotiators offered only a standard bilateral agreement. These typically require airlines to be majority owned and controlled by parties from their country of origin. Such limits would be problematic for British carriers as they have large foreign shareholdings. Under existing arrangements, UK-based airlines are covered by the “Open Skies” treaty that requires them to be majority EU owned. Kate Hoey, the Labour Brexiter, asks May if she has read the report (pdf) to a European parliament committee setting out a solution to the Irish border problem. May says she is aware of it. She has asked her officials to look at it. She thinks it could provide a basis for a solution. Sir Nicholas Soames, a Conservative, asks if the commission have full details of what the UK wants. Can talks proceed apace? May says the EU now knows what she wants. Her message is, lets get on with it. Emma Little-Pengelly, the DUP MP, thanks May for her response to the “disgraceful” EU attempt to interfere in Northern Ireland. May restates her commitment to avoiding a hard border in Ireland. Labour’s Pat McFadden says May has admitted there will be an economic cost to Brexit. What is it? And who will pay it? May says life will be different after Brexit. While Labour is just focused on the EU, the goverment wants good trade deals with other countries too. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, asks if May think it was right of the European commission to behave in such a “high-handed manner”, proposing something unacceptable to the UK. May says the EU was entitled to publish its document. She says she said it was unacceptable. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says after 20 months May has at least achieved a trade deal - with her own cabinet. Would the NHS be covered by a trade deal with the US? May says the NHS is not for sale. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, asks May if she agrees that Labour U-turns betray their votes, and the country. May agrees. They are consistently saying one thing one moment, and another thing they next. And they would not deliver proper Brexit, she says. Labour’s Yvette Cooper says there would be customs checks and rules of origins checks under May’s plan. And in Ireland she has proposed that 80% of firms should be free from checks. But there would be an increased incentive to smuggling, in an area where smuggling is linked to paramilitary activity. So why is she still proposing this approach? May says the 80% figure relates to just one of the customs options. If the UK were in a or the customs union, it would not be able to follow an independent trade policy, she says. Anna Soubry, the pro-European Conservative, says no one can doubt May’s determination to get a good deal. May was frank about the drawbacks of any deal. There will be administrative costs. Will May keep MPs informed of the administrative costs of leaving? May says she will make information available to MPs. Some information has been given already. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks May to give a guarantee that manufactured goods and agricultural products will be able to cross the Irish border without checks, control or infrastructure after Brexit. May says there will be no return to a hard border in Ireland. She says she wants a free flow of goods and people. John Redwood, the Tory Brexiter, asks May for an assurance that the UK will be able to leave the EU with or without a deal. May says the government continues to work on all scenarios. May is responding to Blackford. She says there are only nine SNP MPs in the chamber today. That is fewer than the number of Scottish Conservative MPs. She says Blackford has a “tunnel vision”, assuming only one approach to a customs union or the single market is possible. She says, from Scotland’s point of view, the most important thing is to be part of the UK. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the government is still struggling to write down its wish list. The EU published a draft treaty last week; May just produced rhetoric. There is no solution to the Irish border problem, he says. He says Scotland’s voice was not heard when the cabinet committee discussed this at Chequers. But SNP MPs will speak up for Scotland, he says. He says the SNP will settle for nothing less than continued membership of the single market and the customs union. Scotland is a European nation, and it intends to stay one. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, congratulates May on her speech. He says bringing back control is crucial. Will May tell the EU that cake exists to be eaten and cherries exist to be picked? May says Duncan Smith is right about how people voted to take back control. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she spoke to Trump yesterday. She say she is far more likely to get a good deal from the US engaging with Trump than criticising him from the sidelines, like Corbyn. She says Corbyn is clear he is opposed to state aid rules, which would be central to a free trade deal. Corbyn does not believe in fair competition, she says. She says Labour does not know what its position is on free movement. One frontbencher said free movement would end under Labour. But Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said “easy movement” would continue, she says. She says Labour has nothing to offer. It voted against moving on the talks in the European parliament. And it twice voted against the EU withdrawal bill in this parliament, she says. Corbyn turns to Ireland. May said in her speech that a customs partnership could be the solution, he says. But he says David Davis himself described this as “blue skies thinking”. He invites May to condemn what Boris Johnson said about the Irish border last week. He says there are welcome things about the speech; May has abandoned her red line on the role of the European court of justice. (May is shaking her head.) Corbyn asks May if she will now back Labour’s policy on the customs union. He ends by saying the government is nowhere near delivering a good Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn says 20 months have passed since the referendum, and a year since the triggering of article 50. Some of the cabinet said this would be the easiest deal in history. Yet instead we have seen debilitating infighting. He says the speech barely papered over the cracks in May’s own party. The EU published a detailed legal document on Wednesday. Where is anything comparable from the UK government? This government’s shambolic approach to Brexit risks taking us down a dangerous road. He says May risks tying the UK to EU rules that back privatisation (ie, state aid rules). Was David Davis wrong when he said Brexit would deliver “the exact same benefits” of the customs union and the single market? If he was wrong, why has it taken so long to say so? Does May want tariff-free access to the single market? Does she still think a good trade deal can be reached with the Trump presidency? Corbyn says it is possible to retain the benefits of the single market and the customs union. But the cabinet is being held hostage by people who want a hard Brexit, he says. They are committed to an ideological crusade which would shrink the state and begin a race to the bottom. Corbyn says May said in her speech that there was no support in the UK for a race to the bottom on standards. But Liam Fox has said current employment rights are unsustainable, Andrea Leadsom has proposed getting rid of rights, Boris Johnson has described regulations as “backbreaking” and the Brexit department has said there are advantages to be gained from deregulation. He says there clearly is a political constituency for deregulation. It is called the cabinet. May says she is confident the UK can set an example to the world. That generate a lot of Labour jeering. The Times’s Patrick Kidd is getting so bored he’s taken to studying Boris Johnson’s hair. This is from BuzzFeed’s Emily Ashton. May is still giving her statement. It really is just a condensed version of the Mansion House speech. The Mail’s Tim Sculthorpe thinks she’s wasting our time. Theresa May is making her statement now. She says the December agreement struck at the end of phase one of the talks is being turned into a draft legal text. They are close to agreeing a transition, she says. Now they must turn their attention to the future relationship. She is now summarising what she said in her speech. Theresa May will shortly be making a Commons statement about the Brexit policy she set out in her Mansion House speech on Friday. Here is our report of the speech. And here is the full text of the speech. May is not expected to announce anything new in her statement. But she may well give new insights into her thinking when she takes questions. (It is not unusual for almost 100 MPs to get called for a statement like this; May is likely to be on her feet for a good two hours or more.) It will also be interesting to see how MPs respond. On Fridays Conservative MPs, regardless of whether they were on the hard or soft end of the Brexit spectrum, were almost all supportive. But, as Matthew d’Ancona wrote in his Guardian column this morning, the truce is unlikely to last. Garrett Carr, who has written a book about walking along the Irish border, has written a lovely article for Guardian Opinion about what it’s like, and why border controls would cause so much difficulty. Here’s an extract. Halfway into my journey I arranged to meet a friend in a border-town cafe; he was driving up from Dublin. At our table, with other customers around, I was appalled by his unguarded statements and his loud voice – things that had never bothered me before. I realised that I had become acclimatised to the borderland’s restraint and political sensitivity. Please note: it is sensitivity as opposed to secrecy. There are people carrying secrets certainly – I’m sure I met some – but for most the evasiveness comes from a lifetime of avoiding sore points. One evening I walked into a bar sited directly on the line of the border. I could pay for my pint in pounds or euros. A sign above the counter read “Please do not discuss politics”. Along the border two neighbours could be friends for 30 years and never once discuss how they vote. They know better. You might think this is a shortfall in their relationship; something for ever held back that means they are not truly friends. You might have a point. This highlights one of the great treasures of the Good Friday agreement; it moved the conversations on. You did not have to pick one of two sides any more. Most people moved towards areas of consensus, the value of peace and an open border. “Sure there is no border any more,” one farmer told me. Strictly speaking this was untrue, and he was actually pointing towards the border at the time, where it ran with a river along the bottom of his field, but it was true enough that he could make the claim with confidence. The border is not there if your identity prefers it absent. On the other hand, if your identity depends on the border, then it is there for you. And here’s the article. Shelter, the housing charity, has welcomed Theresa May’s housing speech. In a statement its CEO, Polly Neate, said: We welcome today’s speech for recognising the scale of our housing emergency, and the fact our current housebuilding system is clearly not fit for purpose. The prime minister has shown the government is willing to take on developers and challenge them over unfair practices that deny communities the affordable homes they need. We’ve been campaigning long and hard on viability assessments – a tool exploited by developers to wriggle out of building their fair share of affordable homes – so we’re pleased the government is listening, and taking steps to close the loophole. But, like the LGA (see 9.41am), Shelter is also calling for councils to be given the power to borrow more money to fund new house building. The Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has ruled out Ireland holding a specific negotiation with the UK on a solution to the Irish border problem after Brexit. (See 10.58am.) President Trump has used Twitter to express his determination to press ahead with imposing big tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, saying that America’s “friends” as well as its enemies have been taking advantage of it for years. His comments suggests that Theresa May has so far failed to persuade him to back away from triggering a trade war. (See 9.10am.) Former shops could be turned into homes as online shopping reshapes high streets, Theresa May has said, as she called for a “great national effort” by the government, developers and councils to tackle the housing crisis. Aid organisations have reported 80 current and historical cases of people being harmed or being at risk of harm, the international development secretary has said. Lord Ashcroft, the polling expert and former Conservative deputy chairman, has published polling about voters’ views in London suggesting that 60% of Londoners disapprove of the government’s record. Here is an extract from his commentary in the Evening Standard. Londoners gave Mrs May an average performance score of 35 out of 100, compared to 47 for Jeremy Corbyn and 53 for Sadiq Khan, who topped our table. Some admired her stoicism, but she tended to arouse sympathy rather than anything more positive (“I’m surprised she hasn’t had a nervous breakdown,” as one of our focus group participants put it). And those were the charitable views. But how much does this matter in a local election? Whatever else is going on, surely Londoners associate the Tories with good services and value for money? Well, up to a point. Even in Conservative authorities, I found only a third of voters, and less than half of 2017 Tories, associating the party with lower council tax; fewer than one in five, and one in three Tories, think of them as offering both. And here is a chart from his more detailed report. Here is some assorted reaction to the Theresa May housing speech. From John Healey, Labour’s housing spokesman We’ve heard hand-wringing on housing from Theresa May before, but there’s nothing new here that will make a difference. After eight years of failure, it’s clear this Government has got no plan to fix the housing crisis. Home-ownership has fallen to a thirty-year low, rough sleeping has more than doubled and the number of new homes built for social rent has fallen to the lowest level since records began. From Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem communities spokesperson The Conservatives cannot rely on the private sector to provide affordable housing. Housing developers will always act in the best interests of their shareholders, which means keeping house prices high. The Liberal Democrats are calling for tens of billions of real investment in new housing. From Jay Das, a planning partner at the law firm Wedlake Bell There is very little “new” in the prime minister’s speech for new-home developers. Theresa May has stated that if developers are sitting on planning permission, then councils will be able to penalise developers. It is difficult to see how this will particularly assist new homes being built. Details are subject to the findings of Sir Oliver Letwin’s review and applications may be many months if not years away. There are many reasons why build out rates can be slow and they are often unintentional. As such, a penalty system will not make a marked difference. The detailed changes proposed to viability assessments will be much more interesting. From Jane Gratton, head of business environment at the British Chambers of Commerce Planning revolutions have often been promised, but usually turn out to be a false dawn, given that businesses report that it never seems to get easier, faster, or cheaper to secure planning permissions and crack on with development. The last time the government upended the planning system six years ago, the framework was slimmed down, but the bureaucracy, delays and cost were not. This time things must be different. From Sam Dumitriu, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute The Campaign to Prevent Real Estate may object, but the prime minister is right to take-on nimby councils in high-demand areas. Restrictions on new development push rents up and hold back productivity by pricing workers out of the best jobs. But we must go further and build on the green belt. Building on the Green Belt doesn’t mean ugly sprawl or trashing the environment. If we only freed up intensively farmed land within a ten-minute walking distance of a train station for development, we could build one million new homes. At the Number 10 lobby briefing Theresa May’s spokesman stressed that the prime minister had raised her “deep concern” about the expected announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs when she spoke to President Trump yesterday. (See 9.10am.) However, the spokesman added that the UK did not know what the announcement would say and would “wait for the details before anything further to add”. Asked if the government was still confident of a trade deal with the US, he said it was. I think both the prime minister and the president have been clear on the importance of reaching a bilateral, post-Brexit trade deal. The USA is our biggest trade partner, we invest over £500bn in each other’s economies and over 1m Americans work for UK companies, so you would expect us to remain close partners and continue to work at the highest levels to make the case for UK industry to the US government. Asked if the UK was lobbying for an exception to the tariffs given the close relationship, the spokesman said he could not add to the read-out. However, he did confirm that as long as we are members of the EU we would operate our trade policy as part of the bloc. Here is the full text of Theresa May’s housing speech. Aid organisations have reported 80 current and historical cases where people have been harmed, or have been at risk of harm, to the Charity Commission since February 12, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said this morning. The cases span 26 charities and groups and cover the “full spectrum” of safeguarding incidents, she said. As the Press Association reports, seven of the organisations came forward with cases that have been reported within the current financial year. Officials said they did not know if any of the incidents involved children and refused to name the charities involved. In a speech this morning at a safeguarding summit in central London, Mordaunt warned predators exploiting the aid sector that there was “no hiding place”. She said: “We will find you, we will bring you to justice. Your time is up.” Mordaunt said that since the Oxfam Haiti sex scandal new standards have now come into force that aid organisations must meet to be eligible for government money. She explained: These standards will include an assessment of codes of conduct, how organisations identify and respond to incidents, and how their risk management places safeguarding and beneficiaries at the very core. That assessment will set the bar at a level of the very best - a bar that we will continue to push higher - from our work here today and in the time to come. Our standards will be world-leading. They will be tough and exacting. Organisations should not bid for new funding unless they are prepared to meet these tough new standards. We will not approve funds to them unless they pass our new standards. Here are the main points from Theresa May’s Q&amp;A after her housing speech. May rejected Local Government Association criticism of her plans [see 9.41am], saying the government has already responded to its proposals. The LGA wants councils to be allowed to borrow to build home. May said the government was already allowing this. She said: We have increased the borrowing cap for certain councils to be able to do exactly that, because that was a message that the Local Government Association gave to us and we responded to it. She denied that she personally was a ‘nimby’. Asked about reports (like this one) that she has opposed new housebuilding in her Maidenhead constituency, she replied: This is about building the right homes in the right places. That’s what the planning process is actually about. The planning process is a process which ensures that developments, that proposals for developments, are looked at properly. And, yes, I have opposed a number of developments in my own constituency. I have also, for what it’s worth, supported a development on a green belt site which had previously been built on. ‘Nimby’ is an acronym for ‘not in my backyard’, making nimby slang for someone who opposes any housing developments that might adversely affect them personally. She implicitly accused the BBC of being pre-occupied with Brexit. In response to a question from the BBC’s Vicki Young about Brexit, she said: Being the BBC, of course you were always going to get Brexit into the question. The jibe was more interesting than May’s reply, which was just about wanting financial services to be included in a trade deal. Q: Is the government now prepared to deliver on the threats issued to developers who don’t build? May says the government is now committed to making sure homes get built. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Do you think empty retail property should be converted into homes? And if developers pay bonuses based on how many homes are built, doesn’t that smack of Stalinist tractor production targets? May says in her speech she made the point that there can be a perverse incentive if bonuses are just paid on the basis of profit. With regard to retail property, she says the new planning rules should make it easier for empty shops to be turned into homes. She also wants to make it easier for people to develop upwards, she says. Q: How far will you go to in forcing councils to allow more homes to be built? May says the government wants to ensure that local plans get followed. Q: On Brexit, the CBI say they are worried about financial services not being included in a deal. May says it is typical of the BBC to ask about Brexit. The Mansion House speech made it clear that the UK wants a partnership on financial services, and on other financial services too. Q: Your junior housing minister said she would resign if homelessness got worse on her watch. Will you make a similar pledge if new houses don’t get built? And you have opposed new housing in your constituency. Are you a nimby? May says the government is committed to getting more homes built. But the issues is ensuring homes get built in the right places. She admits she has opposed homes being built in her constituency. But she she has backed other developments. May is now taking questions. Q: The LGA says your speech is unhelpful and misguided. [See 9.41am.] It says the only way we can build enough affordable homes is if councils can be free to borrow. What is your response? May says the government has already raised the borrowing cap, allowing some councils to borrow more. But this is a problem that all sides need to address - government, councils and developers. In her Mansion House speech on Friday Theresa May said that the UK government would start talking directly to the Irish government about how to address the Irish border issue. She said: We have been clear all along that we don’t want to go back to a hard border in Ireland. We have ruled out any physical infrastructure at the border, or any related checks and controls. But it is not good enough to say, ‘We won’t introduce a hard border; if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that’s down to them’. We chose to leave; we have a responsibility to help find a solution. But we can’t do it on our own. It is for all of us to work together. And the taoiseach [Irish prime minister] and I agreed when we met recently that our teams and the commission should now do just that. In an interview with RTE’s Morning Ireland today the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, played down the significance of these talks, saying they would not amount to a specific negotiation. “There won’t be tripartite or three-way talks,” he said. He went on: What will happen is that there will be talks between the EU 27, and the UK and Ireland is part of the UK 27, and we’re much stronger, by the way, as one of 27. We will, of course, have negotiations about what could be done to avoid a hard border but what we won’t be getting into is a negotiation with the UK, or a three-way negotiation. That’s not in our interest and not the way that this can be concluded. Speaking about the speech generally, Varadkar gave it a guarded welcome, but said more detail was needed. What we want is not so much principles and aspirations and red lines. What we want is detail, written down in black and white that can be codified into law and that is what is required. Theresa May is giving her housing speech now. Since it has been well trailed, I won’t cover what she says minute by minute, but I will zoom in for the Q&amp;A (if I can), and post a summary of anything new when the full text is available. Yesterday, ahead of Theresa May’s announcement, the LGA chair Lord Porter (see 9.41am) posted this on Twitter. MHCLG is the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, the new name for the communities department. Nick Boles, a former planning minister who earlier this year accused the government of “timidity and lack of ambition”, retweeted Porter’s tweet saying he agreed. He has also posted these. And here’s an extract from the Matt Ridley column in the Times (paywall) that Boles endorsed. Ridley said: So why is British planning so restrictive? Until 1947 Britain regulated housebuilding in most cities the same way other countries did: by telling people what they could build, rather than whether they could build. As Nicholas Boys Smith, director of Create Streets, told a recent conference at the Legatum Institute, in the centuries following the Great Fire of 1666 “there was a series of pieces of legislation that set down very tight parameters: ratio of street width to street height, the fire treatment of windows etc. That is how most of Europe still manages planning. They have not taken away your right to build a building.” Britain switched to deregulating what you could build, but nationalised whether you could build, by adopting a system of government planning in which permission to build was determined by officials responding to their own estimate of “need”. This brought great uncertainty to the system, because planning permission now depended on the whims of planners, the actions of rivals and the representations of objectors. Today local plans are often years out of date, if they exist at all, and are vast, unwieldy documents, opaque to ordinary citizens and subject to endless legal challenge and revision. In January the SNP organised a meeting of opposition parties in the Commons to discuss coordinating efforts to keep the UK in the single market after Brexit. The Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green MP Caroline Lucas attended, and the group posed for a picture alongside an empty chair for Jeremy Corbyn to highlight his refusal to attend. Tomorrow the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens are holding another meeting at Westminster - and this time Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, is attending. The TUC has also called for the UK to remain in the customs union and the single market. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said in a statement: I’m delighted that Frances O’Grady, has agreed to meet with us to discuss the serious impact that Brexit will have on workers’ and citizens’ rights, jobs and the livelihoods of millions of people. Time is running out for Theresa May. Her own government’s economic analysis warns of the significant damage that Brexit will do to our economy. It’s time she heeded our calls to remain in the single market and customs union and the concerns from the TUC about safeguarding the rights of millions of workers. Since the meeting in January Corbyn has announced that Labour is committed to keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU after Brexit for good. But Labour is still opposed to remaining in the single market (partly because that would involve accepting freedom of movement, but partly because Corbyn is worried about being bound by EU state aid rules). O’Grady’s decision to line up with the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid and this Greens on this issue will encourage Labour pro-Europeans who hope Corbyn can be persuaded to shift further. Downing Street released lengthy extracts from Theresa May’s housing speech overnight. My colleague Anushka Asthana has written them up here. As she reports, May will hit out at the “perverse incentive” of housing industry bonus structures paying out millions of pounds to chief executives as a result of company profits rather than the number of homes built. But May’s focus on planning rules, and the proposal for “Nimby” councils that do not approve enough homes to lose their say over planning, have angered the Conservative-led Local Government Association. Lord Porter, the Tory councillor who chairs the LGA, said in a statement: In the last year, councils and their communities granted nearly twice as many planning permissions as the number of new homes that were completed. Councils approved more than 321,000 new homes in 2016/17, while there were around 183,000 new homes added in the same year. More than423,000 homes with planning permission are still waiting to be built. The truth is that councils are currently approving nine in 10 planning applications, which shows that the planning system is working well and is not a barrier to building. Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of planning refusals are upheld on appeal, vindicating councils’ original decisions. It is completely wrong, therefore, to suggest the country’s failure to build the housing it desperately needs is down to councils. The threat of stripping councils of their rights to decide where homes are built is unhelpful and misguided. Porter also restated the LGA’s long-held demand for councils to be allowed to borrow so that they can build homes themselves. He said: The last time the country delivered 300,000 homes which this country needs each year, in the 1970s, councils were responsible for more than 40 per cent of them and it’s essential that we get back to that. In order for that to happen, councils have to be able to borrow to build homes again. Ultimately, the private sector will never build enough of the homes the country needs on its own. The Government must back the widespread calls, including from the Treasury Select Committee, for council borrowing and investment freedoms to spark a renaissance in house building by local government. Theresa May’s attempt to persuade President Trump to rethink his plan to trigger a trade war by imposing big tariffs on steel and aluminium imports doesn’t seem to be working. She was scheduled to speak to him yesterday about Syria, but when the call came she also took the chance to raise her concerns about his new tariff proposals. In the read-out released to journalists afterwards, Number 10 said: The prime minister raised our deep concern at the president’s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties’ interests. The statement doesn’t record how Trump responded. But Downing Street read-outs of this kind are famous for their blandness, and if they are using phrases like “deep concern”, then presumably it must have been quite a frosty and awkward exchange. No 10 may not have commented on the president’s reaction, but the president himself posted a tweet on the subject last night and it makes it clear that he’s not taking much notice of May’s concerns. That reference to “friends” presumably includes the UK. The ramifications of this don’t just apply to steel and aluminium. Trump’s response also illustrates the dangers of relying for a post-Brexit economic strategy too much on striking a free trade deal with someone who does not actually believe in free trade. May will be giving a speech this morning on housing. And then she will be in the Commons this afternoon making a statement on Brexit. At some point she will doubtless be asked about the Trump tweet. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, gives a speech at a safeguarding summit with aid charities. 10am: Theresa May gives a speech on housing. As Anushka Asthana reports, she will hit out at the “perverse incentive” of housing industry bonus structures paying out millions of pounds to chief executives as a result of company profits rather than the number of homes built. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, meets the Sinn Fein leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill in Brussels. After 3.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs about her Brexit speech. 4.30pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the European scrutiny committee about Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/08/glam-or-sham-are-youtubes-beauty-vloggers-selling-out","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"Glam or sham: how the big brands cash in on YouTube's beauty vloggers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/08/glam-or-sham-are-youtubes-beauty-vloggers-selling-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/08/glam-or-sham-are-youtubes-beauty-vloggers-selling-out","fields":{"headline":"Glam or sham: how the big brands cash in on YouTube's beauty vloggers","bodyText":"In late January, a troupe of makeup obsessives were sent on an all-expenses-paid trip to paradise. The YouTube beauty “gurus” – whose makeup tutorials have amassed them almost 30 million loyal viewers – were flown by the cosmetics brand Benefit to Soneva Jani: a Maldives resort where a night’s stay ranges from US$4,000 to US$15,000. On the final night Benefit announced the reason for the gathering: a new mascara that retails for US$24. “Press trips” like these, once the domain of lucky journalists at mainstream media companies, are now the ultimate marker of social media influence. They’re at once a reward for vloggers and an opportunity for brands to be mentioned on their YouTube channels – product placement that can otherwise cost thousands of dollars a post. The YouTubers on the trip were not Benefit loyalists. Take Chloe Morello, for instance: one of Australia’s most-watched YouTubers with more than 2.4 million subscribers. Morello and her husband vlogged the Maldives trip, which doubled as their honeymoon, during which she demonstrated to her fans a “vacation makeup routine”. This featured eight brands, including Benefit, her own line Face Halo, and Tarte – a brand that last year flew her and other YouTubers to Bora Bora. She also took the opportunity to plug her new collaboration with Pixi: a face palette and lip gloss that she’d unveiled on her channel four days earlier. For the savvy content creator, there’s a constellation of potential income streams in the beauty world – and those with the most lucrative careers are able to mix and match. ‘Can’t wait to see your post!’: the pressure to play nice Michael Finch is a 21-year-old, Brisbane-based beauty guru who has been filming makeup tutorials and product reviews for four years. He belongs to a growing community of male beauty YouTubers, who include names like Patrick Starr, Manny MUA, Jeffree Star and James Charles, who became the first male CoverGirl ambassador in 2016. More than 17 million subscribers watch these men brush, dab and preen for the camera, using the same products as their female counterparts. And there’s a lot of product: the dramatic makeup looks that dominate Instagram and YouTube involve baking, contouring, strobing – and can require several products layered one on top of the other. As well as earning income from Google AdSense (the ads that run before and during YouTube videos, which pay per click) and a series of masterclasses (where audience members paid between A$399 and A$650), Finch makes money from brand sponsorships. “That’s just brands reaching out to you to promote their product if you like it,” he explains. In accordance with Australian consumer laws, paid-for content must be clearly marked as “sponsored”. Last year the US Federal Trade Commission updated its guidelines on social media disclosures for the first time since 2010, when the thought of people earning millions for recommending lipstick on YouTube was unheard of. About the same time the Australian Association of National Advertisers established a new code for social media users, who can now be fined up to A$220,000 a post if they fail to disclose a commercial arrangement or are found to be “misleading by omission”. But a grey area still exists when products are sent to an influencer, unprompted and without prior agreement. Being added to a PR list for mailouts is how vloggers can prove their industry cred, but Finch says it’s often unclear what – if anything – is expected. “A lot of brands send stuff to my PO box and don’t expect anything back … But some brands will send you [product] and then send an email saying, ‘Can’t wait to see your post!’” With a YouTube subscriber count of more than 800,000, Finch’s profile is growing, and the Maldives gathering was his first press trip. Attendance, Finch says, carried only the expectation that he would post one Instagram photo. In the end he posted four tagging the brand, and one half-hour vlog, which opened with a Benefit employee effusively describing the product launch. That video was not labelled as sponsored, as the brand did not pay him to produce it – but, after an all-expenses-paid trip to the Maldives, can any content about the brand that sent a vlogger there be truly independent? ‘Sometimes I’ve been a little too myself’ On platforms including YouTube and Instagram, where influence often comes down to relatability, an influencer might prefer to let a sponsorship deal fly under the radar: that way their content will appear more organic and their opinions uncompromised. But with regulations slow to catch up to the new economy, young, unsuspecting audiences are often left unaware of when they’re being advertised to – or the pressure brands are placing on their favourite YouTuber to play nice. Jackie Aina is a YouTube beauty guru from Los Angeles and the recipient of a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People image award. She reviews products like Kim Kardashian West’s debut range of contour kits to decide if they’re “chocolate girl-friendly” and shares her thoughts with her audience of more than 2 million subscribers. When she tested a new line of foundation by Tarte, she found it featured a dozen fair/neutral shades and only three designed for people of colour. “This brand embodies the exact opposite of everything that I stand for,” she said in her video. After posting an earlier video criticising the brand for a product that didn’t cater to shoppers with dark complexions, Aina told her viewers she had been removed from Tarte’s PR list and would be receiving no more product. Finch has felt the pressure too; he’s “been kicked off a few PR lists”, he says. “Sometimes I‘ve been a little too myself and it’s gotten me into trouble.” It illustrates yet another way that, for social media influencers and brands, the line between paid promotion and recommendation is blurrier than it has ever been. Unboxing, decluttering and the apolitical plug Last year the website Racked published a series titled The Swag Project. Staff collated all the free products, gifts and experiences (and their packaging) they were sent or offered over the course of six months. Of the 2,972 items, 2,350 were beauty products with a total retail value of US$64,000. The website published pieces that mentioned just 3% of them. As part of the series, Racked interviewed PR employees responsible for deciding who gets sent what. One former publicist began working for a haircare brand when “influencer gifting was ‘nonexistent’. By the time he left the company last year, his team was sending new products to roughly 60 print editors, 60 to 100 digital editors, and between 300 and 600 influencers.” Shannon Harris was probably one of them. Named one of Forbes’ “10 most powerful influencers in the world of beauty” last year, the 25-year-old New Zealander has been uploading videos under the moniker Shaaanxo since 2009. She has more than 3 million subscribers on YouTube, so getting a product mentioned in one of her videos is a goal for many working in beauty PR. So is watching her unpack them. On Harris’s “hauls” playlist there are more than 11 hours’ worth of videos with titles like “PR haul” and “Unboxing free stuff” in which she opens parcels on camera, describes their contents and, occasionally, swatches a lipstick or eyeshadow on the back of her hand. Unboxing videos are safe spaces for beauty vloggers and brands: the company is happy because a product got a mention and the influencer doesn’t have to risk an opinion. Many of the products Harris receives will be mentioned only once more: when she features them in one of her “decluttering and organisation” videos. Harris has uploaded 15 of these videos totalling more than nine hours. In them, she decides which products will be thrown out, gifted to family or followers, or donated to charity. Although they aren’t directly sponsored, these videos make money for Harris – not from the brands but from her viewers. Advertisers pay YouTube each time one of their ads is watched, and the creator pockets about 68% of that. So Harris earns about 12 US cents for each of the cumulative millions of views she receives for unpacking boxes. When ‘democratising’ is anything but Gifting, press trips and “unboxing hauls” form a new economy that feeds the beauty industry – but regulating its grey areas would require explicit disclosures that wouild threaten its very nature. The journey from shopping at Sephora to being sent an enormous box of highlighters is now, it seems, the goal for makeup fans turned beauty gurus. And for the brands doing the sending, having your product’s features read aloud by someone with a dedicated audience who perceives him or her as being “down to earth” is a more direct and cost-effective way of reaching customers than recruiting a Hollywood star to wear a new shade at the Oscars. But that “down to earth” influencer could be earning millions a year, benefiting from a fast-moving but poorly regulated industry. And as influencers earn more followers and money, the products they showcase become further out of reach. Nikkie De Jager is a 24-year-old Dutch makeup artist with more than 9 million followers, who has filmed videos with celebrities including Kardashian West and Nicole Ritchie. To recreate one of her tutorials would require more than a dozen products and hundreds of dollars. (To buy these products, subscribers can click “affiliate links” which pay her commission.) Influencers like De Jager are a symbol of a perceived democratisation of the beauty industry, in which the path to recognition no longer requires years of studying and mentorship. Yet this changing of the guard is ultimately little more than a popularity contest. Those with the most fans and (more often than not) the fairest complexions get the offers and exclusives and special treatment – while the followers who get them there get a 10% off discount code from an industry that leaves them behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/battle-cry-for-inclusion-shape-of-water-triumphs-in-oscars-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:42:44Z","webTitle":"A battle cry for inclusion: The Shape of Water triumphs in Oscars of seismic change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/battle-cry-for-inclusion-shape-of-water-triumphs-in-oscars-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/battle-cry-for-inclusion-shape-of-water-triumphs-in-oscars-2018","fields":{"headline":"A battle cry for inclusion: The Shape of Water triumphs in Oscars of seismic change","bodyText":"The Shape of Water, a romantic fable about a janitor who falls in love with a sea creature, has swept top honours at the Oscars in a ceremony that turned into a battle cry for inclusion and female empowerment. Guillermo del Toro’s cold war-era fantasy about the triumph of outcasts fended off the satirical horror Get Out and the drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, to take best picture and director, continuing a winning streak for Mexican film-makers in Hollywood. The 90th Academy Awards turned Sunday night’s ceremony in Los Angeles into a celebration and exhortation of representation and inclusion, after a year marked by seismic cultural change in Hollywood that rippled across the world. Frances McDormand, who won the best actress award for playing a grieving, furious mother in Three Billboards, created one of the night’s most memorable tableaux by asking all the female nominees in the Dolby theatre to stand up. “Look around,” she said. “We all have stories to tell and projects we need financing.” She finished her speech saying: “I have two words to say: inclusion rider”, a reference to a little known contract clause that lets actors demand diversity on both sides of the camera. Backstage, she stressed this is a new era. “We’re not going back. It changes now ... power in rules.” The acting awards went as expected. Gary Oldman won best actor for depicting Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. “Put the kettle on,” he told his 99-year-old mother, watching on the sofa at home. “I’m bringing Oscar home.” Sam Rockwell won best supporting actor for playing a racist cop in Three Billboards and Allison Janney won best supporting actress for playing an unforgiving mother in I, Tonya. Greta Gerwig’s acclaimed coming of age story Lady Bird and Steven Spielberg’s The Post left empty-handed, though Jordan Peele’s Get Out won best original screenplay, prompting a rapturous standing ovation that cemented his elevation to Hollywood’s elite. Christopher Nolan’s war epic Dunkirk and Paul Thomas Anderson’s dark romance Phantom Thread took a clutch of technical awards. James Ivory, 89, became the oldest winner of an Oscar for the gay coming of age drama Call Me by Your Name, in the best adapted screenplay category. A crystal stage, clips of classic films and appearances by veteran stars projected a nostalgic glow, but the ceremony crackled with contemporary politics and social activism related to sexual misconduct and immigration rights. Salma Hayek, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra, who went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against the disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, jointly presented an emotional montage that channelled the anger and hope of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. The movement’s leaders had decided to stand down for the night, in contrast to the Golden Globes, whose attendees expressed solidarity by wearing black, but Hollywood’s mood of reckoning still permeated proceedings. Along with jewellery, the traditional gift bags for top nominees included pepper spray and a “phobia-relief” therapy session. On the red carpet, most stars shunned the E! News presenter Ryan Seacrest because of sexual harassment accusations, which he denies. The host, Jimmy Kimmel, joked in the opening monologue that the Oscar statue set an example for Hollywood: “He keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word, and literally doesn’t have a penis.” This was the year that men screwed up so badly “women started dating fish”, he said, referencing The Shape of Water. Kimmel also addressed last year’s fiasco, when the wrong best picture was announced. “This year, when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away,” he told the audience. “Give us a minute.” Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, who initially, incorrectly announced La La Land instead of Moonlight the winner last year, surprisingly returned to present the best picture award – this time without a hitch. Del Toro’s victory was the fourth time a Mexican director has taken Oscar honours in the last five years, following Alfonso Cuarón in 2014 and Alejandro González Iñárritu in 2015 and 2016. “I am an immigrant,” said Del Toro in a veiled rebuke to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. “The greatest thing art does and our industry does is erase the lands in the sand. We should continue doing that when the world tells us to make them deeper.” Backstage, the director said artists have to honour their roots and said he would be bringing his statues to his parents in Mexico. “I’m going home with these two babies.” Coco, about a Mexican boy’s journey to the underworld, won best animated film and best original song, prompting cries of “Viva Mexico” from the stage. Latino talent triumphed again when the Chilean drama A Fantastic Woman, starring trans actor Daniela Vega in the lead, won best foreign film. The drama was the first Oscar winner to feature both a transgender storyline and star an openly trans performer. Weinstein, an Oscar svengali who in previous years was thanked more times than God, was nowhere in sight, banished from the Academy last October after multiple allegations of his predations triggered the #MeToo avalanche. But a jarring moment came when the retired basketball star Kobe Bryant won an Oscar for an animated short based on his farewell letter to the sport, prompting accusations of double standards among Oscar voters, given a rape accusation made against Bryant in 2003 – a case that was dropped when his accuser refused to testify and settled out of court. Amazon’s The Big Sick and Netflix’s Mudbound won nothing, but Netflix’s film about Russian doping, Icarus, took best documentary, suggesting the Academy’s resistance to streaming services is weakening. Blade Runner 2049 won two Oscars, with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins collecting his first statue after 13 previous nominations. Kimmel promised a jet ski to the winner who made the shortest speech, weaving in a quiz show vibe to balance the politics. The show ended with Mark Bridges, the Phantom Thread costume designer, scooting across the stage atop the machine. His speech had clocked in at just over 30 seconds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/08/nrl-2018-season-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"NRL season preview: good business primes Roosters for Storm chasing | Paul Connolly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/08/nrl-2018-season-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/08/nrl-2018-season-preview","fields":{"headline":"NRL: good business primes Roosters for Storm chasing","bodyText":"At some point in life you’d hope to attain the kind of clear-eyed perspective that has you agreeing with Tennyson, that it is indeed better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. But as so many young NRL fans will discover this coming season you don’t reach this point without first enduring a lot of long, lonely nights tearfully singing Simply the Best while hate-watching YouTube highlights packages of your former love carving them up. Player movements are commonplace in professional sport but the shuffling of the decks that has taken place in the NRL over the off-season has been remarkable. It’s as if the clubs had a key party over summer. While it’s torn young hearts asunder to see their once favourite players pull on the colours of another club (a situation referenced by the NRL’s latest ad campaign) the club-swapping has added considerable intrigue to the 2018 season which commences at Kogarah Jubilee Oval on Thursday night. This is particularly the case because of the quality of the players involved. Cooper Cronk (Storm to Roosters), James Tedesco (Tigers to Roosters), James Maloney (Sharks to Panthers), Matt Moylan (Panthers to Sharks), Josh Dugan (Dragons to Sharks), James Graham (Bulldogs to Dragons), Ben Hunt (Broncos to Dragons), Jack Bird (Sharks to Broncos), Jarryd Hayne (Titans to Eels), Dane Gagai (Knights to Souths), Mitchell Pearce (Roosters to Knights), Kalyn Ponga (Cowboys to Knights), Aidan Guerra (Roosters to Knights), Tohu Harris (Storm to Warriors), Kieran Foran (Warriors to Bulldogs), Josh Reynolds (Bulldogs to Tigers), and many others, all made off-season moves. Safe to say, then, that the premiership will be decided in large part both by how the presence of these players improves their new teams and how their absence affects their old ones. Like entering a wolf’s lair wearing trousers made from bacon, predicting the NRL top eight is not something you do with any confidence. This is mainly because of the fine margins that exist not only between the clubs but also between winning and losing in any given game. Eight of Canberra’s losses in 2017, for instance, were by six points or less, three of them in golden point extra-time. The club for whom so many predicted good things last season finished two wins outside the eight. As unpredictable as the NRL can be the reigning premiers Melbourne, the Sydney Roosters and last year’s beaten grand finalists, North Queensland (who are boosted by the return from injury of Johnathan Thurston and Matt Scott, both of whom missed the Cowboys’ finals heroics in 2017), would have to get a lot wrong to not feature in September football. Outside of that trio Parramatta, Penrith, Brisbane and Cronulla look particularly capable while St George Illawarra might surprise with James Graham and Ben Hunt on board. Though the Roosters look a little light on depth they have done some particularly good business as they always seem to do (though for all that they’ve won just two titles since 1975). Cronk and Tedesco are key positional upgrades on Mitchell Pearce and veteran Michael Gordon respectively. As the 2017 preliminary finalists have also retained Jake Friend and Luke Keary – ensuring they will field the kind of model spine you could use in chiropractic schools – they’ve set themselves up well to challenge for top honours. But so much will hinge on Cronk and it will be fascinating to see how he operates without his long-time wingmen Cameron Smith and Billy Slater with whom he’d developed something akin to a telepathic understanding. At 34 the old dog will have to learn a few new tricks but only a fool would doubt his ability to do just that. If Cronk and Tedesco boost the Roosters’ premiership credentials what does his absence mean for the premiers? As promising as his replacement Brodie Croft is the loss of Cronk’s composure and link play will surely cost the Storm points along the way. But of the now defunct Big Three it’s Smith whose influence is the greatest at the Storm. As has been pointed out, the Storm have won 65% of the 54 games they’ve played without Cronk (but with Smith and Slater). This is compared to a 73% win rate from from 232 games when all three have played, 55% from the 11 games Cronk and Slater have played without Smith, and the 40% from 15 games Cronk has played without Smith and Slater. The latter two are admittedly very small sample sizes (because Smith, seemingly, is made from titanium) but they could suggest the Storm will be weakened – but not critically so – by Cronk’s absence as long as Smith stays healthy. They remain the team to beat. As well as the race for the premiership the 2018 season will offer up its usual amounts of drama, intrigue and controversy – which, in the case of the latter, has already started what with Matthew Lodge’s return to the NRL threatening to overshadow the opening game and the possible return to the competition of Todd Carney. As always, there will be politicking in the background and new NRL commission chairman Peter Beattie – who has replaced John Grant – has the unenviable task of uniting the game’s clubs when it comes to constitutional reform. But he’s already thinking big. “The vision of the game is really simple; we have to expand,” he said at his first ARLC AGM two weeks ago. Another point of considerable interest will be how the NRL and the clubs respond to the New Zealand v England Test match in Denver in June (during a State of Origin bye weekend). It shapes as a test of the NRL clubs’ willingness to support the international game, given they run the risk that released players will be injured. It will surely help matters if the NRL implements, as it has suggested it might, salary cap relief for clubs whose players are injured on international duty. The coming season will also see the launch of a women’s competition, abbreviated though it will be in its first iteration, as well as a ninth Immortal named since Andrew Johns was last added to the list in 2012. As always, however, it will be the drama on the field that captivates. And at the centre of that will be the players, including all those romancing a new set of fans, or twisting the dagger in the hearts of those they left behind. But don’t let your broken hearts consume you, folks, much less burn your replica jumpers. Put them in storage instead, for look at what’s happened at the Tigers.

It was hardly a vintage year for Australia but hey, at least we got one run on the board. The Sydney-born editor Lee Smith was the sole Aussie winner, taking best editing for Dunkirk, the writer/director Christopher Nolan’s superb second world war drama about the evacuation of allied troops from the titular French city. Another Australian, Paul Machliss, was in contention for best editing, nominated for his work on the writer/director Edgar Wright’s offbeat crime caper Baby Driver. Smith and Machliss exhibited very different styles. The former juggled multiple timelines and vantage points with scalpel-like precision in Nolan’s gritty and visceral film, while the latter took a flashier approach for Wright’s visually batty style. In his acceptance speech, Smith described Nolan as “an editor himself, [but] he doesn’t handle the actual equipment, and I am very, very happy for that”. Smith is a longtime Nolan collaborator, whose first feature film as editor was the 1986 Ozploitation oddity Dead End Drive-In. He continues a proud tradition among Australian editors, who tend to do well at the Oscars, collectively amassing a whopping 16 nominations over the past 25 years. The most famous Australian nominated this year – and clearly the best dressed – was Margot Robbie. The actor turned up in a white Chanel gown, a custom haute couture piece to mark the announcement that she has just become that fashion house’s new brand ambassador. The Queensland-born former Neighbours star was nominated for best actress for her dazzling, high-voltage performance as the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. Robbie lost to odds-on favourite Frances McDormand, who is easily the best thing about Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri, the writer/director Martin McDonagh’s overrated and racially problematic revenge drama. The big surprise this year, in terms of Australian nominations, was the nod to the director Derin Seale and the actor-writer Josh Lawson for their short film, The Eleven O’Clock (for best live-action short). Seale is the son of the veteran cinematographer John Seale, who won an Oscar for 1997’s The English Patient and has been nominated a bunch of other times, the latest time for Mad Max: Fury Road. An Oscar nomination was a particularly welcome stroke of good fortune for Lawson, in the wake of last year’s embarrassingly inept Channel Seven miniseries Hoges, which horribly miscast the actor as the veteran comedian Paul Hogan. The Eleven O’Clock was adapted from a short play written by Lawson, who stars in it alongside Damon Herriman (just on Australian screens as the protagonist in the Mardi Gras telemovie Riot). The film is now available to watch on ABC iView. Had The Eleven O’Clock won, the Seales would have become the first Australian father and son to have received Academy Awards. Alas, it was not meant to be. Seale and Lawson lost to The Silent Child, a British film about a profoundly deaf child. This year might not have been a great one for Australians at the Oscars, but we’ve had a good run. In 2017 the country chalked up a record 14 nominations, with two local films contending for best picture for the first time: the touching drama Lion, and brutal war pic Hacksaw Ridge. At the previous ceremony, in 2016, the director George Miller’s explode-a-palooza, Mad Max: Fury Road, took six golden statues back to the Wasteland – double the number of Oscars of the previous, record-holding Australian movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/06/matildas-back-to-winning-ways-at-algarve-cup-against-china","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T21:21:38Z","webTitle":"Matildas back to winning ways at Algarve Cup against China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/06/matildas-back-to-winning-ways-at-algarve-cup-against-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/06/matildas-back-to-winning-ways-at-algarve-cup-against-china","fields":{"headline":"Matildas back to winning ways at Algarve Cup against China","bodyText":"The Matildas claimed a deserved 2-0 win over China but the scoreline fell short of delivering an Algarve Cup final appearance. Injury-hit Australia endured some unlucky moments and at times struggled to break down a compact China in their third and final group match. In the end, Chloe Logarzo and Sam Kerr found the net to hand Alen Stajcic’s side a third-place play-off against host nation Portugal on Thursday. Despite scoring eight goals against China over November’s two friendlies, the world No 4 Matildas could not deliver the four required here to make the final of the invitational tournament, key preparation for next month’s World Cup qualifiers. Their 14th-ranked counterparts had the better of the first-half chances, and Australia could thank some resolute defending for their half-time clean sheet. Wang Shuang sent a golden chance begging, swiping wide on the break, and Wang Shanshan had a crack that MacKenzie Arnold gathered comfortably. China allowed Kerr little of the ball and the Matildas, toiling in a bid to dictate the midfield rhythm, could not find a clear passage. One opened up in the 30th minute when goalkeeper Wang Fei fumbled Elise Kellond-Knight’s free kick. Kerr toe-poked home but was ruled to have fouled Wang. A lifeline finally materialised after the break. Alanna Kennedy, who played well throughout, put in a precise ball and Logarzo finished with finesse, looping a header over Wang Fei. It opened the game up with Lisa De Vanna skying a sitter and Wang Shanshan heading marginally wide. Logarzo then fired in a shot from 25 metres out but her effort bounced cruelly off the post. China came close to a late equaliser from a free kick following a foul by Kennedy; Arnold saved and then spilled Wang Shuang’s subsequent free-kick but Kerr was on hand for the vital clearance. Kerr finally converted a chance at the death, clipping a lob past the onrushing keeper that sailed into the far corner. Sweden and the Netherlands qualified for the final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/05/china-told-to-follow-the-leader-xi-jinping-in-thought-word-and-deed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T05:01:13Z","webTitle":"China told to follow the leader Xi Jinping in thought, word and deed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/china-told-to-follow-the-leader-xi-jinping-in-thought-word-and-deed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/05/china-told-to-follow-the-leader-xi-jinping-in-thought-word-and-deed","fields":{"headline":"China told to follow the leader Xi Jinping in thought, word and deed","bodyText":"The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has kicked off a potentially momentous political summit in Beijing by instructing Communist party officials to “resolutely uphold” the primacy of president Xi Jinping and follow their sovereign in thought, word and deed. Speaking at the opening of the fortnight-long national people’s congress – at which Xi looks set to establish himself as ruler for life – Li urged his country’s political elite to fall in line behind a leader now considered China’s most dominant since Mao. “Entering a new era … we must resolutely uphold the core position of Xi Jinping,” Li told the nearly 3,000 delegates who had packed into the vast scarlet-carpeted auditorium of the Great Hall of the People. Last week it emerged that Xi, 64, would attempt to use this year’s congress to abolish presidential term limits, a highly controversial move that paves the way for him to reign for decades to come. In a speech peppered with adulatory allusions to China’s ascendant leader, Li signalled that delegates should back those proposals when they are put to the vote on Sunday. He urged cadres to gain “a good command of Xi Jinping’s major policy addresses”, to “firmly uphold the guiding position of Xi Jinping’s thinking on strengthening the armed forces” and to “act on Xi Jinping’s economic thinking for ‘new era socialism’ with Chinese characteristics”. He praised “the strong leadership of the party central committee” with Xi at its core for helping China overcome “a stream of risks and challenges” since he took power in 2012. Announcing plans to grow the Chinese economy by 6.5% this year, Li also urged delegates to back Xi’s “inspiring blueprint” for China and his “three critical battles” - fighting economic and financial risks, extreme poverty and pollution. “Unity gives us strength,” Li concluded to applause. Predictably, Li’s 105-minute address contained no mention of the outcry Xi’s bid to scrap term limits has stirred, particularly among liberals who fear a return to Mao-style despotism. However, perhaps hinting at such unease, China’s premier told the 2,970 delegates gathered in the Great Hall of the People: “Power cannot be used as one pleases; the exercise of power must be supervised … Decisions will be made in a sound and democratic way on the basis of law, and before making decisions on any major issue related to public interests, we will solicit input, including criticism, from all parties.” Orville Schell, a China expert who has been visiting the country since the Mao era, said Xi’s power play was part of a global shift back towards strongman rule. “We used to have such leaders back in the good old days when there was Ho Chi Minh, Stalin, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao, Charles de Gaulle. People who had lifetime sinecures. Enver Pasha. Ceaușescu. Then we drifted off into this sort of wan land of bureaucratic leaders,” Schell said. “Now we seem to be back in the kind of Big Leader Couture era around the world.” Carl Minzner, the author of a new book about China’s authoritarian revival, said: “In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, China moved out of the Maoist era and away from one-man rule to collective leadership. It moved away from cult of personality towards an effort to rule China through more stable, bureaucratic norms. What’s happening now is that those things are beginning to buckle.” At the congress’ opening session, delegate after delegate refused to wade into the highly sensitive debate on term limits. “Sorry,” said one, in English. Some, however, were openly supportive. Ding Zhaomin, a delegate from Jilin province, said: “I’ll vote for it ... It’s not good if a policy is enacted in the morning and cancelled in the evening.” “In some foreign countries a policy that is not completed in one president’s term will stop during the next president’s term. What advantages are there to that? None.” Cai Xue’en, from Hubei, said he also backed a proposal which reflected the “voices of the people”. “If I had the chance to say one sentence to President Xi, I would say this: ‘Hello President Xi. To get China to where it is today, you must have worked really hard,’” added Cai, 52.

It has no time for the mysterious, the erratic. It abhors its cousin rugby union’s rucks and mauls and scrums, so-called “dockyard brawls” in which the ball can be hidden under a heaving mass of sweaty bodies who roll and roil about before the referee blows a penalty for something it appears only he can see. Rugby league hates that. It craves only the clean. Rugby league – which for the purposes of this column we’ll define as the greater micro-society of fans, pundits, coaches, players, administrators and sundry holders of stakes – has a thing for clean. The game lauds crisply-executed, completed sets and demands absolute consistency in adjudication. It has mandated that scrums are completed with such high alacrity that they’re not even scrums. There are time-clocks ticking on scrums and drop-outs to move us hastily into the greater game-play. The game is great for all that. Television loves rugby league. It’s fast, high-energy; a demolition derby of collisions by skilful, over-sized people with disproportionate pace. And to facilitate that, a quick ruck is a good ruck. It means higher energy, more ball movement and more collisions. Ratings gold. Yet with the mandate by administrators for referees to clamp down on players not using their feet to play the ball backwards – and thus to actually police the game according to one of its rules – it appears that rugby league would like to dial back the pace of the game, just a tad. For in the modern game, ruck speed is all. Coaches call it “the ground” and see every tackle as a battle-ground. Attackers try to get up and play the ball quickly to catch the defence back-peddling. Defenders try to slow the ruck down with the dark arts of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. A wrist tweak here, a head turn there, anything to win those crucial milliseconds, to disrupt flow. And it was all going along well enough, one assumed. Yet attackers incorrectly playing the ball has apparently infuriated enough purists that administrators have heeded their furies and instructed referees to rule to the letter of that law. So hard chargers like Andrew Fifita and Martin Taupau and other experts in human movement – mighty creatures who can tear into the maelstrom and muscle their way over the gain line and hop up quickly to get the ball back and get their team running at back-peddling opponents – will be now be asked to play the ball as the rule-makers instruct, using their feet. Rugby league won’t go so far as allowing competition for the ball at ruck time (much less scrum time) yet by mandating that attackers play the ball with their feet as the rules say they must, authorities have opened another can of worms. For they have asked referees – poor, beleaguered, inconsistent, human referees – to make a guess. Did the player touch the ball with his foot? Or did he not? Incorrect play-the-ball has been one of those rules that referees have turned a blind eye too. There was a similar clamp down the beginning of 2016 to rid rugby league of what The Courier-Mail described as “the tunnel ball farce which has sent purists into a spin”. But referees quickly found bigger fish to fry. And players like Fifita became so adept at making “an attempt” to play the ball with their feet that the game just moved on, nothing to see here. Referees – and players, coaches and administrators – were largely OK with that; had they blown penalties for it they would have been accused of that most heinous crime: inconsistency, another variant of unclean. Coaches hate that, they hate the unknown. And referees would have been vilified and some of them sacked – the end result they are all afraid of. So in order to be consistent in 2018 it appears referees will be keeping a super-sharp eye on studs on Steedens at ruck time. We’ll see how that changes a game which changes each year but you’d suggest the players are on notice. Let’s hope they learn fast because in a trial at AAMI Park between Newcastle Knights and Melbourne Storm, one senior Knights player reported that there were 16 penalties for incorrect play-the-ball. Heading into the new season it seems referees will, at least early doors, penalise players who will emerge from the ruck with eyes wide open and pleading like a child. And rugby league – coaches, players, fans, pundits, the greater globulous mad mess of us – will accuse referees of inconsistency. By which, of course, we will mean “mess”, and you know how we feel about that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/jimmy-kimmel-oscars-monologue-slams-weinstein-skewers-trump-and-pence","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T01:51:56Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Kimmel Oscars monologue slams Weinstein, skewers Trump and Pence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/jimmy-kimmel-oscars-monologue-slams-weinstein-skewers-trump-and-pence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/jimmy-kimmel-oscars-monologue-slams-weinstein-skewers-trump-and-pence","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Kimmel Oscars monologue slams Weinstein, skewers Trump and Pence","bodyText":"Jimmy Kimmel celebrated the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements and addressed the Harvey Weinstein scandal in an Oscars opening monologue that was unafraid to confront politics – or the envelope fiasco of last year’s ceremony. In a speech that was preceded by a parody of a black and white Oscars newsreel, in honour of the 90th anniversary of the Academy Awards, Kimmel began by addressing the incorrect announcement of the best picture award at the 2017 Oscars. “This year, when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away. Give us a minute,” he said. Kimmel, who was also host at that ceremony, explained that, in advance of the awards, he was asked to contribute to a comic skit with the PriceWaterhouseCooper accountants who are believe to be responsible for handing the wrong best picture envelope to host Warren Beatty. Kimmel said he had declined: “I told the Academy I didn’t want to do comedy with the accountants, so the accountants did the comedy on their own.” The late night host then pivoted to the sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the entertainment industry last year. He noted that the Oscar statuette is “the most beloved and respected man in Hollywood” due to having “no penis at all. He’s a literal statue of limitations.” Adopting a more serious tone, the host said that “what happened with Harvey [Weinstein] is long overdue”, and he praised the “brave and outspoken supporters” of organisations such as #MeToo and Time’s Up. He also saluted female nominees including Lady Bird director Greta Gerwig and Mudbound’s Rachel Morrison, the latter of whom is the first female nominee for cinematography in Oscars history. Kimmel added that advocates from various causes would be invited to speak during the ceremony. While Kimmel largely avoided the Trump-heavy tone of his monologue of last year, he did aim a few barbs at the current administration. In a segment on Jordan Peele’s race-relations horror movie Get Out, Kimmel said that Trump had declared the film “the best three quarters of a movie released last year” – alluding to the portion of the film in which Daniel Kaluuya’s African-American character is tormented by white supremacists. Kimmel also took aim at vice-president Mike Pence, who has been criticised for his gay rights record. “We don’t make films like Call Me By Your Name to make money, we make them to upset Mike Pence,” he said of the gay romantic drama. While Kimmel encouraged award winners to speak on whatever subject they wanted to – including, he said, the recent Parkland high school shooting – he did ask that they kept their speeches brief. He explained that the winner who made the shortest speech of the night would win a brand-new jet ski, which was then modelled by Helen Mirren. The British actor was “not included”, Kimmel noted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/datablog/2018/mar/07/a-new-dawn-how-a-new-coach-can-impact-an-nrl-club","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"A new dawn: how a new coach can impact an NRL club | Nick Tedeschi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2018/mar/07/a-new-dawn-how-a-new-coach-can-impact-an-nrl-club","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/datablog/2018/mar/07/a-new-dawn-how-a-new-coach-can-impact-an-nrl-club","fields":{"headline":"A new dawn: how a new coach can impact an NRL club","bodyText":"Nothing in rugby league brings hope like a new coach. Fresh beginnings. The start of a different path. Optimism is at a premium, even if there is a degree of uncertainty over whether the latest man to sit in the hot seat can get it done. This season South Sydney, Canterbury and Gold Coast get to wave goodbye to the frustration of yesteryear and say hello to hope and anticipation: Souths sacked Michael Maguire after six seasons, replacing him with assistant Anthony Seibold; Des Hasler lasted the same time at Canterbury before he was unceremoniously dumped and former Bulldogs hardman Dean Pay took the reins; and after three tumultuous years at the Titans, Neil Henry was axed, replaced by Penrith lower grade prodigy Garth Brennan. With the big kick-off nearly upon us, what can fans expect, based on the records of the 63 full-time hires made by NRL clubs since 2000? Defensive improvements When a new coach takes over, this is the most obvious statistical change for a club. It is also a smart one. Defence has been the biggest indicator of success since 2006 with nearly every grand finalist ranking in the top two in points allowed during the regular season. Teams have improved by an average of over 31 points per season defensively, relative to just eight points in attack. And defence has improved significantly with 19 coaches improving their new team by 100 or more points a season defensively in their first year while three have bettered their new team’s defence by 300-plus points. Eight of those teams who had their defence improved by 100 or more points a season played in a grand final within four years with five winning premierships. Among those have been Craig Bellamy at Melbourne, Trent Robinson and Ricky Stuart at the Roosters, and John Lang at Penrith. Attack in the balance Since 2000, a new coach has registered an improvement for their new team’s attack 33 times while it has gone backwards 30 times. The average improvement is just eight points. Only eight teams have improved an attack by over 100 points. Five of those eight reached a decider in the first three years under the new mentor so a leap in attack is a big indicator of success. But such a jump should not be expected. The right direction New coaches need to show immediate improvement in at least one area or their tenure is doomed. Since 2000, 20 coaches have taken over and that team went backwards in both scoring and defence in year one. Only Geoff Toovey at Manly in 2013 has gone on to make a grand final. Those coaches have gone on to win five wooden spoons. Thirteen of those 20 coaches did not see out three full seasons at the helm of their new club. Going backwards in both attack and defence in the first year is almost a definite indication that the coach will not bring any form of success to the club. Immediate finals are unlikely A new coach is a less-than-even money shot to take his team to the final in the first year. Since 2000, just 22 of the 63 coaches (34.92%) have taken over a club and led them to the finals immediately. While teams on average improve by 1.06 wins under the new mentor – with first-time coaches improving their teams by an impressive 1.56 wins (compared to 0.52 wins under recycled coaches) – it typically doesn’t lead to finals footy in the first year. A total of 33 teams improved by at least one win, 17 by four wins and four by nine wins but the odds of shooting straight to the finals are just short of two-to-one. While it is a popular narrative that teams should and do improve significantly in the second year of their tenure, the stats don’t play that out with an improvement of 1.42 wins from the original win tally. When a new coach is hired, 38 of the 63 teams make the finals in at least one of the two years after a hired while 25 don’t reach the playoffs in either of the first two seasons. Just 15 new hires reach the finals in the first two seasons of their tenure. It will most likely end in dismissal Of the 51 NRL coaches hired full-time since 2000 and now gone from the club, 41 were sacked. Five only saw one season. There were 23 who didn’t see out more than two seasons. Two of those 23 – Graham Murray in 2000 and Daniel Anderson in 2009 – reached the grand final while they claimed six wooden spoons between them. Just 14 of the 63 coaches lasted five or more years at the club with 10 of those 14 taking their team to a premiership. There seems to be a one-in-six chance the new coach delivers a title. And even then, he will likely get the chop. There are certainly no guarantees in the world of rugby league coaching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/04/roger-bannister-gentleman-almost-never-ran-race-defined-him","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T20:15:26Z","webTitle":"Roger Bannister, a gentleman who almost didn’t run race that defined him | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/04/roger-bannister-gentleman-almost-never-ran-race-defined-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/04/roger-bannister-gentleman-almost-never-ran-race-defined-him","fields":{"headline":"Roger Bannister, a gentleman who almost didn’t run race that defined him","bodyText":"Even now, 64 years on, 3:59.4 is a number recognisable to every sports fan – and one that instantly unlocks sepia images in the mind’s eye. Of Sir Roger Bannister hurling his body across the line in a desperate bid to make history. Of an expectant crowd around him. And then the deafening roar – and the sweetest release – as the crowd hears he has become the first person to run the mile in under four minutes. Sir Roger was later to become a prominent neurologist but by then he already knew the power of the mind. As he admitted, he imagined bombs and machine guns would rain down on him if he did not go at absolute full pelt. Yet Bannister’s record for the ages, achieved on 6 May 1954, nearly never took place. For after working in a hospital that morning, he almost decided not to travel to the Iffley Road track in Oxford because of high winds. However a chance meeting with his coach, Franz Stampfl, convinced him otherwise. Stampfl told him: “If you pass it up today you may never forgive yourself for the rest of your life.” Yet it was only 30 minutes before the race was due to start at 6pm that Bannister decided he would compete. “My pacemakers Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway were getting a little impatient,” he told me in 2014. “They were saying: ‘Make up your mind!’ But it was I who had to do it. I was very concerned about the weather but when the wind dropped it proved just possible.” Bannister’s performance was more remarkable still given his lack of training. He would skip his gynaecology lectures, enabling him to run for 45 minutes at lunchtime, and did only 35 miles a week. What is also forgotten is Bannister had felt “stale” a month before breaking the record and so had decided on a radical strategy: a three-day break to go hiking. It was, he admitted, “bordering on the lunatic”. But there was a method to the madness. It gave Bannister time away from training and took his mind off the record attempt. His key training session involved 10 repetitions of 400m with short rest periods between each lap – his aim being to do each one in around 60 seconds. Before his break he had struggled. Afterwards he took flight – and suddenly laps of 59 seconds felt easy. But Bannister still had to break a barrier many thought was physiologically impossible. When I spoke to him on the 60th anniversary of his achievement he talked through the race fluently but dispassionately. The anger he felt after a false start by his first pacemaker, Brasher. Then feeling so full of energy on the first lap he was shouting: “Faster!” And then the fear at the end of the 62.4sec third lap when the record appeared to be slipping away. “I heard the lap times as they went by,” he says. “The first was 58. The half-mile 1.58. But the three‑quarters was three minutes and one second so I knew I had to produce a last lap of under 59. “I was also unsure whether I should start my finish immediately or wait another 150 yards and overtake Chataway in the back straight. I decided I would stay a bit longer and then went. There was plenty of adrenaline then, I can assure you!” When his effort was spent he collapsed, almost unconscious. He described feeling like “an exploded flashbulb” but he had the record. And it changed him. As he put it: “I suddenly and gloriously felt free from the burden of athletic ambition I had been carrying for years.” His record lasted six weeks before the Australian John Landy lowered it by more than a second. But later in 1954, when the pair met at the Empire Games in Vancouver, Bannister emerged triumphant after an epic contest – later called, with complete justification, the Miracle Mile – coming from 15 yards down with a surprise sprint off the last bend. “I felt it was a piece of unfinished business to be able to reproduce the performance of my sub-four-minute mile in a race,” Bannister said. “And I ran the final lap in the last race I had in England beforehand in 53 seconds to persuade Landy that his best chance was to run me off my feet. “However at the half-mile he looked as though he was doing it. He was 15 yards ahead and I thought either he’s going to break a world record in 3min 56sec or he’s going to have to slow. But I managed to catch him by the bell – and then I just managed to choose the right moment to take him by surprise.” It is often said when someone dies that “we will never see their like again” but in Bannister’s case it is almost certainly true. For having won the Empire Games and European Championships in 1954 he then hung up his spikes aged just 25 – at his absolute prime – to focus on medicine. Bannister admitted in 2014: “If I were to start running today I could not combine training with being a medical student. “Most top athletes will train two-three hours a day, whereas I would run half an hour – very hard – five days a week.” But while the last of the gentleman athletes has left us - his legacy will endure for ever.

Thames Water has faced criticism for resorting to handing out bottled water to customers after up to 20,000 properties in London and the Thames valley had their supplies cut off. The company apologised and said the number of homes without water was now down to 12,000 – and falling – as engineers battled to fix widespread disruption to the water supply. Anglian Water, Severn Trent, Southern Water, Welsh Water, Wessex Water, Yorkshire Water, South West Water, Scottish Water and United Utilities all said they had received reports of customers experiencing problem with their pipelines. Meanwhile, a number of schools said they would be forced to close on Monday because they did not have running water. Thames Water customers have expressed frustration on social media and criticised the company for not providing more convenient access to water. The company has been inundated with messages from customers and many took to Twitter to say their complaints had not been answered. Others offered to help vulnerable neighbours. Problems began late on Saturday night, though the company’s network had been experiencing issues with freezing pipes since Thursday. Addresses in SW16, SW17 and SW18; NW2, NW3, NW5 and NW11; N2, N6, N10 and N19 were the worst affected, according to a company spokesperson. Thames Water has not said when households can expect water supplies to return, but said engineers were working around the clock to resolve the problems. It said: “We’ve seen an increase in leaks and bursts on our network, which we are urgently dealing with as fast as we possibly can. But the sudden and widespread surge in demand, coinciding with the rise in temperatures, means we also need to urge all our customers to check their own pipes for bursts and call a plumber if necessary. “We are getting as much extra water into our network as we can and sincerely apologise to all our customers who are currently without water or who have low pressure. “Our teams are working hard to prioritise services for vulnerable customers and stand up locations from which our customers can collect bottled water.” The company is handing out water at two locations and they will remain in place overnight: Hampstead No 1 Pond car park, East Heath Road, NW3 2RJ and Homebase, 100 Woodgate Drive, Streatham Vale, SW16 5YP. Thames Valley issued a joint statement with South East Water, Southern Water and Affinity Water, which urged customers to use as little water as possible “while things get back to normal”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/06/brain-prize-winner-calls-brexit-a-disaster-for-the-nhs-and-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T14:22:33Z","webTitle":"Brain prize winner calls Brexit a 'disaster' for the NHS and science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/06/brain-prize-winner-calls-brexit-a-disaster-for-the-nhs-and-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/06/brain-prize-winner-calls-brexit-a-disaster-for-the-nhs-and-science","fields":{"headline":"Brain prize winner calls Brexit a 'disaster' for the NHS and science","bodyText":"A predicted exodus of European doctors, nurses and care workers following Brexit will be disastrous for Alzheimer’s patients and their families, according to a pioneering dementia scientist who was on Tuesday named as a joint recipient of the world’s most prestigious prize in neuroscience. Speaking at a press conference in London ahead of the announcement of the winners of the 2018 Brain prize, Prof John Hardy, of University College London, described the UK leaving the EU as an “unmitigated disaster for science and an unmitigated disaster for the health service”, adding that he planned to donate some of his prize money to the anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain. Hardy shares the €1m prize from the Lundbeck Foundation in Denmark with Prof Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, Prof Michel Goedert of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Prof Christian Haass of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich. Together the scientists helped map out the genetics and biological processes that underpin the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s. Hardy said NHS services have already been left “close to collapse” because, as the number of patients with dementia in the UK has risen to nearly 1m, funding has not kept pace. If doctors and care staff leave the country in significant numbers the system will be placed under even more severe pressure, Hardy said. “When you go around the hospitals, so many of the geriatricians and neurologists are Europeans, and the nurses and carers,” he said. “As a society we’re not doing very well, and the indications are we’re going to do even worse.” Hardy described the field of dementia research that he encountered in the early 1980s as “a real backwater” and said extraordinary progress on understanding the pathology of the disease had been made since then. “The first conference only attracted 40 people, but now thousands attend,” he said. In the late 1980s, Hardy’s team at UCL began studying a family from Nottingham who had been blighted by early-onset Alzheimer’s for several generations. Blood tests uncovered a genetic mutation in a stretch of DNA linked to the production of amyloid protein. “We put that pathology into order,” he said. “Instead of basically seeing a car crash of pathology we could say that happened first.” De Strooper further advanced the so-called amyloid hypothesis by identifying the role of a protein, presenilin, that “cuts” other brain proteins into smaller segments. De Strooper showed that a faulty version of the presenilin gene results in the production of an abnormal version of amyloid, leading to the formation of tangles and sticky plaques in the brain. Together, the findings suggested that if a drug could be found to block the production of amyloid or stop its accumulation, the disease might be slowed or prevented. However, 30 years on, no drug has been shown to slow the progression of the disease – current treatments only alleviate symptoms. Successive failures of drug trials have led to many pharmaceutical companies – most recently Pfizer – pulling the plug on their neuroscience programmes. Hardy describes this as a “great disappointment”. “Things are more hopeful now from a scientific point of view and an understanding point of view than they were five years ago,” he said. “I think pharma is making a mistake pulling out.” The successive trial failures have led some to question whether the amyloid hypothesis is misguided but Hardy believes it should remain a focus, arguing that many of the failures could be down to trials involving patients who are already in the late stages of disease. More recent research suggests that amyloid can start accumulating in the brain 15-20 years before symptoms occur. “It’s like popping a statin to treat a heart attack – the right drug but the wrong time,” he said. Goedert discovered that along with amyloid, another protein, tau, is implicated in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Haass’s lab has produced a series of breakthroughs that allowed scientists to link together the cascade of biological steps, starting with amyloid production, the development of plaques and the eventual death of neurons that result in memory loss. Haass said he hoped the prize would put a spotlight on the potential for science to lead to social good. “We are facing a time when more and more people don’t believe in science any more,” he said. “Science is not always right, but it is the only way to go to find the truth and for humans to progress.” The scientists will be presented with the prize on 9 May in Copenhagen by Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/04/wakefield-huddersfield-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T18:32:30Z","webTitle":"Wakefield keep up 100% record as Ben Jones-Bishop sinks Huddersfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/04/wakefield-huddersfield-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/04/wakefield-huddersfield-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wakefield keep up 100% record as Ben Jones-Bishop sinks Huddersfield","bodyText":"For the first time since 1945, Wakefield Trinity have won their opening four league games in the top flight as they continue to suggest they could be an unlikely force this season. This latest victory, a hard-earned effort against Huddersfield, perhaps best justified the pre-season belief some had that Trinity – perennially one of the strugglers – may be Super League title contenders this season. They remain one of only two sides, alongside the favourites St Helens, who remain unbeaten after the first month. The critics will point out that Wakefield’s opening fixtures have been against the so-called weaker sides. That may or may not be true but in winning four games they have shown a resolve so often seen in sides who can last the distance throughout the course of a season. For large periods of this ferocious Yorkshire derby, the hosts were put under enormous pressure by Huddersfield. The old Wakefield would have buckled but not this team. After coming so close to a top-four finish in 2017, there was a suspicion Wakefield could challenge the game’s elite this time, despite being one of the lowest spenders in the competition. How far they have come will be put to the test on Sunday at Wigan but Wakefield will head across the Pennines confident. “It’ll be a different kettle of fish but if we turn up with that desire and attitude, we’re a force to be reckoned with,” their coach, Chris Chester, said. Defence was the backbone of this latest performance, with Lee Gaskell’s try five minutes before half-time all Huddersfield could muster. Ben Jones‑Bishop’s try, coupled with a Liam Finn goal, had put Wakefield ahead before a decisive passage of play after half-time. In 14 second‑half minutes Huddersfield conceded seven consecutive penalties, with the final one in that sequence seeing Kruise Leeming sent to the sin-bin. Finn had kicked two penalties before, with their man advantage, Trinity went further ahead when a Finn kick found Jones-Bishop unmarked in the corner. The Ireland international converted – just as he did two minutes from time when Mason Caton-Brown scored to seal Wakefield’s unbeaten start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-cycling-and-the-law-good-manners-needed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T18:21:00Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on cycling and the law: good manners needed | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-cycling-and-the-law-good-manners-needed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-cycling-and-the-law-good-manners-needed","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on cycling and the law: good manners needed","bodyText":"Hard cases make bad law. The tragic – genuinely tragic – death of Kim Briggs, a pedestrian in London who was hit by a cyclist as she crossed a busy road, and died of her injuries, has now led to the proposed introduction of an offence of causing death by dangerous cycling, to match the existing offence of causing death by dangerous driving. As the law then stood, Charlie Alliston, then 18, who killed Ms Briggs, could only be charged under a Victorian statute, even though it was argued that by riding a bike which had only a back brake he was not only breaking the law, but doing so with a culpable disregard for the safety of other road users. Both the case and the resulting proposed law highlight the extent to which cycling has become a front in the culture wars. The bicycle started off as a symbol of liberation at the end of the 19th century. It allowed young people – especially young women – an astonishing degree of freedom and autonomy. In the mid-20th century it became a symbol of honest, unpretentious transport for anyone who could not afford a car. Mrs Thatcher’s grim employment secretary, Norman Tebbit, used the example of his father “Who got on his bike and looked for work” as a way to damn slackers and scroungers. Forty years later, the meaning has changed again and the bike is associated with everything reactionaries believe is wrong with modern Britain. Tebbit senior’s bike would have had a frame of British steel that could batter any potholes which dared argue with it. The only soft part would have been the saddle. The modern carbon-fibre bike has disc brakes, innumerable electrically operated gears and a saddle so advanced it is only comfortable in special padded underwear. It seems to demand a different sort of character. What poisons relations is when one side – or both – feels morally superior to the other. Cycling in many parts of many cities is frankly terrifying. Yet there is an important paradox here: cyclists are statistically less likely to be killed on the road than pedestrians, although they are much more likely to be injured in accidents. This is not just proof that the health risks of physical inactivity far outweigh those of cycling (or walking in cities). It also highlights a strange fact about the psychology of cycling, since no one feels especially brave when they set out to walk down the road, even if this carries a 20% higher risk of a fatal accident than cycling does. In Britain, 29.5 cyclists were killed for every billion miles ridden in 2016; 34.5 pedestrians died in accidents for every billion miles walked. Of course, children are trained from an early age that cars are dangerous so that pedestrians have now entirely interiorised their own inferiority relative to cars and feel there is nothing unnatural in their vulnerability. Cycling, by contrast, can be touched with exhilaration. Car driving caters to the same feelings of omnipotence, as any car advertisement on the television shows. But the cyclist in a traffic jam can feel free while the driver is horribly conscious of being imprisoned there. This does not have an improving effect on the character. Anyone familiar with city traffic in Britain will have seen cyclists, as well as car drivers, behaving with disregard for other road users. But when car drivers make mistakes they are still physically safe. It is the cyclist or pedestrian who pays the price for arrogant drivers. Cycling does in fact have all the moral and physical benefits claimed for it but that should not make cyclists the objects of resentment. Some cyclists, however, need to remember their common humanity with the humble pedestrian. • This article was amended on 5 March 2018 to comply with our style guide on gender issues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:03:20Z","webTitle":"Woman behind 'inclusion rider' explains Frances McDormand's Oscar speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/what-is-an-inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars-2018","fields":{"headline":"Woman behind 'inclusion rider' explains Frances McDormand's Oscar speech","bodyText":"Many people watching the Oscars were left scratching their heads when Frances McDormand finished her speech with the phrase “I have two words for you: inclusion rider.” An “inclusion rider” is a clause that an actor can insist be inserted in their contract that requires cast and crew on a film to meet a certain level of diversity. The concept was explored in a TED talk in 2016 by Stacy Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California. Having examined the data on diversity in US-produced films, which showed that casting was not representative of the population, she suggested that an “equity clause” or an “inclusion rider” could be part of the solution. “The typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it” she explained. “I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story. The remaining 30 or so roles, there’s no reason why those minor roles can’t match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place. An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live.” Smith has likened the implementation of it to the NFL’s Rooney Rule. McDormand was awarded best actress for her performance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. She opened by saying “If I fall over, pick me up because I’ve got some things to say”, and then went on to urge all of the female nominees in the room to stand up. After McDormand’s speech, some actors immediately offered public support to the idea on social media, with Brie Larson committing to it. In an interview late Sunday night, Smith said she was shocked and grateful to hear that McDormand had given a shout out to her work. “I’m utterly elated,” she told the Guardian by phone. “It’s a complete surprise.” Smith said she had worked with attorneys to create specific contract language and has already been in touch with numerous actors interested in the idea. “The real goal is to counter bias in the auditioning and casting process,” she said, explaining that the contract could also stipulate that if the film ultimately failed to meet the requirements, the distributor would have to pay a “penalty” to a fund that supports female directors and other underrepresented groups. Smith said A-list stars could use inclusion riders to ensure proper representation and inclusion of women, people of color, LGBT people and people with disabilities. “The goal is that talent can take the inclusion rider and adopt it in ways that make sense for their values and their beliefs,” she said. Earlier this year, actor Octavia Spencer revealed that Jessica Chastain had fought for her to make a significantly higher salary by negotiating a joint deal on an upcoming film. Smith said inclusion riders could be used to ensure fair pay on sets: “The goal here is to really put it in the hands of the most powerful people.” The professor added that she hopes McDormand’s speech helps the idea spread throughout the industry: “I hope I get calls from the agencies tomorrow saying they want to adopt this across all talent … I’m hoping to make a lot of attorneys really busy.” Backstage after her win, McDormand said she had recently learned of the concept, adding: “You can ask for or demand at least 50% diversity in not only the casting and the crew. The fact that I just learned that after 35 years in the film business – we aren’t going back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/05/monday-briefing-italy-rides-europes-populist-wave","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:25:20Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Italy rides Europe's populist wave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/monday-briefing-italy-rides-europes-populist-wave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/05/monday-briefing-italy-rides-europes-populist-wave","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Italy rides Europe's populist wave","bodyText":"Top story: Huge defeat for centre-left government Italy faces a hung parliament after exit polls forecast that more than half of the votes cast in the country’s general election went to populist parties in a devastating rejection of the centre-left government. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement looks like being the biggest party with 31% of the vote, a remarkable result for a party formed nine years ago by the comedian, Beppe Grillo. Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right coalition won 36% of the votes and hopes to form a government. If the coalition does secure a majority, the 81-year-old Berlusconi would not be allowed to become prime minister again because of a tax conviction. That would potentially clear the way to power for Matteo Salvini, leader of coalition partner the League (formerly known as the Northern League) and a man who wants immigrants to be deported en masse. Our Rome correspondent, Stephanie Kirchgaessner, says Italians will nevertheless wake up this morning with no idea who their next prime minister will be. Forecasts have been wrong before and there is much horse trading to be done under the country’s complicated electoral system. But it is clear that Italians, following the populist pattern of Brexit, Emmanuel Macron’s victory in France and huge gains by the far-right party AfD in Germany, have rejected the centre-left government of Matteo Renzi and his campaign message of economic recovery.

Wiggins became one of the country’s most celebrated athletes after his ground-breaking victory in cycling’s greatest race, which he followed up with a gold medal a month later at the London Olympics. But a long-awaited report by the Commons select committee for digital, culture, media and sport concludes that Team Sky abused the anti-doping system to allow Wiggins, and possibly support riders, to take powerful corticosteroids to prepare them for the Tour de France. Team Sky has always claimed that Wiggins took the decongestant fluimucil but MPs say they found this explanation “implausible” and that they believe he took corticosteroids to improve his power-to-weight ratio before the race. Wiggins denies the claims and says he hopes to “have his say” in the coming days. The report could signal the end for Team Sky and its manager, Sir David Brailsford, who are already under investigation after their star rider Chris Froome failed a drug test in December. Our sports news correspondent Martha Kelner asks how much longer this organisation can continue “when every scintilla of credibility they had as a completely clean team has been decimated by another inquiry”. * * * ‘Put the kettle on, Mum’ – Gary Oldman triumphed over fellow British nominees Daniel Day-Lewis and Daniel Kaluuya to win the Oscar for best actor for his role as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour at the Academy Awards in Hollywood. In his acceptance speech, the Londoner thanked the movie industry for “giving him a dream” and told his 99-year-old mother: “Put the kettle on, I’m bringing Oscar home.” But it fell to Frances McDormand, a popular winner of best actress for Three Billboards, to electrify the audience with a rousing speech in which she exhorted all female nominees to stand up and urged producers to back their projects. She concluded: “I have two words to leave with you tonight, ‘inclusion rider’.” She was referring to a Hollywood contractual term which requires cast and crew on a film to meet a certain level of diversity. The best picture award went to the cold war fantasy thriller The Shape of Water, and the film’s director, Guillermo del Toro, made it a double triumph by picking up the Oscar for his work. Sam Rockwell won best supporting actor for Three Billboards, while Allison Janney won best supporting actress for her dark turn as the mother of the ice skater Tonya Harding in I, Tonya.

Willetts, now head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, will say in a speech today that although his proposed 15p income tax rise for wealthy homeowners and pensioners would be “unpalatable” for many Tories, the debate can no longer be delayed. He also wants the “regressive” council tax replaced with a property tax. * * * Carillion fail – The government failed to force the directors of the collapsed contracting giant Carillion to adopt a restructuring plan that could have saved millions of pounds in public money. Several sources have told the Guardian that the consultants EY devised a plan in December to sell off profitable parts of the company and place the rest into liquidation, avoiding an involuntary collapse. The plan could have salvaged £364m, EY believed, and reduced the £1bn deficit of the company’s 13 pension schemes, a chunk of which must now be covered by taxpayers. But ministers believed it was not appropriate to advise Carillion’s directors what to do. * * * Loss of appetite – Brexit has copped the blame for a lot of things, from the fall in the pound to a rise in racist attacks. But it also seems that it has put us off our food – or at least eating out in restaurants. A new study says that one in three of the UK’s top 100 restaurant groups are making a loss as households reconsider their budgets in the wake of uncertainty around leaving the EU, says the report by accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.

Lunchtime read: The inhumanity of Britain’s immigration system Our columnist Nesrine Malik offers the fascinating, astounding fact that there have been 45,000 changes to the UK’s immigration laws since Theresa May became home secretary in 2010. And Nesrine should know: she’s been battling to win British citizenship for most of that time. She details that battle today in a powerful account of a process so dehumanising that she describes feeling only “exhaustion and sadness” when she finally became British last year. All she looked forward to, she says, was that she would never have to think about any of it again. She longed to feel integrated by her love of Britain but found the process blighted by what she calls the “administrative incompetence and politically instructed cruelty” to fulfil targets on migration that the government cannot meet and is too proud to jettison. Sport Antonio Conte branded the Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville “stupid” after they described Chelsea’s display in their 1-0 defeat by Manchester City as “anti-football” and “embarrassing”.

The Guardian also has the story on its front but splashes on news that the government could have recouped millions of pounds for taxpayers from Carillion – but did not pursue a proposed rescue plan in December. The Mirror has a picture of the late Roger Bannister on the front and a story alleging a person was given a job in the NHS despite having been jailed for a scam involving it.

The most likely result of the national election seemed either a win by the centre-right coalition headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the 81-year-old former prime minister, or a hung parliament in which populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the xenophobic Northern League – would have considerable influence in the creation of a new government. The ruling centre-left Democratic party has already admitted defeat after coming in third according to projections. “This is a very clear defeat for us,” said minister Maurizio Martina. “We are expecting a result below our expectations ... This is very clearly a negative result for us.” Andrea Marcucci, one of the party’s senators in the outgoing parliament, wrote on his Facebook page: “Voters have spoken very clearly and irrefutably. The populists have won and the Democratic party has lost.” The preliminary results showed Berlusconi’s coalition – which includes the Northern League – winning about 37% of the vote, a result that could potentially help the billionaire media magnate clinch a fourth election victory under a complicated Italian election law. Analysts were also poring over early data that suggested another potential political upset: Matteo Salvini, the firebrand head of La Lega – as the Northern League is now known – beating out Berlusconi within the centre-right coalition. Under a “gentleman’s agreement”, whoever emerges as the winner between the two will choose the next prime minister, if the coalition were to win a majority. Berlusconi is not eligible to serve personally because of a previous tax conviction, but said he would choose Antonio Tajani, the European parliament president, as prime minister. Two facts seemed indisputable: that Italian voters, who have traditionally been risk-averse, were ready to ditch the big mainstream parties, and that the centre-left party headed by Matteo Renzi had an abysmal election. “The results are still very unclear,” said Giovanni Orsina, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “The odds are still that there is no majority in parliament. But what is clear is that the centre left were punished. Italians didn’t buy the story of Italy getting better. At least the majority of them did not.” The Italian economy has significantly improved in since the dark days of the 2011 economic crisis and the PD has taken strong – and controversial – measures to try to stem the flow of migrants into Italy in recent months, but the party was hammered regardless – in part because of the prevailing view that Renzi is out of touch, untrustworthy, and that change has not happened fast enough under his leadership. Whatever the final outcome, exit polls and partial results appeared to reveal a monumental shift in a majority of Italian voters. If the centre-right fails to clinch a majority, then the Five Star Movement, an anti-establishment party that was founded nine years ago by former comedian Beppe Grillo, will emerge as the single most powerful party in Italy and decisive in a future coalition, having won up to 31% of the vote, according to early results that were not yet final. Among other controversial views, the Five Star has expressed deep reservations about the euro – until recently it promised to call a referendum on Italy’s participation in the eurozone – questioned Italy’s role in Nato, and does not support mandatory vaccinations. In the likely event of a hung parliament, there are several parliamentary combinations that could be cobbled together to win a majority of seats, many of which would pair unlikely bedfellows. Under some scenarios, the Five Star Movement could combine with the Democratic party to get to above 50%. “Building a majority in parliament will be hard if not impossible. An extended period of horse-trading among the parties is next,” said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence. Parliamentary maths could also allow a majority to emerge through a combination of the Five Star Movement and the Northern League. But Piccoli said chances of such a coalition deal were “very low”. While both parties are eurosceptic, pro-Kremlin, and anti-free trade, the Northern League’s view are far to the right, particularly on the migration issue, while many Five Star voters identify with the Italian left."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/04/antonio-conte-chelsea-jamie-redknapp-gary-neville-sky-sports","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T20:08:18Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte hits back at comments by Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/04/antonio-conte-chelsea-jamie-redknapp-gary-neville-sky-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/04/antonio-conte-chelsea-jamie-redknapp-gary-neville-sky-sports","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte hits back at comments by Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville","bodyText":"Antonio Conte branded the Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville “stupid” after they described Chelsea’s display in their 1-0 defeat by Manchester City as “anti-football” and “embarrassing” respectively. A Bernardo Silva goal seconds into the second half handed Chelsea a fourth league defeat in their past five matches and stretched City’s lead over Liverpool to 18 points, though Manchester United can cut that to 16 if they beat Crystal Palace on Monday night. Redknapp also labelled Chelsea’s performance as a “crime against football” while Neville, who was on co-commentary duties at the Etihad Stadium, said the visiting players had performed like “mannequins”. Informed of the comments, Conte said: “The pundit has to use the head to understand when you speak about tactics. I think you must have knowledge to speak about tactics and not only to speak in a stupid way. You have to accept every criticism but I am not so stupid to play against Manchester City open and to lose 3-0 or 4-0. “If I remember well, Arsenal played twice against them and then you [media] criticise a lot [Arsène] Wenger because they concede three goals in only 30 minutes.” Asked to explain the poor run of form, he said: “We must have big regrets for the defeat against Bournemouth and Watford, against Manchester United but I don’t think today because we played against a team that are shown to be a strong team. “Today they showed the difference between them and us. When you play against City, this kind of team, they are showing fantastic quality but at the same time fantastic mentality. When you match quality and mentality you become unstoppable.” Pep Guardiola wants City to beat the record Premier League points total of 95, though his prime focus is on securing the title after the win left them needing four more victories. “Yes, of course, but we’re not going to play for the records, we are going to play good, to win the games and after it will be a consequence of that,” he said. “Records are always a consequence of what you have done but if you think about the records you forget what you have to do.” Guardiola admitted City’s lead was not expected. “No way – who could believe it? Not just the results but the way we play today was another demonstration [of how good we are]. That is when I’m pleased the most but, of course, could I expect after what happened the previous season, with five or six contenders, to have the distance from many teams now – 25 to Chelsea, 33 to Arsenal is a lot – it’s March. They made good results but we were so good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/04/harlequins-bath-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T19:08:38Z","webTitle":"Kyle Sinckler the bulldozer steps in to give Harlequins win over Bath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/04/harlequins-bath-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/04/harlequins-bath-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Sinckler the bulldozer steps in to give Harlequins win over Bath","bodyText":"Kyle Sinckler sets about winning his England place back on Monday with a spring in his step after a timely reminder of his talents, coming off the bench and almost immediately bulldozing over for the decisive try in Harlequins’ gritty win against Bath – a first in the Premiership in 2018. Sinckler has not played for England since last year’s Six Nations but the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the start of this year’s tournament is behind him and, having been named in England’s training squad to prepare for France over the weekend, he is back on Eddie Jones’s radar. “He’s an unbelievable guy who wears his heart on his sleeve and is hugely passionate,” the Harlequins director of rugby, John Kingston, said. Sinckler’s impact was in direct contrast to that of the Bath replacement prop Max Lahiff, who was introduced a few minutes earlier but was in the sin-bin less than 60 seconds after coming on. Harlequins took advantage of their extra man, with Sinckler powering over from close range to give the home side a lead too big for Bath to claw back. It was the pivotal moment of a match that was poor on quality but was ultimately enough to stop another rot for Harlequins, who had lost their previous four league matches – another sign of their struggles during the international windows. For Bath, ill-discipline was their downfall – they shipped 15 penalties – and they are down to seventh in the table, in danger of allowing their season to slip away. “The discipline killed us again,” Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, said. “We’re starting to question if we can learn, whether the boys are actually listening. Something within us internally has to fundamentally change.” It was far from a vintage Harlequins performance but it was warmly received by the supporters who made the trip after the weather had forced the match to be delayed by 48 hours. Following the announcement last week of their partnership with the All Blacks, things are beginning to look up against for Harlequins. Demetri Catrakilis – making his first start since breaking a bone in his throat in early September – eventually got Harlequins going after Bath had dominated the early exchanges. Matt Banahan had opened the scoring after Taulupe Faletau, who got through another 80 minutes to prove he is ready to return for Wales, picked up from the base of a scrum, fed Kahn Fotuali’i, who in turn put the Bath winger clear in the right corner. James Wilson missed the subsequent conversion and it was his pass, near the Harlequins 22, that was picked off by Tim Visser, who streaked clear and under the posts for his ninth try of the season. Catrakilis was then on target with a penalty on the half hour mark to stretch his side’s lead. Not long after the restart Lahiff entered, then promptly exited, before Sinckler showed him how it is done, notching his first Premiership try since the final day of the 2015-16 season. Catrakilis converted before Bath rallied and were twice denied by the TMO. Marcus Smith added a late penalty before the 18-year-old was agonisingly short of running in a long-range try in the final minute, chased down by Mercer over all of 60 yards. Mercer has graduated from apprentice status with England while Smith is yet to – perhaps that was a demonstration of why. Leicester up to fifth after Manu Tuilagi inspires bonus point-win against Worcester Manu Tuilagi scored his second try in as many matches as Leicester moved up to fifth in the Premiership table with a bonus point win at Worcester. Tuilagi touched down with two minutes left on the clock as a late flurry of three tries in the last 11 minutes – Telusa Veainu scored the other – put the gloss on a 34-5 victory and sealed the bonus point. It is a third straight win for the Tigers, who are now just three points off the top four, after Jonah Holmes had put them on their way with the opening try after 12 minutes. Alafoti Fa’osiliva registered for Worcester but Greg Bateman scored Leicester’s second try and Matt Toomua was on target with a penalty before Tuilagi and Veainu cut loose late on. It means Worcester remain in 11th place, still 12 points above London Irish after the Exiles left Wasps empty-handed in another agonising defeat. London Irish trailed 17-16 after Petrus du Plessis’s 75th-minute try but Tommy Bell missed the conversion that would have given Nick Kennedy’s side the lead. Wasps swiftly punished the visitors with Tom Cruse scoring his second try of the game to seal a 24-16 win. Tries from Cruse and Dan Robson – as well as a penalty from the fit-again Danny Cipriani – had put Wasps in a commanding 14-0 lead, but Irish rallied with Dave Porecki going over and Bell adding two penalties, either side of one from Cipriani. Du Plessis’s try gave Irish hope but ultimately they were unable to build on last weekend’s win over Worcester.

The last time a title-winning Chelsea team visited the side that was destined to succeed them they lost 2-1 to Leicester in December 2015 and promptly sacked their manager. This display is unlikely to accelerate Antonio Conte’s apparently inevitable summer departure, but a performance so stripped of ambition and attacking quality certainly reflected poorly on him. “My tactic was: don’t concede space between the lines,” he said. “If you concede space at Manchester City you risk losing with many goals down.” Aggressively stripping the team of the personnel and instructions necessary to effectively attack hardly affected Chelsea’s chances of avoiding defeat, it simply limited their losing margin. What Conte failed to see is that for a team of Chelsea’s recent history, ambition and resources an emphatic thrashing is not the only form of humiliation.

David Dein and pals failed to predict television money outstripping bums on seats as football’s major source of revenue, likewise an elite club’s ability to sponsor everything and partner with anything; Stan Kroenke isn’t as interested in a winning team as he is a profitable business, part of the reason Wenger has been retained so much longer than made sense; and a succession of talented players have shrunk and failed. Which is to say that the sooner Wenger leaves the better for everyone, him included – but plenty of others have failed in bringing us to this miserable point.

He gave a man‑of-the-match performance, not just for his goals but his attacking thrust. The South Korean is in good form but, as Spurs approach the biggest match of their season so far, against Juventus on Wednesday, he is not alone. Dele Alli, the subject of so much finger-wagging, laid on a superlative assist against Huddersfield. Christian Eriksen was quieter but still slid a single pass 40 yards through a crowd of half a dozen players. Érik Lamela and Lucas Moura got minutes from the bench, with the recruit from Paris Saint-Germain catching the eye once more. In many home games at Wembley, breaking through the opposition’s defensive line has proved hard for Spurs. But now they have greater attacking options than before and are firing. Can they make the difference in midweek?

Seven of Newcastle’s starting lineup played in the Championship last season – but a collection of modest talent restricted Jürgen Klopp’s flying team to three shots on target. Newcastle had two, but could not profit. “Three shots on target, I was surprised,” Benítez said. “We wanted to be strong in defence and create more in counterattack. We couldn’t do it, why? Because we have a very good team in front of us. We got into some good positions and we were running full pace but still we couldn’t beat them. When you pay money you pay money not just because of their technical ability. It’s the quality, the decisions and the physicality. Everything that is the difference between teams.” Andy Hunter • Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Newcastle United • Oxlade-Chamberlain hits out at Henry’s ‘stupid’ comments 5) Allardyce leaves his fate in hands of his players Sam Allardyce believes he is powerless to stop the Everton fans from barracking him, arguing it is only his players who can alter the views of the unhappy supporters about their increasingly unpopular manager. “The only people who can change the fans on what they think and what they say are the players,” the Everton manager said. “They have to go out and perform to a level and win matches and bring everybody back onside.” Supporters targeted Allardyce after he substituted Cenk Tosun and Gylfi Sigurdsson at Turf Moor but he is confident he can cope with the abuse. “I’ve been around long enough to know it comes your way sometimes. You have to be big enough to ride it out. It’s not nice, it’s not what you want to hear, but you’ve got to accept the responsibility when you’re the No 1. You take the good, the bad and the ugly with it.” Richard Jolly • Match report: Burnley 2-1 Everton 6) Hughton fires Brighton to verge of survival Brighton are almost there. The daunting nature of their run-in, with seven of their last 10 games against current members of the top eight, had been a source of unease, but a splendid upturn in form has hoisted them into the top half of a congested division. The manner in which they dismantled Arsenal in the opening half-hour here was a measure of their qualities. Glenn Murray has eight goals in 10 games and, while he has never been quick, mustered the most sprints in the in-game statistics. Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy are rugged defenders and spread panic at set pieces. Moreover, there is a balance and organisation to this team which will surely see them clear of trouble. That stems from their manager. “This group are working so hard, giving themselves every chance,” said Chris Hughton. He will not rest easy just yet but, on this evidence, cause for celebration is close. Dominic Fifield • Match report: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2-1 Arsenal 7) Mahrez plays waiting game to perfection Riyad Mahrez is the best player outside the Premier League’s current top five clubs and it will be no surprise if Manchester City, along with others, try to prise him away from Leicester again in the summer. Admirers must be impressed by how he has regained form after digesting the disappointment of being denied a move in January. His continued fine performances – including his wonderful stoppage-time equaliser against Bournemouth on Saturday – mean if and when he leaves the club where he made his name, it will be on good terms. “It was a difficult situation ... but I was very pleased with the way the fans have been with me throughout this – I thank them all,” Mahrez said after the match on Saturday. “While I am here, I will keep giving everything for this club.” That is how to ensure a happy ending for everyone. Paul Doyle • Match report: Leicester City 1-1 Bournemouth 8) Lambert gets his best players to give Stoke a chance A glance at the Premier League table and Stoke City, indeed, remain in the mire, but one defeat in six matches since Mark Hughes was sacked and Paul Lambert’s arrival and three draws in succession suggests they have other plans. Their failure to win matches – one victory since Christmas – might ultimately be their undoing and if the spirit Lambert has garnered is not enough, then they will not go quietly, at least. Jack Butland made some classy stops at St Mary’s, while Joe Allen’s cute passing and Xherdan Shaqiri’s quick thinking may yet just dig them out of their malaise. The biggest plus point, compared with Southampton, for example, is that their star players have not gone into hiding in the circumstances but rather come to the fore. “We have got players that can turn the game on a switch,” Lambert said. Ben Fisher • Match report: Southampton 0-0 Stoke City 9) Moyes not looking too far ahead for safety David Moyes had already admitted that West Ham’s next two matches, at home against Burnley and Southampton, could define their season, when it was put to him that the widely held view outside of the club is that a team with their attacking talent will be “fine” and survive without too many problems. “I’d like the message to be that ‘we’ll be fine’, but the truth of the matter is that we’re not,” Moyes said after a chastening defeat against Swansea. A couple of wins and a couple of draws could be enough for West Ham, yet the pressure will be on if they fail to perform in the next two matches, because they still have to play both Manchester clubs at home as well as Arsenal and Chelsea away. The main problem is not hard to identify: with 54 goals conceded, West Ham have the joint‑worst defensive record in the league. This was the fifth time this season they let in four goals. Stuart James • Match report: Swansea City 4-1 West Ham United 10) Richarlison needs a breather from first-team action Having arrived at Watford in August, Richarlison took the Premier League by storm, scoring five times in 12 appearances and generally impressing with his skill and strength. That now feels like a long time ago. The 20-year-old’s last goal came in November and this win against West Bromwich Albion made it five out of five league games under Javi Gracia that the Brazilian has been substituted. He reacted angrily to the decision and it is clear a situation is developing between player and manager, although the latter said: “I don’t think about the reaction of the players. I think only about the team.” Richarlison did catch the eye against West Brom with an acrobatic strike that flashed just wide, but overall he struggled to make an impact and it may be best if the forward is afforded a break. Away from the spotlight, Richarlison may just rediscover his early-season mojo.

No formal boycott was announced, but only two of the five supporting actress nominees – Alison Janney and Mary J Blige – were interviewed, while other prominent early arrivals such as Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd did not speak to him. Others he did speak to made remarks considered pointed by Twitter users: notably Taraji P Henson, who said: “The universe has a way of taking care of the good people, you know what I mean?” Before the ceremony Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, had called for Seacrest to be dropped from TV coverage of the Oscars’ red carpet, in the wake of the sexual harassment allegations against him from his former stylist. Speaking to Variety, Burke said that Seacrest should be removed from E!’s Oscars’ broadcast to avoid pressure on female celebrities over whether to avoid him or not. “They really shouldn’t send him [to the Oscars],” Burke said. “We shouldn’t have to make those choices of, ‘Do we or don’t we?’” “This is not about his guilt or innocence,” Burke added. “It’s about there being an accusation that’s alive, and until they sort it out, it’s really on E! News and shouldn’t be on us … It will let us know where they stand in terms of how respectful E! News is of this issue – and of women.” Seacrest, who began hosting E!’s Live from the Red Carpet in 2006, has been accused by stylist Suzie Hardy of aggressive sexual advances, groping and sexual molesting, including grabbing her vagina and rubbing against her with an erection, while the pair both worked for E!

Seacrest has denied the accusations, going public with them in November, calling them “reckless”, and also responding in Variety with a guest column entitled What Happened After I Was Wrongly Accused of Harassment. An investigation by an “outside counsel” on behalf of E! reported that there was “insufficient evidence to support the claims against Seacrest and therefore could not be substantiated”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/04/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T18:19:46Z","webTitle":"Bernardo Silva secures easy Manchester City victory over tame Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/04/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/04/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Bernardo Silva secures easy Manchester City victory over tame Chelsea","bodyText":"For once, it did not really feel necessary to go through all the well-worn superlatives that have accompanied Manchester City on their procession to the title. That is 14 successive home wins now in the Premier League. No team have ever racked up so many passes – 902 – since the league’s inception and Ilkay Gündogan’s total of 174 was another record for the modern era. Pep Guardiola’s side had won with something to spare and by the time it was all over, with an 18-point gap opening up at the top of the table, it was difficult to remember that it was the players wearing the darker shade of blue who were, in fact, the champions of England. For City, that honour will be theirs in a few weeks – quite possibly when Manchester United visit here on 7 April – whereas Chelsea should be embarrassed that those kind of record statistics could happen on their watch. They barely laid a glove on the team that, lest it be forgotten, finished 15 points below them last season and it was startling to see their regression, the ultra-defensive tactics employed by Antonio Conte’s side and, more than anything, the sheer lack of gumption at 1-0 to do anything about it. Chelsea are supposed to be a big club with lofty ambitions, but what does it say for the current team that they were the patsies on the day one of their rivals produced an unprecedented show of keep-ball? The only surprise was Guardiola’s men restricted themselves to Bernardo Silva’s goal 33 seconds into the second half and that, for all the intelligent promptings of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva and the flowering brilliance of Leroy Sané, they did not make it a more emphatic win. The home side played every sort of pass – 508 in the first half alone – but there were not too many of the killer variety. This was actually the first time in City’s winning run on their own ground that they have not managed at least two goals, but that seldom felt like an issue when their opponents were so vapid. No team can accumulate the kind of statistics City did here if they were being chased and harried and that, perhaps, was the most alarming aspect for Conte. N’Golo Kanté was missing because of a virus and, without their most combative player, it was startling to see the lack of enthusiasm among Chelsea’s players to make a tackle or raise their voices – anything to show they cared. Chelsea have now lost four of their past five league games and there was a telling moment late on, just before the amount of stoppage time was announced, when Conte withdrew Eden Hazard to bring on Álvaro Morata, giving the Spaniard all of four minutes to conjure up an equaliser. Hazard walked past his manager without even exchanging a look. Too much can be made of these moments sometimes, but the strained body language was reminiscent of a similar incident involving Hazard and José Mourinho, shortly before the Portuguese was sacked from Stamford Bridge in 2015. Conte explained afterwards that he had had to be realistic about City’s superior position and adapt his tactics accordingly. He had a point, but could they not have shown a touch more ambition? It was difficult to think of another side that has visited the Etihad Stadium this season and had so little impact, attacking-wise, and Conte’s analysis did not take into account that City, for all their counter-attacking brilliance, can often leave themselves vulnerable because of the sheer nature of Guardiola’s lineup. City had an attacking midfielder, Oleksandr Zinchenko, at left-back. Kyle Walker is the most forward-thinking right-back in the league and Gündogan, operating as a holding midfielder, is another whose first instincts are to go forward. The trick for City’s opponents is getting the balance right between defence and attack. Yet Chelsea rarely ventured to find out why City had kept only two clean sheets in their previous nine home games and, among the blizzard of statistics confirming the home side’s superiority, one in particular jumped off the page – Hazard had only 33 touches of the ball, 18 fewer than Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper. Chelsea employed the same tactical plan against Barcelona in their Champions League first leg, but it works only if the team defend at their absolute best. Instead, Andreas Christensen’s mistake let in Lionel Messi for Barcelona’s equaliser and, again, the centre-half had to accept a proportion of the blame when City scored the goal that leaves them needing four more wins to confirm the title. When Christensen’s attempted clearance struck one of his own team‑mates Sergio Agüero was on the ball in a flash. David Silva was overlapping on the left and Bernardo Silva, coming in at the far post, showed more interest to get to the cross than Marcos Alonso, turning his shot into the bottom corner. Chelsea still had plenty of time to save themselves but their problem was getting the ball, and this is the other thing about City that sometimes goes unnoticed: when they do lose the ball they work devilishly hard at getting it back as quickly as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-charity-dont-turn-away","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T18:21:15Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on charity: don’t turn away | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-charity-dont-turn-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-charity-dont-turn-away","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on charity: don’t turn away","bodyText":"The British public has a deep social contract with charities, which makes a real difference for the world’s poor, averting famine in Somalia last year. As the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, noted: “The poorest in our own nation are giving generously to others less fortunate than themselves, time after time.” But since the Harvey Weinstein scandal in Hollywood, disturbing revelations of sexual abuse have swept through politics, business and now the aid sector. Some of the biggest names in development have been hit by allegations of sexual misconduct, at home and abroad. The succession of scandals requires immediate and concrete action to restore trust in two areas: the protection of vulnerable people, and evidence that aid makes a difference. It is clear that when dealing with traumatised, impoverished and often uprooted people, the duty to protect lies with aid agencies. Every British charity that recruits people to work abroad should be held, by law, to the same standard as agencies working with vulnerable people at home. This would require a vetting system, like the one for UK schools, to be put in place for aid workers that could screen potential recruits for previous complaints of sexual abuse. A global industry needs a global system of checks; an agency like Interpol could oversee such a system. This would help keep high-risk predatory men out of the charitable sector. Last week Kevin Watkins, Save the Children’s CEO, warned that the current crisis of trust experienced by charities is comparable to that of the 2008 financial crisis, which eroded confidence and destroyed institutions. To regain trust charities will have to move beyond simplistic slogans about “making poverty history”. Development’s next challenge is to expand the freedom that poor people have and the real choices they are able to make. Not all inequality is a constraint on freedom. But the extreme inequalities of wealth and of opportunity across so many countries are barriers to human development. Charities need to show, with evidence, that aid is making a difference in this regard, else the British public will lose faith in the sector. Charities’ power is not in glitzy events with celebrities or getting a line into a G8 communique – it is providing a connection between the UK public and people at the sharp end of globalisation. Today, we have a near-instant awareness of suffering, and the public does respond. The aid sector is a conduit for compassion and human solidarity. It is still the case that carnage proceeds in many parts of the globe and the world does nothing. Sometimes this inaction is because intervention – especially military action – is a cure worse than the disease. Sometimes it is that our attention and resolve is arbitrary and pinched. However, empathy has to underpin our own security in an interconnected world. This understanding is relatively new. More than two centuries ago, Adam Smith made the case that compassion for others was too unreliable to be relied upon. He wrote that if “a man of humanity” knew he would lose his little finger tomorrow, “he would not sleep tonight; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the more profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren” in an earthquake that entirely destroyed the whole of China.

Running the heated seats and climate control for about seven hours costs about three miles of range for my Tesla and it’s probably something similar for a petrol or diesel car. The big difference is, the electric vehicle won’t be killing the occupants with carbon monoxide poisoning. Indeed, the advice has always been not to run the engine if stuck. Teslas have a 12v battery for “domestic” uses and a 400v battery for motive power. The 400v kicks in to recharge the 12v when needed. Think of the 400v battery as the equivalent of running the engine to top up the battery. Cat Burton Barry, Vale of Glamorgan • Our electric car (a Leaf) has 24 kilowatt hours of battery power, and a rough guess gives about 15 to 18 hours of heating with a little left over for travel afterwards. The car is also extremely well insulated, and has seats heated from a subsidiary battery, which would give a further backup. The motor does not need to run to achieve this. The heating could be turned on and off, extending the heating period. The 2018 Nissan Leaf with the larger battery pack could last about 40% longer. In a car with an internal combustion engine, it may or may not keep warm for longer to run the engine. However the carbon monoxide emissions in a snow drift may negate the need to keep the corpses warm beyond 30 minutes. Steve Emsley Newcastle upon Tyne • My Renault Zoe has a battery capacity of 40 kilowatt hours, enough to run a one-bar electric fire for 40 hours. I suspect my car would keep me warm longer than a petrol or diesel vehicle, without the added hazard of surrounding the car with noxious fumes.

Former minister David Willetts will argue that public spending on the three areas is due to rise by £60bn a year by 2040, which could be funded by either taxing the homes of wealthy pensioners or by squeezing younger people’s take-home pay. “As we baby boomers sit on so much wealth – which has continued to grow even as incomes have stagnated – one obvious source is for us to make a contribution through capital or property taxes,” Lord Willetts will say in a speech on intergenerational fairness. Willetts, who was in David Cameron’s cabinet and now chairs the Resolution Foundation thinktank, will admit that he is addressing “difficult and unpalatable options”, particularly for his Conservative party, but will say the debate can no longer be delayed. “By the end of the next decade, the fiscal gap is set to grow to the equivalent today of £20bn a year and then to £60bn after another decade. That translates to an income tax hike of 15p in the basic rate by 2040, the burden of which will overwhelmingly fall on the generations following baby boomers,” he will say. “Is that kind of tax rise really the legacy we – a generation that owns half the nation’s wealth – £13tn of wealth – want to bequeath to our children and grandchildren?” The Tory peer will hit out at “clumsy” attempts to address the issue, such as the mansion tax proposal by Labour and the Liberal Democrats and the so-called Tory “dementia tax” at the last election, which he feels triggered “hysterical” responses. “But neither party can avoid this issue,” he will say, claiming the Tory party’s stark 2017 manifesto was a “taste of things to come” with little room for tax cuts in the future. The Labour party, he will add, cannot raise all the money from the very rich as “taxing bankers cannot pay for everything”. Willetts will call for an overhaul of council tax, which he will describe as the “most regressive property tax you could have”. According to the Resolution Foundation, which has been gathering evidence through its Intergenerational Commission, a family living in a £100,000 house faces a tax rate five times higher than the occupant of a £1m house. “That is why council tax is crying out for reform. We will shortly be publishing a paper looking at the options for making it fairer and raising more money from it,” Willetts will say. One idea is a 1% tax on the value of properties above £100,000, adding £9bn to revenues. The idea of controversial new bands for council tax has never been attempted, however, because of the numbers of people living in homes that have risen dramatically in value while their incomes have not. However, Willetts points out there could be ways to help “asset-rich, low income older families”, for example through deferred payments. The Resolution Foundation is also examining inheritance tax, which it says is “poorly designed, widely abused and under-utilised”. “Inheritance is now a classic bad tax with a very high rate and very high exemptions. We could lower the rate but with a broader tax base, which would be fairer for all,” according to Willetts, although he admits that would also be unpopular. He will argue that he has come round to the idea of such tax measures reluctantly: “Today’s young people are earning less than people of the same age 10 or 15 years ago. Recent shifts in the welfare state have been increasingly tilted against their generation and towards older people. “The younger generation are spending a record share of their income on housing – and getting smaller, insecure rented accommodation in return, rather than the homes they want to own and settle down in. The norm of major living standards gains made by each successive postwar generation is under threat.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/04/boris-johnson-a-boarding-school-bullingdon-club-vandal","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:49:14Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson: a boarding school, Bullingdon club vandal | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/04/boris-johnson-a-boarding-school-bullingdon-club-vandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/04/boris-johnson-a-boarding-school-bullingdon-club-vandal","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson: a boarding school, Bullingdon Club vandal","bodyText":"Gary Younge does an exhaustive demolition job on the foreign secretary (Boris Johnson’s white privilege: imagine he was a black woman, 2 March), but I think he lets off very lightly the institution that produces such a narrow-minded, incompetent elite. It is the private boarding school that produces the vandals of the Bullingdon Club. Their abuse and indoctrination of the privileged was well documented in Alex Renton’s recent ITV documentary, Boarding Schools: The Secret Shame. Someone needs to take the bull by the horns. That means banning boarding for those under 14, and phasing out exclusive “public” schools as we know them. We could do a lot worse than look at how some of them could be converted into what social democratic Denmark calls efterskole (after schools): boarding fifth and sixth form colleges open to all and based round a philosophy of developing civically informed citizenship, and not entitlement. Perhaps Younge could take a look at this alternative and pass it in the direction of Angela Rayner, the shadow education minister. Clement Attlee, too devoted to his alma mater Haileybury, botched the last opportunity in 1945. Theresa May offers us only a few more grammar schools.

It betrays your own journalists, who, with Nick Davies leading the way, laboured bravely and brilliantly to expose criminality and wrongdoing at national newspapers. It betrays the blameless and often vulnerable victims of those crimes, who were promised a full public inquiry, including the all-important Leveson part 2, but whom your editorial does not deem worthy of mention. And it betrays the public at large, including your readers, who, as Brian Leveson has pointed out, are entitled to know the true scale of what went wrong, how newspaper managements allowed it to happen and what lessons can be learned. In endorsing the cancellation of Leveson 2 you place yourself on the side not only of this Conservative government but also of its close allies, the newspapers that perpetrated the crimes and the wrongdoing. And what is your rationale? That we should look forward rather than back – a logic that negates all accountability and one that is always favoured by the unscrupulous and the unethical. This was unworthy of your newspaper’s great traditions of independence, of service to the public and of intellectual rigour. That is the fourth betrayal.

Every investigation is a backward look at events and Leveson 2 would have allowed a thorough look at the relationships between the press and public officials. Less an attack on press freedom and more an investigation into possible corruption. Andy Trotter Former chief constable and media lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers, Tonbridge, Kent • The Guardian is the only newspaper I read and I am therefore disappointed, when the topic is a subject I know quite a lot about, to find false and pejorative phraseology. It makes be doubt the veracity of articles on matters where I have no personal knowledge. You refer to the “tiny, state-sanctioned press regulator Impress”. The state has not sanctioned Impress. Parliament set up the machinery (a royal charter) for an independent body, the Press Recognition Panel (PRP), to recognise any press regulator which fulfilled set criteria. This was to ensure that appropriate regulators of the UK press are independent, properly funded and able to protect the public. The PRP chair, David Wolfe, is quoted as saying: “The PRP works in the public interest by supporting and promoting a free press in a free and fair society.” The Guardian has chosen not to be regulated by an independent body qualified to do so. I consider that it should not use its position to publish “fake news” about such a regulator. Caroline Instance Thakeham, West Sussex • One can only imagine the disappointment which must have been felt by the family of murdered Milly Dowler at the announcement that the second part of the Leveson inquiry has been cancelled. They – and no doubt many others – must have hoped that before too long questionable past relationships between police and the press would be fully investigated. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, despite all that has happened around the original phone hacking scandal, government ministers are still inclined to bow to the will of the press barons. Jeremy Corbyn was right to press for change. Andrew McLuskey Staines, Middlesex • The interview with Max Mosley (Interview, 3 March) shows how little his views have really changed from when he was actively helping his father’s fascist movement. Despite being asked to apologise over the notorious racist leaflet in the 1961 byelection, he refused to do so. And he still finds reasons to have supported apartheid in South Africa. There is certainly no criticism at all of Oswald Mosley’s politics before and after the war. The Labour party should never have accepted funding from Max Mosley, though it is now stated it would not do so again. However, the £500,000 already received should now be returned and all the more so after Saturday’s interview. It is tainted money. David Winnick London • Fifty-six years ago Max Mosley published a fascist leaflet (Labour to cut off donations from Mosley over links to ‘racist’ leaflet, 1 March). He now gives money to the Labour party, which is not a fascist party. Surely we should welcome it when people change their political views in a good direction. Why on earth is Labour refusing future donations from him? Chris Birch London • While nothing could or should justify the nature and language of the young Max Mosley’s (purported) byelection leaflet for his father’s Union Movement, a reading of his half-brother Nicholas Mosley’s memoirs, Rules of the Game/Beyond the Pale: Memoirs of Sir Oswald Mosley and Family (1998) might at the very least put into context the bullying demands Oswald Mosley set upon his children, most especially his sons, Max and Alexander, from his second marriage to Diana (nee Mitford). Alexander, the older by a year, managed to escape to university in the US, but Max, while a student at Oxford and after, was certainly his father’s Union party “right-hand man”, not least in 1962 when he rescued the unrepentant fascist from serious injury after an attack on a London Street. Oswald Mosley’s postwar Union Movement was truly despicable and the young Max should have released himself from it at the earliest possible moment, but… Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/04/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T22:30:08Z","webTitle":"Marcus Rashford’s progress praised by Manchester United’s José Mourinho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/04/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/04/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-jose-mourinho","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Rashford’s progress praised by Manchester United’s José Mourinho","bodyText":"José Mourinho is pleased with Marcus Rashford’s progress this season in the face of what Manchester United’s manager has described as unrealistic expectations. The 20-year-old has scored 11 times in 40 appearances, equalling last term’s goals total, which came in 52 games. He seems certain to continue to improve his season-by-season tally, after eight in 18 appearances in his debut campaign of 2015-16. Mourinho had previously stated that this season would feature a step-change in performance from Rashford following what can often be a challenging second season in the first team. Asked about this, Mourinho said: “At his age, what he’s doing is more than enough and the experience he’s getting at every level is more than enough for us to be happy with what we think is going to be his future. It’s as simple as that. But because he had such an impact at the beginning, probably people expect him to play even more than he does, and score even more than he does and perform even more than what he does but it is not so simple. “What I see makes me really happy, to see the same boy. Marcus is a fantastic boy, very grounded. For sure, we love him and we believe in him, and he’s going to have the chances.” Mourinho, speaking before Monday’s game at Crystal Palace, said he had not offered Rashford any assurances regarding his status. “No, I don’t reassure anyone. The main reassurance is that he is always selected. There is not one single match when Marcus is not selected to start or to be on the bench.” Mourinho has repeatedly said he will not buy a forward in the summer. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic expected to leave, Rashford may be offered more game time as a stand-in to Romelu Lukaku at centre-forward. “The good thing with Marcus is that he can play in the three attacking positions, so even when he doesn’t start, to have him on the bench is such a security for me and for the team,” Mourinho said. Mourinho believes Rashford’s prospects of selection by England for Russia 2018 will be unaffected by not being a regular, the forward having started only 13 of 28 Premier League games for United. “It’s up to Gareth Southgate. If he trusts him, he selects him. It doesn’t matter if he plays or if he doesn’t play for Manchester United.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-jared-kushner-ivanka-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T20:02:46Z","webTitle":"Christie: Trump’s reliance on family hurts ability to run White House","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-jared-kushner-ivanka-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-jared-kushner-ivanka-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Christie: Trump’s reliance on family hurts ability to run White House","bodyText":"After a week of chaos and infighting at the White House, speculation remains rife over who might soon follow communications director Hope Hicks and resign. Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner saw his ability to function as a senior adviser threatened after his security clearances were downgraded at the behest of the chief of staff, John Kelly, whose own position has been questioned recently. On Sunday Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who managed Trump’s transition and remains a loyal supporter, said the president’s reliance on family members compromised his ability to run the White House. But Christie, whose hopes of becoming attorney general were reportedly quashed as payback for his role in jailing Kushner’s father Charles, sidestepped the question of whether he thought the son should be removed. “The president’s going to have to make that judgment,” Christie told ABC’s This Week. He added: “This is most particularly sensitive because it’s a family member. In a normal situation, you might terminate a staff member for that reason. It becomes a lot more difficult if you’re going to be sitting at Thanksgiving dinner with that person. “And so for Jared and for Ivanka [Trump’s daughter] and for all the other members of the family who were involved in one way or the other, I think everybody’s got to focus on what’s best for the president.” Kushner is facing a series of reports concerning the intersection of his business and political portfolios, including one by the New York Times that said his company received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from investors who attended White House meetings. It was also reported that the president is considering whether his daughter and son-in-law should return to New York. Christie pointedly praised Hicks, who became embroiled in controversy over the handling of domestic assault allegations against former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, to whom she was romantically linked. Hicks also appeared before the House intelligence committee this week, admitting in a nine-hour appearance to telling “white lies” for the president. “I think Hope Hicks saw that between the Rob Porter situation and some of the other things that were going on that she was becoming a distraction for the president and less of an asset in her mind,” Christie said. “And she did the noble thing, in my view, which was to say, ‘You know what? If I’m not 100% an asset for the president, I’m gonna back away.’ And I think she deserves credit and I don’t think she’s getting a lot of it in this kind of scandal-driven stuff that’s going on.” Among the names suggested as next out the door are chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, reportedly angered by Trump’s sudden trade tariff decision, and national security adviser HR McMaster, who has reportedly never got on with the president. The White House has denied that either man will leave. Despite Trump’s public falling out with Jeff Sessions, it is not thought likely the attorney general will go. The former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus – who resigned last July – told ABC the Trump-Sessions feud was “a problem” but said: “I don’t think it would be good for the president for Attorney General Sessions to leave.” Trump’s grievance with Sessions is based on the former Alabama senator’s decision to recuse himself from investigations into Russian election meddling. “[Trump] feels like that was the first sin, the original sin and he feels slighted by it,” said Priebus. “He doesn’t like it and he’s not going to let it go. And so I think when he feels frustrated by the Russia probe and all of those things he watches on television and reads about in the paper.” Christie said: “The president has the right to do what he wants to do. And if the president has absolutely no confidence in the attorney general, then the president has to act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/05/jets-a-case-study-for-romance-of-well-functioning-a-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Jets a case study for romance of well-functioning A-League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/05/jets-a-case-study-for-romance-of-well-functioning-a-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/05/jets-a-case-study-for-romance-of-well-functioning-a-league","fields":{"headline":"Jets a case study for romance of well-functioning A-League","bodyText":"When Andrew Nabbout received possession on the left touchline 56 minutes into Saturday’s fixture between Newcastle Jets and Sydney FC expectation fizzed around McDonald Jones Stadium. The contest between the A-League’s top two sides was already living up to the hype but it was about to go to another level. When Nabbout cut in from the left something magical happened. There was the split-second realisation in the mind of a young Australian that he possessed the confidence, the technique and the license to attempt a shot that would have made XG blush. First there was the strike itself; a laces-first daisy-cutter hit with intentional precision and power. Then there was the celebration, the euphoric goalscorer sprinting to the stands, scaling a wire fence and sharing a moment of pure abandon with the Jets faithful; as authentic an expression of reciprocal joy between player and supporter, club and community as you could wish to see at any football ground anywhere in the world. It was the high-water mark for A-League season 2017-18. The crowd was the fifth-highest non-finals attendance in Newcastle’s history (including pre-Jets) and the hubbub had long since morphed into something more tempestuous following the early dismissal of Roy O’Donovan. Shortly before halftime, the crowd erupted when Dimitri Petratos buried a penalty. Shortly after halftime, it subsided when Bobo’s equaliser forced fans to contemplate their undermanned side resisting another 40 minutes against the competition’s pre-eminent team. Not long after that, Nabbout changed everything. There haven’t been many reasons to be cheerful as an A-League follower in recent months, but the Jets could well be top of the list. CEO Lawrie McKinna is the catalyst. With the backing of owner Martin Lee, McKinna has set about righting the wrongs of Nathan Tinkler’s ill-fated ownership. He has realigned the club’s administration with its football operations, brought youth and W-League programs in-house, and made a priority of embedding the Jets in the Hunter community. This was exemplified on Saturday when the cast of thousands at the game included over 70 former players as the club commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Jets’ A-League championship victory, and 40 years since Newcastle KB United kick-started Novocastrian participation in national league football. One of McKinna’s first bright ideas was to bring club legend Joel Griffiths back into the fold, ultimately as football operations manager. There was obvious symbolism to the appointment, but Griffiths also brought with him the knowledge of what a successful Jets operation looks and feels like. He is responsible for driving the cultural change that has underpinned the club’s resurgence and his fingerprints are all over Newcastle’s successful recruitment strategy. Perhaps most significantly of all, he was instrumental in the appointment of Ernie Merrick. Together, Merrick and Griffiths set about overhauling a squad that finished last in 2016-17, targeting players who could bring to life Merrick’s passion for attacking football, while also re-establishing the Jets as a confident, forward-looking unit. “The biggest change? Getting the squad right,” Merrick told News Corp. “You can coach defensive structure, but getting goalscorers and people who want to go forward is to me the real trick in coaching,” said Merrick. “That, and changing the mindset. I asked the players, are you going to sit back and let teams come at you for the rest of your life? Or are you going to have a go? I told them they could make mistakes – I allow for 20 percent mistakes, so long as the 80 percent is right.” It’s a philosophy that has paid dividends many times over during a thrilling campaign in which the Jets have always strived to express themselves, including on Saturday, with ten men, against the runaway leaders of the A-League. It was a win that forces a reappraisal of the remaining weeks of the season, one that has for so long resembled a Sky Blue procession. With four points from three even contests against Sydney FC, there is no reason the Jets should feel overawed in any future head-to-head encounters. It should also not be overlooked that Sydney have yet to face Newcastle’s best XI. This combination of Merrick delivering on-field and McKinna making strides off it is a potent one. Not only are the Jets bucking a trend with increased attendances, but the relationship between crowd and players has become a virtuous cycle. As displayed by Nabbout’s celebration on Saturday, there’s a vitality underpinning it all, a romance glimpsed all-too-rarely in recent months, and a reminder of what a well-functioning A-League can accomplish. With congress reform imminent, expansion and perhaps even a second tier on the horizon, the Jets offer a timely case study for how the time and effort invested in growing the game can bear fruit. We should all tip our hats in appreciation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/04/germany-social-democrats-spd-vote-in-favour-of-coalition-angela-merkel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T13:39:28Z","webTitle":"Merkel secures fourth term in power after SPD backs coalition deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/04/germany-social-democrats-spd-vote-in-favour-of-coalition-angela-merkel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/04/germany-social-democrats-spd-vote-in-favour-of-coalition-angela-merkel","fields":{"headline":"Merkel secures fourth term in power after SPD backs coalition deal","bodyText":"Angela Merkel has secured her fourth term in power after Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) agreed to form another “grand coalition” government with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The SPD announcement ends almost six months of uncertainty in German politics, the longest the country has been without a government in its postwar history, and puts Europe’s largest economy in a position to answer the challenges for EU reform laid down by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Congratulating the SPD for its “clear result”, Merkel said she was looking forward to “further cooperation for the good of our country,” according to a tweet attributed to her on her CDU party’s account. Macron’s office welcomed the decision, saying “this is good news for Europe.” But with both Merkel’s party and the SPD facing internal calls for a programmatic reboot and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) now the biggest opposition party in parliament, the new government’s stability will likely be tested. When the Social Democrat treasurer, Dietmar Nietan, announced on Sunday morning that a majority of SPD members had given the green light to a new “GroKo” or “grand coalition”, it was met with quiet relief rather than enthusiastic applause. “We now have some clarity,” said the Social Democrats’ caretaker leader, Olaf Scholz, a contender for the role of finance minister, speaking at Willy Brandt House in Berlin, the party’s headquarters. “The SPD will enter into government.” Only muffled cheers from behind the closed doors of the headquarters minutes earlier gave a hint of the weight of expectation that weeks of turmoil had piled on the centre-left party’s leadership. A majority of 66.02% of 463,723 eligible SPD members voted in favour of renewing the constellation that has governed Germany for the last four years – a more decisive outcome than a narrow vote among delegates in January had indicated, but also a diminished achievement compared with the 76% who had endorsed a grand coalition four years ago. In the wake of historically disappointing results at federal elections last September, the SPD leader, Martin Schulz, had initially ruled out joining Merkel in government. But the collapse of talks to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition between Merkel’s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party forced the German centre-left back to the negotiating table. With its back against the wall, the SPD managed to secure a surprising victory in getting the chancellor to cede control of the influential finance ministry. A Young Socialists youth wing led by Kevin Kühnert, an energetic 28-year-old, nevertheless put together an effective campaign that encouraged members to reject the deal that the party’s senior leadership had agreed with Merkel’s CDU. Europe’s oldest social democratic party needed to reinvent itself in opposition if it wanted to avoid the fate of the French socialists, the “No GroKo” camp argued. Watching the announcement of the membership vote result on Sunday, Kühnert expressed his disappointment but indicated that he could continue to play an active role in the debate over the German left’s future. “Disappointment undoubtedly prevails among many Young Socialists and myself,” he said, adding that the SPD now had to rise to the difficult challenge of renewing its identity while in government. “We will keep a close eye on the government – on both of its sides.” Following the resignation of the failed candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz, the Social Democrats are likely to next month elect the former labour minister Andrea Nahles as the first female leader in its 155-year history. A former leader of the Young Socialists who was once seen as a rising star on the party’s left wing, Nahles will try to reverse her party’s decline by establishing a more combative and confrontational approach with the CDU. This week, the SPD will discuss the contenders for its six ministerial post, with the interim leader, Olaf Scholz, confirming on Sunday that his party will supply three female and three male ministers. Merkel is due to be officially sworn in as chancellor on 14 March. Scholz, a liberal centrist and the mayor of Hamburg, is mooted to replace the CDU veteran Wolfgang Schäuble in the powerful finance ministry, where he will have to pay lip service to his predecessor’s dogma of a balanced budget while simultaneously meeting a commitment to increase Germany’s contributions to the EU budget, as outlined in the coalition deal. “We don’t want to prescribe to other European states how they should develop,” Scholz said in a recent interview with Der Spiegel. “Mistakes have certainly been made in that regard in the past. And we need to ask ourselves how to deal with the consequences of Brexit.” Merkel, meanwhile, has to juggle more immediate challenges on the international stage with a long-term task of arranging her successorship in a way that does not reverse a legacy of moving the CDU into the centre of the political spectrum. The new party secretary, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, looks like the centrist candidate best equipped to moderate calls for a “conservative revolution” from the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), which will be in charge of the interior ministry, and the ambitious new health minister, Jens Spahn. In the short run, the various political factions that make up Germany’s government will have to learn to pull together to face a looming twin threat to the country’s important car industry. Merkel will have to draw on all of the diplomatic know-how acquired in her 13 years in power to find a response to Donald Trump’s threat to tax Europe-made cars. Closer to home, Merkel and her ministers also have find innovative ways to avert bans on diesel cars in highly polluted cities such as Stuttgart or Düsseldorf, rendered legal by a court ruling last week, which would affect millions of drivers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/05/tasmanian-election-how-the-greens-helped-dash-labors-hopes-of-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Tasmanian election: how the Greens helped dash Labor's hopes of victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/05/tasmanian-election-how-the-greens-helped-dash-labors-hopes-of-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/05/tasmanian-election-how-the-greens-helped-dash-labors-hopes-of-victory","fields":{"headline":"Tasmanian election: how the Greens helped dash Labor's hopes of victory","bodyText":"Tasmania’s Hare-Clark voting system tends to produce close results. The proportional voting system requires a party to win close to half of the total vote to win a majority, and the complexity of the voting system means that we often have a number of seats left undecided at the end of the night. Yet the scale of the Liberal party’s victory was big enough to produce a clear result before the end of the night. The party is currently sitting on 50.5% of the total vote, with at least 13 out of 25 seats, and a chance of winning two more. Labor recovered some ground from 2014, when they polled their lowest vote in recent history, gaining a swing of 5.4%, and possibly gaining as many as three seats. The result was most disappointing for the Greens, who dropped to 10% and may have lost two of their three seats (although both of these seats are still in play). This roughly equals the party’s worst result in 1998, when they polled 10.2% and dropped to one seat. The Liberal campaign focused, among other issues, on the prospect of a hung parliament with Labor and the Greens forming government together. While the Greens have traditionally polled higher in Tasmania than in other states, there are also more voters who have a strong dislike of the minor party, and the prospect of minority government has been a turn-off for many swing voters. Both major parties pledged to only form government if they won a majority (creating a dilemma if a hung parliament emerged), but the Liberal party particularly focused on how anything other than a strong Liberal majority would end up with the Greens holding power. This issue played out in reverse back in the mid-2000s, when Labor was in a much stronger polling position, and they could claim that a vote for Labor would result in a stable majority. The most recent polling did a reasonably good job of predicting this result, with recent polling suggesting a shift towards the Liberal party and away from the Greens. The result was generally bad for minor parties. The combined vote for the major parties (83%) was the highest such vote since the 1986 election. The Jacqui Lambie Network managed 3.2% of the vote but this is down from almost 5% polled by the Palmer United party when Lambie was their senator in 2014. While the Liberal party solidified its majority position with a scare campaign about a potential Greens balance of power, Labor did a good job of strengthening its left flank. Labor’s promise to remove poker machines from pubs neutralised one of the Greens’ main non-environmental campaign issues. While Labor was targeted by a big-spending campaign against the poker machine policy that may have lost them votes to the Liberal party, Labor appears to have gained ground off the Greens, with Labor gaining a swing of 5.4% while the Greens lost 3.8%. This election emphasises a dilemma for Labor – there are many swing voters who will only vote for Labor if they believe they can govern alone. Yet the Greens will continue to play a major role in Tasmanian elections and the voting system ensures they will keep a toehold in Tasmania’s lower house. Labor and the Greens formed government together from 2010 until 2014 but were both punished with significant drops in support at the 2014 election. Since then, Labor has insisted that they would only govern alone but it was not entirely plausible that they would turn down the opportunity to govern if it came as a package deal with the Greens. So how do you find a way to cooperate with a party who many swing voters don’t like, or convince those voters that you will be able to govern alone, when that requires a big jump in your vote? Until Labor solves this problem, they will struggle to win elections in Tasmania."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/05/aflw-pearce-underlines-champion-status-as-grand-final-contenders-narrow","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"AFLW: Pearce underlines champion status as TV visibility strikes sour note","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/05/aflw-pearce-underlines-champion-status-as-grand-final-contenders-narrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/05/aflw-pearce-underlines-champion-status-as-grand-final-contenders-narrow","fields":{"headline":"AFLW: Pearce underlines champion status as TV visibility strikes sour note","bodyText":"Watching Daisy Pearce at Casey Fields on Friday night, retired St Kilda star Leigh Montagna offered this definition of a champion AFL/W player: “There are two things they do when they’ve had a poor game. They respond... but they also look for ways to improve.” Tagged out of last week’s disappointing effort against Collingwood, Pearce underlined her champion status on the biggest stage of her team’s short season. Not only did she amass 24 disposals and boot two goals, the skipper brought something athleticism and skill cannot buy: rabid competitiveness. During the week, Pearce made her regular appearance on Daisy, Lane and Race, and admitted to feeling “flat” after two weeks of poor losses, before adding: “I’m glad we’re playing on Friday night, not Sunday, let’s put it that way”. The determination was evident in her voice, but so was the frustration. Pearce was left shattered after her team missed the grand final by percentage in season one, the “what ifs” haunting her throughout the off-season. No-one would have been more disappointed than her at her performance in Alice Springs, but to perform the way she did against the Lions spoke volumes about the character of the woman. Adding two goals in the first quarter, after managing only one in 2017, proved the icing on the cake of an already formidable game – and the difference against an unrelenting opponent. The Demons can count themselves fortunate to have Pearce as their leader, but she was assisted admirably by Elise O’Dea whose tackle count of 12 dwarfed her rivals and spoke of her own superior will to win. Combined with Karen Paxman’s gut running for yet another mammoth total of 25 disposals, the Demons’ famed midfield put the pre-season premiership favourites back in the box seat for a spot in the grand final. All is far from lost for Brisbane, however, who, despite being well outplayed, could still count themselves unlucky not to have forced a draw. Too much, no doubt, was left to too few, and the performances of Sabrina Frederick-Traub and Kate Lutkins underscored how vital both pillars are to their fortunes. Frederick-Traub’s three goals were a masterclass in core strength and positioning, while her forward pressure continues to belie her height and force turnovers and scoring opportunities for her team. Lutkins, meanwhile, is a lock at All-Australian half-back, another 26 disposals (21 kicks) impossible to ignore. That only 2,100 were present for the finals-like clash, however, was the biggest disappointment of the night, and highlighted some of the problems with the AFLW’s fixturing. While playing games at Casey fields is in keeping with the community spirit of the competition, a 7pm start in Cranbourne East deterred non-local fans who would have had to leave work early and compete with peak hour traffic to attend. At the conclusion of round five the Lions remain in second place on percentage, with an easier run home than the Demons to come; they play Collingwood at home before taking on GWS in Blacktown, while Melbourne will face Carlton at Ikon Park before lining up against premiership fancies the Bulldogs at Whitten Oval. It may now seem a foregone conclusion that the race for the grand final is down to three: the Western Bulldogs and whoever finishes higher of Brisbane and Melbourne, but below them lurk two dark horses in Adelaide and GWS. Under new coach Alen McConnell, the Giants have been one of the success stories of AFLW season two, unlucky not to topple the Demons (or at least draw) in round one, while their only other loss came to Carlton after a storm delay in round two. Most impressive has been their astute recruiting, with Courtney Gum, the 35-year-old SANFL best-and-fairest, continuing to impress, and Cora Staunton, star Gaelic footballer, building an impressive highlights reel. At season’s end, however, they, like Adelaide, may pay the ultimate price for last week’s draw which leaves both a half-game out of the top three with two rounds remaining. Adelaide remain difficult to gauge given their early season form, but since the return of spiritual leader Erin Phillips they have found an aggression and belief that once again makes them a fearsome opponent. Phillips suffered a recurrence of her right quad injury in the comprehensive victory over Carlton, and it will be a nervous wait for her teammates as to how severe it is. That Phillips took herself off after having “awareness” of her quad, and claimed to be able to return if needed was promising, and may well prove a smart, precautionary move. Perhaps the best sign for the Crows, however, was a much-improved team performance, which continued as their wounded captain paced nervously on the boundary in the second half. Most eye-catching were Phillips’ co-captain Chelsea Randall, who continued her underrated and excellent season with 15 disposals and seven tackles in a swing(wo)man role, and Ruth Wallace, W-League and junior Matildas recruit, who excited with three goals to solidify her status as one of the recruits of the season. The Western Bulldogs, meanwhile, now find themselves a game clear on top of the ladder, although their clash with Collingwood in Moe proved much closer and ferocious than predicted. After a fiery first half, one of the most entertaining moments came when Brittany Bonnici, tasked with tagging league best-and-fairest favourite Emma Kearney, tackled her over the boundary line and into the Fox Footy boundary-line commentary team. Kearney, unhappy with the over-zealous treatment, then responded by pushing Bonnici into the remaining camera crew before journalist Sarah Olle staged a dramatic walk-off, muttering “wowsers”. The resultant melee is sure to keep the match review panel busy with Pies captain Steph Chiocci and Bulldogs tagger Libby Birch also on report. As now seems to be a recurring theme, however, the match of the round was unavailable on free-to-air television (only two games were: Fremantle’s clash with GWS on 7Mate, but only in Perth, and Adelaide v Carlton on 7mate nationally). More investment is needed to maximise the audiences for a league that continues to improve in leaps and bounds – but is seen by fewer than in its inaugural season. The much poorer visibility of AFLW 2018 (on TV and elsewhere) has been a sour note in a second season that should have been riding the wave of goodwill, remarkable increases in participation and viewing numbers that defined season one. With a broadcast deal shortly to be struck for next season, it remains to be seen what difference vested commercial interests will make to how seriously the competition is treated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/05/boston-red-sox-rename-yawkey-way-baseball-fenway-park","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T09:30:11Z","webTitle":"Why a road name is stirring up the Red Sox's troubled color-line history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/05/boston-red-sox-rename-yawkey-way-baseball-fenway-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/05/boston-red-sox-rename-yawkey-way-baseball-fenway-park","fields":{"headline":"Why a road name is stirring up the Red Sox's troubled color-line history","bodyText":"Last week, the Boston Red Sox confirmed they would change the name of Yawkey Way, the street just outside Fenway Park where fans gather before the game. The Sox were direct about the reason for the decision: “[Changing Yawkey Way’s name to] Jersey Street ... is intended to reinforce that Fenway Park is inclusive and welcoming to all.” But why would a street’s name fall short of those stated goals? It all goes back to its namesake in a city where racism has too often spilled over into sports. Tom Yawkey was the owner of the Boston Red Sox from 1933 until his death in 1976. It was under his watch that the Red Sox became the last MLB team of the pre-expansion era to field a black player: infielder Pumpsie Green made his debut in 1959, a good 12 years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. In fact, Robinson’s historic debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers may never have happened if Yawkey had had any say in the matter. He was one of several owners who made up the Major League Steering Committee which, in 1946, recommended that the league remain segregated. Not that Yawkey’s Red Sox didn’t occasionally feign interest in African American players. Most notoriously, in 1945 they held a tryout for Robinson that was, by all accounts, a farce. The team had no intention of actually signing him. Robinson would later go on to call Yawkey “the most bigoted man in baseball”. Robinson wasn’t the only legendary black player that the Red Sox skipped over, they also failed to offer Willie Mays, one of greatest players of all time, a contract. While Yawkey’s resistance to integrating his ballclub was primarily a moral failure, the policies that were in place during his tenure actively hurt his team’s chances of winning. It’s no coincidence that it was during this period, when other teams were integrating some of the most talented players from the Negro Leagues and elsewhere, that the Red Sox started to lag behind in the standings. Boston never won the World Series under Yawkey, and it’s impossible not to wonder if their history would have been different had they signed Robinson or Mays or any of the other talented ballplayers passed over because of the color of their skin. Maybe we could have all been spared all that non-stop “curse” talk. Over the last few decades, Yawkey has come to represent an era that the current ownership has been trying to distance itself from. It’s no secret that the history of Boston sports, and the history of Boston in general, is filled with racial tension, and this past continues to affect people’s perception of the city. When racist incidents occur, for example at Fenway last year a fan shouted slurs at an African American player, it’s pretty much impossible to say “this is not who we are” while simultaneously honoring a literal segregationist. While the case against unreservedly honoring Yawkey is fairly overwhelming, the Red Sox’s decision to rename Yawkey Way has provoked some rather strong backlash. The least surprising criticism came from the Yawkey Foundation, the organization Yawkey and his wife Jean established to ensure that their philanthropic efforts would continue after their deaths. The foundation swiftly responded to the Red Sox’s announcement with a statement defending Yawkey, painting him as the victim of “a false narrative,” and emphasizing his charity work (which the Sox acknowledged and praised in their announcement). Let’s just assume that Yawkey’s defenders are right and that much of what we think we know about him comes from apocryphal mud-slinging, would that really affect his legacy as an owner? The integration of the major leagues was the most important moment in baseball history, maybe even US sports history, and Yawkey’s Red Sox were on the wrong side. Whether or not Yawkey was a bigot himself is ultimately irrelevant in light of the fact that his team was the last remaining hold-out, a hold-out that inexcusably lasted over a decade. We are judged primarily by our actions as well as our failures to act. Whether or not Yawkey was the primary person responsible for the Red Sox’s all-white rosters, it still happened under his watch. If it’s Yawkey’s fate to be remembered mostly as a symbol of bigotry and exclusion in sports, it’s one that he’s earned. Beyond those without direct ties to Yawkey himself, the proposed move has also come under fire from the expected corners. There are those who accuse the Red Sox of surrendering to political correctness. You may remember this argument, in as much as it is one, from fans upset that the Cleveland Indians were phasing out the grotesquely racist Chief Wahoo logo just a little while ago. Then there are those who believe the Red Sox are somehow erasing history by removing Yawkey’s name, as if deciding to stop paying tribute to him is somehow the equivalent of a Stalinist purge. But owner John Henry and the rest of the Sox organization aren’t cropping Yawkey out of photos and, as Boston Herald columnist Steve Buckley points out, it’s not like his plaque in the Baseball Hall Of Fame is going anywhere any time soon. For better or worse, Yawkey’s place in baseball history is assured. There is however, at least one criticism you could lay on the Red Sox organization: why are they doing this now? Henry claims that he wanted to change the name of Yawkey Way as early as 2002 and that he has been “haunted” by the idea. If so, then why has he waited until now, after three World Series wins and in the midst of a favorable political climate, to actually go through the renaming process. Was the Red Sox organization that afraid of a fan backlash? There’s a certain level of moral cowardice at work here: they knew that renaming Yawkey Way would be the right thing to do, yet they waited well over a decade before finally following through. That course of inaction sounds very familiar for the Red Sox, doesn’t it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/04/max-mosely-fascism-press-regulation","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T00:04:31Z","webTitle":"Max Mosley, the 56-year-old fascist leaflet and a battle for the press","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/04/max-mosely-fascism-press-regulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/04/max-mosely-fascism-press-regulation","fields":{"headline":"Max Mosley, the 56-year-old fascist leaflet and a battle for the press","bodyText":"In January 1961 Walter Hesketh ran from Edinburgh to London in his slippers. Pathé footage of his 82-hour journey can be found online: a monochrome snapshot of another era. But this historical curio is not the only aspect of Hesketh’s life in 1961 to have been archived. A leaflet distributed on his behalf, as he contested the Moss Side byelection in Manchester, has resurfaced in explosive fashion. Hesketh fought the November byelection while standing for the fascist Union Movement (UM) of Sir Oswald Mosley – an admirer of Mussolini – who was interned during the second world war for his extreme views. In a leaflet appealing for voters to back him, Hesketh pledged to “stop coloured immigration” which, he suggested, “threatens your children’s health”. The UM, which was spawned from the British Union of Fascists (BUF), was already a spent force by the 60s, when Mosley and his followers, who dreamed of creating a pan-European fascist movement, were fighting byelections in racially diverse areas as a means of extracting maximum political impact. “Mosley’s high point was 1934, though the BUF’s members soldiered on after being released from internment,” said Graham Macklin, an assistant professor at the Centre for Research on Extremism (C-Rex), University of Oslo. “The union movement didn’t really do a great deal after the second world war. Mosley’s pro-European ideology did for the group. For a lot of the British extreme right who had followed him it was complete anathema.” Unsurprisingly, given his outlandish views, Hesketh came last in the vote, lost his deposit, and faded into political obscurity. Mosley died in 1980, having spent his last years in Paris while a new generation of fascists formed the National Front. Hesketh’s leaflet might have remained of interest only to historians of the far right such as Macklin except for one thing: it names Mosley’s son, Max, as its publisher. To say this fact is toxic is an understatement. Max Mosley, a former boss of the organisation that runs Formula One, is the bete noire of the country’s most powerful newspaper publishers. Following his 2008 high court privacy victory against the News of the World over revelations of his participation in an orgy with prostitutes, he has become a trenchant critic of several Fleet Street titles which complain that he is pursuing legal measures to gag them from reporting certain aspects of the original story. During the 2008 case references were made to the leaflet, but it was never produced. At the time Mosley said he had no recollection of it and challenged the News of the World’s legal team to produce the document. “I can only say categorically I do not remember it,” Mosley explained to the Observer in an email last week. “I imagine I would have read it (although, if so, I’m surprised I did nothing) but it was 57 years ago and I’ve read an awful lot since then. I would never have challenged a QC to produce it had I had the slightest suspicion it might exist. That would be very foolish. The News of the World should have disclosed it if they thought it relevant to the issues before the court.” Well, it has been disclosed now, and at a time when the tectonic plates connecting Westminster and Fleet Street are shifting as the long-running battle over press regulation enters a new phase. Many see Mosley as a central character in this battle. Around £4m of his family’s money has, via a trust, been channelled to Impress, the rival press regulator to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which is funded by newspaper groups such as News UK, publisher of the Sun and the Times, and DMG Media, publisher of the Mail. A minnow by most standards, with fewer than 100 media outlets signed up to it, Impress nevertheless remains the only regulator to be approved by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) – the body established by royal charter to ensure that regulators are truly independent. When asked whether he agreed that newspapers should examine the political views of someone whose money is backing a press regulator, Mosley said: “It would be different if the donor had even the slightest degree of controls. The regulator is either completely independent or it’s not – if it is, the source of its money becomes irrelevant. “The PRP and then the high court both looked at the question in great detail and ruled I have no influence whatsoever over Impress. The Impress board are outstandingly qualified but I have never met any of them except [Walter] Merricks [its chairman] very briefly.” Despite its limited size, its critics fear Impress’s reach. The government had been considering bringing into force section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act which would mean newspapers that are not signed up to a fully compliant regulator would have to cover the legal costs of a claimant in a libel case, even if they were to win it – a measure many saw as draconian. Similarly, the data protection bill passing through parliament contains proposed amendments that would ensure only publishers signed up to a code put together by an “approved regulator” – of which Impress is currently the only one – would be granted special exemptions or immunity when handling data. Its critics say both measures would give Impress considerable power. Impress’s supporters say there is nothing to stop Ipso from becoming a similarly approved regulator. There is little common ground to be found between either side. The antecedents of the current row over press regulation can be traced back to 2012 when David Cameron pledged action following the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World. At the time Cameron said the test should be “not ‘do the politicians or the press feel happy with what we get?’ It’s ‘are we really protecting people who have been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves by this process?’ That’s what the test is.” The first phase of the test – an examination into the culture, practices and ethics of the press – concluded with the publication of a 1,987-page report by a senior judge, Sir Brian Leveson, that recommended a new system of regulation. A second phase, a public inquiry examining the relationship between the press, the police and politicians, known as Leveson 2, with powers to compel witnesses to attend court and to demand documents, was scrapped by the government on Thursday, just as the furore surrounding Mosley’s historical far-right links was raging. Explaining the climbdown, and its related decision not to introduce section 40, the culture secretary Matthew Hancock suggested that newspapers had cleaned up their act and that their plunging circulations meant “the world had changed” since 2012. But some see an unsettling choreography in the timing of the Mosley story and the government’s announcement. That it was the Mail – a paper which ran a story in 1934 headlined “Hurrah for the Blackshirts” praising Oswald Mosley for his “sound common sense” – that led the attack on his son, unearthing the Hesketh leaflet and highlighting Mosley junior’s enthusiastic attendance at a number of violent far-right demonstrations, is an irony not lost on Jonathan Heawood, CEO of Impress. “There was a clear political context to what’s happened over the last few days and it’s disappointing that politicians are interfering in press regulation once again,” Heawood said. He added: “A lot of people have said the Leveson framework is somehow about the past, not the future. But that’s nonsense. Most of our members are digital-first publications.” Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader who has received more than £500,000 in donations from Mosley and has been effusive in his praise for the millionaire, a source of embarrassment to many in his own party, also accused the government of capitulating to the powerful newspaper groups which, he said, had been “lobbying hard” for Leveson 2 to be scrapped. They were lobbying from a position of strength. A government threatening to implode under the pressures of delivering Brexit to the nation is desperate to keep its allies in the press on side. But despite the government’s climbdown the internecine war over press regulation appears far from over. In the longer term, much may depend on which way the political wind blows. Labour, whose leader Jeremy Corbyn recently warned that “change was coming” for the “media barons”, made implementing Leveson 2 a manifesto commitment at the last election. In the shorter term, a judicial review of the decision to ditch Leveson 2 seems inevitable. Watson, too, has hinted that he believes further legal battles lie ahead. In a speech in parliament on Thursday he asked Hancock: “If it is revealed that the criminality that took place at the News of the World extended to other newspapers, will he reconsider his position [to ditch Leveson 2]?” The Observer understands that a series of civil claims against at least one major newspaper publisher are likely to end up in court this autumn. This would be extremely significant. Previous civil cases have been settled out of court, meaning little light has been shed on what exactly happened at those newspapers alleged to have engaged in phone hacking. As one person complained in an excoriating letter to Hancock and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, last week, in which they said that they “fundamentally disagreed” with the decision to scrap the second part of the inquiry: “In neither part one nor the trials have there been answers to ‘who did what to whom?’” The name of that person? Sir Brian Leveson.

Their supporters probably do not expect them to stay there for very long but the significance of this result, apart from bringing up 200 Premier League goals under Jürgen Klopp, is that should Chelsea lose to Manchester City on Sunday there will be a seven-point cushion between Liverpool and the dreaded fifth place. Unless Chelsea win, in fact, the fight for top-four places could be as good as over. Early interest was provided by the question of how quickly Salah could get onto the scoresheet. The Egypt international had scored in each of his last six Liverpool games before Saturday, and one more here took him to 32 in all competitions this season, exactly the same as the entire Newcastle team have managed thus far. Chances were unlikely to be abundant with Newcastle falling back into a flat back five when they were without the ball, which was most of the time, but Salah got his first sight of goal after 11 minutes and managed to catch Paul Dummett in the face with his shot. A couple of minutes later Emre Can hoisted a ball forward from halfway that allowed Salah to easily run through Newcastle’s square defence, only to put his first-time half-volley into the side-netting. Newcastle were content to do more defending than attacking, though there was one moment midway through the first half when DeAndre Yedlin was able to show off his startling pace, kicking the ball past Andrew Robertson and beating the Liverpool left-back to it even after taking the long way round. After Dejan Lovren brought a save from Martin Dubravka with a header from a corner there was another chance for Salah when Can dispossessed Yedlin. Roberto Firmino found Salah in the area, but in attempting to guide the ball around Kenedy he gave Florian Lejeune the opportunity to intercept. The visitors had a lucky escape when Dubravka came for a Salah corner and missed, the ball travelling harmlessly across goal and out of play for a goal-kick, before a measured pass from Virgil van Dijk almost played Roberston into the area from half way, the full-back just failing to control the ball with a headed touch. It was clear that Liverpool would not be kept at bay for long, and the breakthrough finally arrived five minutes from the interval. Naturally it was Salah who applied the finishing touch, though Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves credit for seizing on a loose ball following a Newcastle mistake in the centre-circle and powering instinctively towards goal. At first he looked to be shaping for a shot, but as Mo Diamé closed in the Liverpool midfielder released the ball to the fractionally better placed Salah, whose low left-foot shot went through the goalkeeper’s legs. Going behind ought to have forced Newcastle to play with a little more adventure, though at times this season Rafa Benítez’s priority has been to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum with an eye on the eventual goal difference. Things could be that tight at the end of the season, though in fairness Newcastle almost managed an instant reply on the stroke of the interval. Diamé was on target with a shot from the edge of the area after beating Can to the ball, and Newcastle would have been level but for Loris Karius leaping to his right to make a last-gasp one handed save. The second half began in the same way as the first, with Newcastle keeping everyone except Dwight Gayle behind the ball and denying Liverpool space to run into. Allowing them to dominate possession when they boast forwards as tricky as Salah, Firmino and Sadio Mané is a risky strategy, however, and the home side had already been denied a fair claim for a penalty when Mané extended their lead in the 55th minute. Salah’s shot clearly hit Jamaal Lascelles on the arm as the centre-half tried to fling himself in the way, though as he was in the process of turning his back and not looking at the ball it was probably reasonable of Graham Scott to allow him the benefit of the doubt. Newcastle respite was brief. Mané started the move which led to the second goal, then moved into the area to finish it following a neat final ball from Firmino. Newcastle were expecting the ball to be moved out wide, though in typically Brazilian fashion Firmino went for the more difficult option, the pass to feet through the middle, and Benítez’s defenders had no answer to such eye-of-the-needle precision. Neither was there any attempt to throw caution to the wind and fight back. One misplaced Isaac Hayden header was the sum of Newcastle’s attacking efforts in the second half. Salah might have won a penalty right at the end, though Lascelles’ foul was actually outside the box and the referee appeared to be unsighted. In three returns to Anfield Benítez has never before finished on the losing side; this time he surrendered quietly. Lascelles should have received red card, says Klopp Jürgen Klopp described Jamaal Lascelles as “a lucky man” after his stoppage-time foul on Mohamed Salah went unpunished. The Liverpool manager initially thought his player deserved a penalty and was fuming on the touchline, though replays suggested the challenge had occurred outside the area. Yet Lascelles was clearly the last defender and Salah in a position to score so Klopp was confused as to why Graham Scott failed to take any action. “I can see now it wasn’t a penalty but it was 100% a red card,” Klopp said. “The Newcastle defender is a lucky man to be able to play the next game.” Rafa Benítez rather diplomatically suggested the referee might not have had a clear view, though privately he must have taken a dim view of Lascelles’ action when the game was all but over and Newcastle cannot afford to have their captain and best defender suspended. “I didn’t get a good view of the incident and maybe the referee was the same,” the Newcastle manager said. “Overall I was happy with the team’s workrate but I can’t be happy with the result. A gameplan has to be good for 90 minutes, not just 40. You can never guarantee you will not make mistakes, and against top sides you will pay for that.” The managers agreed a save by Loris Karius from Mo Diamé at the end of the first half was a key point in the game. “That would have been a perfect moment for Newcastle to score and a bad time for us to concede,” Klopp said. “Loris is an outstanding goalkeeper who happened not to make a good start to his Liverpool career. I believe in him, though, the save was almost as good as scoring a goal. I would be the biggest idiot in the world to keep lining him up if he wasn’t good enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/03/trump-campaign-survey-sharia-law-russia-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T19:11:34Z","webTitle":"'Are you concerned by sharia law?': Trump canvasses supporters for 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/trump-campaign-survey-sharia-law-russia-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/03/trump-campaign-survey-sharia-law-russia-2020","fields":{"headline":"'Are you concerned by sharia law?': Trump canvasses supporters for 2020","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is canvassing supporters about the potential spread of sharia law, whether English should be the official language of the US and whether they regard Russia as “a concern”. The online survey, funded by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, offers an early insight into likely themes in what is set to be a bitter battle for the White House in 2020. This week Trump named digital strategist Brad Parscale as his campaign manager. The multiple-choice questionnaire appears to be aimed squarely at the so-called Trump base, as it delves into slashing regulations, support for “merit based” legal immigration and imposing tariffs to protect American industry. One question reads: “Do you believe many universities indoctrinate rather than teach students?” Perhaps hoping to build evidence that public polling – where Trump has an all-time low rating – consistently underestimates his true popularity, the survey asks: “Do you feel that you cannot publicly admit that you support Trump?” Next is: “Do you think stopping taxpayer-funding of abortion remains a priority?” Trump recently became the first sitting president to address the March for Life in Washington and has rallied anti-abortion groups to his cause. The survey makes reference to Trump’s controversial travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, but in different language: “Do you support President Trump’s temporary restriction on immigration from terrorism-compromised countries?” It then asks: “Are you concerned by the potential spread of Sharia Law?” The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremist groups, has described “mass hysteria” surrounding a so-called threat of sharia law in the US as “one of the most successful far-right conspiracies to achieve mainstream viability” and largely the work of anti-Muslim groups. The next question is blunt: “Is Russia a concern to you?” It does not specify whether this refers to the justice department investigation of Trump’s alleged collusion with Moscow, the threat posed by Russia to future US elections or President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive geopolitical and nuclear ambitions. The ideological leanings of the next question are clear: “Has illegal immigration had a negative impact on your community?” Trump has vowed to restrict both legal and illegal immigration, target gangs such as MS-13 and build a wall on the Mexican border – always a loud applause line at his rallies. In question No 31, critics are likely to hear a rightwing dog whistle: “English is currently not recognized as the official language of the United States. Do you think it should be?” Trump’s positions on immigration and Mexico have drawn criticism from many Spanish-speaking voters and he has appointed fewer Latino people to influential positions than Barack Obama. Two questions relate directly to recent debate over gun control. “Do you believe schools should be hardened to protect our children?” the survey asks, without specifically raising the issue of arming teachers. “Do you believe background checks for purchasing firearms need to be enhanced to include the mentally ill?” is the other. The poll asks whether supporters trust the media and find news coverage too negative. On Saturday Trump tweeted a link to an article that claimed he is being treated more unfairly than any past president, commenting: “Mainstream Media in US is being mocked all over the world. They’ve gone CRAZY!” He was also due to deliver remarks at “a Trump Victory reception” fundraiser at his private Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida before flying back to Washington. The Trump Make America Great Again Committee is a joint fundraising committee composed of “Donald J Trump for President” and the Republican National Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/04/barcelona-v-atletico-madrid-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:11:08Z","webTitle":"Barcelona 1-0 Atlético Madrid: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/04/barcelona-v-atletico-madrid-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/04/barcelona-v-atletico-madrid-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona 1-0 Atlético Madrid: La Liga – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for joining me! It was an intense old game at the Nou Camp, so my fingers are killing me. Until we meet again! (Maybe at some point int he next week). Will Atletico be annoyed they did not give it more of a go in the first-half? They might have worn Barca down if they’d been more proactive for the opening 45 minutes as the hosts were struggling to cope with the pressure late on and would have conceded if it weren’t for Costa’s leg being the wrong side of the line. And City are winning! What a day! And the lamb is in the oven! And there is wine! No hay Liga! It is only fair that a game of this pressure and intensity was settled by a goal of pure quality from a man who continually makes the difference for Barcelona. The hosts dominated the opening half, while after the break it was all Atletico but they failed to create a decent chance in the 45 minutes despite having the majority of the possession, meaning they will be left to rue one needless foul which allowed Messi to score a stunning free-kick. Is the title race over? 90+3 min: Oblak sends the ball long down the pitch to the opposition area but it is sent back from whence it came. 90+2 min: The home fans are waving their flags and singing in a victorious manner. Is it too early? 90 min: Saurez wins a free-kick in the corner from Godin, the striker knew what he was doing with that and has wasted some valuable time. Three minutes added on! 88 min: Atletico’s yellow shirts look like they are outnumbering Barcelona when the visitors attack. Surely there will be one more chance... 86 min: NO GOAL! Gameiro smashes the ball into the back of the net after a knockdown from Costa but the assistant puts his flag to rightly point out the former Chelsea man was an inch offside. Could be an effective method for Atletico to create chances, though. 84 min: Paulinho is coming on for Coutinho as Valverde backs the more defensively-minded Brazilian for the closing stages. This is pretty intense, I will need wine later. 83 min: Suarez is the latest striker to go down in the box after he was stopped when trying to work his way through on goal. He is still down, rubbing his left knee. Is his race run? 82 min: Costa tries to spin after receiving the ball in the box, but instead of trying to do something with the possession he just throws himself to the floor in the desperate hope the referee will be fooled into awarding a penalty. Get up, Diego! 80 min: Coutinho drifts in from the left, through two defenders who were left bamboozled by the Brazilian’s quick feet but his run into the box is stopped by a left shoulder, though the referee sees no ill. 78 min: Messi sends a free-kick to the back post where Busquets is waiting. The midfielder watches the ball go over everyone and then smashes a volley with his left foot but Oblak does not flinch and palms it away. 76 min: Suarez gets the ball into the back of the net but it is rightly ruled out for offside. After a corner was cleared the Uruguayan did a little bit of goalhanging so when the ball was headed back into the box he steered it home but he was definitely off. Messi then has a good chance as he shoots from 25 yards but it is deflected over. Game on! 75 min: Griezmann tries to go round Umiti but he instead just runs into his fellow Frenchman in the vague hope he is rewarded a free-kick. The referee sees no foul and waves play on. Mark emails from Peru, which is novel. He says: “I’ve used it on the few occasions Barsa isn’t on teevee here in Peru, worst commentator in the world. “Hey, you see that goal by Messi today? Rather good, no?” It was bloody, ruddy great. 72 min: Atletico are really on top here and Simeone is hoping to take advantage by bringing on Lucas Hernandez for the final 20 minutes. Where will he fit in? 69 min: Costa takes Atletico up the pitch and the attack is stopped as Rakitic fouls Correa, which the referee books him for. Atletico have a free-kick from slightly further out than from where Messi scored but his chipped cross results in Godin being punished for a foul. 68 min: Gomes tries to take on the entire Atletico midfield who was being patronised, he fails to do so and is patronised by the home crowd. Not a popular man in this blog or at the Nour Camp. Poor Andre... Paul writes: “Playing gomes is akin to playing with 10 men. Players and crowd don’t seem to fancy him and he seems to hide as far away from the game as that white line will allow.” 67 mins: Another change for Atletico as Gameiro is brought on for Gabi, allowing them to play a proper front two. Will the struggling Pique be able to cope? Tom is ashamed, he says: “Not proud, but watching this on a dodgy stream, Barca have a player by the name of Kwhlewithhhhhhhhhhh Schhhhhhhhhhwwwwwarthethhhhhhhhhhh according to the commentator!” Not sure I even know who he means. 64 min: Role reversals in this half as Barcelona are the team waiting to counter on Atletico. This could be a pretty interesting last 25 minutes or so. 62 min: COSTA IS HOLDING HIS FACE! Atletico have a free-kick after Umtiti challenged him illegally. Umtiti is laughing at how pathetic Costa is as there was barely any contact. The set-piece comes to nothing. 60 min: Atletico Madrid win a corner as they took advantage of Barcelona being one man down temporarily. After a half-clearance the ball is looped back into the box and Saul heads into Ter Stegen’s arms which sort of counts as a shot. 58 min: Messi takes the free-kick from 20 yards out but this time he hits it straight at the wall, which is a surprise. Correa is coming on for Vrsaljko while Pique is struggling with a knee problem for the hosts. 57 min: Barcelona break on Atletico as Messi leads the charge towards all the box but it comes to an abrupt end as Rakitic is hilariously bodychecked by Gimenez just outside the area. 54 min: All very even at the moment as Atletico look to be playing higher. Suarez is trying to take advantage of this by permanently waiting on the last man, hoping for a ball over the top to chase. 51 min: There is now some intent from the visitors who have finally realised that if they want to score they will need to attack Barcelona. They might even force Ter-Stegen into a save soon. 49 min: Atletico have some possession in the final third which was rarely seen in the opening 45 minutes but they can’t make anything after Saul is ruled offside after the ball is launches towards him. 47 min: Messi sees off Gabi midway inside the Atletico half, he then plays the ball into Suarez who decides to play the ball back to Messi rather than shoot but his pass is array and Atletico clear. 46 min: Here we go again! No changes at the break for either side. The players are back out on the pitch! Could be a fascinating 45 minutes. Are there any more angles of the Messi free-kick? Think I’ve seen them all about from one from his boot itself. Poor Diego... John has been in touch... Getting my fill of 15 minutes of Manchester City v Chelsea. I am a City fan so really sacrificing a lot for your enjoyment. I suspect is doing more than me for your Sunday afternoon, though. How do Atletico get back into this one? Is Fernando Torres the answer? Probably not. They need to get on the ball into midfield in order to feed Griezmann and Costa who have barely had a kick between them. Your answers will be better than mine, I am sure. Barcelona have dominated from the start and thoroughly deserve to be in the lead and it was a wonderful goal which made it 1-0. The paucity of superlatives left describe Messi is embarrassing our profession and that’s full great to the great man. 45 min: Barcelona are calmly playing out the finally few moments of the half as they keep hold of the ball to ensure they maintain their lead. Just one minute added on. 43min: Atletico play themselves into trouble as Godin sends a terrible pass straight to Sergi Roberto, who knocks it to Suarez only for Godin to recover and tackle his compatriot. The corner is whipped in but Pique heads it over the bar. 41 min: Atletico will be happy to go in just one goal down, allowing to create a Plan B as their currently offering will does not look like it will bring them a goal or even a shot. 600 goals is just silly, isn’t it? 39 min: Messi leads the charge towards the Atletico box before laying a pass to Gomes in space on the right. The Portuguese takes the ball into the box but then sends a pathetic cross straight into the arms of Oblak, much to the annoyance of the home fans. I have never seen Gomes have a good game for Barca. 37 min: Gomes gets involved by battling for the ball in the opposition box before working it out to Roberto. Barcelona play it across the pitch to Coutinho who works his way into the area and fires in a shot with his left foot from 12 yards but Oblak stands tall and punches it clear. 35 min: Iniesta passes the ball out, takes off his captain’s armband and heads to the touchline as his game is curtailed by injury. In his place we have Andre Gomes, which is in some ways a like-for-like swap even it wasn’t for the fact the Portuguese is half the player that Iniesta is. Paul points out that Messi has the advantage before he’s even taken the free-kick, he says: “The problem with Messi’s free kicks is that his repertoire means the keepers cant move until they see it properly which is usually once its past the wall.” 32 min: Suarez breaks into the box and directs a shot at goal from 10 yards, but Gimenez blocks it and he complains that about the use of a hand, though the referee cares little for the protestations. 31 min: A yellow for Vrsaljko as he trips Suarez after the defender is turned by the striker. Been a few feisty challenges so it won’t be the last card. 29 min: Filipe Luis and Messi clash resulting in both hitting the deck. The Barcelona man looks hurt and is holding his ankle, while he’s on the floor he is booked for his efforts. Messi caught Luis with a late tap on the ankle, so it is all fair. The official Guardian view on that goal... GOAL! Atletico are punished for a needless foul 30 yards from goal as Messi steps up and curls his shot over the wall and gets it to perfectly dip and curl into the top corner, meaning Oblak can only palm it into the net. A truly stunning free-kick for Messi’s 600th career goal. What a free-kick from Messi! Kari seems to be influence by Bart Simpson with his “BARcelona v aTleticO should be called El Barto: suggestion. 24 min: Iniesta has jogged back on, which is a confident move for someone with a muscular issue. Maybe he is just trying to lure Atletico into a false sense of security. Atletico fail to clear the ball, which lands at the feet of Coutinho but he bottles shooting first time and the visitors send it out for a corner. 22 min: Iniesta is down once again. Iniesta is just rubbing his hip in the hope of continuing. Actually, it looks like a hamstring problem. Game over! 21 min: Messi receives the ball 25 yards from goal, he is quickly surrounded by three Atletico players but somehow he flicks the ball between then all, spins to take it towards goal but his shot from 20 yards out was straight at Messi. How on earth did he beat all those men? No beer here... 19 min: Iniesta is on the ground with a hip problem after challenging Saul for a header. The Barcelona man hit the ground hard after a big leap to beat his opponent to the ball. He gets up and is fine, which is a relief to all the home fans. 18 min: Diego Costa is flagged offside but it was very close. This is about as much as he’s done in the game so far. He will need to be patient today as Atletico do not look like they will be seeing much of the bal in the opposition half. 17 min: Two balls on the pitch! Whatever next? 15 min: Barcelona have had a couple of miss-placed in the last few minutes with Busquets and Messi the culprits of sending the ball nowhere near their team-mates. Barcelona are not rattled but they know they are in a game here. It could work... 13 min: Suarez is fouled on the edge of the box by Gabi after the Atletico man kicked the Uruguayan in the calf, giving Barcelona a free-kick on the left. Messi takes the set-piece but it goes straight into the wall. 10 min: Atletico Madrid will look to play on the break it seems. They are happy to let Barcelona have the ball for now. The visitors are working really hard while absorbing a lot of possession. Griezmann is doing his fair share of defensive work. 8 min: Iniesta lifts a straight ball into the box allowing Suarez to challenge Oblak but the referee’s whistle blows after some unconvincing working from the goalkeeper. It seems Suarez pushed Gimenez over in the build-up. 6 min: Barcelona are having all of the ball at the moment. A short corner is played into the box and after the odd ricochet is ends up with Coutinho who has a shot which deflects towards the goal but Oblak reacts well and holds on. 5 min: It looks like Partey is playing as deep as he can without becoming an extra defender. His eyes are focused on where Messi is wandering and the midfielder will not let the Barcelona No 10 get too far from him. Iniesta looks up for this one and he will be key if Barcelona are going to win this one! 3 min: Vrsaljko gets in with a classic ‘you’re in a game foul’ on Iniesta an he needless brings down the Spaniard when he tries to turn the defender near the halfway line. Matt emails to ask: “I think the most pressing question on all of our minds is: what will you be having with your lamb? Roast potatoes, greens, a healthy helping of gravy, and a generous portion of mint sauce? Remember, there *are* wrong answers.” Controversially, I have never been a huge fan of full roast dinners, it can all be a bit too much. So the lamb will be roasted in garlic and rosemary, which will then be served with some cous cous, bejewelled with dried fruit, roast peppers and herbs. 1 min: Here we go at the Nou Camp! There is a minute’s silence for Quini now. A former Pichichi winner while at Barcelona and fondly remembered by all at the club. Here come the teams both wearing some lovely jackets that are available for a silly fee in the club shops and other sporting goods outlets. And here is Sid Lowe on Barcelona legend Quini. What a tale! I am also going to Barcelona later this month but will probably go to watch Girona instead but it just seems more fun to watch City’s reserves. Girona is nicer than Barcelona, right? We’re almost ready! I am well placed to write about this game as I explained to a family of Spanish tourists staying at a flat in my building how to open the door to get out this week. They loved my Spanish instructions and then got to exit and enjoy the snow. Seeing as these two are the best teams in the league, should we come up with a title for the game? El clasico is saved for Barcelona v Real Madrid but maybe something less grandiose would be appropriate. El partidazo or similar? Obviously, you can contact me in the usual places, with the details being at the top of the page. You can ask me about the lovely soccer or the roast lamb I hope to find when I get home. Sid Lowe has been writing about some of La Liga’s overachievers. Will one end up in Europe? Lionel Messi has 34 goals in 44 games this season for club and country, which is once again an incredible tally for an individual. There is no doubting how much Barcelona have needed to rely on their Argentine maestro throughout the campaign with Suarez starting the season poorly and the lack of a third forward following Neymar’s exit and Dembele’s injuries. Griezmann looks to be back to his best now that he has been joined by Costa in attack, which is a worrying thought for Barcelona. The Catalans are keen on bringing the Frenchman to the Nou Camp in the summer, even though Valverde distanced himself from a deal this week but that’s just him being very polite ahead of a crucial match. Messi v Griezmann: who will win? Atletico did win the league at the Nou Camp in 2014 thanks to a draw. It was a glorious day for the club. Although Simeone has never lost to Valverde in 12 games, he has not actually beaten Barcelona in La Liga in 12 matches, so there is a good chance one of those records will go later on today. Or it might just be a boring draw. Is this the biggest game of the day? Matt thinks differently... Both clubs have sent their condolences following the tragic news today of Davide Astori’s passing. Diego Simeone can boast not lost in 12 encounters with Valverde, which is a pretty decent record. The Argentine now just wants to keep the title race alive until the last possible moment. “We have always competed and we will be competitive again on Sunday,” Simeone said. “The game is important, against a rival with numbers that speak for themselves. “We still have to go to Villarreal and Real Madrid. There are 12 games left and we are all competing for something. “The points (on Sunday) are important because they give us a (smaller) margin and that makes us better able to handle what’s left.” Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde has played down the importance of the match at the Nou camp, claiming it will not be the decider. “It’s not a final for LaLiga,” Valverde said. “It will be an important three points to the winners, but not decisive. “We are two strong teams and the three points are worth a lot.” That does not help with us building this up to be the biggest game of the season but I can confirm it definitely is! Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, Piqué, Umtiti, Jordi Alba, Busquets, Iniesta, Rakitic, Coutinho, Messi, Suarez. Subs: Cillessen, Dembélé, Paulinho, Paco Alcácer, Digne, André Gomes, Vermaelen. Atletico Madrid: Oblak, Vrsaljko, Gimenez, Godin, Filipe Luis, Gabi, Partey, Saul, Koke, Griezmann, Costa Subs: Werner, Lucas, Juanfran, Vitolo, Correa, Torres, Gameiro.

Now Usain Bolt is gone, and Justin Gatlin is getting on, everybody is waiting to see who is going to take over as the world’s fastest man. Right now the main contender is Christian Coleman, a 21-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia. Coleman split Bolt and Gatlin when he won silver in the 100m at the world championships in London last year. In Birmingham on Saturday night he shredded his way through the world indoor 60m final in a championship record of 6.37sec, which was three hundredths off the world record he set last month. Coleman’s run was all the better because it was against such a strong field. Between Coleman, his teammate Ronnie Baker and China’s Su Bingtian, it featured three of the seven fastest 60m sprinters in history. And while Coleman was able to take it oh so easy in the heats, Bingtian pushed him hard here in the final, right up to the line. Bingtian finished in a personal best of 6.42; Baker was another couple of a hundredths back in third place. Coleman’s run was the highlight of a fun, and chaotic, night. Two days after Laura Muir won her first medal at a major global championships, a bronze in the 3,000m, she took her second, a silver in the 1500m. Before that, Eilidh Doyle won bronze in the 400m too. It looked for a time as though Britain had won another bronze as well: Elliot Giles finished fourth in the 800m, but was promoted to third and then demoted back down again. It all took 90 minutes to sort out, which must have made it the slowest 800m race in history. Muir’s race was the best of the three that featured Brits. She finished almost a second back from the great Genzebe Dibaba, who won in 4min 05.27sec. But Muir fought her way past the defending champion, Sifan Hassan, on the back straight of the last lap. “I just ran my socks off,” Muir said. She had the kind of week that Alf Tupper used to put up with in The Tough of The Track comic strip each week, with a seven-hour taxi ride through a blizzard to make her first race back on Thursday. The only difference is that Tupper used to win his races. Muir may well do that too soon enough if she carries on like this, although Dibaba will clearly take some beating. It has been eight years since she lost a race indoors, bar one disqualification, and she has just become the second woman to do the middle-distance double at the world indoors, after Gabriela Szabo. Doyle was only running here to sharpen up her speed ahead of the Commonwealth Games, when she will be competing in her regular event, the 400m hurdles. She was well back from the eventual winner, the USA’s Courtney Okolo, but like Muir she found herself in a fierce scrap for second place. Okolo’s team-mate Shakima Wimbley passed Doyle coming off the final bend but it was a gutsy run. Doyle grew up just down the road from Muir and they even went to the same school. They must raise them tough in Kinross. Doyle had made it through to the final after the Swiss runner Léa Sprunger was disqualified in the heats. For a while it looked as though Giles, who was born and raised in Birmingham, was going to get the benefit from a DQ too. He finished fourth in the 800m after he was passed by the USA’s Drew Windle in the final few metres. Then Windle was disqualified for jostling Giles earlier in the race. It was a close call and led to some disgruntled muttering about the home judging from a few suspicious American fans. They were still arguing about the decision in the appeals room 90 minutes later. Then the judges finally announced that Windle had been reinstated after all. It was a messy business. There have been a lot of DQ decisions at these championships, and there is an idea that the judges are being a little too stringent. The winner of the men’s 400m, Spain’s Óscar Husillos, was disqualified as well, so Poland’s Pavel Maslak won the gold. There were some boos about that one, too. Cruel as all that was for Giles, he was still happier about his circumstances than his team-mate CJ Ujah, the British sprint champion. Ujah was disqualified for a false start in the semi-finals of the 60m. His assessment ran to two words. The printable one was “indoors”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/03/after-the-freeze-empty-shops-lost-bookings-but-also-reunited-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T20:00:44Z","webTitle":"After the freeze: empty shops, lost bookings, but also reunited communities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/03/after-the-freeze-empty-shops-lost-bookings-but-also-reunited-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/03/after-the-freeze-empty-shops-lost-bookings-but-also-reunited-communities","fields":{"headline":"After the freeze: empty shops, lost bookings, but also reunited communities","bodyText":"Lennoxtown lies 12 miles north-east of Glasgow but for much of last week it might well have been on a different planet. Blizzards enveloped the little settlement and brought it to a freezing standstill. The shelves of the Co-op rapidly emptied as deliveries dried up because roads surrounding the village and others in the Campsie Glen had become impassable in snow drifts more than two metres deep. The local bus operator cancelled services linking the villages to major roads. The people of Lennoxtown suddenly found themselves isolated and dependent on each other as the “beast from the east” blasted Britain with Arctic ferocity and triggered some of the grimmest winter conditions of recent years. And this chilling tale was repeated across the country, from the Cotswolds to Coventry and from Cornwall to Cardiff. Hillary Ogden, who farms 60 sheep near Stroud in the Cotswolds with her husband Trevor, said the conditions were the worst to affect the area for 20 to 30 years. “I could have sat down and cried sometimes but you can’t do that. Some of the sheep are near to lambing so it’s imperative that we get to them. We’ve had a couple who have lambed already and we’ve got them in some dog kennels here. We’ve got one in the house. We’re having to unfreeze all the pipes in the barn. There’s also a shortage of straw this year, so it’s more expensive – that has been a problem. All the water troughs are freezing over so we’re having to look after that as well.” Debbie Reed, who runs the Old Mill House B&amp;B near Padstow, Cornwall, with her husband Ashley, said five of their seven bookings this weekend had been cancelled and that the adjoining Old Mill Bistro, run by her son Adam, was also heavily affected. “This evening everybody has cancelled their tables,” she said. “There are just no cars on the road.” She said the weather would have a huge financial impact for them. “Had the people not cancelled we’d probably just about break even. I used to be a teacher before. Ashley was a builder and Adam was a policeman. You just don’t realise the financial impact the weather has on businesses.” In FarGo Village, a repurposed industrial space in Coventry, Michael McEntee, owner of the Big Comfy Bookshop, said his store had been closed since Thursday. “We cancelled our poetry night on Thursday – which is a huge outlet for Coventry people – a gig on Friday and we’ve had to cancel a local book launch yesterday, too, which is a great shame.” McEntee said the start of the year usually proved to be a tough time: “This week’s closures won’t help.” He added that he would be active on the shop’s social media sites “to show that it’s not the end of the world. Also I’ve had two days with my kids to make snowmen.” Matt Barraclough, who runs the Calls Sandwich Bar in Leeds with his partner Chris Watson, said the past few days had been really challenging. “On Thursday we got in and opened up but our deliveries couldn’t make it so we were short on stock. That turned out to not be a problem as over 90% of our regular customer base didn’t make it in. On Friday we didn’t make it in at all.” Barraclough added that over the past three days the cafe’s takings were down by 80%. “That’s a huge chunk of money for a small business and will cause problems to our cash flow. What it means is that when it comes to paying our bills at the end of March, it’s going to be really tight.” James Rix, owner and head chef at the Fox and Hounds pub in Hunsdon in Hertfordshire, said he estimated to have lost close to £9,000 in takings over the week as a result of the weather. The pub, well-known for its food, is in a village several miles from a main road and diners were put off by the possibility of getting stuck. “We had 20 bookings for lunch and 30 for dinner for Thursday, said Rix. “We ended up with four diners, one of whom was the lady over the road who came in because her boiler had broken down.” In Cardiff, Carl Tugwell of Tugwell Master Builders described last week’s weather as horrendous. “We have lost so much time. It’s been difficult for workers – when there is no work there is no pay, and we haven’t been able to work for three days now.” On top of the financial impact, there are also fears about the likely effect of last week’s weather on the health of the nation. “We are admitting many frail elderly people with severe bronchopneumonia, strokes, heart and respiratory failure,” said Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine. “But there are also all those problems associated with the direct cold and the fact that people are doing things, like sledging, that they don’t usually do and so are suffering more fractured hips, severe hypothermia, broken legs and severe facial injuries. “This is on top of the influenza epidemic that was already here. The big fear is that there are people out there who are seriously ill who cannot access the service the need, and are deteriorating while waiting for help. We will not know the true human cost until the figures for the coming week are published, in 10 days or so. “Overall the efforts made by very many NHS staff have been immense, and truly they have gone so far beyond the ‘normal’. It is incredible. But this cannot go on without major risks to the wellbeing of these people.” However, one happier note was sounded in Lennoxtown, where local men got together to clear roads and people’s driveways. “It took twice as long as it ought to have done as we all stopped every few minutes for a blether,” said local resident Ronnie Shepherd. “The absence of traffic also had people walking to the shops and stopping to talk to each other, just as I remember them doing when I was young. Although it was an inconvenience for most people, the snow actually brought communities together. Perhaps it has actually done more good than harm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/03/saudi-arabia-new-mood-freedom-for-women-but-is-it-ready","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-03T20:59:00Z","webTitle":"The kingdom’s women can now drive, join the military, visit sports arenas and cinemas – with other changes planned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/03/saudi-arabia-new-mood-freedom-for-women-but-is-it-ready","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/03/saudi-arabia-new-mood-freedom-for-women-but-is-it-ready","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Arabia’s new mood: more freedom for women – but is the nation ready?","bodyText":"Nada Qahtani and the seven women with her gathered expectantly in the atrium of the National Museum. Draped in black abayas, their faces shielded by masks that left only their eyes exposed, the group had not seen the building before and knew little about what was inside. A giant new poster of one of Saudi Arabia’s ancient sites covered most of a wall ahead. And a collection of artefacts, predating the Islamic era, took pride of place inside the entrance. “There are two idols there,” said a museum attendant, pointing to an exhibition that would have been unthinkable in recent decades, when the country’s archaeological past was at best ignored, and often disavowed. “The rest are now being displayed in Japan.” Once gatekeepers of a culture that regarded anything before the life of the Muslim prophet as a time of ignorance, the attendants were ushering in a new era that embraced – not eschewed – the region’s long history. In November, when the larger exhibition was opened, many feared that openly displaying artefacts regarded by some as idolatry would lead to a backlash. To the relief of many, the response has largely been positive. “I was afraid,” said art historian Maha al-Sinan. “I did not know what people’s reaction would be. Especially since they were shown to the public for the first time. Religious beliefs have become related to social ideas. There was a need to spread awareness about what those idols really represent. Not each and every one was to be worshipped like a god. People are now driving this change and wanting us to recognise it.” Qahtani, 26, was just as enthusiastic. “For us as a young generation, we need to know the history of our region,” she said. “We are deeply rooted here. And comprehending our historical identity matters to us.” Outside the museum, understanding how the modern kingdom got to this point is also in vogue. For the past three months, political leaders have proclaimed – often to sceptical audiences – that acknowledging the country’s past is central to shaping its future. Discussions about history, archaeology and culture have become part of the Saudi lexicon. So, too, have other former taboos, such as individual liberties – and a national identity that has taken on dimensions beyond Islam. Slowly a view is taking hold that real change is taking place in a kingdom renowned for resistance to anything new. But the pace of the reform programme, introduced by the crown prince and heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman, has left many in the kingdom bewildered. Last month alone, women were told they could join the military and the intelligence service. Driving schools will soon open for women who can legally take to the roads on their own in June. Sports arenas have opened to females and cinemas are being built and reopened across the country. And in a move that has startled many, a senior cleric recently decreed that wearing an abaya was not obligatory under Islam, and should be regarded as a personal choice. “Most of what we know is Islamic culture. It’s important that there is something beyond that,” said Qahtani. “The way we Saudis were is not something we should hide from.” Her purple trainers protruding from her robe, Qahtani said she welcomed the abaya decree, especially the bit about choice. “There was no- one forcing us to wear this in Islam,” she said, ignoring the fact that women who did not abide by the rigid dress code would probably have been whipped by the religious police. “For me this is a choice, it is part of my identity.” Inside the museum Abdullah, a visitor from Mecca, said wearing the abaya was obligatory. Standing next to him, his sister and niece, both covered from head to toe, agreed. New cultural values were one thing, but personal codes another. “And this is where they are going to run into resistance,” said a Riyadh-based diplomat. “Just how much support there is out there to a reform programme that genuinely is revolutionary is very tough to gauge.” Nearly one year into his reign as the kingdom’s strongman, Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated his authority through a change agenda that has been so rapid it has muted those who might otherwise have warned against it. At the same time he has sidelined clerics he deems to have been unsupportive, and ousted rival royals who may have had a claim on the throne. His heady rise will be recognised in London this week when the young crown prince will meet the Queen on his first foreign visit since his father, King Salman, dismissed his cousin, Mohammad bin Nayef, to give him a clear run at the monarchy. The reception awaiting the crown prince is that of both heir and de facto leader. “There is a lot to get behind,” said a senior British official. “The domestic agenda is real. But he has some issues on the regional front. And he needs to be careful who he listens to.” Saudi Arabia remains embroiled in three regional conflicts – a war in Yemen, a standoff with Qatar, and a feud with Lebanon’s leader, Saad Hariri – all ignited by Prince Mohammed. The conflicts have roots in Saudi perceptions that the regional rival, Iran, has used all three arenas to advance its agenda. Across Riyadh, and in parts of the Middle East, the crown prince has been accused of unwittingly driving all three countries further into the hands of Iran. “He doesn’t yet know how to lead,” said one leading Riyadh businessman. “But he will get there, hopefully.” Across the Saudi capital for the past three months, the talk has been the goings-on in the Ritz Carlton hotel, where titans of industry, executives and politicians had been detained, facing graft charges. Hailed by Prince Mohammed as a corruption purge, and a marker of a new, more transparent business environment in a society keen to attract international capital, it was instead labelled by his critics as a blatant power grab. One senior regional official described the episode, which ended in mid-February with several dozen detainees from an original list of close to 300 being transferred to a prison, as “a bit about all three” – first, a more transparent way of doing business globally; second, recouping assets and cash lost over decades of industrial-scale graft; third, eliminating what remained of Prince Mohammed’s rivals. “How he will emerge from all of this is yet to be written,” said another senior official. Also uncertain is how a conservative society, unused to upsets, will emerge from such regular bouts of shock therapy. With announcements about the latest reforms being made almost daily, there is a fear that “the system” may derail momentum. “There are many at medium levels of the bureaucracy who do not want to see women in the workplace, or on the streets,” said a senior military officer. “They know that the best way to stop this is not to appear to defy the rulers, but not do their bidding either. Any real change here will take a lot more than one guy saying it, no matter how strong he is.” On Riyadh’s streets, a half-finished metro network and a half-finished financial centre suggest the gap between ambition and realisation remained vast. “Prices have more than doubled this past nine months,” said Mahmoud Azzam, a city driver. “If business doesn’t start to increase, that’s when you’ll see whether these reforms succeed or fail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/mar/05/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T15:00:44Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/05/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/05/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. It’s time for some sunshine – as you can see above, ID8459116 has found an beautiful copy of HV Morton’s A Traveller In Southern Italy: I just brought it for 45 rand in Norwood, a shabby suburb just above central Johannesburg. I’ve got a lot of his stuff; he is a dream of a travel writer. Actually, I’ve got this already, I think, but not with the dust jacket. It’s torn, but lovely. And vivid, just like southern Italy really is. When you read the first few paragraphs (when he arrives in Tivoli very early in the morning) you cannot help but be delighted by his evocative style. It’s 1969, and the newly made roads are making this road trip a possibility that would have been difficult a decade earlier. Wouldn’t it be nice if I could make the same trip in 2019, 50 years after Morton’s ‘grand tour’... Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast And Slow has earned a mention from tommydog: His research was the basis for the study of behavioural economics. Kahneman argues that people are inclined to make snap, generally erroneous decisions, often to their detriment, rather than well thought out decisions. He tested this by structuring questions and giving tests. A typical question might be something like: Peter is quiet, reflective, very studious, intelligent and something of a loner. Tom is most likely a librarian or a farmer? Most people choose librarian because he fits the stereotype, but farmers out number librarians, so statistically Peter is far more likely to be a farmer, albeit a quiet and studious one. Many people have argued that this explodes the whole theory of homo economicus, that theoretical being who makes all decisions rationally to maximise his benefit. “From the first pages” of George Eliot’s Felix Holt, The Radical, “you know you are in the company of a great writer,” says vermontlogger: The Reform Bill has just passed, and Loamshire is preparing for the election. (So, Middlemarch was a sort of prequel.) Harold Transome, second son of a family of hereditary Tories, returns after years spent amassing wealth as a banker in Smyrna. His ageing mother has had to manage the entailed estate on her own, her husband being feeble and her first son dissolute. She was always fonder of Harold as a boy, so fond she wished the first son dead. And she guards a secret: Harold is the result of a dalliance. Now what does she find? Mortification. Harold is brusque and dismissive to her face; he has married and never told her; he announces he will stand in the election – as a Radical. We’re still in chapter one! George Eliot relates it all with smooth authority. I’m settling in for 500 pages of pleasure. The Unseen by Roy Jacobsen has also struck Tom Mooney as “superb”: Shortlisted for last year’s International Booker, it follows the Barroy family as they scratch out a living from the island and waters that bear their name ... Beautifully written it is, but much of the credit must go to translators Don Bartlett and Don Shaw. They have rendered a book steeped in local custom and dialect into English with great skill. A wonderful book I will never forget Elsewhere, tyorkshiretealass has revisited JK Rowling’s Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone “and remembered why I’d loved it so much as a kid”: OK, writing-wise it’s not exactly the greatest work of literature, but I do think Rowling does a particularly great job with the world-building and I still liked the combination of the Enid Blyton-style ‘school story’ with the adventure and fantastical elements. It also feels oddly refreshing to look back on it in comparison to the later books and now Fantastic Beasts - there’s an innocence about it and a lightness of touch, a sense that it’s not taking itself too seriously, which I think disappeared as the series went on. allworthy also conjured some happy memories: I so miss queuing at midnight for next Harry Potter book ... apart from Peake and Tolkien no one else has come close to creating an alternative world for me. It’s something to be very proud of. Some very clever people brought it to page and screen and it’s been a huge part of so many people’s lives. It’s still being reinvented and doesn’t rest on its laurels: look at Kay’s gorgeous illustrations. I can’t begin to understand how people don’t love it or get it. The magic was real ... Interesting links about books and reading Daniel Kahneman also got a mention on Adam Buxton’s latest podcast. Fake books sold on Amazon? And Amazon profits?Oh dear. The New York Times reports on US librarians dealing with overdoses on their premises. (Hat tip to ChronicExpat.) Sad news from Japan.

Ruth Serwotka, convener of the Socialist Feminist Network, said she and others on the left had been “frozen out” of voicing their concerns to the party leadership about what they believe would be the impact of the government’s proposed Gender Recognition Act. The act would make it easier for people to self-declare their gender without having to be assessed by clinicians. Nearly 500 people from Labour, the Greens, the Women’s Equality party and trade unions attended the latest meeting of the group, which took place in London at a location that was kept secret because of what the group alleges is intimidation by trans activists. “I think that in time there will be an impact on Labour’s support among women and trust in the party from women,” said Serwotka. Further meetings are planned around the country, she said, and will lead to the establishment of “a new women’s liberation movement” later this year. “It will talk about wider issues than just transgender issues and really go back to the founding principles of the women’s liberation movement, look at whether they are fit for purpose, and consider what any new founding principles might look like. We want to do that because we certainly want to be able to influence a Labour government.” The campaign by Serwotka and other feminists comes against the backdrop of divisions in Labour over whether transgender women can be included on all-women shortlists for parliamentary seats. The party is embarking on a consultation after confirming they are welcome to stand without a gender recognition certificate. Divisions threatened to spill over on Saturday at the annual meeting of an influential group on the party’s left, whose membership includes Jeremy Corbyn and Jon Lansman, the activist currently involved in a separate power struggle to become Labour’s general secretary. Factions in the bitter split had both been encouraging supporters to join the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD), which met in central London. They include CLPD member Jennifer James, who has established a crowdfunding campaign to bankroll a potential legal challenge in relation to Labour policy on all-women shortlists. The crowdfunder states that the election of self-identifying transwomen as women’s officers and their inclusion on all-women shortlists is reducing and undermining female representation in the party. She was suspended from the party over comments made by her online. James issued a call for allies to attend the campaign’s annual meeting after a young Labour activist, Max Shanly, called on people to join the group in order to “clear out the transphobes and cranks”. James’s online campaign, which has now raised more than £23,000, has been criticised as “transphobic” with figures such as the MP Clive Lewis supporting trans women being allowed on to all-female shortlists and describing James as “wrong”. Leigh Drennan, a councillor and vice-chair of Young Labour, said that much of the debate had been marked by what he called “casual transphobia”, and that social media had allowed those opposed to letting trans women on to the shortlists to appear as if they had more support than they actually do. “I am a gay man and know the battles that have had to be fought over decades to win rights for gay people. That battle has been won in many – though not all – quarters, but it is still going on for trans people, and they need Labour’s support,” he said. “The vast majority of the public would not care either way about the Labour party’s internal position, but we are the largest political party in western Europe and I think we have got to lead in this. “I think that the overwhelming majority of the Labour party certainly support the inclusion of trans women on all-women shortlists. In 40 years’ time people will look back and view campaigns for the exclusion of trans women as bizarre.” The transgender model Munroe Bergdorf was last week appointed as an LGBT adviser to the Labour party, saying on social media that she was “absolutely delighted” to be part of a panel to support the shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler. The move was criticised by the Conservatives because of Bergdorf’s previous controversial comments, which she insists were taken out of context by newspapers, that she no longer had the energy to talk about the “racial violence of white people any more”. • This article was amended on 4 March 2018 to clarify the focus of the crowdfunding campaign set up by Jennifer James."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/can-restaurant-apps-make-splitting-the-bill-a-thing-of-the-past","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T14:32:52Z","webTitle":"Can restaurant apps make splitting the bill a thing of the past?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/can-restaurant-apps-make-splitting-the-bill-a-thing-of-the-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/can-restaurant-apps-make-splitting-the-bill-a-thing-of-the-past","fields":{"headline":"Can restaurant apps make splitting the bill a thing of the past?","bodyText":"Name: Dine &amp; Dash.

In its traditional form, it is. Eating and then doing a runner – AKA dining and ditching, or chewing and screwing – is the bane of the restaurateur’s life. In the US, it has been estimated that one in 20 people have dined and dashed. But this is the legal form. Is there a legal form? There is now.

You are back in the stone age. I like the stone age. Be quiet and listen. You get to your seats, use your app to tap into an electronic device called a totem, which is in the middle of the table ... Zzzzzzzzzzzz. Then you order your food as normal, see what you are being billed in real time and walk out any time you like. Without so much as a cursory nod to the waiter and maitre d’? What’s a maitre d’? Something you app obsessives will never have heard of. Anyway, yes, you can leave when you like. Location-tracking technology tells the restaurant you have left, the light on the totem changes colour from blue to green and the bill is automatically deducted from whatever account you signed up with. Clever, eh? It’s HORRIBLE! It’s the future. In any case, you don’t have to dash. You can settle the bill through the app in the conventional way if you want, adding a tip and saying thank you to your waiter. What if you want to share the food and split the bill? Easy – as long as you all have the app. Sounds like a nightmare. Are you having a starter?

Six words that sum up the performance of the Italian economy in the decade since the financial crisis, and that go a long way towards explaining the support for populist parties in the election. Indeed, if ever there was a country that was ripe for a protest against the political mainstream it was Italy, where four years of modest growth have not been nearly enough to repair the damage caused by a deep slump in 2008-09 and a second two-year recession in 2012-13. Only two countries that belong to the west’s club of rich nations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have yet to see economic activity surpass pre-financial-crisis levels. Greece is one. Italy is the other. In some respects, Italy’s record since the turn of the century is even worse than that of Greece, because at least Greece had a boom before the bad times arrived. Italy’s living standards are only slightly higher than they were when the country became a founder member of the single currency in 1999. Membership of the euro has clearly been a factor in explaining the rise of populism in Italy, because it has made it impossible for governments in Rome to restore competitiveness by devaluing the currency – something they did on a regular basis in the days before monetary union. The disciplines of euro membership have resulted in slower growth, stagnant wages, high unemployment and austerity – perfect conditions for Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement to exploit. Mainstream politicians such as Italy’s outgoing prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, can point to some small successes. A million jobs have been created in the past four years, although 60% of them are part-time. Youth unemployment has come down, but a third of all people under the age of 25 are still without work – double the average for the EU. Unable to find jobs at home, young Italian graduates have left the country to find opportunities elsewhere. Speaking in Davos less than two months ago, Gentiloni aptly summed up the problem he faced at the election. “There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. “Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels.” There are certain features that appear to make populist insurgencies more likely. A country needs to have been through a prolonged economic trauma, just as Italy has. It needs to be geographically split between a fast-growing region and a struggling region, as Italy is with the marked divide between the industrial north and the agrarian south. It needs policymakers to respond to the budget deficits that result from high unemployment and slow growth by imposing welfare cuts, which Italian governments have been obliged to do as a result of the EU’s fiscal rules. And it needs economic and social tensions to be inflamed by mass immigration, as has been the case in Italy, the main gateway to Europe for those travelling from Libya. Like Britain, Italy has a productivity problem, only worse. Like France, it has an unemployment problem, only worse. Like Spain, it has had banking problems, only worse. And as in Germany, a sudden surge in migration has created a twin problem for the mainstream parties. It has made them appear to be completely out of touch with ordinary voters, and to be like rabbits in the headlights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/why-britains-attitude-to-breastfeeding-is-still-a-disgrace","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T17:28:57Z","webTitle":"Why Britain's attitude to breastfeeding is still a disgrace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/why-britains-attitude-to-breastfeeding-is-still-a-disgrace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/why-britains-attitude-to-breastfeeding-is-still-a-disgrace","fields":{"headline":"Why Britain's attitude to breastfeeding is still a disgrace","bodyText":"Shock, horror! A woman has bared part of one of her breasts (let’s say 35% of total breast area) on a magazine cover in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Not for the sake of titillation but lactation: to feed a baby. The model gazes out at the reader with a defiant half-smile. The baby feeds on, blissfully unaware that its food source is also an international site of objectification. The cover line reads: “Mums tell Kerala: don’t stare – we need to breastfeed.” The response? Lots of staring, debate, outrage, accusations of sensationalism and one indecency case launched against the magazine, Grihalakshmi. Which is ironic because feeding a baby is pretty much the definition of human decency. The cover was inspired by a photo of an Indian woman, Amritha, publicly breastfeeding her daughter, which went viral on Facebook. Amritha says she was told off for breastfeeding her baby in hospital and advised that if she fed without covering her breasts, her milk would dry up. But, before we start congratulating ourselves for our more evolved attitudes, remember that the UK has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, and women are still not permitted to nurse in the House of Commons chamber. Breastfeeding is bloody hard work, and I write this with my own seven-month-old on my breast, not for authenticity’s sake but because she is hungry. It takes patience, practice, commitment, physical strength, good humour, multiple tubes of Lansinoh cream, and enough chutzpah to withstand the stares, unwanted advice and general opprobrium that come your way whenever you need to feed your baby while out and about. This is why a third of women feel embarrassed breastfeeding in public, according to one UK survey. I’ve breastfed both my babies; my son until he was nearly two (go on, judge me). This has meant feeding on the bus, in cafes, on park benches, in front of my dad, and – on one particularly fabulous occasion – on stage while I was discussing Anne of Green Gables. I have felt embarrassed, vulnerable and exposed. Once, I retreated to the toilet. It’s not easy whipping out an intimate and sexualised part of your body that has doubled in size and developed the ability to shoot multiple jets of hot milk from its core. This should incite praise, compassion and awe, as opposed to accusations of indecency. The only shame in breastfeeding is in the misogynistic attempt to turn the simple, free, loving and necessary act of feeding our babies into a dirty secret."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/05/mass-die-off-of-sea-creatures-follows-freezing-uk-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T16:02:59Z","webTitle":"Mass die-off of sea creatures follows freezing UK weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/05/mass-die-off-of-sea-creatures-follows-freezing-uk-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/05/mass-die-off-of-sea-creatures-follows-freezing-uk-weather","fields":{"headline":"Mass die-off of sea creatures follows freezing UK weather","bodyText":"Massive numbers of starfish, crab, mussels and lobsters have been washed up on the North Sea coast of the UK, following the recent freezing weather and storms. Tens of thousands of creatures are piled up ankle-deep in places along the Holderness coast in Yorkshire and similar mass mortality has been reported in Kent and Norfolk. “There was a 3C drop in sea temperature last week which will have caused animals to hunker down and reduce their activity levels,” said Bex Lynam, from the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. “This makes them vulnerable to rough seas – they became dislodged by large waves and washed ashore when the rough weather kicked in.” The casualties are mostly invertebrates though some fish were also found. “Larger animals such as dolphins are more mobile and can save themselves by swimming away when this sort of thing happens,” said Lynam. All the organisms piled up on the shores were dead, except some of the lobsters. Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s team worked alongside local fishermen to rescue the surviving lobsters, collecting them in buckets and taking them to tanks in Bridlington. The aim is to put them back in the sea when the weather improves. Lynam said: “This area is very important for shellfish and we work alongside fishermen to promote sustainable fisheries and protect reproductive stocks. It’s worth saving them so that they can be put back into the sea and continue to breed.” Large numbers of dead animals were also found at the Norfolk Wildlife Trust’s Holme Dunes reserve near Hunstanton. Local warden Gary Hibberd said he had seen crabs, squat lobsters, starfish, sea anemones, sea cucumbers, sun stars and whelks. Dr Lissa Batey, senior living seas officer at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “We can’t prevent natural disasters like this. But we can mitigate against declining marine life and the problems that humans cause by creating enough protected areas at sea and by ensuring that these sites are large enough and close enough to offer fish, crustaceans, dolphins and other marine life the protection they require to withstand natural events such as this.” Holderness inshore waters are already designated as a Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) and the government is due to announce a consultation into more MCZs this year. However, an £8m government consultation proposed 127 sites in 2011, only 50 of which have been designated so far. The most recent designations, in 2016, stretched from the coast of Northumberland down to Land’s End and included Europe’s longest chalk reef off Cromer in Norfolk. The 50 MCZs, along with other types of protected areas, now cover 20% of all English waters, almost 8,000 sq miles (20,700 sq km). The MCZs have been also criticised as useless “paper parks” that offer no real protection from the dredging and trawling that has devastated large areas of England’s seas for decades. “They have no management at all, so life within them remains unprotected,” said said Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York and one of the UK’s leading marine conservation experts. “They will be worse than useless, giving the illusion of protection where none is present.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/06/philip-hammond-accused-hoodwinking-over-public-sector-pay-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Philip Hammond is 'hoodwinking' public sector over pay rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/06/philip-hammond-accused-hoodwinking-over-public-sector-pay-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/06/philip-hammond-accused-hoodwinking-over-public-sector-pay-rise","fields":{"headline":"Philip Hammond is 'hoodwinking' public sector over pay rise","bodyText":"Philip Hammond’s continued squeeze on Whitehall departments means that the government could not fund a 1% pay rise for public sector workers without cutting jobs or public services, according to a new analysis. Trade unions have argued that all public sector workers, including nurses, teachers, refuse collectors and civil servants, deserve a fully funded 5% increase – after years of suffering from pay restraint. But a report by the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) thinktank, on behalf of the PCS union, said current projections of departmental spending would prevent even minimal increases in people’s wages. It said the figures cast doubt on the government’s claim to have lifted the public sector pay cap, arguing that in practice it would remain in place unless ministers overhauled spending policy. Dr Faiza Shaheen, director of Class, accused the chancellor of “attempting to hoodwink the public into believing the public sector pay cap is over while knowing full well that it isn’t”. She claimed that “empty words on the pay cap” were an insult to five million public sector workers, some of whom were using food banks. “Our analysis shows what Philip Hammond knows: lifting the public sector pay cap either means further job losses or cutting public services, an impossible and unfair choice.” Pay restraint has been a reality in the public sector since 2010, when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition froze wages completely. In 2013, a 1% limit was put in its place. However, after the issue was seen to have been critical in the Tories losing their majority in 2017, Theresa May and Hammond came under intense political pressure to act and promised to lift the cap. Police received a 1% pay increase with a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting 1.7%. However, Hammond did not announce any further increases in the budget, instead waiting for the advice of independent pay review bodies. Campaigners said the Class research showed how unlikely it was that the government would choose to fund increases, warning that a 1% rise would be well below inflation, and amount to a real-terms pay cut. The study found that the Department for Work and Pensions would need to see its day-to-day spending rise by 15.9% to accommodate the change; HMRC would need to be 14% bigger; the Ministry of Justice 11%; and the Department for Transport, 18.5%. As such, Hammond could only fund pay increases by lifting overall spending or cutting back in other areas such as job numbers or public services on offer, it concluded. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is expected to attack Hammond over the issue at an event in parliament on Tuesday, which will be attended by the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey. McDonnell called on ministers to stop “playing one group of workers off against another”. A Treasury spokesman insisted that the cap had been lifted and that ministers were ready to consider the recommendations made about future pay awards. “The government is committed to the delivery of world class public services, and ensuring that public sector workers are fairly paid for the vitally important work that they do,” he said. The government argues that pay awards should differ to reflect the various circumstances around recruitment and retention levels, and that it would be wrong to pre-empt the advice of the pay review bodies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/05/hundreds-of-mental-health-patients-dying-after-nhs-care-failures","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T18:00:48Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of mental health patients died after NHS care failures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/05/hundreds-of-mental-health-patients-dying-after-nhs-care-failures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/05/hundreds-of-mental-health-patients-dying-after-nhs-care-failures","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of mental health patients died after NHS care failures","bodyText":"At least 271 highly vulnerable mental health patients have died over the last six years after failings in NHS care, a Guardian investigation has found. Coroners have been so alarmed at the lapses in care that emerged during inquests that they issued legal warnings to 136 NHS bodies, mainly providers of care, between 2012 and 2017. They included mental health trusts, acute hospitals, ambulance services and GP surgeries. Mental health campaigners said the findings were shocking and claimed that many of the deaths were avoidable and constituted a “tragedy”. “It is not acceptable that some trusts fail in some of the most fundamental requirements of providing care, with catastrophic consequences,” said Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind. “Every one of these deaths is a tragedy, and it must be deeply difficult for families already having to come to terms with losing a loved one to learn that their death could have been prevented,” added Farmer, who chaired NHS England’s taskforce in 2015-16 on improving mental health care. A Guardian investigation has established that coroners in England and Wales have served “a prevention of future deaths notice” (PFDNs) on one or more NHS bodies in 271 cases. The coroners identified problems including errors, misjudgments, flawed processes, a lack of staff or beds and poor training. Coroners are obliged under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to issue a notice if they believe shortcomings by a person, organisation or public body such as a hospital trust, council or government department, are so serious that other people may die unless urgent action is taken to tackle them. The Guardian’s analysis of all the notices issued between 2012 and 2017 involving people receiving NHS care for mental health conditions uncovered a total of 706 failings across the 271 deaths. In many cases patients took their own lives. The disclosures follow growing concern about the NHS’s ability to cope with the fast-rising demand for mental health care, especially among children, young people and older people, and fears that some patients are facing long delays in accessing treatment and receiving inadequate care when they do. Bodies such as the Commons health select committee, NHS Providers, mental health staff organisations and charities have warned that NHS services have too few staff. There are 6,000 fewer mental health nurses in England than in 2010 and the number of psychiatrists for children and adolescents is also falling. Many of the notices examined by the Guardian cited inadequate supervision of someone who was a clear suicide risk, or NHS staff ignoring families’ fears that their loved one would take their own life. In dozens of cases, staff made mistakes with the patient’s medication, or failed to properly assess the risk that the patient would take their own life. The notices also included: • Forty-five cases in which patients were discharged too soon or without adequate support. • Seventy-two instances of poor or inappropriate care. • Forty-one cases in which treatment was delayed. In two of the most shocking cases, an acutely distressed patient died after NHS staff looking after them made what the coroners found were 12 different types of mistakes on each occasion. One of those involved was Michael, a 50-year-old teacher who had bipolar disorder and died in July 2013 after his car hit a tree on the Wirral in Merseyside. Michael, whose full name the Guardian is withholding at his family’s request, was described by coroner André Rebello as “respected [and] high-achieving”. Rebello found that Michael had intentionally killed himself but that “the cause of death was aggravated by neglect”. The prevention of future deaths notice said the “real and immediate risk” to the teacher’s life was not recognised as a result of “failings [by the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS foundation trust] to take steps which might have been expected to avoid that risk”. It added: “His death was facilitated and enabled in part by the fact that the poor state of his mental health [the day before Michael died] had not been fully appreciated, his care, treatment and supervision was not adequate and he was not listened to.” Rebello then listed 26 separate instances of failings he called “all more than minimally or trivially contributory factors to a lesser or greater degree [in] Michael’s death”. Labour said the government should hold an inquiry into the deaths, given Theresa May’s call for the NHS to improve mental health care as part of her crusade on “burning injustices”. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, a mental health campaigner and former health minister, said the inquests had revealed “wholly unacceptable loss of life. I will be writing to Jeremy Hunt [the health and social care secretary], highlighting the Guardian’s analysis, and urging him to look at how the system can be reformed to ensure that every notice issued by a coroner is tracked so that lessons are always learnt.” The Guardian’s analysis found two trusts with notably high numbers of deaths. Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust and Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust in London each had 14 such deaths across the six years. Two of the PFDNs sent to the Avon trust related to the death in 2014 of Charlotte Bevan, who fell to her death from Avon Gorge in Bristol four days after giving birth to her daughter Zaani Malbrouck, who was in her arms. The case attracted widespread publicity after CCTV footage emerged of Bevan, who had schizophrenia, leaving St Michael’s hospital carrying Zaani. Dr Rebecca Eastley, the Avon trust’s medical director, said: “Every death by suicide is a tragic loss of life and reducing the number of people who take their own lives in the area we cover is a priority for our trust. Preventing suicide is a complex task and we are committed to learning lessons from every case.” Improvements in care made since 2012 have cut the trust’s suicide rate by 31%, she added. In a statement Camden and Islington trust said that it “provides care in an area of London with one of the highest demands for complex mental health support in the NHS. The death of any service user is a source of great concern and sadness for all the staff involved in that individual’s treatment. Our clinicians review every death in line with national guidance and examine any failings, where appropriate, in the quality of care provided.” The total number of deaths in which the NHS was found to be at fault would be higher than 271 if deaths of inmates in jail where health service staff provided the medical care were included. Hunt made clear that NHS trusts should implement in full recommendations made by coroners to reduce the risk of further fatalities. “Every preventable death is a tragedy, bringing unimaginable distress both for families and staff, so where coroners recommend specific steps to prevent future tragedy, I expect NHS bodies to act without delay,” he said. “The prime minister and I have made mental health services a personal priority: from record spending, to our zero suicide ambition, to the new law on parity of esteem, we are seeing progress, but there is still more to do: any avoidable harm is simply unacceptable.” • In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

I can’t lie’","bodyText":"John Boyega is talking about the day his world changed – and he knew everything would be OK. It’s not when he got the lead role in his first film, Attack The Block, aged 18, nor when he was whisked off by JJ Abrams to Hollywood for a mighty role in Star Wars. Not even when he earned his spurs as a serious film actor in last year’s Detroit, a shocking exposé of racism in the US police. No, he realised everything was going to be just fine back in secondary school when he learned to use his hands. “I smacked a few people in the face. That was a glorious day. I was 14 or 15. I was on the 148 bus and I got to the bus stop and a guy that had been at our school was there with two of his friends. He wanted a new phone, so he thought he was going to get one off me. Anyway, to cut a long story short, he approached me with one of his friends and I made both their left eyes water. And I didn’t even punch. I slapped – hard. It was significant I slapped because that’s something a parent would do to their child.” As Boyega tells the story, he seems to experience afresh the euphoria of learning to stand up for himself. “I felt great. Fantastic. Nobody touched me after that.” As a boy he was small for his age. Kids picked on him. Today, at 25, Boyega is a big unit – broad-shouldered, stocky, strong. He looks anything but a pushover. As Finn in Star Wars he is puppyish, eager to please, endearing. In Detroit he is taciturn, observant, contained. In person, Boyega is a fascinating mix of the two – the boyish enthusiasm is countered with a resolute toughness. The second he walks into the south London pub to meet me, he is asked for an autograph. No, sorry, he says, politely but firmly, I am busy. It could easily come across as ungracious. The next second he shows a generous side. When I head to the bar to get the drinks in, he stops me. “No, you’re in my manor, I’m paying.” He gets himself a rose lemonade. Boyega doesn’t drink alcohol. He can’t stand the taste, he says. We retire upstairs where it is empty. This is one of his favourite pubs because it is so quiet. But not today. Within a couple of minutes a young woman joins us at the table, uninvited. She is virtually sitting in Boyega’s lap and asks him if he would mind taking a picture with her boss downstairs, who is a big fan. “I’m in a meeting, so I can’t leave.” “I’m sorry,” she says. She stands up and goes. “No, it’s all right, love. All right, take care.” Does he get a lot of this? “No, I really don’t. I’ve never had that before. She really took a seat. Wow!” He bursts out laughing. In the past, Boyega has insisted he is neither a role model nor a crowd pleaser. I tell him many famous people would have agreed to the photograph, particularly when being observed by a journalist. He’s not interested in that, he says. “I’ve been called an arsehole for saying no to pictures when I’m out and about. But I don’t care and the reason I don’t care is that I’ve never said no out of anger or dislike for the person or because I see myself as better than you.” Boyega grew up on an estate in Peckham, south London, with his parents and two older sisters. His father was a preacher who ran his own church and his mother was a carer. As a young boy, he did not fit in at school, struggled with the work and found it difficult to keep up with others. “I was in the bottom set for everything. I was a bit of a nuisance in class.” In maths and English he would be thinking of films he had seen or dreaming of films he could be in – such as Star Wars. He was hopeless at sport (“Sport was more for the lads”) and went to a local theatre where he studied ballet, tap and contemporary dance. That probably also explains the bullying, he says. “Doing ballet in Peckham. You’re going to get whooped in the back of your head, yeah!” How did his parents feel when he was bullied? “My mum and dad tried to get involved at various times. But it gets to a stage where teachers and family can’t help you. I’m sure my dad would have loved to bust a Range Rover through the school gates and bust up the whole school, but it wasn’t about that.” Hold on, I say, that doesn’t sound very Christian. “No, he would never have done that,” Boyega concedes. “He’s a minister, but deep in your heart you want to do something for your child. And I handled it.” Did he have many friends? “I wouldn’t call them friends.” Why not? “I didn’t see them that way; we were just students going to school. As soon as school is done, there’s nothing much in it. I had one friend from secondary school who went to the same college as me. That’s my boy Levelle. We’re friends today.” Now, he says, he’s spoilt for choice. “I have five friends. My boys. We’re solid as a team. Nobody comes in and nobody goes out. We’re all going out tonight.” Most are musicians. “I don’t have close-knit friends in my circle that are actors.” It amuses him that so many people think actors are special. “It’s just a job at the end of the day, man. But we have to keep all that ‘Actors are special!’ so we can all get paid. Heeheeheee! It’s a way of tricking you guys.” Boyega has a deep voice and a joyous, high-pitched laugh like an attack of hiccups. Before we meet, I have been warned that Boyega often thinks he is portrayed by the media as an urban street kid and that he thinks it feeds a racist stereotype. I ask him what he means. “Well, the [London] Evening Standard tried to tie me to the Damilola case and that’s insensitive as hell. They said something like, ‘He lived on an estate where guns and knives were rife.’ The fact is my estate wasn’t rife with guns and knives. That wasn’t the case. We had a beautiful theatre two minutes away from the estate.” I had also heard he did not like to talk about Damilola Taylor’s death. But today he does so at length. He says it had a huge impact on him when he was growing up. “It was my first experience of murder [the schoolboys who killed Damilola were actually convicted of manslaughter] and of death. He was my sister Grace’s friend and I was always with my sister.” Damilola’s family had only recently moved to Britain from Nigeria. Boyega’s father’s Pentecostal church was a hub of the local Nigerian community. If a Nigerian family moved to Peckham with children at the same school, Samson Adegboyega (John later shortened his name) would expect his family to support them. “When somebody comes from Nigeria for the first time,” Boyega says, “you look out for them. I was nine, Damilola was 10. He had a fresh African accent and he was getting picked on.” Boyega understood what it felt like. But, he says, it was harder for Damilola because he didn’t understand the culture. Boyega and his sister were with Damilola shortly before he was stabbed. After school, Damilola had gone to Peckham library. On his way home, approaching the North Peckham estate, he was stabbed in his left thigh and it severed an artery. He collapsed in a stairwell and died on his way to hospital. I keep thinking of what Boyega says about it being his first experience of somebody being killed. Lots of people never have that experience, I say. “Yes, and I was nine,” he says quietly. “The police came to our house because me and my sister were the last…” He trails off. “We were with him on the day. Before he got to the library my sister was like, ‘We should walk him home’ because it was already getting dark. But he was like, ‘I’m just going to pop to the library and then I’m going to go home straight from there.’ So we went home our separate ways. I think he had a crush on my sister. I was a bit uncomfortable with that.” Boyega smiles. “Then we got into the house. And a few hours later the police turned up at our door and all of a sudden we’re involved in an investigation and we didn’t understand what was going on. “At the age of nine I found it a weird concept that someone is here one day and not the next. I didn’t understand what that truly meant. It was so big. I’d never heard of murders in London before then. A little kid running around with your packed lunch and your superheroes.” Did the killing of Damilola leave him scared? “Of course it made you scared. From 2004 to 2009 knife crime was a huge problem. Even in church they would make announcements, ‘If anybody can drop anyone home because our kids can’t be on the streets.’ It felt dangerous on London’s streets. And not just in Peckham and Camberwell. Kensington and Chelsea – stuff was going down there, too. What scared me is that you don’t know who it’s going to be. I’ve seen white guys in suits bring out machetes. That was when I was going to school. The reality is you don’t know who can get angry and pull out a weapon. You just had to be careful growing up. My dad had to explain to me, look, when you see a commotion happen, whatever it is, just get out of the area.” Boyega often refers to his parents, always admiringly. “My dad is the man I want to be. He’s the living example of who I’d like to embody. He is a very good, genuine man.” Does your father think you are a good man? “He thinks I’m all right for the stage I’m at. I speak to him about everything. He knows there are certain elements that I need to work on, but I’m only 25.” What like? “More of an awareness of my spirituality. Not being controlled by emotions in the moment.” What do you regard as your biggest failing? “The way I react to certain things. Sometimes somebody has a point, and I don’t have time, and I’m like, ‘What are you saying? Get straight to the point.’ I’m very direct and sometimes you have to realise people aren’t always like you.” Especially in your business, I say. “Yeah, they like a little bit of bullshit soup.” How do you cope with that? “I don’t, I can’t lie.” After school, Boyega went to college where he retook GCSEs in English and maths. By now he was determined to prove he could learn, and go to university. He discovered he loved reading, and maths started making sense to him when he began to read about the philosophy of it. Now he is passionate about education. “Is the system currently catered to the variety of brains we have? Hell, no. Stop teaching us bullshit. Teach us about tax, teach us about credit, teach us about opening a business, teach us about housing. A lot of people will lose out on opportunities because they don’t know.” While still at college, he starred in Attack The Block, then he won a place at Greenwich University to do film studies. But after a year he dropped out to act full time, and in 2012 he met JJ Abrams in Los Angeles, while working on a Spike Lee pilot for a TV boxing drama that never got made. The Star Wars director had seen Boyega in Attack The Block, told him he loved it and promised to get him a part “in something”. Boyega thought he was all talk. “Thanks, mate, and sure,” he said sceptically. In 2014, after a seven-month audition process, Boyega was offered the part of Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A few racists on social media objected to a black (former) stormtrooper. Boyega gave them short shrift, responding on Instagram: “To whom it may concern… Get used to it.” Boyega was astonished when people told him he should have reacted “with more grace and stayed silent”. That’s when he decided, if being a role model meant staying stumm when attacked, forget it. “I was like, be graceful? Are you mad? If anyone comes talking nonsense, I’m going to shut them down. You have to fight fire with fire sometimes.” Boyega’s Finn has given Star Wars a new energy and sense of fun. Last year he appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he is signed up for the next instalment. It will be the first film without the heroic trio that have dominated the series – Princess Leia, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. In December 2016 Carrie Fisher, who played Leia, died and now the characters Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) have been killed off. Boyega adored Fisher. “Great woman. She represented to me what I needed to see at the time – somebody who was just unapologetically herself, somebody who does not fit into any category. She was quirky, smart and intelligent. If you got her jokes, you felt intelligent because there was always wordplay – you’d really laugh because you’re thinking, ‘I got that!’” And he gets the giggles just thinking about it. Last year Boyega showed off his range, appearing in the title role of Woyzeck, playing a squaddie driven to madness, in a radical reinterpretation of the 19th-century Georg Büchner drama at the Old Vic theatre. Again, he received positive reviews. Boyega says if he had to choose between stage and cinema, he would opt for the stage. But he is most proud of another film role from last year – in Detroit, he played Melvin Dismukes, a real private security guard who observed a racist killing by police officers in 1967 and was framed for the murder. Boyega plays Dismukes with a wonderful stillness. Why is the film so important to him? “Because it opened up another avenue of expression. When I was studying Melvin, I realised he was introvert. He didn’t express much, but on his face you can read the emotions he’s going through. It opened up another way of harbouring your acting skill, and the subtlety of the face is something I discovered I could do.” Boyega has loved his success. Not least the freedom money brings. Look, he says, it’s obvious he doesn’t spend a fortune on clothes – he’s dressed in an Asos hoodie, Adidas tracksuit bottoms, white trainers and his sister’s All Saints jacket (“I like it, but I can’t close it cos it’s too small for me”). I find out what he likes spending money on only when I ask whether his parents still live on the estate. “Hell, no,” he says. “It’s the first thing I used my cheque for: to rehouse them.” Until then they had always rented their flat. “I chose the house for them.” What if they had said, thanks, but we hate this place, son? That would never have happened, Boyega says. “When my dad preached, he would say he dreamed about material things, and he was scared about being too material at times: ‘But if anyone was to ask me as a human being, I’d love to drive a Jaguar and I’d love to have a house.’ He mentioned a particular area and said he’d love to have a house that was spacious, that had its own garden, that was private. White walls, wooden floors, spotlights, modern, clean and simple. So I got him exactly what he wanted. “I told him he had an interview about Star Wars in a really nice house. We planned the whole thing. We had cameras there. It was a fake interview, but he didn’t know. I gave him the questions in advance and told him they were things like, ‘What does it feel like to have the best son in the world?’” Boyega bursts out laughing. “Then as soon as he came in, I went, ‘Dad, there ain’t no interview. This is your house. I bought you a house.’ He cried. He was in shock. I told my mum about the house a week before because I didn’t want the shock to be too big. They were really happy. I’d dreamed of it ever since I started dreaming – to get my parents a suitable house. I cried as well.” And now I’m starting to well up. Did he get him the Jaguar, too? “Yeah, I did. The funny thing is, he won’t get rid of his old Range Rover.” As well as starring in the forthcoming sci-fi blockbuster Pacific Rim: Uprising, he is one of the film’s producers. He’s taking his responsibilities seriously, he says, putting in a full shift – unlike some actor-producers he could name. “I don’t like the whole system of being a notable actor, then you just get the green light to go and direct or produce something. I actually want to learn the craft.” His real ambition has always been to be a newspaper cartoonist. And he’d like kids – a few of them, please. I show him a story from a Nigerian website that says “Nigerian-British actor John Boyega looks like he’s found love with a quite pretty lady’’. He looks at the picture and shakes his head. “They always say that, man. Little do they know you’re in the friend zone. Heeheehee!” He has been in one long-term relationship, with a nurse, but he is drawing a blank at the moment. One woman he was seeing, he says, called it a day when she discovered he was in Star Wars. “A lot of women are like that. They don’t like it too loud. I’m very broke when it comes to love. If you put it in financial terms, money-wise I’m OK, career-wise I’m OK, spirit-wise getting there, love-wise, if it was money, I’d have like £320. No, £320.99.” He looks at his watch. He has to meet his boys. I ask if he still has the wariness he had when he was young. No, he says. “I can go around and no matter what area it is, I generally get a lot of love. I can be in central London and a banker can come up and just go, ‘Oh, I think you’re great.’ Or I can be in Brixton and a group of people partying will come up.” And yes, he isn’t a huge fan of selfies, and will often refuse them, but he loves a good chat. “I was stopping by Sainsbury’s the other day, craving Jelly Babies, and there were a couple of schoolkids by the escalators. One of the guys had a BMX that was just like mine when I was growing up. I go, ‘Let’s see you pop a wheelie’, so he’s popping wheelies and I just chilled with them for 30 minutes, just talking.” You may not always be nicey nice, I say, and you’re a reluctant role model, but it is obvious you are a role model of sorts. “Well, yeah,” he says. “I suppose you take inspiration where you can. As long as you don’t put an image of perfection on a person. People like to hope, man, which is cool, but add some wisdom to that. Know the person is a human being and that they can fail at times. Be inspired in the right way.” And with that he pops on his hoodie and his sister’s too-tight jacket, and heads off to hang with his boys. • Pacific Rim: Uprising is in cinemas nationwide from 23 March.

Inside was a freebie with purpose: a pair of yellow socks made from 85% upcycled yarn using no water, chemicals, dyes or pesticides. In a socially conscious climate in which more and more fashion brands are pledging their commitment to sustainability, such details matter. But McCartney has been exploring ethical fashion since she set up in 2001, when it seemed like an eccentricity – or even a nuisance – to many in the wider industry. Seventeen years later, McCartney’s winter show on Monday came at a crucial moment for her company, which is currently in talks with the French luxury conglomerate Kering – which owns 50% of the brand – about McCartney buying her share back. “That’s not confirmed, but the option is there,” she said backstage, with her representative confirming that the decision would be made by the end of the month. It is difficult to know whether the rumours flying around, including that McCartney’s father, Paul, may be helping to finance the deal, are an extension of the swipes she has long faced concerning her famous family, or represent wishful thinking on the industry’s part – or are a genuine signal that the former Beatle may soon make his arrival into the rarefied world of French fashion. (On that note, a company spokesperson told trade journal the Business of Fashion that Paul McCartney had never been involved in the business.) In any case, it was an appropriate time for what McCartney described as a mindful and considered exploration of “what we stand for in this industry”; a chance to reevaluate and modernise it and “take it to the highest level”. On the catwalk that theory was brought to life in a show that combined menswear and womenswear for the first time and focused on twisted tailoring. Suit jackets appeared to have been turned inside out so the silky lining was on display, and there were lingerie-inspired dresses in soft boudoir colours, along with the repeated use of paintings by JH Lynch, including his mysterious kohl-eyed Tina. The kitsch touch brought a welcome note of eccentricity or, as McCartney described it, of “something a little bit wrong”, to a covetable, luxe collection. Only by reading the show notes would you know that this was ethical fashion, employing fur-free fur, skin-free skin, faux leather and “loop” trainers that use special stitching instead of glue. Of the trend towards sustainability, McCartney said: “I hope that I am joined by more people, and I think it’s unavoidable that it will be part of the curriculum for consumption, because the next generation need a planet to live on and they deserve no less. “It’s doable. I’m here showing everyone you can actually do it and hopefully there is no compromise. That’s the mindset you need to get around. You can actually have it all.” Whatever she does with the business side of the brand, McCartney will remain ethical in her focus, she said, “until I am decomposing – like my invitation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/05/irans-foreign-minister-accuses-europe-of-appeasing-trump-us-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T16:59:33Z","webTitle":"Iran's foreign minister accuses Europe of appeasing Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/irans-foreign-minister-accuses-europe-of-appeasing-trump-us-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/05/irans-foreign-minister-accuses-europe-of-appeasing-trump-us-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"Iran's foreign minister accuses Europe of appeasing Trump","bodyText":"Iran’s foreign minister has accused Europe of appeasing Donald Trump as the French foreign minister travelled to Tehran in an effort to salvage the 2015 nuclear agreement. In an interview with an Iranian newspaper published before his meeting with Jean-Yves Le Drian on Monday, Mohammad Javad Zarif chastised European countries for bowing to pressure from Washington and said concerns about Iran’s missile programme or its role in the Middle East were hypocritical and dangerous. “In order to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal, European countries are resorting to extremism … [we] will not remain indifferent,” Zarif told the reformist Etemaad daily in a front-page interview printed under the headline “Europe will regret”. Trump refused last year to certify Iran’s compliance to the nuclear accord but he has so far stopped short of cancelling US participation in the deal, which promised to loosen sanctions in exchange for curbs to Tehran’s nuclear programme. In January he reluctantly waived a raft of sanctions against Iran as required by the US Congress every 120 days, but warned this was “a last chance” and asked “European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal”. Trump has vowed not to waive the sanctions again unless Europeans managed to make radical changes to the nuclear deal, including curbs on Iran’s missile development. The missile programme is not covered by the deal, and Tehran says it will not bow to pressure to halt it. “At present, two groups have violated the nuclear deal: the United States and Europe. The Americans because of Washington’s policy and the Europeans because of the US policy,” Zarif said. Although all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, Iran is not benefiting, mainly because top European banks, fearful of Washington, remain wary of doing business with the country. The banking issue is preventing Iran from capitalising on huge foreign investment interest shown in the past few years. The Iranian embassy in London has faced obstacles in opening a bank account in the UK and in a recent example of frustration despite the removal of sanctions, Munich airport companies refused to refuel Zarif’s aeroplane while he was attending a prominent security conference last month. On Monday the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Yukiya Amano, said Tehran was fulfilling its obligations and warned “it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism” if the framework of the nuclear deal were to collapse. Zarif’s interview appeared a day after Le Drian gave an interview to a French weekly in which he said Tehran risked “exposing itself to new sanctions” if it remained reluctant to discuss its missile programme. A group of hardliners gathered at Tehran airport to protest against his visit, and newspaper front pages in Iran criticised him. “French foreign minister insults people of Iran before visit to Tehran,” said a headline of the ultra-conservative Keyhan daily. The Javan newspaper carried the headline “Trump’s Parisian lackey in Tehran”. A poll conducted by IranPoll in collaboration with the University of Maryland, published last month, showed 92% of Iranian respondents believed the US was trying to preventing Iran from normalising its trade and economic relations, with 58% saying Iran should retaliate by restarting the aspects of its nuclear programme it agreed to suspend under the deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/10/annihilation-netflix-release-alex-garland-ex-machina","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"Was Annihilation too brainy for the box office?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/10/annihilation-netflix-release-alex-garland-ex-machina","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/10/annihilation-netflix-release-alex-garland-ex-machina","fields":{"headline":"Was Annihilation too brainy for the box office?","bodyText":"Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, one of the year’s best films will be readily, quietly available to pyjama-clad night owls at home – while over in the US, it is still screening to admittedly sparse crowds in multiplexes. Feverishly awaited by cinephiles and sci-fi geeks alike, Alex Garland’s Annihilation was not supposed to be a direct-to-Netflix release internationally. Tensely following an intrepid group of female scientists into an uncannily mutating stretch of wilderness from which almost no man comes out alive, it’s a larger-scale follow-up to Garland’s smart, stark, Oscar-winning directorial debut, Ex Machina, and should have doubled down on that film’s sleeper success in cinemas. Watching it at home, I missed the vast, dark expanse of a cinematic environment for its gasp-worthy effects and shuddering sound design – it may be intimately, brain-scramblingly idea-driven, but Garland has fashioned it first and foremost as big-screen spectacle. What happened, then? Annihilation’s surprise, do-not-pass-go swerve into the streaming realm portends an interesting, somewhat alarming future for grownup genre cinema: films that are too large and flashy for arthouses, but whose adult inclinations or deviance from formula make major distributors commercially nervous. Paramount, the studio behind Annihilation, started to get cold feet after test screenings for the film suggested mainstream audiences found Garland’s film overly chilly and intellectually complex – quite what manner of blockbuster they were expecting from him after Ex Machina, not exactly a candyfloss rollercoaster itself, one can only imagine. With Garland refusing to make suggested alterations to the final act – rightly so, since the whole film is contained in its wordless, haunting crescendo – and Paramount still licking its wounds from the box-office failure of its last adult auteur experiment, Darren Aronofsky’s outlandish Mother!, the studio settled on a cautious compromise: release it theatrically stateside but cut their losses by dumping it on Netflix abroad. Nice as it would have been had the American public then proven the studio drastically wrong, you can’t count on the American public for much these days: Annihilation took in a somewhat soft £8m on its opening weekend in February. Might audiences on Garland’s British home turf have been more supportive? Perhaps. We’ll never know. This would be a dispiriting turn of events for cinemagoers even with a less exciting film. That a Hollywood studio has effectively given the 2018 version of straight-to-video treatment to a £29m A-list sci-fi epic because a) it’s deemed too brainy, and b) its predominantly female ensemble, led by Natalie Portman, isn’t deemed bankable enough, says volumes about the fears and biases of an industry in thrall to safe, macho franchise formula. (Would swapping Portman for Chris Hemsworth have strengthened Paramount’s resolve?) For Netflix, however, it’s a gift after a couple of months that have seen the credibility of the Netflix Originals brand – a catch-all term that covers both the films it develops in-house and the ones it acquires from other production companies – take some hard knocks. After establishing itself as a distributor of quality documentaries and arthouse fare, this was supposed to be the year Netflix broke out into blockbuster genre territory. Yet after derisive receptions for a trio of fantasy duds in David Ayer’s Bright, Duncan Jones’s Mute and the surprise-release The Cloverfield Paradox, Netflix’s creative instincts have been called into question. With the streaming giant still set to premiere more than 60 new films this year, Annihilation – even if it’s not strictly its own – may restore some lustre to the term “Netflix movie”. But it’s something of a sacrificial lamb, sounding a bleak warning for other directors with cinematic visions that don’t fit the Marvel-era mould. If you’ve got big ideas, you might need to accept a smaller screen for them. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week The Florida Project (Altitude, 15) Unjustly sidelined in the recent awards season, Sean Baker’s spirited child’s-eye vision of poverty on Orlando’s social fringes remains a small miracle of hard truths and candy hues. Paddington 2 (Studiocanal, PG) Its predecessor ingeniously fused childhood nostalgia with progressive social politics; this ebullient sequel somehow makes lightning strike twice, with added Hugh Grant japery. Only the Brave (Lionsgate, 12A) The generically inspirational title doesn’t do justice to this surprisingly involving, humane true-life firefighter drama, which balances thrilling pyrotechnics with fine-cut character detail. The Little Hours (Universal, 15) A farcical revisionist twist on The Decameron, with Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza, is a pitch that’ll draw a highly specific audience who won’t feel let down by the funny but scatty results."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/10/hero-of-entebbe-deserves-own-film","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"There’s one hero of Entebbe who deserves his own film.

I remember him well","bodyText":"The forthcoming film Entebbe, starring Daniel Brühl and Rosamund Pike, will introduce a new generation to the story of how an Air France flight in 1976 from Tel Aviv was hijacked by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the German Revolutionary Cells. There is one central figure who isn’t in the film, but should be. Michel Cojot-Goldberg was one of my father’s oldest friends, and he was on that flight with his then 12-year-old son, Olivier. Fluent in multiple languages, Michel acted as the translator for Uganda’s president Idi Amin, as the go-between for the hijackers and the passengers, and became a central figure in the eventual rescue. But I can understand why the film-makers left him out, because Michel’s story is so incredible it requires its own movie. Born Michel Goldberg in Paris, he managed to escape with his parents to France’s unoccupied zone during the war. One day his father had to go to Lyon and wanted to bring his beloved five-year-old son with him. But there was snow on the ground and Michel’s mother worried about him catching a cold, so he stayed home with her. This snow saved Michel’s life, because it was on that trip that his father was captured and deported. He managed to escape from the train but was recaptured within a few days and sent to Auschwitz, where he was killed. Michel’s mother remarried after the war and she swiftly changed her son’s distinctly Jewish surname to the more neutral one of his stepfather, Cojot, to protect him from any future holocausts. Michel grew up and was, by all outward appearances, successful and content: by the 1960s he was working in a high-powered job in Paris, which is when my father met him, and he got married and had three children, Olivier, Stephane and Yael. But inside, Michel was crushed with guilt about not having been with his father the day he was arrested. He became consumed with the idea that the way to avenge his father’s murder was to kill the man responsible for his arrest: Klaus Barbie, who was the head of the local Gestapo in Lyon and directly responsible for the deaths of 14,000 people. Michel knew Barbie was hiding in Bolivia, and so in 1975 he went there, stopping off on the way in Mexico to buy a gun. He tracked Barbie down, posing as a journalist, and carefully learned his daily routine, what time he went to which cafe, who he hung out with. One day he followed him and pointed the gun at Barbie’s back. It was the perfect moment to shoot him – but his hand dropped. He couldn’t do it. He had, in his eyes, failed his father again. Michel flew back to France and had a nervous collapse. His marriage ended and he was deeply depressed. The following year, he took his oldest son, Olivier, to Tel Aviv and on 27 June they headed back to Paris, on Air France flight 139. The plane that was hijacked. Once the plane was diverted to Uganda, and the hostages moved to a disused airport building, Michel cannily developed what could almost be described as a relationship with Wilfried Böse, the main hijacker. Over many hours, they debated politics, and Michel helped to persuade the terrorists to release the first group of hostages, including his son. Michel himself was released a few days later with the second group, and when he got back to Paris he told agents from the Mossad everything he had carefully committed to memory: the layout of the terrorists’ compound, what their daily habits were, where the remaining hostages slept. In his critically acclaimed 2015 book about the Entebbe rescue, Operation Thunderbolt, historian Saul David details precisely how invaluable Michel’s information was to the rescue mission. Had it not been for Michel, the IDF’s then chief of staff, Motta Gur, said, “many more hostages and soldiers would have died”. Michel had not been able to avenge the Jews killed by Barbie, but he was able to save almost all the hostages in the plane. And while he hadn’t been able to save his father, he had saved his son. Michel then wrote an account of his failed assassination of Barbie in Le Point magazine and testified at Barbie’s eventual trial in 1987 in Lyon, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Barbie died in jail four years later. The circle was closed. Michel’s health improved after Entebbe, but even then he had a sadness about him. I remember thinking as a child that when his mouth smiled his eyes looked like he was about to cry. At the time, in my childish way, I put that down to his divorce, being too young to understand words such as “hijack” and “Holocaust”. Michel died in 1999, which is when I read his autobiography, Namesake (full disclosure: he thanks my father, Ron Freeman, in it). But it wasn’t until I saw Boaz Dvir’s very moving forthcoming documentary about him, Cojot, that I truly understood Michel’s life, and perhaps the message of it: Hollywood action movies are all very well, but true heroes walk among us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/michele-hanson-mischief-wisdom-guardian-columnist","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T15:54:46Z","webTitle":"Teenagers, ageing and tortoise sex – Michele Hanson was so full of mischief and wisdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/michele-hanson-mischief-wisdom-guardian-columnist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/05/michele-hanson-mischief-wisdom-guardian-columnist","fields":{"headline":"Teenagers, ageing and tortoise sex – Michele Hanson was so full of mischief and wisdom","bodyText":"I thought Michele would be around for ever. Being totally herself: grumpy, hilarious, blindsiding us with kindness and always with a surprise up her sleeve. Only a week ago, she had been arguing for pole dancers to perform in care homes if that is what people want. “We have our own minds and we like to make them up.” She knew her own mind, and she knew what getting old meant, having looked after her elderly mother for many years. She talked about ageing, but she seemed ageless. I knew Michele mostly through her work but when I did see her she would inevitably have a tale of such magnificent “inappropriateness” it would be hysterical. A moment with a vet, a sick dog lying between them; a loud sweary dispute with Rosemary in the post office queue over biscuits/vegetarians/ex-husbands. The woman was funny in her bones. She observed every detail and, thus, could write of intimate things, of embarrassments, of pain and loveliness, and turn it all on a sixpence. God I will miss this – the splattering of genius in the mix; her sublime sense of the absurd. Although she was hilarious enough that a single line could crack you up for days – “Our own lone tortoise only has rather morose, noiseless sex with a small towel on the kitchen floor” – she was also, to me, a deeply serious writer. When she wrote about what it is like to be a single parent caring for a teenager (in the Treasure column), or about looking after an old person, or setting herself free at 62, she packed a punch. As she got older, the writing became more direct, razor-sharp and angry. This was not a lecture about socialism but on decency. If bonobos and children can learn to share, why not overpaid vice-chancellors, she asked recently. When she wrote about the flaws in the education system, you felt her experience as a teacher. She had a real life. There was nothing fake. The readers knew that. When she told us that life was hard and unfair for so many, we cared because she did. She wanted to change things. Michele could make you laugh precisely because she was unafraid to go to the places where it hurts: to death, to pain, to indignity. She loved a bodily function, and she could lacerate any taboo. She was a writer of fantastic economy, saying a lot with few words. It is no surprise to me that she could play several instruments: there is a musicality in the best comic writing, and she had it. There was nowhere Michele would not go: constipation, tortoise sex, how capitalism really works, how we might live the last part of our lives. How we could all live better. She was a clever woman. Always curious. So very alive, so full of mischief and wisdom and politics and stories. She was just bloody wonderful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27457","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T00:00:08Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,457","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27457","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27457","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,457","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27454","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T00:00:02Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,454","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27454","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27454","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,454","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/05/neil-basu-met-police-appoints-new-counter-terrorism-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T12:44:09Z","webTitle":"Met police appoint new counter-terrorism chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/neil-basu-met-police-appoints-new-counter-terrorism-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/neil-basu-met-police-appoints-new-counter-terrorism-chief","fields":{"headline":"Met police appoint new counter-terrorism chief","bodyText":"Scotland Yard has appointed a new counter-terrorism chief, viewed by many as the toughest job in British policing. Neil Basu, a Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, is to succeed Mark Rowley, who retires this month, as assistant commissioner responsible for leading counter-terrorism policing nationally. Basu is a former Met commander overseeing organised crime and gangs. He has specialised in counter-terrorism policing for the past three years and was in effect Rowley’s deputy. In the last year of Rowley’s tenure as head of counter-terrorism there were five terrorist attacks including atrocities at Westminster Bridge, London Bridge and Borough Market, Finsbury Park mosque, Parsons Green station and Manchester Arena. Basu said: “It is a privilege to be asked to join the management board of the Met and to lead for CT policing at such a point in our history. It is both a challenge and a duty that I accept with humility and a sense of great purpose.” He took up his current role as senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism in October 2016, in which he was responsible for delivering the police response to pursuing terrorists and the Prevent strategy. He has worked as a detective in all ranks to detective superintendent in a range of areas including anti-corruption and homicide for the anti-gangs unit Trident. He has also held the posts of area commander for south-east London and head of armed policing within the Met. He will take over as assistant commissioner for specialist operations on 21 March. Basu has been groomed for the top of the Met for years, serving as staff officer to the former commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson. He was the favourite for the top job in counter-terrorism and is well regarded by others in policing as well as by MI5, the domestic security service, which works closely with the police to thwart attacks. During the wave of terrorist attacks in Britain last year he would have been seen up close and under pressure by senior security officials as well as the home secretary and prime minister. Despite holding senior ranks he has not seen that as a bar to being outspoken on controversial issues. He criticised plans to stop armed officers conferring and more recently said government funding cuts jeopardised national security and called for reforms to Prevent, the official anti-radicalisation programme. Basu is the first officer of Asian heritage to be appointed to the role. The Met has come under fire for its lack of diversity across ranks so Basu’s appointment to a key senior role will be seen by some as a positive step. Commenting on the appointment, the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, said: “He is a leader of courage, compassion and integrity and I know he will do a great job.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said Basu’s promotion was well deserved and he had his utmost support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2018/mar/08/reclaiming-the-streets-the-apps-helping-women-tackle-sexual-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T09:08:41Z","webTitle":"Reclaiming the streets: the apps helping women tackle sexual violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/mar/08/reclaiming-the-streets-the-apps-helping-women-tackle-sexual-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2018/mar/08/reclaiming-the-streets-the-apps-helping-women-tackle-sexual-violence","fields":{"headline":"Reclaiming the streets: the apps helping women tackle sexual violence","bodyText":"When Safecity started mapping sexual violence in public spaces in India six years ago, it found public toilets in the Sanjay camp slum of Delhi were hotspots for attacks. “We wondered why,” says Elsa D’Silva, Safecity’s founder. “Then we realised the toilet doors were missing.” When women went to the toilets – the only option for many people in the area – local boys would hang around nearby, take video clips of them on their phones and shout comments. So the women were drinking less water and only using the toilets late at night, risking an attack in the darkness. Armed with data from the Safecity app, which was set up after 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh Pandey was beaten, gang raped and tortured on a bus in Delhi in 2012, local residents and students pressured the police into fixing the toilets. But they didn’t stop there; they also sat with local boys and showed them the harm they were causing. What happened next? The community, including many of the boys, came together to pressure the authorities to take women’s safety seriously. And it worked; the toilets were given doors, and fewer assaults have been recorded. Safecity now operates in five cities in India – Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Patna and Ahmedabad – and continues to digitally map incidents of sexual assault based on anonymous reports to the app by victims. D’Silva is not alone in her mission to transform public spaces into welcoming places for women. Around the world, women are creating databases, blogs and heatmaps to document street harassment. HarassMap, set up in 2010, is successfully mapping street harassment in Egypt. Women anonymously report incidents by texting a hotline, using social media or via the site. The reports are categorised by types of harassment and visualised on an online map. “We wanted evidence that this is happening to women of all ages,” says Alia Soliman, the site’s communications manager. The map has succeeded in influencing attitudes; since its launch, sexual harassment has been made illegal in Egypt for the first time. “People’s beliefs have changed,” says Esraa Honsy, who volunteers for HarassMap and set up her own blog to tackle gender-based violence in Egypt. “Now they know sexual harassment is a crime and that it’s the fault of the harasser not the person being harassed,” she says. The map is taking off around the world and activists in more than 80 countries, including Greece, Jordan, Turkey, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, are setting up their own versions. Anna Liakopoulou and Georgia Papantoni set up Sex Harass Map in Athens using Google Maps in 2016. They hope it will change sexist attitudes and Greek laws; a report by Equality Now found Greece was failing women with its laws on sexual violence. “Violence against women is considered to be typical, but a woman’s reaction is out of the ordinary,” Liakopoulou says. This means women who act in self-defence can get disproportionately harsh sentences, she says. “So we are keeping track of street harassment and of court verdicts.” Liakopoulou hopes the data will “shed a light on the magnitude of violence against women in Greece”. But women aren’t just recording attacks – they’re also documenting their own presence on the streets. Sadia Khatri set up Girls at Dhabas in Pakistan in 2015 to “shift our imagination of how women should exist and behave in public spaces”. The blog collates photographs of women in places normally dominated by men, such as sitting at dhabas (roadside tea shops). They’ve had more than 1,000 submissions through the site and social media so far. “Creating this alternative narrative is a step towards the normalisation of our presence on the street,” the group says. Technology has enabled women to learn from one another’s successes and to share information online. “It has made change easier and faster,” says Honsy. “Plus it provides global solutions, so we benefit from other people’s successful experiences.” As demonstrated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, where women share experiences of sexual harassment on social media, reporting personal stories can raise awareness. It can also change the way you think about the incident. Hollaback, founded in New York in 2005, has collected around 11,000 global stories of street harassment. Emily May, Hollaback’s founder, says the process of reporting can help people see it as a societal rather than personal problem. “That framework shift then has the capacity to move people into action,” she says. May says one success of such sites has been to normalise the term ”street harassment”. “When we started Hollaback in 2005 we had never heard the term,” she says. But now it is widely used. “That’s important because when you just call something ‘catcalling’, it’s language that diminishes the deep and significant mental health and community aspects that harassment has.” Recording and mapping data also gives activists something tangible to work with. “You can monitor it, draw trends, and use it in a structured way at a local level,” says D’Silva. “And when people take ownership of their own neighbourhood they feel empowered to take on bigger problems.” It also plugs gaps in official records. “Our map can be a helpful tool for research, because most of the incidents haven’t got to court or been published,” says Liakopoulou. International Women’s Day is a call to action. This year, we’re being urged to #PressForProgress on gender parity and to join a “strong and growing global movement of advocacy and activism”. The app founders say they will continue to “push for progress” on and after IWD. “I want reporting of sexual violence to be mainstream,” says D’Silva. “There’s still a taboo around it.” But Honsy is confident change will come. “I’m really looking forward to a world that doesn’t tolerate gender-based violence,” she says.

It’s a fine line, but he is more successful than most of his western journalistic competitors in exploring the often contradictory attitudes that Russians hold towards their president and the hybrid system he is building on the basis of Russian nationalism, Soviet nostalgia and a striving for international respect. Walker reports several illuminating interviews with people who hold “an often intangible longing for a past, if not the actual Soviet past, then at least for the sense of meaning that went with it”. There’s a strange but revealing encounter with Ivan Panikarov, a retired power station worker in Kolyma in Siberia, who has created a Gulag museum in his own flat. Amid the evidence of horror that he has spent years collecting, he shocks Walker with the claim that the western view of the Gulag is one-sided: “People fell in love in the camps, people got pregnant, it wasn’t all bad.” At a higher level Russian politicians and historians have largely failed to make a proper analysis of Stalin’s crimes, Walker writes. They acknowledge the terror but not the guilt, refusing to see that almost everyone who lived through the Stalin period was partially both a victim and a perpetrator. But Walker argues that the west is wrong to contrast Russia’s failure to come to terms with the grimmest aspects of its history with Germany’s success in doing so. A better comparison is Spain where, after Franco’s death, all sides agreed not to inquire into past crimes. More than half the book deals with the war in Ukraine, where Walker spent many weeks over the past four years. He does not go into detail on the more controversial episodes, such as the downing of a Malaysian airliner or the issue of who started the shooting that led to the toppling of the Ukrainian government. He gives a good account of the unsavoury views of many Ukrainian nationalists and the rehabilitation of wartime leaders involved in anti-Jewish and anti-Polish atrocities, but seems more interested in the attitudes of anti-Kiev, pro-Russia separatists. Walker points to their class component, which he likens to pro-Brexit attitudes in the UK and the new populism in the US and EU. In eastern Ukraine, people who had done well out of the post-Soviet economic chaos opposed links with Russia: those who had lost jobs and status supported pro-Russian separatism. Walker makes friends with Alexander Khodakovsky, an unusually reflective officer in Ukraine’s special forces who joins the rebel side and becomes its No 2, but hates the corruption of many of his colleagues. Khodakovsky misses the warm social relations of the Soviet past, yet hates the Kremlin’s way of exploiting history in its struggle with Kiev. Walker’s book promotes a variant of this accusation: Putin is cynically using pride in the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war as a vehicle for creating a post-communist national identity. There are two weak points in this argument. The victory narrative is not new. It was used extensively during the Stalin and Brezhnev periods, with annual military parades as a reminder of past glory and regular school visits by veterans to inspire the next generation. Nor are morale-boosting and public anger in the face of post-imperial decline confined to Russia. Coming of age in Britain in the 1960s, I remember the constant spate of war films, the unruly demonstrations by Empire Loyalists protesting at decolonisation, the We Won the War envy over Germany’s economic recovery, all coupled with resentment at the US for hastening Britain’s loss of global status and inheriting its benefits. Russians resented the way the US treated their country in the 1990s. Putin’s anger over triumphant American boasting that we had moved to a world with only one power centre was shared in many countries. Unipolarity and “end of history” smugness led Washington to the relentless expansion of Nato and the invasion of Iraq. Walker ignores the Nato issue, which upsets almost all Russians, including much of the liberal intelligentsia. They applaud Putin’s resistance however critical they are of his authoritarianism. The liberals reluctantly accepted the Baltic states’ adhesion to Nato but the flashpoint was Washington’s campaign to bring in Ukraine. Even though most polls until the crisis of 2014 showed Ukrainians preferred non-alignment, Nato would not accept that. It constantly wooed the Ukrainian military and political elite while the US Republican and Democratic parties had offices in Kiev pumping out pro-Nato propaganda. The EU, led by traditionally anti-Russian Poland, pushed the economic case for Ukraine to “make the Euro-Atlantic choice”, arguing that could not look east as well as west. These were strategies that were doomed, if not intended, to split the country and to lead to the war that Walker describes so graphically from the frontline. .• The Long Hangover is published by Oxford.

Austria and Switzerland, too, have vocational training programmes that allow them to punch above their industrial weight. So what can the UK learn? One big difference between Germany and the UK lies in the perceived role of an apprenticeship, says Ulrich Hoppe, director general of the London-based German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce. In Germany, apprenticeships are seen more as a rite of passage – part of a young person’s education. Employers see themselves as educators and think long-term. They are expected to provide a high standard of training for their apprentices who, in many ways, are treated more like students than young workers. Employers work very closely with local government, unions, schools and chambers of commerce (which coordinate the apprenticeships in their area). Apprentices’ wages are typically pretty low – starting at between €450 and €800 (£400-£700) a month – which means smaller companies can afford to take on apprentices and get good value from the arrangement. In return, employers respect their apprentices and go the extra mile to ensure they pass their final exams and gain a proper job. At international transportation company Logwin in Bremerhaven, for instance, training manager Biagio Aprile says the firm takes on two apprentices a year (10% of the workforce) who will then spend two mornings a week at vocational college (in Austria, where the company also operates, this can be one three-month block of study instead). Logwin, at its own expense, puts on extra training sessions to help answer any queries before the apprentices take their exams. “As a small company, we cannot guarantee to take our apprentices on after qualifying – it depends on our needs – but we help them find work elsewhere,” says Aprile. And if no other Logwin branch has a vacancy, he will recommend them to rival companies. This is accepted by apprentices themselves. “The branch I work in is not big, so I can’t imagine they would take on all their apprentices,” says Elisa Mehrtens, 22, a forwarding agent apprentice at Logwin. In the UK, Hoppe finds young people view apprenticeships more as salaried jobs with training – and may move on in the jobs market if an employer does not deliver. There is peer pressure regarding pay, while higher salaries mean fewer companies can offer apprenticeships – so there is less choice in training. However, other continental ideas could be more easily adopted. In Austria, where membership of the local chamber of commerce is mandatory for all employers, a visit to one of several special careers advice centres across the country is obligatory for pupils aged 14. These centres offer aptitude tests, information and advice, and run through all the career options. A student’s home region will often determine the path a school-leaver takes towards work. According to Thomas Mahr, director of IBW, a national research body focusing on education and the economy, half the brightest students living in Austria’s western regions, which are heavily influenced by the handcraft and tourism industries, do apprenticeships; university is more popular in urban areas. Retention rates are sky high in a country where about 40% of 16-year-olds choose apprenticeships, says Mahr. “We know 94% of all apprenticeship graduates are being employed at the level of skilled labour or above.” As in Germany, apprenticeships are accepted by parents as a recognised alternative to university. In fact, Maurice Taylor, 19, an apprentice joiner with high-end furniture-maker Interior-ID in Riegersberg, says he wants to finish his apprenticeship (while studying part-time for his final school exams), tack on a one-year master’s-level apprenticeship and then study interior design at university. The fact that Taylor wants to go to university does not worry company co-owner Bernd Radaschitz, who accepts that this goes with the territory. “Ideally we’d like to take on our apprentices after they finish,” he says, “but half of them move on to a different firm, while a quarter will follow a related career in, say, architecture or design.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/05/arsenal-confidence-laurent-koscielny-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T12:37:01Z","webTitle":"Arsenal's confidence is shattered, admits Laurent Koscielny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/05/arsenal-confidence-laurent-koscielny-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/05/arsenal-confidence-laurent-koscielny-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal's confidence is shattered, admits Laurent Koscielny","bodyText":"Laurent Koscielny has laid bare the crisis of confidence at Arsenal and admitted the players’ self-belief will not return swiftly after Brighton inflicted the team’s fourth defeat in the space of 11 days. “We know we are in a bad situation, a bad period,” Arsenal’s captain said. “We tried but nothing is with us. We tried to fight and play football but you could see the confidence is very down. We miss a lot of things during the game but we need to push more again and again. The confidence will be back slowly. We know we need to win to have a little bit more confidence in us. We lost a little bit of our quality but we need to stay united.” Arsène Wenger has accepted that a top-four finish is out of the equation, which means Arsenal need to win the Europa League to return to the Champions League. They play the first leg of their last-16 tie against Milan in Italy on Thursday. “It is very hard because when you play for a big club like Arsenal you need to be in the top four,” said Koscielny, who was moved to tears at a team meeting called last week to address the slump. The defender said the defeat at Brighton capped the worst week of his career, coming as it did after Manchester City beat Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final and Premier League. “I think it has been difficult for everyone, maybe the first time for all of them,” Koscielny said. He did not hide from the impact. “We are not confident in our quality individually and collectively,” he said. Wenger has been the target for much of the fans’ anger, which surfaced again in chants for the manager’s sacking on Sunday, but Koscielny said blame was shared. “The players have the responsibility on the pitch, the boss has responsibilities too and we have to be together,” he said. “It is difficult to say if it is his fault or our fault. The club are together and we need to stay together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/06/gulf-states-plans-end-saudi-arabia-qatar-boycott","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Gulf states considering plans to bring end to Saudi-led Qatar boycott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/gulf-states-plans-end-saudi-arabia-qatar-boycott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/06/gulf-states-plans-end-saudi-arabia-qatar-boycott","fields":{"headline":"Gulf states considering plans to bring end to Saudi-led Qatar boycott","bodyText":"Gulf states are studying plans to break the deadlock over the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar by persuading the two sides to agree to relax restrictions on civilian movements as the first step to a wider deal. The dispute with Qatar is likely to be one of the major topics for discussion between the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and the UK prime minister, Theresa May, when the two leaders meet in London on Wednesday. Britain has urged Saudi Arabia to lift the blockade, which has damaged economies across the Gulf but has not brought Qatar to its knees nor led to a change in regime. In what would be seen as a mutual goodwill gesture designed to lead to the end of the nine-month boycott of the country by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, the two sides would allow citizens of each others’ countries to travel freely. Such a move would require Qatar’s neighbours to end the air blockade that has prevented Qatari flights from landing in their territory and from using their airspace. As many as 10,000 Gulf citizens, most with relations in neighbouring states, have been affected by the land, sea and air restrictions. Saudi and UAE leaders have urged the west not to regard the boycott as a family feud between Gulf states but as a serious move against Qatar’s alleged championing of extremist political movements in the Middle East, including Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said it did not want the dispute settled by anyone but the Gulf states, and that the pressure of the boycott was forcing Qatar to change its approach to funding terrorism. Qatar has categorically denied the charges and accused the Saudi-led alliance of attempting to curtail its sovereignty. Qatar and the boycotting states have been locked in an expensive competition for influence in the west, spending billions on arms purchases, PR and state visits in an effort to win favour. Qatar insists that by reacting to the boycott in a measured way, it has shown it can be a reliable diplomatic and military partner for the west. The US wants the dispute ended partly because it fears it could drive the extraordinarily wealthy Qatar closer to Iran. The US would prefer a united Gulf willing to challenge Iran over its nuclear ambitions and foreign policy. It has its largest regional military base in Qatar and the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has steered the administration away from its initial stance supporting the Saudi boycott. Donald Trump will have a chance to test Saudi flexibility when the crown prince meets the US president in Washington after his UK visit on Wednesday and Thursday this week. In an attempt to convince the west that Qatar has a coherent alternative vision for a cooperative and stable Middle East that rivals the adventurism of the crown prince, the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has set out plans for a Middle East security pact incorporating not just Gulf states, but also other states in the region. The plan is intended to counter what Qatar describes as the unilateral adventurist foreign policy of Saudi Arabia. The emir’s’s communications chief Sheikh Saif bin Ahmed al-Thani told the Guardian that the pact “would be a way of ensuring that what happened to Qatar does not happen anywhere else”; it would represent”a baseline of co-existence, backed by binding arbitration mechanisms, and enforced by the collective body of the region”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/05/airbus-may-leave-uk-unless-there-is-urgent-clarity-on-brexit-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T17:22:53Z","webTitle":"Airbus may leave UK unless there is urgent clarity on Brexit trade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/05/airbus-may-leave-uk-unless-there-is-urgent-clarity-on-brexit-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/05/airbus-may-leave-uk-unless-there-is-urgent-clarity-on-brexit-trade","fields":{"headline":"Airbus may leave UK unless there is urgent clarity on Brexit trade","bodyText":"Airbus has warned it would have to consider its position in the UK without imminent clarity over customs rules after Brexit. The European aerospace manufacturer said it would soon have to decide whether to start stockpiling parts to avoid border delays, adding costs that could make its British operations uncompetitive. Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president for Airbus in the UK, said that despite some welcome assurances from government over Brexit, the firm feared that customs and paperwork would delay its manufacturing process. Airbus employs about 15,000 people in the UK and moves parts between other EU countries and wing-making operations at Broughton in north Wales and Filton, near Bristol. Bennett said: “It’s critical for our business to ensure that the wings that we build in Broughton and in Filton can get to France and Germany for the final assembly line.” Bennett said that Airbus spends about £5bn each year on the UK supply chain. “It’s really important that the parts don’t get held up in warehouses. We have a very just-in-time delivery system.” She told the BBC Today programme that a three-hour wait on a lorry at Dover “would be a critically bad issue for Airbus”, as would be delaying cargo flights carrying completed wings to Europe. While she welcomed the announcement in Theresa May’s Mansion House speech that Britain intended to remain a member of EASA, the air safety certification agency, Bennett warned that customs remained “pretty critical for us” and said that Airbus very soon “will have to press a button on a decision on stockpiling parts”. She added: “It would be very expensive for us and a burden we don’t want to be suffering. Our key preference is for the UK to remain a home nation for Airbus. But we really need the conditions for us to be effective. We don’t want extra costs on our UK business which may make Airbus think differently about us.” Meanwhile, Airbus management is to meet unions on Wednesday to discuss potential job losses as it slows the rate of production on two of its flagship aircraft, the A380 superjumbo and the troubled A400M military transporter. A deal on the A380 with Emirates airline guaranteed production until the mid-2020s, but Airbus will reduce its output from 12 planes per year to just eight in 2019 and six in 2020. In a statement, Airbus said leaks to the media over the slowdowns had “resulted in excessive reporting about alleged job cuts in its four home countries”. According to one report in the French business press, up to 3,600 jobs could be affected. An Airbus spokesman said that an increased rate of production on the A320 and A350 models should mean no jobs would be lost in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/05/britain-ukraine-far-right-neo-nazis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T16:28:52Z","webTitle":"From Britain to Ukraine, the far right is thriving on shared emotion | Natalia Antonova","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/britain-ukraine-far-right-neo-nazis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/britain-ukraine-far-right-neo-nazis","fields":{"headline":"From Britain to Ukraine, the far right is thriving on shared emotion","bodyText":"While reports of Britons being recruited by Ukrainian neo-Nazis to fight in a war against Russia appear to be somewhat exaggerated – two men hardly constitutes some sort of far-right stampede to the eastern edge of Europe – this is a good time to remember that hate is on the upswing, and to think of it as a localised phenomenon is to miss the bigger picture. Consider the war that Russia is waging. After years of bloodshed, Ukraine fatigue has firmly settled in across much of the western media. Yet if we were paying closer attention to the conflict between Kiev and Moscow, we would notice an interesting element to the conflict – that the far right is involved on both sides, and that the values of these two groups pitted against each other are similar in many respects. Members of the Ukrainian and the Russian far right are willing to riddle each other with very many bullet holes over such issues as the legacy of the second world war, and who the real heroes were. Ask them about abortion, however, or feminism, or migration, or antisemitism, or LGBT rights, or human rights in general, or, for that matter, government transparency and accountability, and suddenly these mortal enemies will seem more like good buddies who had a little tiff over history and national identity but will happily join forces to oppress whoever gets in their way, should the current conflict come to an end. As the editors of the anarchist publication Nihilist.li have argued, “the differences between the Kremlin and Ukrainian fascists are tactical – not strategic … Both Russian and Ukrainian far-right groups have the same values and the same political ideal – crony capitalism.” The greater lesson here is this: the resurgent far-right ideology tends to transcend borders as surely as the practical concerns of far-right groups – and their high-placed supporters – do. This is where the real threat lies, particularly as memories of the second world war begin to erode (it no longer has such an emotional pull on younger generations). More than anything, a holistic approach to far-right hatred in Europe – and, for that matter, the United States – is needed. Ukraine’s problems with the far right are Britain’s problems, are Bulgaria’s problems, are Austria’s problems, and even, ultimately, Russia’s problems. (No matter how much Putin coddles and coopts the far right abroad, the truth is, he is never going to be extreme enough for his own extremists.) In looking for solutions, we should consider the predicament the US now finds itself in – with a blatantly racist president who will reward any far-right group for as long as it sings his praises. Much has been made of Donald Trump’s supporters’ desire to support this president at any cost. Reporters from elite publications are regularly parachuted into towns and districts that represent Trump’s “base” in order to file bewildered, slightly apocalyptic reports on how there are millions of Americans out there who do not care that the man they elected thinks there are “both sides” to a conflict involving murderous far-right violence. Even as we continue to combat fake news, it has become glaringly obvious that facts alone won’t reach these racists and cheerleaders for racism – because support for Trump comes from a place that’s wholly different to the place where we compile and analyse facts. As George Lakoff has argued, conservatives’ hierarchical moral worldview influences support to a great degree – this translates into support for the virulent racism of the current administration. Far-right advances across nations embolden the far right in other nations. This trend is likely to continue – and this is why a couple of Britons travelling to Ukraine to fight alongside neo-Nazis is something to take notice of. The causes of our current predicament can be debated – certainly a great number of economic and social factors are at play – but what matters is the simple realisation that what binds members of far-right groups can be exploited for good. Shared humanity, the idea of belonging to a common cause – these are the tools we have at our disposal if we wish to adequately address the rising tide of hate. Tracking hate, analysing it, understanding the damage it can and does inflict on communities is important – but it will not be enough in the days to come. Active resistance will be needed, and a crucial component of resistance is teaching people to connect with one another in meaningful ways, to establish horizontal ties that engage them not just intellectually and ideologically, but also emotionally. To bring this back to Lakoff, what matters right now is not so much what far-right hate groups think, but what their members feel and believe. If we lose sight of that, the far-right threat will only grow and metastasise. As human beings, we have been at this crossroads before. The question is whether or not we’re willing to try something different this time around. • Natalia Antonova is a Ukrainian-American journalist and playwright based in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/08/spanish-women-give-up-work-for-a-day-in-first-feminist-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T15:56:21Z","webTitle":"More than 5m join Spain's 'feminist strike', unions say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/spanish-women-give-up-work-for-a-day-in-first-feminist-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/08/spanish-women-give-up-work-for-a-day-in-first-feminist-strike","fields":{"headline":"More than 5m join Spain's 'feminist strike', unions say","bodyText":"More than 5 million workers have taken part in Spain’s first nationwide “feminist strike”, according to trade unions. The action, held to mark International Women’s Day, is intended to highlight sexual discrimination, domestic violence and the wage gap. On Thursday afternoon, the Workers’ Commissions and the Workers’ General Union said that 5.3 million people had participated in two-hour walkouts, describing the action as “an unprecedented strike in our country’s trade union movement”. The strike, which is being supported by some of Spain’s best-known female politicians – including Madrid’s mayor, Manuela Carmena, and the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau – has drawn huge crowds on to streets and squares across the country to call for change and equality. Coordinated by an umbrella group, the 8 March Commission, the strike called for an end to Spain’s enduring machista culture. Under the slogan “If we stop, the world stops”, protesters congregated in cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville and Pamplona. The messages scrawled on placards read: “They took so much away from us that they ended up taking away our fear”; “No woman has an orgasm polishing the kitchen floor”; and “Women’s rights = human rights”. Demonstrators in Catalonia blocked a railway line and disrupted traffic in central Barcelona. Elsewhere, students and protesters picketed universities and many female journalists chose not to set foot in newsrooms or studios. A video posted by the newspaper El País showed rows of empty desks, their monitors plastered with signs in support of the strike. Spain’s health, social services and equality minister, Dolors Montserrat, described Thursday’s action as “a social revolution for men and women”, but stressed that it was not “a war between the sexes”. Montserrat told the Espejo Público programme that while she was pleased to see so many women exercising their right to protest, it was up to individual women “to decide how they want to strike” or whether they wished to go to work as normal. Four secondary school students taking part in a demonstration in Barcelona said they had felt compelled to disregard instructions to stay in their classrooms. “It wouldn’t have been right to stay in school,” Roser, Claudia, Judith and Marta told the online paper eldiario.es. They said sexism was also rife at school. “They say sexist things as jokes – especially when it comes to domestic work – even though we say that you shouldn’t say things like that even as a joke,” one of the students said. “Yesterday, some boys said they’d come down to the protest with us, but look: it’s just us four.” Ana Reyes, a 37-year-old PR executive, said she had decided to join the strike in Madrid “in the hope that the importance of half of the population will be recognised and that it will bring about a real change”. She told AFP the action gave “visibility to the malaise and discrimination we women suffer”. Carmena, the Madrid mayor, joined a protest outside her office on Thursday morning. “The aim has been achieved,” she tweeted. “This isn’t only about calling for true equality, but also about facing the need to change how the world treats women. It’s about feminism.” Colau, who has been mayor of Barcelona since 2015, said she was joining the strike “to show that without women the world really does stop”. She said: “As people in public positions, we have the duty to mobilise on behalf of those who can’t go on strike. This is the century of women and of feminism; we’ve raised our voices and we won’t stop. No more violence, discrimination or pay gap.” Last year in Spain 49 women were killed by their partners or ex-partners, compared with 44 in 2016. Government statistics a show reports of violent abuse are on the rise: there were 129,193 reports in 2015 and 142,893 in 2016. Complete annual figures for last year are not yet available, but by the end of September 125,769 reports had been logged. A European commission report last year said the pay gap between men and women in Spain had fallen from 18.1% in 2007 to 14.9% in 2015, while a recent Spanish study found that women on average were paid 12.7% less for doing the same job as male colleagues. The strike is also intended to show how much domestic and care work women do on a daily basis – by leaving the tasks to men. A poll for El País this week found that 82% of Spaniards thought there were valid motives for the strike.

Every house has one set of cables carrying electricity and one set of pipes with gas; in addition, all the key energy market prices are set nationally, regionally or even globally, so there can be little or no competition in supply costs. You could argue that having more buyers actually increases competition, pushing prices higher. We may not realise it, but it has been cold in all of Europe, so price rises are inevitable. As your report says, the 7.9% rise in prices in the last six months was “driven primarily by increases in wholesale gas and electricity costs”. How will the government’s much-vaunted price cap help with that? I have changed suppliers almost every year in the last five or more years, but my bills are higher than ever, for a very simple reason: replacing the government-controlled system by more than a dozen private companies, all with highly paid chief executives and shareholders to keep happy, made the costs of the delivery process soar. How could it not? The private sector is good when there are genuine differences in goods or services, but cannot do much in a market where the basic costs are fixed by others.

Billboards were driven through central London last month saying “71 dead”, “And still no arrests?”, “How Come?” The Justice 4 Grenfell campaigners took inspiration from the central theme of the film, in which McDormand’s character uses the same medium to call attention to the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter. “Billboards still work, so I think that it’s really exciting,” said the American actor after accepting her award, praising “the idea that activists are taking that kind of statement and putting it out there”. “It started actually with the Grenfell Tower fire investigation, then it leapfrogged to [the] Miami gun control situation, it was outside the UN ... That’s the kind of power that an image can have and that’s what we’re making, we’re making powerful images.” McDormand followed Stormzy in using a public platform to highlight the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign. The British grime artist demanded answers from the prime minister, Theresa May, over the fire during his performance at the Brit awards. Moyra Samuels, one of the people behind the Grenfell billboards, was quoted by the BBC as saying: “It’s not just politicians who are taking note of what happened. We are being effective at raising the issues on a worldwide stage.” Announcing the launch of the billboard campaign, the Justice 4 Grenfell activists said: “Eight months on from the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower, the issue is being ignored. 71 people died in the Grenfell Tower. And still no arrests. “And still 297 flammable towers. And still hundreds of survivors are homeless. And still they are not represented on the inquiry. And still there is no justice. “These three billboards are here to keep this tragedy in the national conscience, to make our voices heard. And our voices call for change to a system that kills.

Songs like Every Day Is a Miracle skew largely towards the bright side – a mature and thoughtful reaction to the despair felt by many in the wake of Trump’s presidency. This being Byrne, one of pop’s most refreshing thinkers, it’s not as simple as chipper equanimity, however. Bullet, for one, is a superficially lovely song about a bullet finding its mark. Everybody’s Coming to My House (made with longtime foil Brian Eno) is a funky workout in which Byrne finds that “we’re only tourists in this life”. On Every Day Is a Miracle and Dog’s Mind, by contrast, the album hits peak “quirk”, as Byrne seeks to explain that “the chicken thinks in mysterious ways” and that dogs can’t drive.

On Monday, as the prime minister unveiled a package of measures to boost housebuilding, the housing secretary, Sajid Javid, said ministers had already taken steps to tackle the problem of homes being left uninhabited. He claimed local authorities had been handed the ability to charge more council tax for vacant properties, adding: “So we’re taking action on that.” But the Guardian can reveal that the policy outlined in the Autumn budget, to allow councils to double the amount of tax levied on homes if they are left empty, has yet to be enacted. The campaigner Guy Shrubsole, who runs the Who Owns England group, obtained an email from a government official saying the proposal “is not yet in place since it needs an amendment to primary legislation”. He uncovered the minutes of a Westminster council meeting that said government officials had “highlighted a potential risk in relation to the government meeting the legislative timetable necessary for a 1 April 2018 implementation”, which could delay action until 2019. Pointing to the huge number of people sleeping rough on London’s streets, Shrubsole said: “It’s a national scandal that we still have thousands of homes lying empty, many owned by billionaires and offshore firms. “The government’s unforgivable delay in introducing its promised new empty homes tax means councils will lose out on millions of pounds of revenue that could be spent on affordable housing. And the wealthy owners of empty properties will keep laughing all the way to the bank.” The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government confirmed there had as yet been no action taken on the policy, saying it would be brought in “as soon as we can”. Meanwhile, a source close to Javid said the cabinet minister’s comments were simply about the proposals that had been announced, adding: “We will bring forward the legislation.” Javid and May had set out on Monday to shake up the country’s planning laws in an attempt to tackle the country’s housing crisis. The prime minister used a speech to tell developers to “do their duty to Britain and build the homes our country needs”. Among the commitments were: allowing former shops to be turned into homes; basing future planning permissions on developers’ build-out rates; and pressurising councils that fail to produce adequate proposals about the properties they plan to build. Tackling the problem of empty homes is also seen as critical, which is why the government decided to ramp up the premium that can be charged on council tax from 50% to 100%. Labour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, criticised the delay. “Just like pledges to ban letting agency fees or build new starter homes, ministers have done nothing to legislate for double-rate council tax for empty properties. Their failure to follow speeches with action shows the government is simply not serious about tackling the housing crisis,” he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, said Javid had been “boasting about a measure that is apparently unenforceable at the moment”, saying his party would “charge empty homes at 300% as a tougher disincentive”. A freedom of information request by the Lib Dems revealed more than 11,000 homes across the country had been empty for more than a decade. Councils urged the government to bring the plans into place. The Local Government Association’s housing spokesman, Martin Tett, said: “We were pleased that the government listened to our call to provide councils with the ability to charge more council tax for empty homes. But we now need the government to move faster in implementing these powers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/05/are-we-really-going-to-let-the-super-rich-take-all-the-art","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T16:50:15Z","webTitle":"Are we really going to let the super-rich take all the art? | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/are-we-really-going-to-let-the-super-rich-take-all-the-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/are-we-really-going-to-let-the-super-rich-take-all-the-art","fields":{"headline":"Are we really going to let the super-rich take all the art?","bodyText":"Last Wednesday, London art adviser Harry Smith spent more than £110m bulk-buying 13 works by Picasso on behalf of unnamed wealthy clients. The day before, Smith, the executive chairman and managing director of the art advisory firm Gurr Johns, bought another nine at Christie’s. Is it pessimistic of me to fear that the bulk of these masterpieces will not end up in public museums? How I dislike people who hog great artworks all to themselves. In fact, it gives me a burning fury to rival the heat of a sun. This latest news follows an investigation by the historian Sir David Cannadine that found museum collections in the UK are at risk of becoming “inert and lifeless” unless more money is invested for them to buy objects. Is this the future we face? A society in which only the super-rich get to bask in the beauty of humanity’s masterpieces. I don’t especially begrudge them their monopoly on vulgar yachts or tacky hotels, but when they start stealing the art, I’m liable to start rocking back and forth while muttering “Full communism!” under my breath. “We are predicting that art will comfortably overtake wine as the best-performing asset class this year,” Andrew Shirley, a partner at Knight Frank and author of the luxury investment index, said at the end of last year, presumably to divert attention from the husk where his soul once was. Thank God for export bars, such as the one placed recently on Francesco Guardi’s painting Rialto Bridge With the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi. But they are not enough, and as long as our galleries and museums remain chronically underfunded, more and more pieces will fall into the hands of the haves, who often lack the brains and the hearts to fully appreciate them. Does David Willetts practise what he preaches? It was refreshing to see David Willetts calling for the government to target wealthy baby boomers. Willetts often feels like the lone “oldie” who is on our team when it comes to generational injustice, at least in the Tory party. Everyone should read his book The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Took Their Children’s Future – and Why They Should Give it Back. However, I can’t help but wonder whether he practises what he preaches. When he was an MP, his 2015 declarations for the register of members’ interests stated that he owned a flat in west London, “for which rental income is received”. I have no doubt that Willetts wants to see a better society for young people, but I cannot help but feel that is unlikely to happen while nearly a fifth of MPs are landlords."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/11/ibiza-in-winter-off-season-breaks-neil-forsyth","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Ibiza in winter: unplugged but still on song","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/11/ibiza-in-winter-off-season-breaks-neil-forsyth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/11/ibiza-in-winter-off-season-breaks-neil-forsyth","fields":{"headline":"Ibiza in winter: unplugged but still on song","bodyText":"It takes two hours to reach the Lost City. My guide, Toby Clarke from Walking Ibiza, leads me down a road that dwindles into barely perceptible paths rising and falling through the forest. Toby’s dog, Cosmo, runs off on long diversions, a flickering presence in the sea mist that drifts through the trees around us. Finally, we reach the remains of a long stone wall. It protects a thumb-shaped peninsula that rides out on white-chalked cliffs into the flat, tideless Mediterranean. Behind the wall are the flattened ruins of the Lost City. Many believe this was the last stand of the Moors, who ran the island as an Islamic caliphate for three centuries. It is hard to hike to the Lost City in the summer heat but this is Ibiza in winter. An island becalmed, cooled and open to inspection. On a sunny February morning, I stand on the clifftop and enjoy a view unchanged for millennia. The remote, undeveloped hills bear only juniper trees. Gulls circle the empty expanse of Cala d’Albarca, Ibiza’s largest natural bay. The silence is so total that it is threatened only by the soft roll of the sea 200 metres below. Cosmo is part podenco, the handsome dog that is emblematic of this island. The podenco was brought to Ibiza on the galleys of the Moors; images of the breed are carved on the walls of Egyptian pyramids. As Cosmo darts across the ruins of the Lost City, he is running over ghosts. Ibiza works in the summer and rests in the winter. In the rural north, I drive along empty roads between fields filled with almond blossom and wildflowers, and the pretty villages offer a commonality of whitewashed church, village square and a bar showing signs of life. In nearby Sant Miquel de Balansat, the stone floor of Can Xicu bar has been varnished by centuries of feet. The place has been in the d’en Planes family for 130 years. A photo on the wall shows Toni d’en Planes performing with an Ibicencan dance troupe in New York in 1965. At the Can Vidal bar in Sant Joan de Labritja, a few kilometres east, Vicente Vidal rattles through the five generations of Vidal who have owned the bar and insistently pours me a glass of hierbas, the island’s herb liqueur. At Bar Anita in San Carlos (or Sant Carles de Peralta), towards the south coast, another Vicente pours me another, to accompany tapas of boquerones (marinated anchovies) and sliced pork in oil and lemon. I’ve spent a lot of time in Bar Anita: I wrote a novel set in the village (San Carlos, Vintage, 2014). Bar Anita was the base of the hippie invasion of Ibiza that began in the late 1960s, initially driven by US draft dodgers. The eponymous Anita served them tortillas and hierbas, and became a post office on the side. As we talk, Vicente points out Anita herself, walking across the square. The guardian of the hippies is a 94-year-old model of Ibicencan reserve in traditional black. I have lunch at Atzaró, an elegant agroturismo on a working orange farm – and in the Guasch family for eight generations. Its menú del día is sourced entirely within 1km of the hotel. Then I drive west to San Antonio and the warm embrace of nostalgia. In 1963, my grandad Jimmy Walker, a doctor in Dundee, successfully treated the relative of a Norwegian. In gratitude, the Norwegian offered the use of a villa on a Spanish island called Ibiza. After a two-day journey, my mother’s family reached San Antonio bay. On one side was a fishing village. On the other was the villa and empty fields. One evening, they saw a handwritten sign for Doc’s Bar, and followed it to a thatched bar overseen by an asthmatic man from Harrogate called Cliff Buckle. Buckle, advised by his doctor to seek warmer climes, had wound up in Ibiza and was building holiday homes for adventurous Brits. My grandparents operated under Presbyterian conditions, but Ibiza does funny things to people and they paid £3,000 on trust for the home that remains in the family today. I stand on the roof built by Buckle. The fields that my mother and her siblings hiked over to the beaches have been filled with hotels, but the evening view remains unchanged as the sun sets behind the island of Conillera. The next morning, at my hotel Can Partit, the co-owner, Nieves, is concerned. I tell her of my plan to cycle across the island and she worriedly plies me with delicious, thin omelettes made from eggs laid this morning. Can Partit is a charming, rustic finca surrounded by almond groves in Santa Agnés de Corona, and in the family of Nieves’ husband José for 200 years. José points to a vast juniper beam in the roof. His grandfather, the strongest man on Ibiza, lifted it by himself. I cycle with Simon Rose of Velo Club Ibiza, who last year covered 13,000km guiding cyclists round the island. We follow country roads that are largely unsigned, rarely seeing a car as we pass fields of sheep and winter crops, and climb over hills of endless pine. With my legs numb, my saddle apparently replaced by a spear, and Simon looking absolutely fine, we disembark in Santa Gertrudis. The walls of Bar Costa, as with many of the island’s older bars, are decorated with the works of local artists, taken as payment for bar bills. Two bellota hams hang above the bar. I start the next day on a mountaintop platform, exhibiting what are surely some of the most inelegant yoga stretches this idyllic setting has seen. The spectacular finca, Can Luminosa, offers year-round yoga (ibizaretreats.com) and is an example of the island’s reinvention (drop-ins welcome in winter; in summer it’s residential). After the lager-laden 1980s and the clubbing 1990s, the 21st century is about wellness. As an antidote, I visit Pikes Hotel in San Antonio for a reminder of the island’s hedonistic spirit. Dawn Hindle and husband Andy McKay were one half of Manumission, the weekly club night that ran for 15 summers from 1994, offering barely contained mayhem for my generation. Now they’ve bought Pikes, where founder Tony Pike was ringmaster for 30 years of celebrity debauchery. Dawn walks me round the hotel, which is being lovingly updated during its winter break. We see the swimming pool used in Wham’s Club Tropicana video, the bar where Freddie Mercury held his days-long 41st birthday party, and the suite where Pike and Grace Jones began a torrid affair. Pikes has a bar around every corner. “We don’t do yoga,” smiles Dawn. That evening I visit Ibiza Town, where newer buildings spread outward from the old Dalt Vila (high town), on a hill behind vast 16th-century ramparts. Within those walls, I walk through cool lanes canyoned between grand houses. Coats of arms above doorways show helmets turned to the left, a sign that the houses had been gifted to illegitimate offspring, sent to Ibiza by embarrassed mainland aristocracy. I walk uphill, passing the Santa Domingo convent, where housebound nuns sell pastries through grated windows, and the decorated mouth of the tunnel through which Catalan soldiers rushed in 1235 to begin the bloody expulsion of the Moors. At the top of the hill, a platform offers a panoramic view over the Mediterranean. In the summer this terrace would teem with people. This evening I am alone, on the island my family have been coming to for over 50 years. To the east, the local llaüt fishing boats set out looking for squid. To the west, the sun sets over the Ses Salines salt flats. The view feels ancient and unchanged. This is Ibiza in winter. When the island shows its age, and is all the better for it. Way to go The trip was supported by the Ibiza Tourist Board. Doubles at Can Partit cost from €98 B&amp;B in low season. For more on holidays in the Balearic islands, see illesbalears.travel.

In summer easyJet, Ryanair, and Thomas Cook Airlines (as well as BA) fly from airports across the UK. Best time to go November to April are the quietest, cheapest months, for an authentic taste of Ibiza with temperatures averaging around 15C (though they can go higher).

What now?","bodyText":"“Italy is the leader,” said Steve Bannon in an interview just before the Italian elections. “The Italian people have gone farther, in a shorter period of time, than the British did for Brexit and the Americans did for Trump.” Bannon delights at the realisation that in Italy the centre no longer holds. Indeed, these elections have certified the collapse of established parties and left the country’s political mainstream in chaos. Taken together, the incumbent Democratic party of Matteo Renzi and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia have gathered a puny 33% of the popular vote between them. For comparison, at the last elections the Democrats alone scored 40%. Any grand coalition is arithmetically off the table in Italy. The parallel declines of Renzi and Berlusconi is telling of a more general trend: the growing disenchantment with parties appearing to uphold continuity. Leaving corruption and clownery aside, the political platform of the traditional centre-left and centre-right is a similar promise of business as usual and adherence to the precepts of neoliberal economics. It is no coincidence that the EU establishment recently hailed Berlusconi as the man to save Italy from populism. While, in a trend consolidated across the west, social democracy becomes associated with elite interests and is abandoned by the working class. It comes as little surprise that the true winners of these elections are two parties perceived to be campaigning to upturn the system. Matteo Salvini’s nationalist and xenophobic La Lega (“the League”, formerly known as the Northern League) has surpassed Forza Italia to lead the rightwing camp with more than 17% of the vote. But the real winner of the elections is the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, which reached a whopping 32% and enshrined its position as Italy’s largest party by far. The two upstarts seem to have divided the country between themselves: the League is by far the most influential political force in the north, while the Five Star Movement has won virtually every constituency in the south. This is to be expected. Extraordinary wealth concentration, a grossly unfair taxation system and a stagnating economy that produces precarious and underpaid employment even in times of growth are enduring characteristics of Italy’s – and Europe’s – economic landscape. It is far from incomprehensible that many would wish to overturn it. As is the case for Renzi and Berlusconi, Salvini’s and Di Maio’s stories also run in parallel. Both have flirted with the idea of Italy exiting the euro, only to tone down their message as the elections approached. Both try to appeal to left-behinds, including many of Italy’s small and medium enterprises, shaken by years of economic crisis. And both mix an apparently anti-elite rhetoric with policies of continuity. The League advocates a flat tax, a measure benefitting by and large the richest households, while the Five Star Movement has repositioned itself as a guarantor of economic stability, advancing moderates as candidates for ministerial posts. What guarantees the anti-establishment tone of both parties is scapegoating: migrants for Salvini, corrupt politicians – the “caste” – for Di Maio. But while the League is part and parcel of an international trend of growing nationalist and xenophobic movements, Five Star is a peculiarly Italian phenomenon. It has drained votes from the centre-left and it has gradually toned down its rhetoric to occupy an increasingly moderate position. It is an extraordinary example of new centrist populism. What government may come out of this situation is anybody’s guess. Both Salvini and Di Maio have claimed the right to try to form a majority, but for both the path is arduous at best, with no obvious coalitions available in the newly elected parliament. A “populist” government bringing the two anti-establishment forces together – a nightmare scenario for the EU – is certainly a possibility, although Di Maio hesitates to identify his catch-all party too closely with the far right. Coalition talks are likely to be lengthy, during which time the incumbent prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, will follow Mariano Rajoy’s and Angela Merkel’s ordeal of governing without a majority. Early or repeat elections are a distinct possibility. But while all eyes will be focused on coalition talks, the most interesting developments may yet appear on the left. The leftwing vote at these elections has amounted to little more than 22%. The scope for disruption, in a country where at least double that number has traditionally voted left-of-centre, is huge. Calls for the resignation of Renzi multiply. Will the Democratic party manage to react to the burning defeat by reinventing itself, following Jeremy Corbyn’s example with the British Labour party? Or will it, on the other hand, attempt to copy Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche and re-brand itself as a pro-European, liberal party? And, while the Five Star Movement moves towards the centre, will a new anti-establishment, leftwing alternative rise up to fill the vacuum? Some appear already to be thinking in this direction. On 10 March, less than a week after the elections, the charismatic mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, and the former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, are due to meet in Naples, together with a large cohort of European progressives, to launch a new pan-European political party. It would be surprising if they had no ambitions to occupy a space left empty by the collapse of the Italian left. Ultimately, the only certainty is that Italy’s political landscape – just like Europe’s – is in a complete state of flux. The collapse of traditional parties is welcome and long overdue. But it remains to be seen whether this will lead to the kind of right-wing backlash that Bannon so revels in, or whether it will open the opportunity for a genuine progressive transformation. The Italian elections have shaken the tree. But the fruits still have to ripen. • Lorenzo Marsili is a writer and philosopher, and the founder of European Alternatives"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/07/police-spy-operation-janet-alder-probably-influenced-by-racism-ipcc","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T16:37:16Z","webTitle":"Police targeting of dead man's sister 'probably influenced by racism'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/police-spy-operation-janet-alder-probably-influenced-by-racism-ipcc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/07/police-spy-operation-janet-alder-probably-influenced-by-racism-ipcc","fields":{"headline":"Police targeting of dead man's sister 'probably influenced by racism'","bodyText":"The police’s decision to launch a surveillance operation against a woman whose brother had been unlawfully killed in a police station was likely to have been influenced partly by racial discrimination, a leaked report by a watchdog concluded. Janet Alder and her barrister were put under surveillance by police during the inquest into the death of her brother, Christopher. The surveillance team followed them to a hotel and car park and attempted to eavesdrop on their private conversations. An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, found there was “evidence to support the conclusion that discrimination and bias is likely to have been a factor” when police initiated the surveillance. In the unpublished 2015 report, seen by the Guardian, the IPCC said it was more than likely that police stereotyped Alder and her supporters as troublemakers or menacing and treated her barrister, Leslie Thomas, less favourably than his white colleagues when he was followed. It is the second time the watchdog has made this kind of criticism during the long-running controversy over the death of Alder’s brother, a former Falklands veteran, in 1998. The IPCC suggested in 2006 that police may have been influenced by unwitting racism in the way they treated Christopher before his death – a finding disputed by officers. Christopher Alder, who was 37, died handcuffed and face down in a police station in Hull after choking on his own vomit. Officers joked and chatted as he died, and said later they had thought he was play-acting. A tape captured monkey noises as he lay dead. Recently attention has centred on the surveillance launched against his sister and her barrister during the inquest in 2000, which found that he had been unlawfully killed. This month two police officers were cleared of gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing. The IPCC’s report on the surveillance found that Thomas was the only one in the legal team working for the Alder family who was put under surveillance. “There is no indication that any other member of the legal team, who were white, was followed. In these circumstances, it is considered more than likely that the family barrister was treated less favourably than other legal representatives at the inquest.”. Janet Alder had been campaigning for details about how her brother died. The report said it was “more than likely” that she was probably seen “as stereotypically a troublemaker intent on causing problems for the police by arranging demonstrations and seeking media attention”. The IPCC cited a memo written by a police employee as another example of possible stereotyping of black people as potential criminals or troublemakers. The employee reported to a senior officer that Alder’s supporters had filled the public gallery at the inquest, stating: “There was a mixture of black and white supporters, but many of the black supporters were large, sported dark glasses and attempted to look menacing.” The IPCC reported that the memo “made no comparison of how the white supporters were dressed or looked in their appearance; the attendance of black supporters at court appears to be sufficient to anticipate some form of trouble. It is a concern that the report was prepared for one of Humberside’s most senior officers with the use of terminology that is less favourable to black people and intended to influence any subsequent decision-making.” This month’s misconduct panel heard evidence that the surveillance operation was launched at short notice after police received a report about the presence of “four large black men” who “looked intimidating”. DCS Judi Heaton, of Humberside police, said: “This report about the events that took place in July 2000 revisits issues that were highlighted at the time and that we have worked hard to address. “We would like to provide reassurance that we now have a much better understanding of the issues and have implemented an improved programme of training in diversity, as well as making changes to our policies and procedures. This includes identifying the individual needs and risks for every person that we deal with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/rebel-choir-deep-throat-and-lips-the-feminist-singing-groups-causing-a-din","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T17:03:19Z","webTitle":"Rebel Choir, Deep Throat and Lips: the feminist singing groups causing a din","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/rebel-choir-deep-throat-and-lips-the-feminist-singing-groups-causing-a-din","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/mar/05/rebel-choir-deep-throat-and-lips-the-feminist-singing-groups-causing-a-din","fields":{"headline":"Rebel Choir, Deep Throat and Lips: the feminist singing groups causing a din","bodyText":"Broadly, feminism rallies for women’s voices to be heard. This year, one International Women’s Day event sees this realised on a literal level: an equality-espousing “superchoir” is set to create a wall of sound at the Women’s Strike Assembly in central London on 8 March. Led by Rebel Choir, the singing group of the Focus E15 housing activists, ranks will be swelled by like-minded members of the local music community. One number planned is Peggy Seeger’s Reclaim the Night. “It’s important to have a very strong, angry female song,” says the choir leader, Rebecca Morris. Group singing is playing a prominent role in contemporary protest; an impassioned flash-mob performance of Quiet by MILCK at the Women’s March on Washington in January 2017 went viral. Here are other feminist choirs causing a din. F*Choir The south London-based cohort, which is helping to form the strike choir, specialise in songs about gender and inequality. I’m Not Dancing by vocalist and producer pair Tirzah &amp; Micachu is a favourite, says the musical director, Jenny Moore, thanks to lines such as: “I’m not dancing / I’m fighting” subverting traditional interpretations of female behaviour. Moore reckons music’s tendency towards repetition means the singers are essentially armed with empowerment mantras. “Suddenly, something you thought you’d never be able to say, like the Tirzah lyrics, you can access any time.” Deep Throat The friskily named, all-female east London collective has rabble-roused at festivals including Green Man and Wilderness and released its first record, Be OK, last year. Loudly occupying space in the male-dominated music industry “feels like a feminist act in itself,” says the founder, Luisa Gerstein. SHE Choir With branches in cities including Manchester, Newcastle and Berlin, SHE blend pop with politics. It has raised funds for charities such as Refuge. Italian working women’s protest songs sit in the repertoire alongside buoyant Destiny’s Child covers. Lips The 80-strong Islington outfit, which goes by the strapline “Political. Not Pious!”, supports immigration injustice campaign group Women Asylum Seekers Together (Wast) and has performed with the Wast choir outside Yarl’s Wood detention centre in protest at the treatment of asylum seekers. It has also collaborated with Music in Detention, a charity that helps immigration detainees to make music, covering Rihanna’s Stay. “We try not to speak for people, but use our platform in a positive way,” says one of the choir’s founders, Geraldine Smith."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/uk-oscar-winners-sign-language-speech-raises-profile-of-silent-disability","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T16:49:28Z","webTitle":"UK Oscar winner's sign-language speech raises profile of 'silent disability'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/uk-oscar-winners-sign-language-speech-raises-profile-of-silent-disability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/uk-oscar-winners-sign-language-speech-raises-profile-of-silent-disability","fields":{"headline":"UK Oscar winner's sign-language speech raises profile of 'silent disability'","bodyText":"Much of the talk before Sunday’s Oscars ceremony was about Hollywood’s moral compass. After 2016’s Oscars So White debacle and the Time’s Up movement, attention was particularly drawn towards how the awards show would approach diversity and, in particular, the equitable treatment of areas such as race and sex. One of the issues that was in rather less sharp focus was disability in Hollywood films. That was until Sunday’s show was stolen by the stars of the Silent Child, a British production about a profoundly deaf child, which won best live-action short film. The film tells the story of Libby, played by six-year-old Maisie Sly, who struggles to communicate until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, teaches her sign language. Shenton, who also wrote the short, gave her acceptance speech on Sunday in British Sign Language (BSL), fulfilling a promise to Sly, who is profoundly deaf and was in the audience. Later she said Sly had “held the Oscar, she said it was very heavy, she had her photograph taken with it and then said she wanted to go back and see her brothers and sisters, so she’s keeping it real.” Prior to the awards ceremony, Sly was pictured on the film’s Twitter account holding a sign that read: “Disability is Diversity,” underlining Shenton’s point that the issue should not be excluded from Hollywood’s introspection. In her acceptance speech, Shenton said: “This is happening. Millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers, and particularly access to education.” Sly was born in Plymouth and when she was two her parents moved the family more than 100 miles to Swindon to gain better access to better specialist education for deaf children for her and her siblings. She had never acted before but Shenton said Sly had “taken it all in her stride. She always said we’d win.” Shenton began learning sign-language at the age of 12, after her father went deaf. “Deafness is a silent disability. You can’t see it and it’s not life-threatening, so I want to say the biggest of thank-yous to the academy for allowing us to put this in front of a mainstream audience.” • This article was amended on 13 June 2018. An earlier version said that Rachel Shenton qualified as a sign-language interpreter at the age of 12. Shenton learnt sign language for herself, however is not a qualified interpreter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/head-quarters/2018/mar/08/bridging-the-gender-gap-why-do-so-few-girls-study-stem-subjects","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T08:55:23Z","webTitle":"Bridging the gender gap: why do so few girls study Stem subjects?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/mar/08/bridging-the-gender-gap-why-do-so-few-girls-study-stem-subjects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/head-quarters/2018/mar/08/bridging-the-gender-gap-why-do-so-few-girls-study-stem-subjects","fields":{"headline":"Bridging the gender gap: why do so few girls study Stem subjects?","bodyText":"You will no doubt be aware that women are underrepresented in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) occupations. They make up 14.4% of all people working in Stem in the UK, despite being about half of the workforce. This is well short of the country’s goal of a critical mass of 30%. Increasing women in Stem is forecast to increase the UK’s labour value by at least £2bn. There is a whole tangle of reasons why the gender gap in Stem exists. One is a pipeline issue – fewer girls than boys choose to study Stem subjects at secondary school and university. Interventions internationally mean the numbers of girls in Stem subjects are creeping up very slowly, but the gap remains surprisingly resistant nonetheless. Are girls biologically worse than boys at Stem subjects at school? Biological explanations tend to rely on the fact that boys are better at spatial tasks while girls are better at verbal recall tasks. However, these differences are very small and their link to Stem ability is tenuous. Meta-analyses consistently show that girls and boys are on average much more similar than they are different across a range of skills. For instance, a meta-analysis of gender differences in mathematics, based on 100 studies and testing more than three million people, found that girls outperformed boys overall in primary school, there was no difference in secondary school and there was only a very slight and inconsistent male advantage for complex problem solving. Typically, girls do as well as or outperform boys in Stem classwork but do worse on tests. The International Student Assessment (Pisa) reports on 276,165 15-year-olds from 40 countries who take identical tests in mathematics and reading. In 2015, the average difference between high-achieving boys and girls was 19 points, the equivalent of about half a year at school. But these differences disappeared when factoring in reported levels of self-confidence or anxiety towards mathematics. On average, girls were more anxious about tests than boys were, and this seems to have affected their score. Are gender gaps socially constructed? Luigi Guiso and colleagues used the Pisa data to explore gender differences in maths performance. Overall, girls’ maths scores averaged 10.5 points (2%) lower than the mean average for boys, but this difference varied by country. In Turkey, for instance, the gender gap is greater (boys outperform girls by 22.6 points) while in Iceland the gender difference is reversed: girls outperform boys by 14.5 points. The researchers then classified each country on the basis of gender equality, ie how much they treated women as equal to men. In more gender-neutral countries such as Norway and Sweden the maths gender gap disappeared. They state that if Turkey were characterised by the same gender equality seen in Sweden, the gender gap in maths would be eliminated. Then why are there fewer women in Stem careers even in more gender-neutral countries? These cultural effects suggest the gender gap in Stem careers should disappear in more gender-neutral countries. Yet we still find a higher proportion of men in Stem-related careers than women, even in gender-neutral Sweden. A study of 1,327 Swedish secondary school students explored why more boys are attracted to Stem subjects at university and more girls are attracted to subjects in the Heed (health, elementary education and domestic) spheres. This difference was partially explained by “social belongingness”: teenagers felt they would fit in better in subjects that had more of their own gender. But another important factor was “self-efficacy”: the belief that one can succeed in a domain. We tend to approach domains where we feel we are competent and avoid those in which we do not. Boys and girls both had high self-efficacy in the Heed subjects, but boys chose not to pursue them. The researchers suggest that this may reflect the low social value and rewards associated with careers in these spheres. In contrast, girls on average had much lower self-efficacy ratings in Stem, despite outperforming boys across school subjects. Even in one of the most gender-neutral countries in the world and despite the evidence of their own marks, girls still seem to be succumbing to the stereotype that girls aren’t as capable in these subjects. Where do gender stereotypes come from? This is a complicated question, and the answer is: lots of places. Even young children can absorb and be influenced by gender stereotypes, and these can be as detrimental for boys as they are for girls but in different ways. A recent study by Lin Bian, Sarah-Jane Leslie and Andrei Cimpian has shown that five-year-old girls are just as likely to say that girls can be “really, really smart” but from six years up they think brilliance is much more likely in boys. From this age girls are also more likely to be attracted to a game if it is described as being for children who “work really hard” than if it is described as being for children who are “really smart”. Again, this is despite the fact that girls, on average, are outperforming boys in these subjects at school. These findings suggest gendered notions of intelligence are picked up very early and start having an effect on the sorts of interests that girls pursue. How can we attract more girls to Stem subjects at university? Research from these different perspectives converge on the idea that there is little to no difference in boys’ and girls’ average ability at Stem subjects. This means that in order to attract more girls to study Stem subjects at university and enter Stem careers, we need to tackle the stereotypes they are exposed to and we need to do this early. One way to encourage girls is to use appropriate role models. As part of a campaign to coincide with today’s International Women’s Day, Speakezee, a platform that connects academics with non-academic audiences, is working with the Institute of Physics and the Girls’ School Association to send young female graduate Stem students into schools to talk to and inspire young teenage girls to consider pursuing Stem topics at A-level. Professor Brian Cox may be the popular face of physics for mass viewing audiences in the UK, but young girls need individuals they are more likely to relate to if they are to be persuaded not to abandon their Stem potential."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/05/peter-stoger-puts-stamp-on-dortmund-board-decision-to-make","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T15:13:26Z","webTitle":"Peter Stöger puts stamp on Dortmund to leave board with decision to make | Andy Brassell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/05/peter-stoger-puts-stamp-on-dortmund-board-decision-to-make","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/05/peter-stoger-puts-stamp-on-dortmund-board-decision-to-make","fields":{"headline":"Peter Stöger puts stamp on Dortmund to leave board with decision to make","bodyText":"On other weekends, it would have been a cause for glumness. Yet even in falling a place below bitter rivals Schalke, from second to third, it felt as if it had been a fairly successful day for Borussia Dortmund. They emerged from Saturday evening’s Topspiel at RB Leipzig not only with a point – and having maintained a three-point lead over their hosts in the race for Champions League qualification – but with the satisfying feeling of having put in a shift. They can be few things that their coach, Peter Stöger, cherishes as much as this. Many may still feel he was fortunate to get this post after his sacking by the bottom club, Cologne, but he has not hesitated to put his stamp on the side. Having criticised their lack of combativeness in recent matches – and particularly after the lucky draw at Atalanta that took BVB through to Thursday’s Europa League last-16 tie against Salzburg – this performance was exactly what Stöger was after. There is, as Kicker wrote on Sunday, a “rarity value to Dortmund collecting more yellow cards than the other side” after the visitors received four cautions to Leipzig’s zero, and the feeling was it was more than just statistical trivia. “As well as their kit,” Thomas Hennecke wrote: “Stöger’s XI had their combat suits in their luggage this time.” Stöger underlined his pleasure with his team’s display by praising their “body language” and aggression. It was also a mark of his growing authority. Not only had Dortmund played as Stöger wanted them to but they appeared to have done so in direct response to his recent criticisms. After last Monday’s 1-1 draw with Augsburg, in which his team lost the lead and the chance to isolate themselves in second place, he had slated his side’s second-half efforts as “nothing like what you had hoped for in terms of temperament and drive”, which, he said, was “totally beyond my understanding”. He did not, it seems, need to ask twice. This was a really engaged Dortmund, who reacted well after Leipzig took a first-half lead, exemplary in both the final pass from Naby Keïta and the smooth finish past Roman Bürki by Jean-Kévin Augustin. The home side, as their coach, Ralph Hasenhüttl, acknowledged afterwards, needed this win more and played like it, forcing BVB to defend well, particularly in the first half. Behind a defence led by Manuel Akanji and Omer Toprak, Bürki was tidy and composed. Dortmund only had four efforts at goal in the whole game but they used their moments well. Mo Dahoud, enjoying perhaps his best game since arriving at the club, created a sublime equaliser for Marco Reus – in a way, this engaging game was a story of two sublime final passes – and they could even have taken maximum points had Michy Batshuayi not been wrong-footed right in front of goal from another excellent Dahoud delivery. This was a Dortmund performance that would simply not have been possible under Peter Bosz. On the first occasion these teams met this season, back in October, Dortmund had all the chances at Westfalen and frittered them, a profligacy only matched by their shambolic defending (which, of course, hindsight tells us was about to get worse). Under Stöger, Dortmund have conceded only eight in 10 Bundesliga games, so it’s little wonder those upstairs are happy with him. The Austrian has given them a decision to make. His personality fits well with Dortmund’s perceived heartfelt, working-man values, though making a medium-term commitment to this sort of no-frills footballing approach will be a big decision. All sides, probably, hope that his defensive nous coupled with the richly gifted front four of Batshuayi, Reus, Mario Götze and the revitalised André Schürrle will find a route to happiness between them. The club are already beginning contract talks with Reus, who has less than 18 months left on his deal, but it would be at least a minor surprise if he jumped ship after Dortmund stuck with him through his injury problems. There are other items on Dortmund’s agenda; with Roman Weidenfeller retiring another goalkeeper is needed but the question – as Ruhr Nachrichten points out – is whether to get a “clear number two” for Bürki or a potential challenger for a goalkeeper whose form has oscillated wildly this season. Frankly, the upcoming availability of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Lukas Hradecky, who will be out of contract in July, has not gone unnoticed. All personnel items, however, will pale in significance to who is leading Dortmund from the bench next season. All that is clear for now is that Stöger couldn’t be doing much more to make his pitch. Talking points • Bayern Munich moved 20 points clear with Sunday’s 4-0 win at Freiburg; an exercise in frustration at the state of the title race, or lack thereof, for some but this was more than a stroll. It was a Bayern who were equally compelled and compelling, in what Jupp Heynckes called “one of our best performances of the season” at opponents who had only lost one home Bundesliga game before. Corentin Tolisso’s piledriver from range was the standout goal, the result of intensive practice with coach Peter Hermann, he told reporters afterwards. • Somebody who doesn’t need finishing coaching is Claudio Pizarro, with the 39-year-old scoring his first for Cologne – and 192nd in the Bundesliga overall – in fine style. It should have paved the way for the bottom side to beat Stuttgart in a strong first-half display but they managed to shoot themselves in the foot again, converting a 1-0 lead in the 45th minute into a half-time deficit. The coach, Stefan Ruthenbeck, and his staff focused their ire on the officials at full time but the devastated players, led by the goalkeeper Timo Horn, knew the wounds were self-inflicted. • A rather happier goalkeeper was the 20-year-old Florian Müller, making his debut in goal for Mainz in the light of injuries to René Adler and Robin Zentner, and earning his team a vital point at Hamburg, for whom the prospect of a first-ever relegation looms large after failing to beat their rivals at the bottom. Müller’s saves included a penalty stop from Filip Kostic in a display described as “amazing” by his coach, Sandro Schwarz, and which kept his third-bottom team seven points ahead of HSV and eight clear of Cologne. • Eintracht Frankfurt make up the top four after a fourth straight home win, beating Hannover, with Bayer Leverkusen hot on their tails after winning at struggling Wolfsburg. Lucas Alario opened the scoring for Leverkusen from the spot – a sixth successful penalty in a row after missing nine of 16 last term. • A gold star, too, for Andrej Kramaric. The Croatian’s excellent headed opener for Hoffenheim at Augsburg made it five consecutive goalscoring games for him, edging Julian Nagelsmann’s team closer to the European places during a season in which their spine has been taken away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/10/france-v-england-six-nations","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T18:37:33Z","webTitle":"France 22-16 England: Six Nations – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/10/france-v-england-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/10/france-v-england-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"France 22-16 England: Six Nations – as it happened","bodyText":"France celebrate wildly as England crumple to the turf! French confidence is on the up again ... while England have lost two on the bounce! And it also means that IRELAND ARE THE 2018 SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONS!!! A deserved victory for France tonight - they were resilient while England were stodgy - and a thoroughly deserved championship for the Irish. Can they close it out by winning the grand slam next weekend with victory over England at Twickenham? It’s going to be a blast finding out, not least because it’ll be St Patrick’s Day! 80 min +4: But with France reeling, seriously worried that they’ve somehow thrown it away, there’s a knock-on, a yard from the tryline! It’s over! 80 min +3: Beauxis was under a little pressure there, but surely he tried to kick too far upfield. So close to victory and yet so far! And England snaffle possession at this lineout! They’ve set up camp in front of the French sticks! 80 min +2: It’s thrown long. Too long! Beauxis gathers ... but can’t find touch with his kick! England are still alive! This is astonishing! Another penalty for not rolling away! Farrell will surely go for the corner again. 80 min +1: England take their time over this lineout. 80 min: The clock’s up. But after 11 phases, France fail to roll away and it’s a penalty. Farrell slaps a superb kick towards the left-hand corner flag. What a dramatic end to this game! 79 min: England with a few phases just inside the French half. They’re up to six. Something’s got to happen soon! Over it goes! Just under two minutes left on the clock. 77 min: Well, this is probably it. France go through a few phases, and then England fiddle about in the ruck. Penalty, right in front of the sticks. France will take their time. 76 min: Gomes Sa intercepts a Lawes pass out on the England right, as the visitors look for one last charge. That could be the final crucial moment of this match. Especially as Farrell strokes a stunning kick between the posts from tight on the chalk! England win France’s lineout. They set up in front of the sticks. Daly flings a pass wide left. Care, out on the touchline, taps the ball back infield for May, who powers over the line! This isn’t over yet! 73 min: Te’o bursts through the middle, and for a second it looks as though France are in serious trouble. But he throws a poor pass, the ball bounces around in the momentum-ruining style, and France regroup. 72 min: Couilloud and Beauxis are on for Machenaud and Trinh-Duc. 71 min: A sweeping left-to-right French move nearly results in Grosso crossing over by the right-hand flag. He’s held up. France make a big heave for the line. Not quite. England push them a little ways back, and finally they fail to release at the breakdown. Decent defence by England. 69 min: Some nonsense at the scrum. Time is not England’s friend, the hosts are perfectly happy with this. 68 min: Lauret is replaced by Galletier. Care and Watson are replaced by Wigglesworth and Brown. 67 min: Poirot, Vahaamahina and Guirado are replaced by Priso, Le Roux and Pelissie. 65 min: Cowan-Dickie is on for George. England put together a few phases inside French territory. Ten phases, and then Simmonds fails to release. Penalty, and England’s grip on the Six Nations trophy is beginning to look very weak indeed. Down to the last couple of fingers. Machenaud takes his time, but it’s worth it. England now have to score twice just for the win; not only that, they’ve only got 17 minutes to score four tries for the bonus point they require. 61 min: France probe a little down the left. England fail to roll away, and this is another penalty for France. 60 min: Joseph comes on for Ford. 58 min: France swap Slimani for Gomes Sa, while England exchange Cole for Sinckler. France escape from the corner by winning the lineout. And Watson comes back on. 57 min: France put ten phases together just inside the England half, but then refuse to release the ball at the breakdown. Farrell kicks majestically for the corner down the left, and England look to have seen out Watson’s yellow card. 55 min: This is extremely scrappy. France lose another of their own lineouts. Daly has a kick charged down. There’s little shape to it. But the home crowd are loving it. 53 min: France collapse the scrum! England were in serious trouble there, but the hosts have let them off. There’s polite. “This is painful viewing,” opines Guy Hornsby. “We’re isolated and weak at the breakdown, with France simply queuing up to pick us off. Given this happened against Scotland, you do have to wonder what on earth we were doing in training for two weeks.” 52 min: Guirado is down getting his right knee looked at. He’ll be OK to continue, it looks like. It’ll be a scrum to France, five metres out. Before that, Launchbury is replaced by Haskell. 51 min: France are very much on the front foot now, against England’s 14 men. Some fancy flinging, left to right. Guirado nearly crosses near the touchline, and they’re four on two, but a flick inside to Fickou doesn’t quite go to plan, and England hold them up on the line. That whole move was started by Guirado’s burst down the right flank, after which Trinh-Duc hoicked across the field to set up Fall. England are in a wee spot of trouble now, if they want to retain their title this season. 49 min: Watson is yellow carded for a high tackle, and it’s ... 48 min: Trinh-Duc plays a crossfield kick towards the left-hand corner. Fall gathers, and looks for the line. Watson throws out an arm and tackles him by his neck. This one’s going to the TMO. A penalty try? 47 min: France confuse themselves in the midfield, the ball squirting from the breakdown, allowing Farrell to run off with the ball. But then Itoje fails to release, and France are gifted possession back. This is not a showcase of technical brilliance. 45 min: England set up camp in the French 22. Seven phases, and France are rocking a bit. Vunipola goes down the right, but he runs into Bastareaud. He fails to release, and there goes that pressure. 43 min: All a bit scrappy in the early stages of this half. Bastareaud clatters into Te’o. Then Vahaamahina goes too far, taking Simmonds out. Penalty, and a chance for England to kick for the corner. 41 min: And now Bonneval is off, with Fickou on. And we’re off again! England get the party restarted. No replacements at half-time. After a couple of minutes of nonsense, the ball eventually comes out of a legal scrum. England fling it hither and yon. But the French intercept. A chance for the home side to tear upfield on the break. But Bastareaud flings a woeful forward pass into touch, a play that just about sums up the half. The whistle goes, and off trot the players. As things stand, Ireland will be the 2018 Six Nations champions in about an hour’s time. England can only stop them by scoring four tries in the second half on their way to victory. 40 min: A lot of faffing in the scrum, as you’d imagine. A penalty here conceded by France would be costly. A lot of faffing. 39 min: Camara knocks on, trying to gather a wild pass on his own 22. If he’d have taken that in, France were in clover down the right. But it’s a scrum to England, and a chance for the reigning Six Nations champions to establish a lead at the break. No bother! A proper old welt, sent straight down the middle of the field and between the sticks. It’s three from three for Machenaud. 36 min: England are offside in the middle of the park, just inside their own half. France will go for the posts. It’s a fair way out, though. 35 min: May comes haring down the right at great speed. Machenaud stops him in a very comprehensive fashion. A good old-fashioned crunching tackle. The crowd very much enjoyed that. Over it goes. France are holding on in a stop-start game. 31 min: Bastareaud goes barging down the centre, his power and energy engaging the crowd. France up the tempo. A few phases. France set up in front of the posts, but then there’s a careless knock-on. France were playing a penalty advantage, so they’ll have a belt at the sticks, but that could have been so much better. No problems there, as England reestablish their six-point lead. 28 min: A collapsed maul in the middle of the park, and France have conceded another penalty. Farrell will gather the ball and have a crack from 50 metres, just to the right of the sticks. 26 min: Watson threads a kick down the right for May, who bravely reaches the ball under pressure and kicks on towards Daly. Grosso comes across to flop on the ball as it bounces over the tryline. England went truly expansive for the first time this afternoon, and it very nearly paid off. No problem for Machenaud. France are on the board. 24 min: A few phases for France, just inside the England half. Then Fickou turns on the jets and eats up a good 20 yards down the right. He’s stopped eventually, but England are caught offside. Penalty for France. Before it can be taken, Hughes has picked up an injury and is replaced by Simmonds. Meanwhile Bonneval comes back on for Fickou. Over it goes, just. The perfect direction and distance. What a clatter he gave that. England are in control of the scoreboard, but they’re still four tries short in their quest to keep the 2018 Six Nations alive until the final weekend. 21 min: Slimani drops a scrum, and it’s another penalty for England. This is out on the halfway line, so Daly will have a dig. 20 min: France do their best to mess up another lineout. Having gathered it, Gabrillagues attempts a long pass inside and it’s nearly intercepted by Robshaw. The England man knocks on, but it was a brave attempt, and that was so nearly a very costly mistake by the French. 18 min: France break away from the back of the scrum. Trinh-Duc tries a chip and chase between the sticks. He’s given that far too much wellie, and he’s never getting to it. Out of play it goes. 16 min: England are penalised for failing to release, and France kick for the corner. Can they finally win a lineout? Oui! France set up in the centre of the field, Camara trying to barge his way through. Not quite. Scrum to France, and a good field position. 15 min: Bonneval has taken an innocent whack from May, and he’s forced to go off. Fickou comes on in his stead. 13 min: And then England over-elaborate as they fling a few passes wide right, Farrell’s backflick to Daly failing to come off. Grosso intercepts and suddenly France are tearing up the other end! That’s got the crowd going. A few phases in England territory this time. But Slimani mishandles and England can clear their lines. Better from the home side, though. 12 min: France almost immediately cede possession as they lose another of their own lineouts. The first audible mutterings from the home support; their side haven’t put anything together at all yet. England are bossing it in terms of possession and territory. 11 min: England win a lineout on the French 22. Another chance to probe. The home support has gone pretty quiet already. Some more phases. Farrell very nearly bursts clear down the right channel, but Slimani stops him in his tracks. After eight phases, possession is lost by England as they fail to release. 8 min: More possession for England. Farrell sends a little grubber kick down the right. Bonneval intercepts, with May threatening to gather it. He then flicks a preposterous backwards pass inside, allowing George to snaffle possession again. France are struggling to keep hold of the ball in these opening exchanges. 6 min: May glides in from the right and very nearly scuttles through a huge gap in the middle of the French defence. The gap’s closed just in time. But England are putting a few phases together here, pressing France back to their 22. No bother for England’s stand-in captain. Over it goes. A fast start for the visitors instead, then. 3 min: A scrum collapses in the midfield. Both teams coming in at an angle. The ref awards a penalty to England. Farrell will have a go from 40 yards. 1 min: Tauleigne is sent scampering down the middle. He flings a pass wide left to Grosso, who nearly makes it over for a sensational start for France. But there was a fairly obvious forward pass at the start of the move. The referee was blowing his whistle like billy-o, to no avail. And we’re off! Trinh-Duc gets the game underway with the opening kick of the match. The teams are out! It’s a very aesthetically pleasing scene, France in their bleu, England sporting their white, thousands of tricolores fluttering in the warm Parisian evening sky. A glorious atmosphere at the Stade de France. England belt out God Save... while the home fans give it a blast of La Marseillaise, which is a tune. We’ll be off in a minute or two! Breaking news ... Ireland have just beaten the travelling circus troupe known as Scotland 28-8. That means the Scots haven’t won away to a member of the old Five Nations since 2010. More important, of course, is what the result means for Ireland and England. The Irish can now travel to Twickenham next weekend with grand-slam hope in their hearts. And they might do battle for only the third grand slam in their history without the added pressure of playing for the Six Nations title, because they crossed the line four times at Lansdowne Road today, picking up a bonus point for their efforts ... and unless England match that four-try feat while beating France this evening, the title is Ireland’s tonight. No biggie, then, England! 1. Ireland P4 Pts19 2. England 3-9 3. Scotland 4-8 4. Wales 3-6 5. France 3-6 6. Italy 3-0 France versus England! A famous rivalry best defined perhaps by this ... ... or maybe this ... ... or how about this ... ... or even this nonsense! England go into this afternoon’s big event as favourites, having won their last three Six Nations meetings with France. Eddie Jones’s side are expected to bounce back from their thorough working over at Murrayfield and make it four on the spin against Les Bleus, keeping their championship hopes alive in the process. Owen Farrell will captain the side for the first time, with Dylan Hartley out injured, while Ben Te’o comes in to face down Mathieu Bastareaud. The French have their own reasons to be cheerful, though. Jacques Brunel has lifted the mood in the camp – as reported by your friend and mine, Mr Andy Bull – though sadly there’s no room in the team for the exciting Teddy Thomas, who is still being punished for that boozy night in Edinburgh along with seven other naughty players.

Age: Here today, due tomorrow. Appearance: Like schoolwork, but on the kitchen table. What does it consist of? Three A4 sides of problems, one of French adjectives, pages 23-26 of the workbook and 500 words on the Corn Laws. Oh yeah, I remember that. My dog ate it. You let a dog eat all that paper? No, not really. I just didn’t understand any of it. Perhaps you should have got some help from a parent. I am a parent. In that case, you may be interested in a new study by an educational charity. You’re not going to make me read it, are you? I’ll summarise: the Varkey Foundation found that 66% of British parents believe they spend either enough or too much time helping their children with homework. You can count me in there. In the UK, parents spend an average of 3.6 hours a week helping their children. That’s loads! It’s also less than almost any other country surveyed. In the US, it’s 6.2 hours. In Russia, it’s 7.5, and in India, it’s 12. The global average is 6.7. If I knew anything about statistics, I’m pretty sure I would find that depressing. On a more positive note, the UK ranked among the top countries when it came to parental confidence in the quality of education their children were receiving – well above Japan, Canada and Singapore. Well, that’s something, isn’t it? Sadly, there is little or no correlation between this confidence and education attainment, where the UK ranks well behind those three nations. There must be some European slackers out there who give even less help than we do. Yes. Finnish parents spend just 3.1 hours a week. Stupid Finns. But Finnish children have less homework generally, spend fewer days at school than British children and still manage to get much better results. Can we just skip to the crumb of comfort traditionally offered at the end of one of these? I’m sorry, we’re fresh out today. Do say: “Bring it on, kid. I love the smell of calculus in the evening.” Don’t say: “Well done, darling. Let’s put the French adjectives to one side for the moment, while I move on to the French white.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T14:39:11Z","webTitle":"Marcus Rashford’s double gives Manchester United victory over Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Rashford’s double gives Manchester United victory over Liverpool","bodyText":"As the one Mancunian in José Mourinho’s team, Marcus Rashford will know enough about north-west rivalries to understand why this counts as one of the more pleasing results of Manchester United’s season. It may not make a jot of difference when it comes to the destination of the league title, with Manchester City haughtily observing from a long distance away, but Rashford chose a good day to remind everyone of his penetrative qualities. This was Rashford’s first league start since the turn of the year and, on this evidence, maybe the break has done him good. He has struggled at times this season and his return to form is certainly well-timed from the perspective of Gareth Southgate. The England manager was watching from the Sir Bobby Charlton stand and will have appreciated Rashford’s two diagonal finishes; Southgate’s latest England squad will be announced on Thursday. Of more immediacy is the fact those goals have helped consolidate United’s position in the battle for second place, albeit they remain 13 points behind City. For Liverpool that will be a source of intense frustration when they had so much of the ball in promising positions during the second half and the six minutes of stoppage-time. Jürgen Klopp was entitled to say his team could have saved themselves during that part of the match. Ultimately, though, Liverpool’s problem was that none of their big-hitters reached their usual levels. Mohamed Salah in particular picked a bad day to put in one of his least effective performances and it was unusual to see Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané so subdued. Perhaps that was because of the way United defended so deeply in the second half, protecting themselves against the counterattack. But that was not so relevant in the opening 45 minutes when the home side were clearly buoyed by Rashford’s goals and there was even the sight of Eric Bailly taking the ball around Salah with a little pirouette. The crowd loved Bailly’s impudence and, though Mourinho did not look quite so thrilled with that kind of risk-taking, it was a reflection of the home side’s confidence in that period. It was shortly afterwards when Romelu Lukaku’s long crossfield pass picked out Rashford on the left, the ball was clipped into the penalty area and Juan Mata flashed an overhead kick narrowly wide. Had that one gone in it would have been a goal-of-the-season contender. Unfortunately for Bailly, not everything he tried came off so elegantly. Midway through the second half, the centre-back went to clear Mané’s left-wing delivery and somehow slashed the ball the wrong way to divert it past David de Gea. It was an eccentric own goal, ensuring a blistering and tense finale and, for United, it was a desperate scramble at times to hold on. Their tactics throughout the final exchanges could be encapsulated by Mourinho’s decision to bring on Marouane Fellaini for Rashford. Fellaini blocked and tackled, jumped and harried and got in the way. It was exactly what United needed. Liverpool will think back to the moment 10 minutes into the second half, when Andrew Robertson’s cross struck Antonio Valencia’s hand inside the penalty area only for the referee, Craig Pawson, to give United’s captain the benefit of the doubt. Klopp also mentioned a risky penalty-box challenge from Fellaini on Mané but there was no real explanation as to why it took Liverpool so long to get into their stride. Their nervousness in the first half was unusual when they have scored even more away goals this season than Manchester City. For United, perhaps the only slight downside came in the form of Alexis Sánchez’s continuing difficulties in adjusting to his new team. At one stage he had the chance to set Rashford free but chose the wrong pass to Lukaku and overhit it anyway. A bemused Mourinho turned to his coaching staff and drew back his foot to show how it should have been played. Sánchez had a poor match but that did not matter too greatly when the players around him were rising to the occasion and it did not take long for it to become clear that Rashford could make this a difficult game for Trent Alexander-Arnold. In the 14th minute, Lukaku flicked on De Gea’s goal-kick and Rashford had his first chance to take on Liverpool’s right-back. He eluded him with a clever cut-back, changing direction at speed, and beat Loris Karius with a shot of power and precision. Lukaku was involved again for what turned out to be the decisive goal. This time, Mata had the first chance, running on to the striker’s weighted pass, but Virgil van Dijk came across to turn the ball away. The problem for Liverpool was that Karius was now out of position and the ball was rolling invitingly towards Rashford. Again, he went for the corner he had picked out 10 minutes earlier and the ball flicked off Alexander-Arnold’s heel to deceive Liverpool’s goalkeeper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T14:29:37Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/mar/10/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s that! Old Trafford erupts as United close out a victory earned by the brilliance of Marcus Rashford! That’s a huge result in the battle for second place in this season’s Premier League, as United ease five points clear of their bitter rivals. Their excellent first-half performance - alongside Liverpool’s strange first-half non-performance - settled it in the end. Liverpool, once the sting has of defeat has eased off a bit, will take succour in a much-improved second-half display. But Rashford was the difference. With a little help from Jose Mourinho, of course, who has once again done a number on Liverpool. 90 min +7: Darmian comes on for Sanchez. The United fans celebrate the victory they’re sure is coming. 90 min +6: A couple of corners for Liverpool out on the right. From the second, the ball drops to Salah, 12 yards out, level with the right-hand post. Under pressure from Lingard, he skies the shot! 90 min +4: Mane very nearly bursts clear into the United box down the inside-left channel, but he’s crowded out. From the corner, United clear, and they’re tearing up on the break, four on two! Karius comes miles out of his goal and makes an amazing saving tackle in the middle of his own half! He clears, just as it looked as though United were going to strike the final blow. 90 min +2: The Old Trafford faithful are doing their best to get their team over the line. A wonderful noise within Old Trafford. Lukaku threatens to break clear down the left, chasing after McTominay’s pass. Lovren slides in well this time, putting at stop to the striker’s gallop. 90 min: Salah’s corner is punched clear by de Gea. Milner is forced to hack out of play in the midfield, as three red shirts threaten to overwhelm him on the break. But there’s time for Liverpool to recover the situation: six added minutes! 89 min: Valencia is booked on a very athletic high-kick on Mane, who was attempting to burst down the middle. From the free kick, the ball breaks to Wijnaldum on the edge of the box. His shot is deflected wide right. Corner. 88 min: Lingard comes on for Mata, who milks his applause as he departs slowly, in the professional style. He’s been quietly impressive today, as ever. 86 min: Liverpool are pressing. Smalling goes down. The referee stops play. The visitors clearly think they’re being grifted, and for a second it looks like it’s all going to kick off, Bailly and Lallana chief protagonists. But it all calms down quickly enough. 85 min: Sanchez’s corner doesn’t clear the first man, but no matter because Young earns a free kick out no the left flank anyway. Young’s delivery causes Liverpool to collectively flap, and they give up half a chance to Mata. But the ball’s eventually cleared. 84 min: Fellaini has been immense, in both senses, since coming on. His power and bustle earns a corner down the left. It’s United’s first of the game ... and you know how these things usually go. But before it can be taken, Solanke comes on for Robertson. Liverpool are going for broke now. 82 min: Mane strides towards the United box. He thinks about shooting, but attempts a wall pass off Firmino instead. Mane keeps going. He goes down in the area, shoulder to shoulder with Fellaini. It looks clumsy but fair from Fellaini. To be honest, Mane should have shot first time ... or Firmino should have had a go. 80 min: Wijnaldum, who has never scored away from home in the Premier League, comes on for Alexander-Arnold. Young hooks the free kick into the Liverpool mixer. Fellaini goes up for a header. Karius punches clear, and Fellaini was offside anyway. 79 min: Lovren comes sliding in recklessly twice on Fellaini, who is going nowhere down the left. He gets away with the first one, so the second one, which is punished, is beyond stupidity, giving away a free kick in a dangerous position as it does. Before the set piece can be taken, Klopp is bollocked by the referee for over-emoting on the touchline. 77 min: Lallana has the chance to release Robertson into acres on the overlap down the left, but hesitates. He does win a corner, but United are dealing with these easily enough. 76 min: Firmino is robbed by Lukaku in the midfield. United stream upfield, Sanchez very nearly besting Alexander-Arnold down the left. But he can’t find anyone with his eventual cross. Fellaini tries to recycle things on the other flank, but the move peters out. 74 min: Mane looks for the space to shoot on the edge of the United box. The United defence closes like an iron curtain. He has a smack anyway. The ball very nearly deflects to Salah, but at the moment the only way Liverpool look like getting through this packed defence is with a lucky bounce. 73 min: United haven’t done much in attack of late. Lukaku powers down the right and tries to spin and set up Valencia on the inside, but his cushioned pass doesn’t come off. 72 min: De Gea punches the corner clear. Alexander-Arnold tries to win the ball back on the edge of the box, but is penalised for a high boot on Sanchez. 71 min: Firmino crosses from the left. The ball clacks off Valencia, and here comes Liverpool’s eighth corner of the game. United have yet to earn one, for what that statistic is worth. 69 min: There’s a United sub, but it’s not Bailly going off! The big, brave defender limps back on - he looked in serious pain back there. Instead, Rashford is replaced by Fellaini. The home fans aren’t super-enamoured by the switch, though it’s not open revolt or anything. A smattering of concern. 68 min: Bailly looks to have injured himself. Not sure whether he hurt his ankle in the execution of that absurd turn, but he’s down and doesn’t seem as though he’ll be able to continue. Oh my. This is quite the own goal. Mane nips down the left. He curls hard and low towards the near post. On the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, Bailly tries to clear but swivels and somehow, with his back to goal, backheels powerfully into the bottom left! De Gea gets a hand on it, but can’t keep it out. Game on! 65 min: Salah looks to rip down the right but runs the ball out of play. He waves his arms in the agitated style. Liverpool have come at United hard since the restart, but nothing’s opened up for them. Their frustration is showing. 63 min: Lallana and Salah try to dribble their way into the United box through the centre. That’s just not going to happen. The ball’s laid off for Milner, who looks for the top right from 20 yards. That’s ambitious too, given the time and space he had, and the ball sails serenely over the crossbar. 62 min: A frustrated Oxlade-Chamberlain is replaced by Lallana. 61 min: Liverpool are probing a lot, but nothing’s happening for them in the final third. United are holding their shape like granite. 59 min: Smalling uncompromisingly shoves Salah off the pitch. Salah wants the foul but he’s not getting it. Liverpool have come at United since the restart, but the home side aren’t yielding an inch. 58 min: Of the six goals United have conceded here all season, only one has been in the second half! Step forward Nicolas Otamendi. Liverpool have quite the task here. 56 min: Mane turns on the jets and dribbles with power down the inside-left channel. He flicks inside for Salah on the penalty spot, but once again, just as it looks like United are in trouble, Young turns up to deal with the situation. He’s been immense today. 55 min: Liverpool have started the half very well, as a team in their position had to. Robertson crosses from the left. The ball hits Valencia’s left arm. He’s got enough time to pull it away; you’ve seen those given as well. Gary Neville on Sky calls both of them in favour of Liverpool. Unfortunately for the visitors, the United legend isn’t reffing this game. 53 min: Mane goes tearing at the United back four, keeping them on the back foot. He’s got Salah on his right, but can’t find him with the pass. He arches his back in frustration and screams at the sky. He’s soon having another go, shooting from the left of the D, but de Gea has that one covered. 51 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a whack from distance. His effort is low and wide left. But it’s deflected, and that’s a corner. From the set piece, de Gea comes out to punch. Lovren gives McTominay an accidental clack on the back of the neck. And that’s a stoppage for a head injury, relieving the pressure on United. Liverpool are a bit miffed about it, though it’s very hard to see what option the referee had. 49 min: Firmino scoops a ball over the United back line. Salah breaks into the box and very nearly gets the ball under control, but Young is grappling with him, operating on the very edges of legality. The referee waves play on, and Young gets away with it. But you’ve seen those given. 48 min: Alexander-Arnold gets the better of Rashford for once, and his work down the right earns a corner for Liverpool. Van Dijk again wins a header, on the edge of the six-yard box, level with the left-hand post. But he can only flop an effort onto the top of the netting, the ball having sailed harmlessly over the bar. 47 min: Liverpool enjoy some early possession but it’s all in the middle third. Salah tries to get something going with a right-to-left crossfield pass but Robertson can’t gather it. And we’re off again! Liverpool get the ball rolling for the second half. And here’s the size of their task: Manchester United have never lost a game in the Premier League era from two goals up at home. Nothing in that first half suggests that record is going to change any time soon. Shameless half-time plug: United and Liverpool weren’t too shabby back in the old First Division days. For some of that hot Tom Watson, Ernest Mangnall, David Ashworth, Matt McQueen, Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish championship-winning action, you could do worse than The Title: The Story of the First Division. (The best bits are about Burnley, mind.) Liverpool have had plenty of the ball. But David de Gea hasn’t had a serious save to make. Marcus Rashford, with a little help from Romelu Lukaku, has been the difference. The home side look calm and comfortable after executing their gameplan clinically ... as well as playing with no little sass. Liverpool have a lot of problems to solve. As things stand, United will open a five-point gap on their old rivals in the chase for second spot. 45 min: There will be two added minutes of a very enjoyable half for Manchester United. 44 min: Liverpool are desperately looking for a goal before half-time to alter the mood. Firmino and Robertson combine down the left to earn a corner, but from the set piece, Lovren can’t get his header at the near post on target. 43 min: Mane slips a pass down the left for Robertson, who is in acres. He fires a low cross towards the far post. Salah is there, hoping to sidefoot home, but again Young’s antenna comes to the rescue for United. He clears and some very serious danger is gone. 41 min: From the resulting throw, Rashford comes sliding in, studs up, on Firmino. He’s lucky there’s no contact, having already been booked. A two-goal, two-yellow-card double whammy would be something to behold. 40 min: Salah has hardly had a touch. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Firmino try to get the ball out to him with some honest graft down the right, but Young covers well and isn’t to be beaten. 38 min: Valencia, out on the right, sends a beautiful crossfield pass to Sanchez on the left. Sanchez loops into the area, where the entire Liverpool defence have gone AWOL. Mata, who likes a bicycle kick against Liverpool, attempts to flash another into the right-hand side of the net. It’s inches wide of the post. Inches away from game, set and match. 37 min: But this is far from over if Liverpool get the next goal. Oxlade-Chamberlain has an opportunity to slip Mane into the United box down the inside-left channel. He’s got a big window, but the pass doesn’t pass muster, or the nearest United defender. On the touchline, Klopp offers an immediate critique in bullet-point form. 36 min: Bailly spins past Salah with a gloriously elaborate dragback. The skill gets almost as big a cheer as the goal. 35 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain is stripped of the ball by McTominay. He responds by dragging the United midfielder to the ground, and is rightly booked. 33 min: Mourinho leans over United’s red-brick dugout looking very pleased with life. Klopp has the funk on. Thing is, his side haven’t even been that bad, even if you conside the imperfect defending. They’ve been knocking it around nicely. They’ve just been undone by two moments of direct brilliance. Also: United know how to win here. 31 min: Firmino tries to halve the deficit by sending a low fizzer goalwards from 25 yards. Again, it’s a decent enough crack, but straight at de Gea, who isn’t letting anything like that in. 30 min: Lukaku and Sanchez combine with purpose down the right. They very nearly open Liverpool up, but Alexander-Arnold comes across to whack clear. The visitors can’t afford to concede again. United have only conceded six goals at home all season! Meanwhile here’s Adam Hirst: “You spend all that money on a world-class attacking midfielder and a world-class wide forward, yet the solution was there already, right under your nose.” 29 min: Alexander-Arnold has a crack from the right-hand corner of the United box. It’s decent enough, but no better, and De Gea flops on the shot near his right-hand post without much drama. 28 min: Rashford is booked for an over-eager slide on Milner. He can have no complaints. Liverpool work the free kick and earn themselves a corner. It’s their fourth of the match. Nothing comes of this one, either. 26 min: Questions about Lovren, who has lost two very decisive headers against Lukaku for both goals. But there’s no time for that right now, as Firmino busies himself down the right and tears off into space. His low cross is hacked out by Smalling for a corner, but van Dijk gets nowhere near this one. Liverpool may be grateful that it didn’t result in a goal kick. given whats happened so far. It’s almost a carbon copy! De Gea takes a long goal kick. Lukaku helps it on. Mata tries to latch onto the ball on the edge of the box. Van Dijk - who should have made it 1-1 - only half clears and the ball breaks to Rashford on the left. One touch, bang, and the ball’s into the bottom right corner! 23 min: Mane sashays into space from the left, then lays off for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who slides one down the channel for Firmino. For a second, it looks like Firmino will get ahead of Smalling, but the United defender knocks out for a corner. From the set piece, van Dijk stoops at the near post, nipping in ahead of Matic, and surely must score from close range. But the ball clanks off his shoulder and out of play on the left. 21 min: Milner and Mane battle down the right, winning a couple of block tackles against Matic and Rashford. The ball breaks to Milner, who skelps a first-time cross low through the United box. There’s nobody in the middle to take advantage. 19 min: Rashford again seriously worries Alexander-Arnold on the United left. He cuts into the box again. Roberson comes across from the other flank to blooter clear. United sense there could be more action for them down this flank. It could be a long afternoon for young Alexander-Arnold. 18 min: Lukaku eyebrows the free kick away from danger. It’s going out for a corner ... but Firmino gathers on the left, then loops towards the far post. De Gea is all over the place, but the cross is too high for Mane by the right-hand post. Goal kick. 17 min: Mane goes on a dribble down the right. Bailly rather clumsily bundles him over from behind. A chance for Liverpool to load the United box. Milner stands over it. 16 min: Poor positioning by Alexander-Arnold for the goal. Rashford had given him warning earlier, too. But what a finish. Liverpool might not want to consider that United have won all 16 matches in which they’ve scored first this season. What a goal this is! De Gea takes the goal kick. Lukaku flicks on down the left. Rashford gets ahead of a dozing Alexander-Arnold, and enters the box. He drops a shoulder to the right, diddling the young full back. And then curls a powerful shot into the bottom right! Magnificent! Karius had no chance! 13 min: De Gea and Smalling confuse each other as Salah chases a ball down the right. Smalling takes control eventually and hacks out for a needless corner; that should have been the keeper’s ball. Salah takes the corner himself, and hoicks a dreadful one high over the box and out of play for a goal kick on the other side. 12 min: Matic sends Lukaku into a bit of space down the right. Lukaku should break into the box and cause Liverpool some trouble, but Robertson is over quickly to snatch the ball away and clear. That’s good defending. But United are beginning to grow into this game after a slow start. 10 min: Young launches a long pass down the left for Rashford. Alexander-Arnold manages to usher the ball out for a goal kick, but he only had inches to play with in the end. If the pitch was another yard long, Rashford was nipping round him and along the byline. This could be a defining tussle between two young English stars. 9 min: United enjoy their first extended period of possession. Sanchez has a couple of semi-threatening dribbles down the left, but nothing quite comes off. Liverpool respond with a long hoof upfield, but Mane can’t get on the end of it. All quite hectic at the moment, pretty much as expected. 7 min: It’s a midfield tussle right now, with calm passing at a premium. The crowd is the star at the moment; a glorious derby atmosphere at Old Trafford. 5 min: Can goes on a bustling run down the middle. He overruns the ball though still manages to hoick it away from Valencia. However he catches the United man on the follow through. A foul and an excuse for the pair to tell each other to eff off. The ref tells everyone to simmer down, which to be fair they do quickly enough. 4 min: Liverpool are enjoying more of the ball in these early exchanges. Mane slips a pass down the right for Milner, who whips low towards the near post. Oxlade-Chamberlain wants a sniff but McTominay isn’t having it. 2 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back awhile. Van Dijk gives Karius quite the hot backpass to deal with. The crowd tease the keeper as the ball fizzes towards him, but he deals with it easily enough. And we’re off! It’s a crisp, clear day in Manchester. United get the ball rolling. Liverpool will be kicking towards the Stretford End in the second half. A bit of head tennis to start. Old Trafford is bouncing! The teams are out! It’s Manchester United versus Liverpool at Old Trafford, so the atmosphere can be taken as read. As home heroes, United have the right to wear their famous red shirts, forcing Liverpool into their second-choice white-and-green quarters. Klopp gives each of the United players a half-smile as they troop out of the tunnel; most keep their steely gamefaces on and stare the other way, but Mata can’t stop himself giving a polite glance and a micro-nod. He’s one of the game’s gents, isn’t he. Klopp and Mourinho give each other a sporting tap on the back, too. All very nice. Anyway, photos are taken, hands are shaken, and we’ll be off before you know it! And now Jurgen Klopp, slightly more hyper but smiling nonetheless, has his say: “It’s always the same. You always have to bring through your own skills but you have to respect the quality of your opponent as well. We cannot be blind and go into the game and say come on, let’s play football and enjoy the game ... it will be hard work, United is a group of unbelievably strong players. Mata is on the pitch, and he can change the game completely. Rashford’s speed on the wing changes the game a little bit. Lukaku is always a threat. We have to be really strong with and without the ball. I have tried to find a good set-up for this game, a good mixture.” A relaxed-looking Jose Mourinho speaks to Sky Sports! “Juan Mata offers experience, and has the capacity to move into areas where he can connect our game, because he is very intelligent. Liverpool are a very strong team in fast counter attack, in transition, so the more times we lose the ball, the more chances they have for that transition. If we are more consistent, we try to reduce the possibility of their super-dangerous counter-attack. So let’s see if Mata can help us! They are not the kind of team to sit in a low block waiting for us. Is this aggressive defence? I don’t know. The objective is to be in front of them at the end of the season, not today. We want to win the game. Paul Pogba is injured, yesterday in training. He was in an unlucky situation. I really don’t know when he is back.” The big news for Manchester United: there’s no Paul Pogba. Their record signing is out injured, with Juan Mata, who has given Liverpool no little grief in the past, taking his place as midfield schemer. There are two other changes to the XI named at Crystal Palace on Monday: Eric Bailly replaces Victor Lindelof at the back, while Marcus Rashford comes in at the expense of Jesse Lingard. Liverpool make five changes to the team that drew with Porto in midweek. Captain Jordan Henderson isn’t risked after suffering a dead leg during the closing stages of that particular non-event; he’s on the bench with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain taking his place. Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold are restored to the defence, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez dropping to the bench while Alberto Moreno misses out altogether. And Mo Salah returns, Adam Lallana also just one of the subs today. Manchester United: de Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Bailly, Young, McTominay, Matic, Mata, Rashford, Lukaku, Sanchez. Subs: Lindelof, Lingard, Carrick, Romero, Shaw, Fellaini, Darmian. Liverpool: Karius, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Milner, Can, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Wijnaldum, Gomez, Henderson, Lallana, Mignolet, Solanke, Matip. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire). This will be the 200th meeting of these grand old clubs. Manchester United are well out in front in terms of victories: 79 to 65. The first match, for the record, was a Test Match play-off in April 1894 between Second Division champions Liverpool and First Division stragglers Newton Heath. Liverpool won the game, played on neutral territory at Ewood Park in Blackburn, 2-0, and with it a place in the following season’s top flight at the Manchester club’s expense. Patrick Gordon and Harry Bradshaw scored the first-half goals that did for the Heathens; the second half was a bit of a non-event, according to this paper, the play being “moderate” because the players were “suffering from excitement”. What price similarly modest, highly strung play today? The more things change, etc. Here’s something for fans of Manchester United and Liverpool to consider! The last four games between these two famous old clubs have ended 1-1, 0-0, 1-1 and 0-0. Well, at least nobody went home upset. But have a gander back in the day. In the 1895/96 season, Liverpool beat Newton Heath 7-1 at Anfield, then went down 5-2 at Bank Street. In 1907/08, the newly christened United won 4-0 at home, but lost 7-4 at Anfield. In 1927/28, Liverpool gave their fans some very happy holidays with a 2-0 home victory on Christmas Eve, but paid for it with a 6-1 thumping at Old Trafford the following May. So what’s better? A season of dizzying highs followed by headache-inducing lows? Or this? Actually, don’t answer that, we’d be here all day, and no good can come of it anyway. But the modern trend is not all that. We could do with something to remember! Does either side have it in them to break the recent run of dull draws, and register a resounding victory for the ages?! Well ... maybe. United go into this game buoyed by their scintillating comeback at Crystal Palace on Monday night. Their critics argue that their football might not have been the best this season ... but this judgement is surely only by Manchester United Standards. They’re second in the league, still in the FA Cup, and a match away from the quarters of the European Cup, for goodness sake. They’ve scored 83 goals along the way! Anyway, even if they have slightly misfired at times, that Nemanja Matic thriker at Selhurst Park may well have cleared a few creative pipes. Liverpool watch out! But Liverpool are in a good place too. They’re nearly always effervescent in attack: it’s 105 goals to date this term. They’ve just made it to the quarters of the Champions League for the first time in nearly a decade. And another top-four place in the Premier League is within reach if they can just keep their form going; they’ve won eight of their last ten matches in the division, dropping points only to Spurs and 2018 sensations Swansea. They’ve conceded just one goal in the last five games, as well, a positively Houllieresque run. United watch out! Two teams in fine fettle, then. Another draw is possibly the most sensible shout, truth be told. Or perhaps United’s recent form at Old Trafford in this fixture will prevail: they’ve not lost since 2014, having tucked comfy 3-0 and 3-1 victories under their belts during that period. Liverpool meanwhile will take succour from the Europa League draw a couple of years ago, a moral victory since they won the tie overall. Whatever, a 7-1, 7-4 or 6-1 to either side is probably not on the cards, if we’re being honest with ourselves. But if that does happen, let’s all play together nicely, love is all you need. And remember history proves salvation is usually around the corner. Even if you have to go back a couple of centuries for much of the evidence. It’s Manchester United! Versus Liverpool! It’s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/09/teenager-faces-jail-over-acid-attacks-on-london-moped-riders","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T14:48:51Z","webTitle":"Teenager faces jail over acid attacks on London moped riders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/teenager-faces-jail-over-acid-attacks-on-london-moped-riders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/09/teenager-faces-jail-over-acid-attacks-on-london-moped-riders","fields":{"headline":"Teenager faces jail over acid attacks on London moped riders","bodyText":"A teenager who threw acid at moped riders in attempts to steal their vehicles has been told by a judge to expect a lengthy jail sentence. Derryck John threw corrosive liquid at six drivers in north and east London in the space of just over an hour on 13 July, causing one victim “life-changing” injuries, Wood Green crown court heard. John, 17, admitted six counts of throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to “disable, burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm”, two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery. The judge, Noel Lucas QC, adjourned sentencing and said: “The starting point for one of these offences is 12 years, but when I am dealing with six offences involving acid coupled with robberies it has to be more.” John’s mother and brother held their heads in their hands as they sat in the public gallery. The judge previously lifted reporting restrictions, allowing John to be identified. Jabed Hussain, 32, was the first person to be targeted, at the Hackney Road junction with Queensbridge Road at about 10.30pm. He screamed for help as the liquid singed his skin after his moped was taken. Footage shows him being doused with water by police to wash the acid out of his eyes. The acid used had PH levels of one and two, the strongest available, the court was told. A third count of robbery will be taken into account when John is sentenced on Monday. In a separate case, two moped muggers caught on CCTV robbing a mother of her £25,000 Rolex watch at knifepoint in west London were jailed on Thursday. Thomas McDermott, 24, and George Fitzgerald, 17, raced through the streets of Chelsea looking for wealthy targets before jumping off their bikes and attacking Heather Mitchell. CCTV played to Southwark crown court showed Mitchell’s children watching in horror as their mother was dragged along the ground. The thieves had robbed a businessman of another Rolex days earlier. McDermott was on bail at the time after stealing seven motorbikes and mopeds worth tens of thousands of pounds with 20-year-old Hisham Tawfik. All three pleaded guilty to various charges. McDermott was jailed for 12 and a half years and Fitzgerald was ordered to spend up for five years in a youth detention centre. Tawfik was jailed for three years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/16/best-crime-novels-review-louise-candlish-andrew-taylor-christine-mangan-melba-escobar-ragnar-jonasso","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/16/best-crime-novels-review-louise-candlish-andrew-taylor-christine-mangan-melba-escobar-ragnar-jonasso","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/16/best-crime-novels-review-louise-candlish-andrew-taylor-christine-mangan-melba-escobar-ragnar-jonasso","fields":{"headline":"The best recent crime novels – review roundup","bodyText":"Given the current preoccupation with housing, the property-porn thriller looks set to become a staple of crime fiction, and Our House by Louise Candlish (Simon &amp; Schuster, £12.99) is an excellent example of this burgeoning subgenre. Fiona Lawson arrives home to find a family busy moving into the desirable south London residence she shares with estranged husband, Bram, and their two children – but they hadn’t made plans to sell and, as far as she’s aware, the place wasn’t on the market. The new owners insist they bought the house fair and square, and Bram has disappeared. As Fiona tries to work out what has happened, it becomes clear that her hard-drinking, sexually incontinent husband’s folly has had appalling consequences, which have been unintentionally compounded by her own plans for conscious uncoupling. Husband and wife pass the narrative baton between them in this masterfully plotted, compulsive page-turner. Property, or the smoke-blackened ruins thereof, is also at the heart of Andrew Taylor’s latest novel. A sequel to The Ashes of London, his magnificent evocation of the Great Fire of 1666, The Fire Court (HarperCollins, £14.99) takes place the following year and continues the stories of James Marwood and Cat Lovett. The city is being rebuilt, with the eponymous fire court settling individual disputes over who should pay for what. Marwood’s elderly father, Nathaniel, claims to have seen the body of a woman at Clifford’s Inn, where the court sits. This is chalked up to senility, but after Nathaniel is run over and killed by a wagon, James discovers a bloodstained list of names among his personal effects and begins to wonder if the old man was telling the truth. His investigation brings him back into contact with tough-minded Cat – now living under an assumed name – and he turns to her for help. With a fast-moving, complex plot underpinned by solid but unobtrusive research and plenty of drama and intrigue, Taylor brings the 17th century to life so vividly that one can almost smell it. The amoral, manipulative presence of Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley hovers over Tangerine (Little, Brown, £13.99), Christine Mangan’s tale of expats behaving badly in Morocco (set to be a film starring Scarlett Johansson). It’s 1956, and Alice and her husband, John, have moved to Tangier. Sweltering in her European clothes, Alice soon becomes too scared of the teeming, dusty streets to venture from their flat, and John, who has married her for her inheritance, leaves her to stew while he embraces all the city has to offer. Emotionally fragile, Alice is badly in need of support, but the unannounced arrival of her former best friend worsens matters. The women haven’t been in contact since a terrible accident at the exclusive American college they both attended, where the devious scholarship girl Lucy, whose backstory contains some disturbing inconsistencies, formed a dangerous obsession with her rich roommate. Lucy takes to Tangier like a duck to water and, introducing herself as Alice, befriends a local conman. Then John disappears … Narrated in alternating chapters by Alice and Lucy, this is an assured and atmospheric debut. Set in Bogotá, House of Beauty by Colombian author Melba Escobar (translated by Elizabeth Bryer, 4th Estate, £12.99) is both a mystery novel and a critique of a corrupt and macho culture. Impecunious Karen moves to the capital to work in a beauty salon in the exclusive Zona Rosa district. The cubicle where she tweezes, epilates and massages is a confessional where her clients reveal their secrets. One of these is teenager Sabrina Guzmán, who visits Karen for a full Brazilian before losing her virginity (to “the same boyfriend who had wanted to sleep with her on two previous occasions but hadn’t done the honours because, in Sabrina’s words, she wasn’t as smooth as an apple”), and who is later found dead. But in a country where the legal system is underfunded and overloaded, and rich people can get away with murder, there’s little chance of justice. The pace may prove too slow for those in search of a warp-speed thriller with a corkscrew plot, but for everyone else, this delicate, merciless filleting of race and gender politics is highly recommended. Detective Inspector Hulda Hermannsdóttir, protagonist of Ragnar Jónasson’s The Darkness (translated by Victoria Cribb, Michael Joseph, £12.99), also has to contend with gender politics. Dogged but prickly, and never having been “one of the boys” in any sense, she finds herself forced into early retirement. Her male superior throws her a bone – the opportunity to investigate a cold case of her choice to keep her occupied in the fortnight before she hands in her badge. The death of Russian asylum seeker Elena, ruled as accidental after a cursory investigation, seems the obvious choice, and Hulda – who faces a lonely future and is struggling to come to terms with personal tragedy – soon digs up new information that points to murder. Expertly plotted, with an ending that’s a true shocker, The Darkness is the first book in a trilogy featuring this engaging investigator, which is good news. • Laura Wilson’s latest novel is The Other Woman (Quercus).

For example, I’ve always liked Paul Merson as a pundit despite the fact he might not be the most knowledgable or the most coherent and may sometimes appear not to have realised he’s on television at all, to have just found himself talking for a really long time with smartly dressed people about Arsène Wenger while, for reasons that escape him, sitting in a brightly lit room behind a cardboard desk. The moment I first realised I was going along with pretty much whatever Merse said was the aftermath of Michael Owen’s goal against Argentina at France 98. Never mind the finish or the way the pre-injury Owen is able to move his feet at a strange, scurrying triple-speed, operating within his own distinct bubble of time and space. The best bit of that goal is the way the TV feed cuts to the touchline just as Owen runs off to celebrate, capturing Merson out on the pitch jumping up and down, turning to the rest of the England bench with a huge gaping grin on his face yelling: “What a farkin’ goal!” The other subs are all out there looking generically pleased. Further along Glenn Hoddle is already doing the classic temple-tapping think-about-it gesture. Only Merse looks completely lost in the moment, utterly consumed by the spectacle of a goal that arguably gave him greater joy than it did Owen himself. As a pundit Merson’s range of response is essentially the same, variations on this scale, with the same ability to identify and communicate a basic joy in his sport. He was right too. For all the white noise about dashed hopes and geopolitical rivalries, all that really remains now of that painstakingly constructed moment is the thrill, the indivisible truth of what a farkin’ goal. The reason for going on about this at such length here is my own slightly unusual experience over the last six days spent watching six of the top 12 richest football clubs in the world, and by extension ever, play in the flesh. In a frustrating twist it turns out I don’t have anything profound, or indeed particularly interesting to share about this experience, as regular readers will no doubt already be aware. But one thing has stood out from City and Chelsea, PSG and Real to the gripping end notes of Spurs and Juventus on Wednesday night. Everybody knows there is a loss of scale around these institutions now. Our super-clubs have become features of the corporate landscape, no longer human-shaped, hard to grasp in outline. At this level of football even the word “player” can seem like a hangover from some more frivolous age. Probably it should be replaced now with something more apt, like human sport unit or elite level ball-tactic cog. And yet whatever we throw at it, no matter how we blind it with greed or dilute its competitive edges, football retains its power, remains an utterly addictive, engaging, consoling source of human interest. Again this comes back to that basic pleasure principle. The game does work best, indeed only really works at all, when we get a sense of play and of joy. Not that this is news in itself. We know this about the best footballers, just as again the really striking thing about Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo on Tuesday night was the sense of pleasure. Ronaldo is often portrayed as a kind of android-warrior, a muscle dummy filled with hair-gel and topped with a sneering robot head-thump engine. But this is of course to deny the basic beauty of his story, the skinny kid from Madeira who just loved kicking a ball and now in his mature splendour communicates that same enduring pleasure. In Paris Ronaldo spent the opening minutes of an epically serious football match wheeling out his zingiest flicks and twirls, enjoying the ping of the ball, a sense of basic enjoyment that also made victory feel somehow inevitable. I hadn’t meant to spend so long going on about star players, but then they do tend to hog the stage. The point of this ramble about pleasure was to linger on the other aspect, indeed the basic point of all team sport. This is, of course, team play, human chemistry, the joy of seeing even a collection of hastily assembled stars blend into the human poetry of a functioning team. With this in mind the most captivating spectacle of the week came at Wembley where Juventus produced a show of genuinely stirring collectivism. At the final whistle at Wembley one travelling Italian of pensionable age could be seen haring up and down the aisle waving his fists and yodelling with pure pleasure at this effort of shared will. And he was right. It was utterly absorbing, just as this kind of fine-margins performance, a 0-1 wrestled back into a 2-1, is probably more rare now. Football will continue to have stars. If anything is in danger of being lost it is this other form of pleasure. The wider unhappiness at a flaccid performance by the stars of Paris Saint-Germain; the howling at Arsenal’s periodic collapses: there is something profound at the root of this, a basic dismay at seeing such shared dysfunction. The joy of sport has always lain in the idea of a miniature society, a harmony that takes us beyond even what a farkin’ goal into deeper levels of play and pleasure; and a joy that will, while it remains, keep us coming back for more whatever the surrounding noise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/09/ireland-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T13:16:13Z","webTitle":"Ireland prepare for Scotland and chance to secure the Six Nations a week early","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/09/ireland-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/09/ireland-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-preview","fields":{"headline":"Ireland prepare for Scotland and chance to secure the Six Nations a week early","bodyText":"It could be over by Saturday evening. Ireland, indeed, could all but slam the door on anyone else’s chances of the title by mid-afternoon. If they beat Scotland with a bonus point, England will have to win with a bonus point in rain-lashed Paris just to retain a mathematical interest. For context, rain-lashed Paris is where Ireland themselves could only squeeze home tryless in round one, courtesy of one of the more remarkable drop goals in championship history. Since then, they have built steadily, unveiling something new with each round, so that they now stand on the edge of supremacy. Their two most formidable challenges await, but if Ireland deal with the first with sufficient authority, only the small matter of a third grand slam in their history will trouble them come the final round. Scotland, visitors to Dublin on Saturday, have their own ambitions to sate. They remain in the hunt for the title themselves, but they will have to find the emotional maturity to follow up the euphoria of the win over England with a rarity. The last time they won a championship away day elsewhere than Rome was in Dublin, as it happens, in 2010 – albeit on the other side of the Liffey at Croke Park. It is not only the English and Scottish hoping against hope for a repeat. A Scotland victory would transform at a stroke the now-customary “Super Saturday” of the final round into something approaching a sequence worthy of the name. Either way, Scotland’s most recent triumph at Murrayfield has elevated this fixture as the game of the round for the connoisseur. It is No 3 playing No 5 in world-rankings terms, but the shifting dynamics in the form and fortunes of these two are every bit as compelling. Scotland are confident enough to resist the recall of a handful of fit-again players who might have been deemed indispensable not so long ago. Alex Dunbar and Richie Gray do not even make the 23, while Fraser Brown and WP Nel are held to bench duty. The only change is to introduce the 21-year-old Blair Kinghorn on the right wing for the injured Tommy Seymour. Kinghorn is a rangy full-back for whom great things are hoped. The front row has been identified as their crisis area this championship, such has been the injury list in that department, but the form of Simon Berghan and Stuart McInally in particular has been so impressive they remain in situ. That said, they are likely to be exposed to their most intense test yet in Dublin. Tadhg Furlong returns after just the one match out to bolster an Irish front row that has looked the pick of the championship so far. No doubt Scotland will be aiming wider as they search for Irish weaknesses. It is scarcely a secret they are most dangerous when sending Huw Jones and Stuart Hogg on their sallies through the outside-centre channel, where Ireland happen to be suffering a mini-crisis of their own, with Robbie Henshaw, Chris Farrell and Jared Payne hors de combat. So they have rushed back Garry Ringrose. Joe Schmidt was questioned at the team announcement on Ringrose’s fitness. He spoke more in hope than expectation, Ringrose having played just the one game for Leinster since his return from an ankle injury suffered in January and only six this season overall. Both team’s campaigns have been similar, unconvincing away days in the opening round (or mortifying in Scotland’s case) followed by layer upon layer of improvement as they have retrenched at their respective homes. Ireland might be perceived as further along their curve, having yet to suffer the indignity of defeat. Indeed, the manner in which they avoided it in Paris might almost be submitted as exhibit A of their case to be rated a champion team. Since that remarkable display of nerve and skill, the fixture list has allowed them to develop an attacking dimension to their game that was singularly lacking in Paris with two home games of escalating difficulty. If there is a department they have yet to convince in, it is defence, conceding three tries in each of those home fixtures. Questionable defence is not a failing to take lightly against this Scotland team, but it would not surprise if they chose this third consecutive home fixture to add that dimension to their game. Keep showing the attacking verve, and Ireland could well have the title sewn up a round early."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T16:39:01Z","webTitle":"Meet Donald Trump’s twin: Benjamin Netanyahu | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Meet Donald Trump’s twin: Benjamin Netanyahu","bodyText":"Each day brings a scandalous new revelation as investigators probe deep into the affairs of the leader and his inner circle. The inquiries range across multiple fronts, tangling politics and business and involving both the top man’s closest aides and his immediate family. On a really big news day, the investigative authorities announce they’ve arranged a plea bargain with one of the key players, coaxing them to turn state’s witness against the man they once served so loyally. In response, the leader resorts to social media to denounce his tormentors, claiming a witch-hunt by once-trusted institutions – the media and the courts, even the attorney general he himself appointed – and casting himself as the victim of a liberal establishment that hates him and his supporters. To his opponents’ despair, the ploy seems to work. The base stays with him. Despite everything, his poll numbers hold firm. But still, day after day, the legal net tightens. If that fairly sums up the situation of Donald Trump, it also works for the man the US president greeted so warmly in the Oval Office this week: his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu. The two posed for pictures in matching dark suits and blue ties, flanked by their wives who also seemed to be colour-coordinated. Bibi and the Donald: they could almost be twins. I’ve spent a week in Israel and the West Bank, speaking to politicians, diplomats and decades-long observers of Netanyahu, and the parallels are starting to look uncanny. While special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Russia affair has expanded into a wider exploration of Trumpworld, so Israel’s prime minister faces a police inquiry into no fewer than four separate allegations of serious corruption, each one helpfully numbered. Case 1000 centres on allegations of old-fashioned bribery: gifts of cigars, champagne and the like to Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, from a pair of billionaire businessmen who, the PM admits, he helped out, including on “tax issues”. Case 2000 alleges that Netanyahu sought to cook up a deal by which he would use the law to hurt one newspaper in order to boost the economic fortunes of its rival, in return for warm coverage from the latter. Case 4000 is similar, an offer to a media tycoon to ensure state policy favourable to his telecoms company, in return for positive coverage of Netanyahu from a news website owned by the magnate. What could prove most serious is Case 3000, which accuses some of Netanyahu’s most trusted consiglieri of fraudulently profiting from Israel’s purchase of submarines from a German company. (The PM is not yet officially a suspect in the submarine affair, but as Aluf Benn, editor of the liberal daily Ha’aretz, told me, this threatens Netanyahu most because it touches on the military and national security – areas Israelis regard as “sacred”.) For most politicians, a war on so many fronts would be overwhelming. And the Israeli press has indeed started to speak of the prime minister in a kind of conditional past tense, assessing the speeches he made this week in Washington as his last “before he embarks on the next phase of his career: as a defendant”. But such obituaries might just be premature. Those poll numbers, which still show his Likud party on top, are the least of it. Even his most bitter critics admit that Netanyahu dominates the political landscape, dwarfing all his rivals both inside and outside his party. In the PM’s chair for nine years, and having held that post for three years in the 1990s, he is the country’s longest-serving leader since its founder, David Ben-Gurion. Israelis now struggle to picture anyone else in the role. While outsiders see a terrible stasis, if not paralysis, with the occupation now in its 52nd year and the conflict with the Palestinians as far away from resolution as ever, most Israelis see stability, relative prosperity and, above all, quiet. Military funerals have become a rarity; people board Tel Aviv buses or sit in Jerusalem cafes without first calculating the odds of a suicide bombing. For this, they credit – even grudgingly and without affection – the man who offers himself as Mr Security. He also benefits from the fact that so many of the scandals’ juiciest details relate not to him but his wife. Stories of her taste for luxury or her screaming fits as she demands more flattering treatment in the papers have turned her into a Marie-Antoinette-meets-Lady-Macbeth villain, a rod for lightning that would otherwise strike her husband. But it’s his Trumpian qualities that are most striking. Trump was born into serious money, while Bibi was educated in a series of prestige institutions. Yet both pose as the plucky champion of the excluded, persecuted by the same permanent, snooty elite that has kept the little guy down for so long. “We are being attacked all the time, every minute and every hour,” Netanyahu complained on Thursday. “Listen to Israeli citizens who support us and who want justice.” Both men rely on those most powerful fuels: fear and hate. While Trump regularly points an accusing finger at African Americans, whether athletes or war widows, Netanyahu knows how to play on Jewish Israeli fears of Palestinians, and not just those in the West Bank and Gaza but those who are fellow citizens living inside pre-1967 Israel. They have not forgotten how he won the 2015 election, by issuing a last-minute alert to his base that Arab voters were flocking to the polls “in droves”. In 2016, he hinted that a series of devastating forest fires in the north could be the handiwork of “elements with great hostility towards Israel”: code for Arabs. Above all, what Trump and Bibi share is a toxic combination of selfishness and shamelessness. Trump thinks nothing of taking to Twitter to slam the FBI or the justice department, even if that means breaking Americans’ trust in vital institutions. All that matters is his own immediate self-interest. Netanyahu prefers posting videos on Facebook to tweeting, but the targets – and the effects – are the same. It’s no good pointing out that Netanyahu helped dislodge his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, a decade ago by solemnly declaring that a prime minister under suspicion of corruption could not make vital decisions of state. Just as it’s futile reminding Trump of his “lock her up” claims against Hillary Clinton. Both are brazenly incapable of embarrassment. They are without shame. The big difference is in their countries’ systems. Ultimately, the only real recourse against Trump is political, by bringing impeachment proceedings in Congress. But in Israel, as the attorney general clarified this week, the law – enforced by institutions doing their jobs, in the face of intense political pressure – demands that an indicted prime minister leave office, no matter how strong his political position. With that in mind, and given the state of the polls, Netanyahu’s most likely move is to call early elections. He might then gain a boost from the country’s 70th anniversary celebrations in May, and if he wins, argue that the public renewed his mandate despite the various charges against him – thereby allowing him to continue in office even while defending himself in court. It would be an act of outrageous nerve, but you can see him pulling it off – with Trump himself watching in awed admiration. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/10/tom-bourlet-spaghetti-traveller","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T06:30:06Z","webTitle":"‘I live a life of austerity so I can travel all the time’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/10/tom-bourlet-spaghetti-traveller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/10/tom-bourlet-spaghetti-traveller","fields":{"headline":"‘I live a life of austerity so I can travel all the time’","bodyText":"I’ve always been a saver. As a student I lived frugally and was constantly setting up little businesses such as a moving-in service for freshers so that I could graduate in profit. My favourite gourmet experience has always been Heinz spaghetti hoops. Now, despite earning a decent salary, I lead a life of austerity as all my spare time and money are consumed by my travel blog Spaghetti Traveller, named for that spaghetti hoops passion. I started it six years ago while working for a travel agent and back then thought it would be cool to eat a can of hoops in every new place I visited. It would have been an economical way to eat out, but I kept forgetting to pack a supply. My job back then was to optimise the website so I thought it would give me useful experience to try building my own. I’d just returned from a holiday in the US which was the high point of my life and gave me an itch to see the world, so it seemed obvious to use the website to motivate and record my trips. It cost £10 for the domain name and £30 a year for hosting and I did all the design and IT work myself, but because I didn’t know what I was doing I’d crash the site and have to pay someone £25 an hour to fix it. I then started saving to go away for a weekend once a month, mostly around the UK, and blog about it. I’d travel to UK and European cities and stay in cheap hostels and do without all luxuries like cinema trips and meals out to afford it. I didn’t go to a restaurant or cinema once. The blog only took off when I started recommending things to do in different destinations. People started writing in for advice and to tell me how bored they were with their lives, and the website climbed up the Google rankings. It now gets 20,000 views a month and last year I spent about £4,000 on it, including seven overseas trips and eight ones within the UK. Part of the cost is unpaid leave from work since my holiday allowance doesn’t cover all the trips I do. In 2016 the outlay was double that because I attended various travel blogging conventions and had to pay for fares and hotels. Now the blog is established I could get most of my trips for free from PR firms, but I prefer to pay for all or part of them to keep them authentic. I also spend about £500 a year on maintaining a fashion blog and last year I spent £1,500 buying Facebook ads and drinks for a marketing conference I held in a pub so people in the industry could get together. I haven’t lost my inbuilt impulse to save money. I buy food as cheaply as possible and spend about £20 a week on it. The trick is to buy a chicken and a bulk bag of potatoes, cook it up on Sunday and make it last three days. I’d never turned central heating on in my adult life until this year when a housemate wanted it. I’d wear thick clothes instead. My main outgoing is my £500 share of the rent for a two-bedroom flat in Hove in East Sussex and I spend £30 a month for my mobile phone and £18.99 for Sky broadband. I still don’t go to the cinema or go out to grab a sandwich with colleagues, which can get frustrating because part of me wants to do what others do, but when I know another trip is coming up it’s worth it.

It changes, depending on how I feel that day.” Turnly’s father was a Northern Irish journalist who at one point taught English in Tokyo. There he met Turnly’s mother, and the family settled in County Antrim. When meeting people who are confused by the combination of his looks and accent, Turnly describes himself as “a Japanese Ulsterman”. Perhaps not surprisingly, he adds: “All my plays are about identity. I’ve often written about someone becoming someone else, someone turning into something else.” In another sense, Turnly has an unusual background for a playwright – his first profession was sheep farmer. Since 2015, he has been away from the farm a lot – given an office in London as Channel 4 writer in residence at the Tricycle Theatre. During his post, Turnly wrote two plays, both set in Japan: The Great Wave and Neko. These are the second and third parts of a trilogy that began with Harajuku Girls in 2015. The central characters in all three plays are young Japanese women. In Harajuku Girls, schoolgirls sample aspects of eastern and western culture on a Friday night in Tokyo. Neko, currently under discussion with a big theatre, is “about a Japanese schoolgirl who turns into a cat”. The Great Wave begins with the disappearance of 17-year-old Hanako during a storm. The girl is believed by Japanese authorities to have drowned. The play takes the form of a moral thriller, with twists and surprises that Turnly reasonably pleads to be left for the audience to discover. One aspect of the narrative involves the so-called “comfort women”, forced by the Imperial Japanese Army to work as sex slaves in occupied territories. That story has featured in various novels and plays – including Christopher Chen’s Into the Numbers, which played in London until January – but Turnly’s main focus is little-known events, such as the local consequence of forced prostitution. During six-months of research, the writer thought of going to North Korea as a tourist, but worried about being arrested as a spy: “Being stuck in North Korea for two years might have provided good material for a play but, in the end, it wasn’t something I fancied.” He had easier access to Japan because of frequent visits with his mother, who advised on some Japanese-language sequences: “I had to run them past her. I only really have the restaurant basics myself.” Some of Turnly’s biggest artistic influences, though, are Japanese: the novelist Haruki Murakami (Norwegian Wood, A Wild Sheep Chase) and the film director Hayao Miyazaki (whose animated movies include Spirited Away). “As it’s worked out,” he says, “all of my theatre plays are about Japan and all of my BBC radio plays are about Northern Ireland.” If this sounds like a policy, it isn’t the writer’s. “I’ve written stage plays that aren’t set in Japan, but I can’t get them on. I pitch radio plays about other things, but they say, ‘Can we have another one in Northern Ireland?’” He hopes to write a dual-nationality play, perhaps about a Japanese tourist catching the wrong plane at Heathrow and landing in Belfast during the Troubles. Growing up, he was part of a “tiny Japanese community in Northern Ireland, maybe a couple of hundred people”. There is a joke about a Belfast resident who excused himself from the hostilities due to being Jewish, and received the reply: “But are you a Catholic Jew or a Protestant Jew?” Did the Northern Irish Japanese suffer similar scrutiny? “Sure,” says Turnly, now 43. “My mother’s a Shinto, and there weren’t a whole lot of temples out in County Antrim.” He, however, felt little direct consequence of the violent years, through living far from the main trouble spots and because the peace process began when Turnly was a teenager. “There’s a generation now that knows nothing about the Troubles. I’m from the generation that was affected a little bit. You were aware of it, going to Belfast, checkpoints and so on. But at the moment, I feel safer in Belfast than I do in London.” Two of the biggest tourist attractions, he notes, are the “Game of Thrones locations tour”, because the HBO series is filmed in Northern Ireland, and “the murals tour” of the loyalist and nationalist wall paintings that reflected the city’s divisions. Previous British productions of shows with Asian characters – from the original version of Miss Saigon to Howard Barker’s recent In the Depths of Dead Love – have been criticised for “yellow-face” casting, in which white actors play Asian roles. The National is committed to culturally sensitive representation, but Turnly admits race-specific casting for The Great Wave was not an option: “It’s very hard to cast North Koreans, as there aren’t a vast number of actors from there here. We have had people from Korean communities in London coming in to advise on language and so on. In the cast, we have two Japanese actors, two Malysian, one Vietnamese and four Chinese. So all east Asian. But it would have been impossible to cast like for like.” Begun three years ago, The Great Wave now feels hotly contemporary. On the day we talk, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un suggested that he might suspend his nuclear weapons programme; subsequently, it was announced that the “Dear Leader” would meet President Donald Trump. “Yes, what is happening now is very relevant to the play,” he says. “I keep hearing echoes of what I’ve written.” • The Great Wave is at the National Theatre, London, until 14 April.

Done and dusted, in other words, bar a series of “battles” for individual positions of varying import. We cut to Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg in the all-important Battle for 10th; in other news, Brighton and Everton are locked in a tense arm wrestle to finish in the top half! Saturday’s trophy within a trophy is at least slightly more exalted: Old Trafford hosts the Battle for Second but, with seven goals in the last six editions of a fixture that has consistently fallen flat, it would take a brave pundit to safely predict a ratcheting up of dramatic tension. Even if that pundit was RT’s Jose Mourinho, who may usefully see his post-match media engagements after this inevitably stifling goalless draw as a useful dry run for his summer gig. Nobody can spin the parking of a bus into a galaxy of honourable intentions quite like Mourinho, after all, but if nuanced analysis is to be his future vocation then he seems intent on throwing shade on some of his new employers’ competition. “Some of the guys with an opinion couldn’t resolve their own problems when they were managers, so they are giving opinions like they have solutions for everything,” he smouldered on Friday, seemingly in response to Gary Neville’s reference on Sky about an “inefficient” United team after their startlingly swashbuckling win at Crystal Palace. Presumably Mourinho will have any outstanding issues tied up nicely in a bow by May then, so he can concentrate on telling Jogi Löw how to improve Germany from a sofa with preferential sightlines to the Kremlin. Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay will, by then, have formed the most intuitive midfield pair since Xavi and Iniesta. Alexis Sánchez will not, in fact, be a man close to the wrong side of 30 whose trademark energy levels are about to tail off and leave half the player behind. If they can repel Jürgen Klopp and Liverpool, who are the anti-United in all bar the stats that matter, then second place should be in the bag and somebody in a Moscow studio will soon enough be extolling the marvel that such a modestly-assembled bunch of minstrels could keep Pep Guardiola’s crew to within a mere 15 points. The smoke and mirrors are a lot of what keeps all this interesting, these days. But cut through it all and Saturday’s showdown provides little more than a consolation prize for whoever can get nearest to Manchester City’s crystal-clear rear view. If it’s another borefest, though, then fear not: the keenly-awaited Battle for 10th really does kick off at Goodison Park half an hour after that one ends.

The meeting in Grenoble really is Le Crunch for two unbeaten teams harbouring grand slam ambitions. England have been imperious in the Six Nations so far, scoring an average of more than 45 points from their three matches but the head coach, Simon Middleton, is under no illusions. “Outside travelling to New Zealand this is the most difficult place to come and win,” he said. “It was always going to be the toughest game in the tournament and we’ll now find out what we are made of. I understand that the French have used the World Cup defeat as motivation but it’ll be how both teams execute their gameplans.” Middleton knows his side have great potential with a new breed in a potent backline, epitomised by the 18-year-old Ellie Kildunne, who has made a successful switch from the wing to full-back. Kildunne has left defences clutching at thin air in recent weeks, her second try against Wales last month a stunning individual effort. Middleton added: “Ellie is a fantastic talent at a very, very young age. She has a great all-round game with great pace that she knows how to use. This new breed of backs gives us a real attacking edge.” The return of the captain, Sarah Hunter, is one of five changes from the side that beat Scotland 43-8 in Glasgow a fortnight ago. Hunter is at No 8, alongside Poppy Cleall and Marlie Packer, the best back-row combination in the tournament, with Rachael Burford and Amber Reed forming a new centre partnership. Over 15,000 tickets have been sold for the match and France, 57-0 victors over Italy last time out, will test England’s mettle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/10/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T19:36:34Z","webTitle":"Willian the spark for Chelsea but Crystal Palace rally to produce late scare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/10/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/10/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Willian the spark for Chelsea but Crystal Palace rally to produce late scare","bodyText":"Chelsea head to Barcelona with three points in their back pocket at the end of a turbulent week. But the way in which they let their performance drift in the final half hour here was a reminder of the Blues’ more wayward moments in an inconsistent season. For Palace, it was the opposite. After the home side scored twice in the first half, with both goals going in via Palace’s Martin Kelly, the visitors bounced back. The introduction of the returning Wilfried Zaha at the interval gave the visitors renewed heart and after Patrick van Aanholt scored in the 89th minute the nerves of the Stamford Bridge crowd were jangled unduly. Antonio Conte may have been the cheerier of the two managers afterwards, but the manner of this topsy-turvy encounter left you unsure that Roy Hodgson wouldn’t take greater heart from it. “I think this win was very important‚” Conte said. “We played really well, especially in the first half; we created many chances. It was a pity that at the end we conceded the goal and the last three minutes were a bit nervous. After you dominate a game you hope to play it out in a more relaxed fashion.” For his part, Hodgson rued Palace’s inconsistent performance. “It’s a shame we didn’t play the whole match as we did the second half,” he said. “There was far too big a difference between the teams in the first half, both defensively and offensively, and we paid the price. A second half repeat could have ended very badly and the temptation to bring on a player of [Zaha’s] quality was too strong.” Both coaches read the first half right. Chelsea were dominant and assertive. They also had a plan that was working. With Olivier Giroud playing as an actual striker, Eden Hazard was given licence to return to the areas he loves to roam in best. Alongside him Willian continued his imperious form of late, registering his fifth goal in as many games in the 25th minute when he drifted in from the left wing to open the scoring with a low shot that spun off Kelly’s calf and in off the near post. Kelly doubled Chelsea’s advantage seven minutes later in strange fashion. A whip-smart piece of Chelsea play ended with Davide Zappacosta firing a shot past Wayne Hennessey. Kelly was in position to block the shot, but his clearance only hit the head of his flailing keeper. The ball bounced backwards, came off Kelly’s own knee and dribbled into the net. Giroud missed two more chances to open his Chelsea account in the second half. He was “unlucky” according to his manager. Willian, meanwhile, “is playing in a fantastic way but, I want to underline, not only with the ball”. The Brazilian has been in and out of Conte’s team this season despite his attacking consistency. The Italian was letting everyone know the reason for it. Hodgson made his own cryptic remark, claiming Palace’s second half recovery was down to everyone putting their body on the line. “We didn’t have 11 doing that in the first half,” he said. The inference would be that Christian Benteke was among those who had disappointed, as it was he who was hoicked off at half-time for Zaha, who made his first appearance after missing a month with a ligament strain. Either way the returning talisman not only gave the visitors a cutting edge but a sense of belief. The Norwegian striker Alexander Sørloth took a Zaha pass and thumped the post with it just after the restart. He then had the ball in the net with five minutes left, but the referee Anthony Taylor ruled it out for a foul by Jaïro Riedewald. Hodgson said “the ones who have studied it on video” told him it should have been allowed. Three minutes later and Palace had their goal as Zaha played a delightful blind pass out wide to Van Aanholt, who fired home with confidence. Palace have now lost to Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea in consecutive matches, but each has been close and Hodgson knows the lesson to draw from those defeats. “In the last eight games we have to reproduce the form of five of these last six halves,” he said. “We have to make certain we leave no stone unturned in the fight to stay in the division.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/10/large-butts-big-thighs-weightlifting-empowering-women-feminism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Large butts, big thighs: why weightlifting is so empowering to women | Lizzie O’Shea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/large-butts-big-thighs-weightlifting-empowering-women-feminism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/10/large-butts-big-thighs-weightlifting-empowering-women-feminism","fields":{"headline":"Large butts, big thighs: how weightlifting empowers women","bodyText":"I remember the first time I tried to pull a bar off the floor loaded with two big weights. Unease pooled in my stomach. My trainer was patient, perhaps a little bemused. “I’ve never met anyone who couldn’t deadlift 130 pounds,” he said flatly. But, I thought, he had also said he’d never trained anyone as short as me. I frowned up at him, wedged myself under the bar, rolled back my shoulders, and pulled for my life. At the top, laughter spilled out of me, in exhilaration and disbelief. Weightlifting is often something you are warned against, as a woman. The squat racks are routinely draped with dudes. Exercise classes, attended largely by women, are full of disclaimers that the exercise will not “bulk you up”. Being toned and lean is the goal: taking up less space rather than more. All of which is part of what makes lifting so appealing. It is about expanding out. A large butt is an achievement; thick thighs are not a source of shame; arms that strain the seams are an accomplishment. Rather than seeing your body through the lens of others, you feel it swell and harden under the quixotic influence of your own agency. When I started to lift heavy, my clothing began to feel tight – less because I was using it to keep my embarrassing bits in, and more because my muscly parts were busting out. The feminist movement has often concerned itself with finding ways for women to be valued other than for their appearance. It’s a laudable and necessary goal. But empowerment is not just an intellectual pursuit, and also involves finding ways to feel comfortable in your own skin. It is about learning to respect what you and your body are capable of, rather than feeling steeped in shame because you fail to meet arbitrary social standards. Strength training builds the exact skills we need to advance women’s rights: persistence, bravery and an understanding of how short-term goals lead to long-term victories. It can also be a place to practise coping with extreme physical pressure. I go boxing regularly for the same reason – to undergo a discombobulating experience, and find a way to calm the mind and work out how to survive. This is not to say that the onus should fall on women to figure out how to navigate themselves out of violent or damaging situations. Challenging men’s harmful behaviour and the systemic practices that oppress women should be the focus of feminism in the year of #MeToo. Physical empowerment is a separate goal, but it is also one that can be surprisingly gratifying – especially when you’ve spent much of your life being told you are weak. Women training for strength is not a new phenomenon. This is not for everyone, and there are other ways to produce similar benefits. The gym is not a place to pay penance for the last doughnut you ate with hours on a treadmill, nor does it have to be the most important part of your day. But I want to give my body the best chance of surviving for as long as possible.

The panel also concluded that Pedley: Said to a pupil: “Oh you’re from [redacted]. Does your dad do boom boom?” Said a pupil should be put “on the next boat back to [redacted]”. Told one pupil he was “pretty good for a foreigner”. Asked “did you bring any illegal substances?” after enquiring about another pupil’s father’s job. Pedley, 60, was found to have used swearwords in class and breached the school’s code of conduct by consuming alcohol in the presence of pupils while on duty during a school trip to Budapest and Vienna. He also purchased alcohol for an underage student and allowed students to drink excessive amounts of alcohol while on the trip. Despite finding that Pedley had made derogatory statements, the panel concluded he should not be banned from teaching because of “the overwhelming evidence in support of [Pedley’s] ability as an excellent teacher”. However, this recommendation was overruled by the education secretary, Damian Hinds. The panel said more than 50 pages of statements and letters had been provided that displayed “overwhelming” backing from “colleagues, parents, former and current pupils from a range of ethnicities and backgrounds”. Several students had also praised Pedley extensively on teaching websites. The panel considered that this evidence “very clearly demonstrates that Mr Pedley is an effective, dedicated and well respected teacher who has positively influenced the lives of pupils in many areas of school life throughout his 37-year career at the school”. Although the panel found Pedley’s actions amounted to “unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute”, they concluded a ban would be “punitive”. But Dawn Dandy, on behalf of the education secretary, overruled the panel and said a full teaching ban was proportionate. Dandy said: “I do not feel that the panel has given adequate weight to the potential damage to the public perception of the teaching profession if behaviours such as those found proven are not dealt with appropriately and proportionately.” Pedley told the panel he never intended to offend or upset his pupils and that if he had, he regretted it “enormously”. He said that while he had used racist language, he was not racist and “abhors racism”. According to employment tribunal documents, Pedley brought a claim against Oundle but withdrew it last year. Pedley can ask for the ban to be lifted in two years. A spokesperson for Oundle school, which is 12 miles (19km) south-west of Peterborough, said Pedley’s employment was terminated in December 2016: “The school complied with its regulatory duties in reporting Mr Pedley’s departure from the school to the appropriate authorities. “The Department of Education conducted its own investigation through the National College for Teaching and Learning. Its findings are now in the public domain. Oundle school is committed to the welfare of its pupils and to promoting the highest professional standards in its staff.” Notable Oundle alumni include the conservationist Sir Peter Scott and the economist Sir Alan Budd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/10/six-nations-bonus-point-anticlimax-england-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"Six Nations organisers hope to avoid bonus-point anticlimax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/six-nations-bonus-point-anticlimax-england-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/10/six-nations-bonus-point-anticlimax-england-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Six Nations organisers hope to avoid bonus-point anticlimax","bodyText":"The Six Nations organisers will come under pressure to reverse their stance on bonus points if they decide the title winners in the penultimate round of matches on Saturday. If Ireland pick up a four-try bonus point in a victory at home to Scotland and England fail to do so in France, Joe Schmidt’s side would have an insurmountable lead in the table before next Saturday’s visit to Twickenham. Ireland would stress they scored a bonus point at home to Wales whereas England did not, but they have enjoyed three consecutive home fixtures and the timing of their trip to Twickenham means that the two sides in the competition placed highest in the world rankings may meet for the second year in a row with the destination of the title already decided. England would still have the motivation of denying Ireland the grand slam on the final day of the championship – particularly as they suffered the same fate in Dublin last year – but the tournament organisers will no doubt be hoping for a title decider on St Patrick’s Day. Indeed, if bonus points are decisive on Saturday it can be considered a worst-case scenario. This is the second year bonus points have been employed in the Six Nations and while 11 were scored in 2017 (there have been seven so far this year) they did not have a direct impact on the final standings. On the eve of this year’s tournament, the Six Nations chief executive, John Feehan confirmed that bonus points would become a permanent fixture. “We believe overall, on balance, that it was a good decision and we’re going to keep it,” said Feehan in January. Eddie Jones’s side will have the benefit of knowing whether they require a bonus-point victory with their match kicking off later. But Elliot Daly – recalled to the wing after an injury absence since December – insisted that an England win of any kind is the No 1 priority. “If you have scored three tries then you’re going to go for the bonus point, if there’s no chance of losing the game,” he said. “If there’s a penalty in front of the posts and you’re leading by a couple of points and there are still a few minutes left, you’ll take the points.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/mar/12/low-cost-housing-needs-dignity-indian-architect-balkrishna-doshi","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Low-cost housing needs dignity, says Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/12/low-cost-housing-needs-dignity-indian-architect-balkrishna-doshi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/mar/12/low-cost-housing-needs-dignity-indian-architect-balkrishna-doshi","fields":{"headline":"Low-cost housing needs dignity, says Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi","bodyText":"The winner of architecture’s “Nobel prize”, Balkrishna Doshi, has called on his profession to rethink the way it approaches building for the most impoverished communities. The internationally noted champion of housing for India’s poor, Doshi was awarded the Pritzker prize last week, in large part for the Aranya low-cost housing project. It accommodates 80,000 people with houses and courtyards linked by a maze of pathways in the city of Indore. A celebrity in India where he speaks to packed lectures, 90-year-old Doshi, who studied under Le Corbusier, has worked on other projects – including mixed-income housing for a life insurance corporation in Ahmedabad and the underground Amdavad ni Gufa art gallery – but it is Aranya for which he is best known. Speaking to the Guardian after the announcement of his award, Doshi said that architects and urban planners involved in low-income housing projects – as well as architectural education – needed to move away from their focus on the designer as individual to being far more collaborative, compassionate and invested in the dignity of those they house. And in the chequered history of slum clearance and relocation – including in the US after Roosevelt’s New Deal, and in countries like France and the UK in the post-war era – Doshi’s Aranya stands out as a success story in a country with substantial and persisting housing issues for its poorest citizens. “They are not houses but homes where a happy community lives. That is what finally matters,” Doshi has said in the past of the organising credo for this project. Doshi believes that a large part of Aranya’s success has been because instead of presenting those who would live there – often in a purpose-built house for the first time – with a ready-made design, the development allows residents the space and opportunity to adapt and improve their homes. Built around a central spine to accommodate businesses, Doshi’s brick houses – in sizes from a single room to larger homes for wealthier families – were designed around parks and courtyards, with groups of ten houses forming inward-looking clusters. Beyond aesthetics, Doshi argued that architecture and urban design – done right – can and should be socially transformative for the world’s poorest. “If you empower people then what happens is that it creates incentives for people that are self-generated. The promise of a home is not a limited hope, but the sky becomes the limit.” If at times Doshi speaks more like a humanist philosopher than a designer, it is an outlook that was explicitly recognised by the prize committee that “projects must go beyond the functional to connect with the human spirit through poetic and philosophical underpinnings”. “Housing as shelter is but one aspect of these projects,” the Pritzker jury added in its citation. “The entire planning of the community, the scale, the creation of public, semi-public and private spaces are a testament to his understanding of how cities work and the importance of the urban design.” Echoing that theme, Doshi added: “As architects we are supposed to be social, economic and cultural designers. But really we are exclusive when we need to be inclusive.” “If I as an architect am not able to do something for my people and provide them with what they need, then I should say my job is incomplete.” For Doshi that has not only meant designing places like Aranya to replace slum housing but to have the curiosity and humility to learn from slums, not least how and why a successful sense of community coalesces, even in situations of extreme hardship. “I used take students to slum areas. When you talk to the people living there they are lot more open and willing to share and modify because the human being is basically a compassionate animal. “In Bombay,” he added, “we have a large slum near the airport. When we were studying you could see that besides the situation of living there in absolute misery, people were also willing to challenge themselves to find a better way of life, and seeking to overcome the problems.”The balance, for Doshi, is a subtle combination of factors including access to the “essentials” of life – shops, cafes and places to do business – with the housing maintaining crucial “privacies” while leaving room for cooperative communities to develop through their own negotiations. “That means borders that are diffuse. What you need to find is how to create not separations but buffer zones, places where there is room for variation.” Doshi said he found such models in Indian temples and old cities. “You want slight shifts – to create gaps – because architecture is not mechanical.” Instead Doshi sees communities and the physical places that they live as “organic” and “messy” and inevitably adapting what the architect has designed. Commenting on the importance of the award for India, Alok Ranjan, Jaipur-based professor and member of the Indian Institute of Architects, told AFP last week: “This is very good news for Indian architects because he is our godfather. We are very proud. “What stands out about his work is that it is for all strata of society … not only for the elite but also for the middle- and low-income groups.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/09/building-a-self-help-solution-to-britains-housing-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T17:04:50Z","webTitle":"Building a self-help solution to Britain’s housing problems | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/09/building-a-self-help-solution-to-britains-housing-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/09/building-a-self-help-solution-to-britains-housing-problems","fields":{"headline":"Building a self-help solution to Britain’s housing problems","bodyText":"Robert Dark (Letters, 8 March) argues that what is desperately needed to deal with the UK housing problem is for “the government and councils to provide affordable homes for rent but with some new imaginative forms of tenancy”. If he looks at the work being done by Radical Routes, Triodos Bank and the Ecology Building Society to develop housing co-ops, he will see that tenancy without landlords is already being developed, but at a snail’s pace compared with other countries. One mystery is why, for example, Nationwide, a mutual bank, instead of providing mortgages to housing co-ops (also mutuals) is providing finance to buy-to-let landlords who use assured shorthold tenancies to provide an extremely tenuous form of tenancy. Figures compiled by Shelter and YouGov indicate that 50,000 tenants are currently being evicted each year because the landlord claims to be selling up. Imaginative for the landlord, but not the tenant. Roger Halford Solihull, West Midlands • Now that it is clear that Mrs Thatcher’s right-to-buy had little to do with “affordable” homes and much to do with turning council tenants into heavily indebted Tory voters, it is time to follow Scotland’s lead and repeal the legislation. As the main beneficiaries, it is hard to believe that the banks, which entered the mortgage market in the 1960s and now have an unpaid debt of £1.4trn (according to the Money Charity), did not help to dream up the property-owning democracy and repeal of the rent acts which places any control of landlords and rents firmly in the hands of the buy-to-let mortgagees. As Robert Dark tells us, since 1980 council homes have been reduced to 2m and 40% of those 4.5m sold are owned by private landlords. Financial services, which are so vital to the British economy, have turned homes into speculative investments. Clearly the government, wedded to this new form of capitalism, will never undermine this cosy relationship and in consequence building new but never enough homes is seen as the only solution. Henry Pryor Hereford • Westminster tube station is adorned by a large advertisement which proclaims that “five landlords signed up with Hostmaster every day in 2017 to unlock higher-paying tenants”. One wonders whether the prime minister’s belated interest in housing policy will extend to this aspect of life in the private rented sector.

She has, says Fiona Shaw, an “unparalleled gift at playfulness mixed with serious profound thinking”. Her Abba musical Mamma Mia! is still a favourite in the West End, almost 20 years after it opened. It has run on Broadway since 2001 and been a hit around the world. Lloyd made her film directing debut with an adaptation, starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, which became one of the most successful British movies ever. She then directed Streep’s Oscar-winning performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady (2011). She has for years put women centre-stage in the theatre, most notably with her hugely acclaimed, prison-set Shakespeare Trilogy, performed by an all-female company. Now, she is directing one of this year’s most anticipated shows, Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, in London’s West End.

For Malala Yousafzai, the hardest thing about starting at Oxford has been working out how much time to spend campaigning for girls’ education globally and how much to devote to her own education. As everyone around her seems to be in a permanent state of alarm about the amount of work they must do, her own battle to squeeze everything in feels bearable. “Sometimes, it is challenging. You have to stay awake until late and finish your work; you have to ask to extend your deadline; you have to work a bit harder,” she says in a phone call between classes. “Everyone struggles. Everyone is panicking with their reading. It is hard to do all the reading and finish a 2,000-word essay – it is normal for everyone to struggle.” Before she arrived, she worried that her unique position as a Nobel prize-winning fresher might make it difficult to fit in. “I was nervous, I was actually scared wondering how people would react. How would I make friends? How would people perceive me? But I was welcomed as a student. It’s my second term now, I’ve made so many friends,” she says. She has an endearingly breezy way of brushing away the extraordinariness of her situation and modestly suggests that her challenges are pretty much those faced by most students (although this term, as well as the trip to Davos, she has been finalising a partnership with Apple to allow her Malala Fund to extend grants for secondary education to more than 100,000 girls – and she has been promoting a new book). “I just feel like an Oxford student; I feel so grateful.” Yousafzai, 20, is studying politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) at Lady Margaret Hall, and recently allowed the US chatshow host David Letterman to follow her around for a day, giving a snapshot of her life (taking him on a rapid tour of the college canteen and gardens, politely smiling at his jokes and halfheartedly playing table football with him); the footage is now available on Netflix, as part of the My Next Guest Needs No Introduction series. She has joined the Oxford Union, the Pakistan society and a cricket team, but is steering clear of student politics and has revised her ambition to follow in the footsteps of Benazir Bhutto (who also studied PPE at the same college) to become prime minister of Pakistan. “I wanted to be prime minister when I was younger, when I was 11, because I thought that by becoming prime minister I could fix everything. But now that I have met so many presidents and prime ministers around the world, it just seems that things are not simple and there are other ways that I can bring the change that I want to see,” she says. “I think we have a lot of time to join politics in Pakistan – so, right now, I am not thinking about that, I have no plans.” It is five-and-a-half years since Malala was shot in the head by a gunman who disliked her campaign against the Taliban’s ban on female education in Pakistan’s Swat valley, where she lived. She was flown to Birmingham for treatment and has lived in the UK since, gradually revising her perceptions about a country she now sees with all its flaws. She was “surprised and shocked”, she says, to discover how far Britain is from having gender equality; as a child, she had assumed that equal access to education here would mean there was a wider equality. “The western world is viewed as an ideal for other countries, especially developing countries, in terms of development, progress and gender equality. There are things I have seen here which I value and appreciate: no girl is told not to go to school because she is a girl, you don’t see women told to stay in houses and to cover their whole face and their whole body, and not go to market. But there is still a lot of work to be done on the representation of women in parliament, or if you look at the equal pay issue, or the sexual harassment issue, there are so many issues that the UK still needs to fight against to achieve equality.” She hasn’t personally encountered racism or sexism, but is annoyed at how the media depicts women here. “If you look at how women are portrayed in movies, films or ads, they are viewed as these delicate bodies who should dress in a certain way, behave in a certain way, talk in a certain way. This is something we have to challenge … it is women who should be deciding what they want to wear, what they want to say, what they want to do. It should not be someone else’s job to tell us how to dress, how to talk, how to walk.” A more relaxed vision of Malala the student comes in a YouTube interview with a fellow student, known as Miss Varz, when they talk about books and takeaway food. This side of her comes across too on her Twitter account – she signed up on the day her A-levels finished last June, posting a screenshot of her Oxford acceptance news a few weeks later, along with pictures of her younger brother getting his hair dyed blond, and of herself eating pakoras with her best friend from school. But, mostly, the posts offer a portrait of the extraordinary pace of her life. On New Year’s Eve, she posted a list of her 2017 highlights – A-levels, Oxford, writing a book for children, visiting the UN general assembly, becoming a UN messenger of peace and a Canadian honorary citizen, and visiting Iraq and Kurdistan, Nigeria, Mexico and Canada. The list goes on. She is used to the juggling act. “I’ve been struggling with studies and the work that I do outside school for girls’ education [for] the last five to six years. I had to take my GCSEs and now do my A-levels – and now university,” she says. “So far, it has gone well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/12/altruistic-organ-donation-carl-pinder","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T11:21:43Z","webTitle":"The altruistic organ donor: 'I was talking to my kidney'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/12/altruistic-organ-donation-carl-pinder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/12/altruistic-organ-donation-carl-pinder","fields":{"headline":"The altruistic organ donor: 'I was talking to my kidney'","bodyText":"Almost 5,000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, but the number of living kidney donors in the UK fell to an eight-year low in 2017. Carl Pinder is one member of a reasonably exclusive club after he decided to donate a kidney altruistically to a stranger. “I was thinking: well, why not?” he remembers. “And I was trying to come up with reasons why not. And even up to the day I was thinking, why not? I never saw it as a serious operation, although everyone seemed to think it was. All I’ve got is three little scars.” The donation on 15 February 2016 by Pinder, who was 58 at the time, started a process that changed two strangers’ lives. His organ went to Barbara Hallam, 68. Barbara’s daughter, who had wanted to donate to her mother but was not a match, gave her kidney to a four-year-old girl in Scotland. And all because Pinder thought: why not? But even though he wears his sacrifice lightly and says he would do it again, the number of altruistic donations is down by more than one-fifth from a high of 110 in 2014 to 87 last year. Figures released this week by the NHS show an overall decline in living kidney donation, with 990 donors in 2017 – the fewest in eight years. Last year, 261 people died waiting for a kidney transplant, many of whom could have been saved through increased living kidney donation. What is especially important about altruistic donations is that they can start chains of transplants. In Pinder and Hallam’s case, the chain had two links, but they can be up to three links long. Hallam, from Sheffield, had spent four years on dialysis. After finding that neither of her daughters were compatible, doctors told them there was another option, donor-pair pooling, where they could be matched with another donor-recipient pair – if one could be found. “My daughter was quite keen to give her kidney to a stranger, so that I could get on to the altruistic list quicker and find a more compatible match,” she says. The operation – keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic – takes about two or three hours and leaves a few small scars. It involves a hospital stay of several days and at least a month off work, but Pinder, who discharged himself early, makes light of it. “I won’t pretend it wasn’t sore; it was,” he says. “[But] two days later, I walked down to the village shop, which is about a mile away. Two weeks later, I was out gently jogging.” Paul Gibbs, a transplant surgeon at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust and trustee of the Give A Kidney charity, says altruistic donors are similar to Pinder: they are typically over 55, have had a good life and are looking for a way to give back. “There’s just this group of people that feel they’ve got a spare part they don’t need and someone is in need of it,” Gibbs says. “They see it as a complete no-brainer.” Candidates face a battery of tests to see whether they are suitable, not least psychologically. “It’s really just to ensure that they have understanding of what they are doing, understand their motivation and just to check that they’ve got the mental strength and social support to deal with not only the success, but also the failure,” says Gibbs. There is no guarantee that an altruistic donor will ever hear from their recipient. But Pinder and Hallam agreed to eventually meet. “It was weird,” he says, recalling. “I was sat next to her talking to my kidney, as it were.

Theresa May, your time is up!” We did so to shed light on the inherent dangers lurking in the government’s upcoming domestic violence and abuse bill, which we knew would be a dangerous distraction from the real state of the domestic violence sector in the UK. On International Women’s Day, the government confirmed our expectations when it laid out more clearly its proposals for this bill. Again, we see smokescreens diverting attention away from what this bill will mean: more survivors being locked up by a harmful criminal justice system while still locked out of refuges and locked into violent situations. Despite a stated aim “to challenge and change the attitudes that can underpin domestic abuse”, the underlying motivation of this bill is clear: to put yet more power in the hands of the police, courts and criminal justice system. Although the government argues this “tough” approach will “better shield victims”, we know that the police and prisons are no solution to domestic violence. In fact, similar policies to those in this bill have, in the US, led to an increase in the number of survivors being arrested, especially black, minority ethnic and disadvantaged survivors. The police and courts have plenty of resources and power; giving them more won’t address the reasons they are failing. If the government truly wants to tackle domestic violence, power should be given back to survivors – by properly funding sorely-needed specialist services and refuges. The government’s purported commitment to develop a “sustainable funding model for refuges” only masks their devastating legacy of funding cuts and piecemeal offerings: in 2016-17, 60% of women who approached a refuge for help were turned away, providing context to Theresa May’s claim elsewhere that “the best available data shows bed spaces have increased by 10% since 2010”. In fact, this figure not only should represent a cut in real terms when taking into account the reported increase in demand as well as population growth, but also cannot count for those survivors turned away for lack of funding. Local authorities’ refuge funding has fallen by an average of 24% in the same timeframe, meaning many survivors, especially those with specialist support needs, are left with nowhere to go. As survivors and sector workers, we know a pro-sentence environment isn’t the answer to domestic violence. The government proposes a “statutory aggravating factor in sentencing, similar to those already in law for hate crimes, for domestic abuse to toughen sentences”. When you’re a survivor in danger, there is little difference between your perpetrator getting a three-week sentence or an 11-week sentence if you can’t get safe housing when they are released. It also plays into a dangerous rhetoric prioritising the criminal justice system over support and services in the community. The government has pledged £2m that will be “dedicated to supporting female offenders who have been victims, as over 60% have indicated they have experienced domestic abuse”, but that’s a drop in the ocean next to the £1.3bn to be invested in 10,000 modern prison places by 2020 and the £500m spent on immigration removal centre over four years. We know that when women suffer violence, it’s the private companies that profit. Sisters Uncut is not alone in criticising of this bill. In October 2017 a wide range of women’s organisations wrote to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the justice secretary, David Lidington, appealing to them to “go further” with the domestic violence and abuse bill, and last week the End Violence Against Women Coalition reaffirmed the need for “radical change”. At Sisters Uncut we stand with these other organisations in demanding that the government stop forcing through legislation based on ideology and austerity, and start basing it on what survivors actually want and need. We demand, and we deserve, a domestic violence and abuse bill that funds refuges and specialist domestic violence services, rather than focusing on a criminal justice system that only further harms survivors. • For more information on the consultation, please follow this link. • Sisters Uncut is a feminist direct action group made up of non-binary people and women protesting cuts to domestic violence services.

Trees stand in companionable silence, the breath between them is slight. Days ago, slender ash trunks rattled like yacht masts in a marina, hawthorns hissed in the east wind, great oaks and steeple limes soughed in deep snowy murmurs. Much of the storm wreckage has been cleared from the path; it is now a gallery full of early birdsong and light falling in patches as if from high windows. Yesterday a blackbird repeated a one … two-three … four syllable phrase of song; today it is elaborated by bright description and excited story. Shakespeare wrote in As You Like It about the bird under the greenwood tree singing “come hither” with no enemy but “winter and rough weather”. Well, they’ve had plenty of that this year, and it may not be over yet, but the birds are now a loose chorus, building from individual fragments towards the great jamming signal that blocks out all other realities and conjures the greenwood. The greenwood is mythologised woodland, a secular sacred place, a hunting ground and sanctuary that exists in the idea of liberty expressed through ecological relationships between its plants, animals, fungi, spirits, ghosts and ourselves. In ancient woods or along this railway line, the greenwood has its origins underground, in the myriad cells of microbes and mycelium threads of fungi. In the clay, the greenwood is also growing from the moony roots of Allium ursinum, wild garlic, ramsons. They emerge as bristles, opening into two or three leaves per bulb on long stalks twisted at 180 degrees, Lincoln green with pointed tips. In last week’s snow the tips were turning black from frostbite, now they are glossy in the sun, thick as a lawn and just about ready for picking (where the dogs haven’t been). Soon these leaves will pong of the erotic, rebellious free spirit of woods outside the jurisdiction of civilisation, a smell that takes us back to memories of gathering and a daring between true seasons. • Paul Evans is appearing at the Lancaster literary festival (litfest.org) on Saturday 24 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/09/john-mcdonnell-criticises-mean-spirited-nhs-pay-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T13:16:35Z","webTitle":"John McDonnell criticises 'mean-spirited' NHS pay deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/09/john-mcdonnell-criticises-mean-spirited-nhs-pay-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/09/john-mcdonnell-criticises-mean-spirited-nhs-pay-deal","fields":{"headline":"John McDonnell criticises 'mean-spirited' NHS pay deal","bodyText":"The shadow chancellor has said it would be “mean-spirited” of the government to ask nurses to give up a day’s holiday in exchange for a pay rise. The Guardian revealed on Friday that ministers hoped to persuade 1 million non-medical NHS workers, including nurses, to surrender one day’s leave as part of a settlement that would increase their salary by 3% this year, and then 1%-2% in the following two years. Delivering a speech in London, in advance of next week’s spring statement by the chancellor, John McDonnell said Labour and the trade unions could take the credit for the government’s decision to lift the 1% cap on nurses’ pay. “The settlement that may come from this is the result of a campaign waged by the Labour party and the trades unions together, to force the government to scrap the pay cap,” he said. However, he pointed out that 3% would only match inflation, after years of real-terms cuts, and condemned the proposal of giving up a day’s paid leave. “I just think it’s mean-spirited to take a day’s holiday off these staff – they work long hours, they’re under pressure. I just think they deserve a decent holiday,” he said. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced in his budget last autumn that the Treasury would make more funds available for a pay rise beyond the 1% cap imposed by George Osborne, amid widespread reports of staff shortages and low morale among NHS workers. The deal the government is preparing to formally put to staff later this month, negotiated with 14 health unions including Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and the GMB, would give some NHS personnel pay rises of 10% and, in certain circumstances, well above that by 2021. McDonnell’s speech focused on the human costs of government spending cuts on local authorities and their provision of key services including social care. “We are calling on the chancellor, as a bare minimum, to plug the funding deficit in children’s services, social care and domestic violence services,” he said. “Inaction under these circumstances would not only be irresponsible but morally reprehensible.” He predicted that Hammond would use next Tuesday’s statement, which the Treasury has stressed will not contain major policy announcements, to claim credit for the improved state of the public finances. But McDonnell said Hammond was “absolutely blind” to the consequences of continuing spending cuts. “There are innumerable personal tragedies behind the raw figures, but this isn’t some natural disaster. It’s the result of direct political choices made by Conservative-led governments to impose austerity, against all sound economic advice,” he said. “It should be intolerable for all of us to live in a society like this, where the most vulnerable are the worst affected.” McDonnell’s speech, delivered at the Institution of Civil Engineers in Westminster, also focused on familiar themes about reshaping Britain’s economy, boosting investment – and reversing some of the Conservatives’ tax cuts, including to corporation tax. He was introduced by the shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, who called him, “the thinking man”. Asked about Donald Trump’s plans to impose hefty tariffs on imports of steel from the EU, McDonnell said, “we hope he’ll pull back from that”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/11/wales-v-italy-six-nations-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-11T16:59:23Z","webTitle":"Wales 38-14 Italy: Six Nations – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/11/wales-v-italy-six-nations-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/11/wales-v-italy-six-nations-live","fields":{"headline":"Wales 38-14 Italy: Six Nations – as it happened","bodyText":"So despite a slightly disjointed and sloppy spell in the first half, Wales won that handsomely in the end, their selections and replacements paying off in a much more expansive second-half performance. They were helped by Italy losing all momentum after a tenacious first-half showing, despite being depleted by yellow cards, and now look well placed to take second place. The battle for the runners-up slot does at least look hard to call next weekend. Stay on the site for Paul Rees’s report from Cardiff. Thanks for reading. Bye. Italy clear their lines from the scrum and kick for touch but Wales win possession again from an interception, from which Evans bursts for the line but is barged out of play. And that’s our lot. 80 mins: Wales enjoy the final passage of play from a lineout in the corner. They’re whistled for a knock-on, which most of the crowd, and North, evidently fail to hear as the Northampton man gambols merrily over the line to score what he thinks is another try. It’s not. It’s an Italy scrum. 78 mins: Yellow card: Benvenutti is off for a deliberate knock-on similar to Davies’s trangression. As Hadleigh Parkes is deservedly named man of the match. 76 mins: Some rare possession and territory for Italy through a couple of phases but Wales hold the line well and eventually regain possession through Steff Evans. But Italy turn it over again and move it swiftly out left where Ruzzo feeds Bellini for a fine try. The replacement Canna angles over a fine kick to convert too. 72 mins: Halfpenny charges through the middle but can’t quite beat the last man, but Wales come again and Parkes, who’s been impressive all afternoon, loops a lovely pass over to Tipuric on the far left and he dives over. Halfpenny is unerringly accurate from out wide to add the extras, and the runners-up slot is on! 70 mins: Wales are turning it on now, and a lovely move from right to left, featuring a clever disguised pass by Patchell ends with Parkes just being bundled out of play. Italy clear up to halfway, but they can’t get any further than that at the moment. It’s been a desperately disappointing second half from them. 68 mins: More changes: Negri is off for Italy, replaced by Ruzza, and Ghiraldini is replaced by Fabiani. Tomas Francis is on for Wales too. North seals the bonus point. Pressure in front of the posts, it’s worked out to Patchell, who offloads smartly for North a couple of yards out and he isn’t going to miss from there. Halfpenny pops it over. Game done and dusted. 66 mins: More changes: Jenkins for James Davies, Seb Davies for Corey Hill. 65 mins: A driving attack from Wales ends with Parkes powering through a crowd of bodies for the line. Referee Garces says he ‘has no idea’ and seeks TMO advice. Two camera angles aren’t conclusive, a third suggests the tip of the ball is down. But upstairs they say they can’t definitely see a clear grounding. Bonus-point try denied. For now. Boos ring out around the needlessly-roofed arena. 64 mins: Italy replacements: Pasquali and Palazzani on in a change of props. All a bit scrappy and flat at the minute. 63 mins: Wales come again, spanning the width of the pitch twice in two fluent phases before a fine tackle from Parisse on North pegs them back. Italy win a scrum instead. 61 mins: Italy concede another penalty on halfway, giving Patchell a first touch, which he overhits towards the corner and it drifts over the line. 60 mins: Wales are back to 15 men, and again make substitutions. Rhys Patchell, Ken Owens and Alan Davies are on for Handscombe, Elliott Dee and G Davies. Rob Evans is also on, for Nicky Smith. 58 mins: Almost a wonderful try as Davies accelarates from halfway, feeds Faletau who powers forward on the inside left, unloads to Tipuric who passes wide to Evans, who’s bundled out of play by tenacious scrambled defence from Italy. 56 mins: Italy attack putposefully on the right with Ghiraldini, Budd and Benevenutti but stout defence from Dee and Steffan Evans wins possession back, and ultimately a penalty, for Wales. 53 mins: Drives from Parkes and then Dee take Wales forward through two phases. Italy hold them at bay and eventually win a penalty to clear the danger with a long kick to the righthand touchline by Allan. 50 mins: Hayward knocks on with Italy on the attack to give Wales a chance to alleviate some pressure. A fine long kick forward from Parkes puts Wales on the attack at the point of the home side’s return to 14 men. Italy have wasted the 10 minutes Liam Williams was off. But it isn’t Williams who returns, it’s Leigh Halfpenny. 48 mins: Italy recycle from right to leg and back again before Davies infringes with his outstretched hand – it’s a deliberate knock-on. Referee Garces lets play continue before eventually pulling it back and sending Gareth Davies to the sin-bin. Wales are briefly down to 13! 47 mins: Italy work it though a couple of fluent phases before Wales strength turns it over, it’s worked out left and Faletau tries to bulldoze through and play is held up at the next phase at the turnover for an Italy penalty. They clear the danger for now. 45 mins: What a deflating start to the half for Italy, and suddenly this game seems out of reach, their tenacious work late in the first half undone. 43 mins: North tries to burrow through as the scrum is offloaded. He’s blocked but it’s laid off to Cory Hill from the ruck and he spots a gap and scores. It’s converted comfortably by Anscombe. 42 mins: Anscombe initiates Wales pressure with a cute little kick and chase (though was there a knock-on?) and it ends in a lineout in the right corner. Pressure on the Italian line earns Wales a scrum with a fine chargedown behind the line by Gareth Davies. Wales get us going again. The early stages of the second half should be quite a test for Wales – a man down for 10 minutes and with the expansive rugby they’d hoped for not fully materialising. Much depends on Italy not beginning the second period as they began the first and repeating some of the pressure they managed particularly in the middle period of the first half. And that’s that for the first half. Sloppiness from Italy allowed Wales to be rampant in the opening stages, running in two tries and looking as if they’d threaten many more. But none more have been forthcoming, and Italy have pegged them back, bossing territory and kicking adroitly. Wales will need to step it up to make this game safe. 40 mins: A bout of kicking tennis ends with Liam Williams finally finding touch as his angled kick outfoxes an edgy Minozzi. Italy’s lineout gives Wales an opening as Elliott Dee charges down Ghiraldini’s kick amd the Welsh No 2 looks to have been held back. Nowt given though. From the next lineout an angled kick to the left is not quite gathered by Steff Evans, from which a little bit of pushing and shoving ensues following Liam Williams forceful tackle. The official wants a look at it though, as shoulder and jaw have collided. The TMO says Williams’ arm has come in late – it’s too high and it’s a yellow card for the Wales full-back. He’s off for 10 minutes at the start of the second half 36 mins: A clumsy spell from Allan, receiving a simple pass from Violi, hands Wales a penalty. Wales, reasoning that they could do with being a couple of scores in front at the interval, opt to kick and Anscombe doesn’t miss from in front of the posts. They needed that. 33 mins: A pleasing but well contained couple of phases from Italy just inside Wales’s half comes to nothing when Wales intercept and a long kick forward comes to nothing and Bellini lets it run into the in-goal area. The atmosphere has fallen rather flat. 32 mins: Deft play from Liam Williams in the centre after a little garryowen helps Wales spread from left to right before Violi clears with a high kick forward. Italy then win a penalty at the turnover conceded by Anscombe. They opt to kick. It’s a fair distance out and though Allan finds the distance he steers it just left of the post. 27 mins: Italy attack through two phases in front of the Welsh posts before needlessly conceding a penalty for going over the top. Anyway, you might care to sign up to The Breakdown, the Guardian’s free, weekly rugby email, if you haven’t already: 25 mins: Italy are on top at the moment, kicking and pressing well. Ghiraldini drives forward well out of a maul before Allan’s attempt to find Bellini on the wing is just a touch too overhit. 23 mins: Wales scrummage well, rotating it around but Italy come again with Ghiraldini and Butt to Parisse whose loose pass is intercepted. Wales break through Liam Williams before Minotti regains possession and feeds Allan who’s hit by an absolute juggernaut of a challenge from Faletau. He needs treatment but is Ok to continue. 21 mins: James Davies concedes a penalty on halfway which Tomasso Allan capitalises on with a superb raking long kick to the right-hand corner, from which Italy win a scrum. They’re just finding their feet a little here. 19 mins: Wales try disallowed. Steff Evans’s inside kick forward is gathered by Gareth Davies who runs through to touch down but replays confirm he’s offside. 18 mins: Italy have the first scrum of the day, 16 minutes in, just inside their own 22. Wales press hard but Minozzi clears well towards halfway. 15 mins: A fine low kick for the corner creates a lineout in a promising opportunity for Wales on the left, but Italy hold their own from their throw and Allan clears well. Nbanda is off injured. Licata replaces him. 13 mins: Nbanda is fit to continiue after being strapped up, and Italy show their strength at the breakdown twice to work it out left for Minozzi again though his advance is kept in check this time. Budd has to kick for the line, and Wales clear the danger from the lineout for now 10 mins: Italy enjoy some territory and possession and work it out left after a strong rlling maul, and Minozzi shows some dazzling footwork to weave through, getting outside Liam Williams to score in the corner. Nbanda needs treatment as the conversion is well converted by Allan. Lively old start here. 7th min: Watkin intercepts a loose pass from Mbanda and suddenly it’s too easy, Watkin rampages forward, sidesteps a couple of tackles before feeding North who runs through to add to Wales lead. Anscombe sends his angled conversion just inside the post. Ominous from Italy’s perspective, this. 5th min: North powers forward on the right taking Wales to within five metres, Italy defend desperately, but after Dee feeds Parkes it’s too simple for the No 12 to power through and score. Anscomne converts with ease. 3 mins: The first turnover gives Wales an opening, Faletau tries a grubber through that Parisse gathers, but play is brought back for a Minozzi infringement. Anscombe kicks menacingly to the corner. 2 mins 0-0: Italy work it through four phases from halfway before Allan’s kick is intercepted by Liam Williams, who sends it forward to concede the first lineout. Italy get us underway, Allan kicking towards the corner Anthem time, as two of the three best national anthems in the Six Nations get their airing. Plenty to look forward to from a Wales perspective today: Anscombe, James Davies, North’s return, Owen Watkin’s first Six Nations start, as Faletau assembles his men in the tunnel to lead out his country for the first time. The talismanic Parisse leasd out Italy. Out they come. Some pre-match Conor O’Shea chat: he’s looking forward to a quiet drink with his former Ireland boss Warren Gatland afterwards but on the pitch he stresses the importance of making sure the key moments go Italy’s way: “We had pivotal moments against England and France when it went away from us and we need to avoid that and keep pressure up. We need to focus on our execution in those key periods, like at 10-14 against France.” It’s a mild day in Cardiff but the roof is on. Why do they do that? It’s an outdoor sport damnit. Women’s Six Nations news: Italy have pulled off a fine win in the first match at the Principality Stadium today, beating Wales 22-15 to secure their first victory of the tournament and draw level on points with their hosts. Michela Sillari’s late try proved decisive. A late Wales change: Sansom Lee is out through illness, so Rhodri Jones takes his place on the bench instead. They line up thusly: Wales: L Williams; North, Watkin, Parkes, S Evans; Anscombe, G Davies; Smith, Dee, Francis, Hill, B. Davies, Tipuric, J. Davies, Faletau. Replacements: Owens, R Evans, Lee, S. Davies, Jenkins, A. Davies, Patchell, Halfpenny. Italy: Minozzi; Benvenuti, Bisegni, Castello, Bellini; Allan, Violi; Lovotti, Ghiraldini, Ferrari, Zanni, Budd, Negri, Mbanda, Parisse. Replacements: Fabiani, Quaglio, Pasquali, Ruzza, Licata, Palazzani, Canna, Hayward. Referee: Jérôme Garcès (France) Afternoon everyone. With the title done and dusted, it’s inevitable that a certain air of anticlimax will accompany the remaining four matches of this year’s Six Nations (other than the St Patrick’s day set-to at Twickenham), though today’s game in Cardiff was never going to be decisive in any case. For Wales, it’s a chance for another selectorial rejig as they seek to inject a little extra expansiveness into the late-Gatland era. Despite two defeats, Wales have probably performed better than expected this year, running England and Ireland much closer than many more downbeat fans expected they would. But they’ve made 10 changes from the side that lost in Dublin, giving first Six Nations starts to Owen Watkin and James Davies in a side with a free-running, free-wheelin’ look, what with Toby Faletau also returning. With Wales’s top three kickers out of the starting XV, they’ll need tries. Italy have in many respects gone backwards in recent seasons, Scotland’s transformation meaning they no longer have a regular sparring partner for wooden spoon honours, which invites the question of whether there should be some kind of promotion/relegation opportunity at the tournament’s bottom end. That said, Conor O’Shea is a smart strategist and his side have scored as many tries as Wales this year – and fine ones at that – and the experienced coach can see improvements taking shape as he embarks upon a serious restructuring job of the Italian setup. Defensive weaknesses mean you’d expect them to concede plenty today but score a few too. They’ve never won in Cardiff mind, though they did draw here 12 years ago when Wales were defending champions, albeit unravelling rapidly at that point. They’re firm underdogs today but this could be agreeably open and unpredictable. So hang around. Kick off is at 3pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/kevin-kadirgamar-we-have-a-duty-to-say-thats-not-who-we-are","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Kevin Kadirgamar: We have a duty to say that's not who we are","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/kevin-kadirgamar-we-have-a-duty-to-say-thats-not-who-we-are","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/03/kevin-kadirgamar-we-have-a-duty-to-say-thats-not-who-we-are","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Kadirgamar: We have a duty to say that's not who we are","bodyText":"In 1995 the Jaffna peninsula was being pounded by mortar by the Sri Lankan armed forces. The city of Jaffna had long been been a Tamil Tigers stronghold. Peace talks had broken down after the Tigers attacked and destroyed Sri Lankan navy gunboats and fired anti-aircraft missiles at airforce planes over Jaffna. In retaliation the newly elected president Chandrika Kumaratunga ordered an army offensive to retake the city. The battle of Jaffna raged throughout the year, bombing highly populated areas, displacing citizens, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians and sending thousands to the overcrowded hospital with serious injuries. For Tamil civilians, Jaffna was a dangerous place to be. “There was this heightened fear,” says lawyer Kevin Kadirgamar. He was six years old when his family fled. “I remember when things got really dangerous, I remember some hours of tension. We had to move from Jaffna down to Colombo, that was a bit of a process and quite an escapade.” The experience would give him a fundamental empathy for refugees of war. The Tamil family and their two young sons found shelter in Colombo. “But it was apparent that there was no real certainty, no real future for us in Sri Lanka.” His school teacher parents found jobs in the Maldives. “My parents had already made the decision that the long term future for their children was in Australia.” It took six years to get here, as the family went through the skilled migration pathway. It was a new start, a new identity. “I do feel like one of the lucky ones. In comparison to what some of my clients have had to go through, it doesn’t compare at all. To the extent of having to jump on a leaky boat to take an arduous journey to Australia.” The young Kadirgamar embraced his new country wholeheartedly, particularly its fairness and egalitarian rule of law. “We were really fortunate to come to a place like Darwin because regardless of cultural background which was celebrated, there was a real and strong sense of unity, as Northern Territorians and as Australians.” After high school, he remained in Darwin and attended Charles Darwin University. “By the time I had finished year 12, I had moved around through 10 different schools. Finally I felt in a place where I was rooted and had my network, my community around me. I felt like I really belonged.” He went on to help to establish Multicultural Youth NT, a youth-led initiative for positive change in the community. In his third year of law school, he started a clerkship with Ward Keller, Darwin’s oldest law firm. Just as he was about to graduate, the firm opened an immigration practice. This was at a time when detention centres started opening up in Darwin and asylum seekers were detained there. “We began to hear stories about the desperation in which they had left their countries and also the very bleak and very uncertain future they were facing. You are looking at people who have come from very difficult circumstances, who are not conversant in English most of the time. There weren’t many avenues to them to get legal representation to pursue applications which involve complex sets of criteria to be met.” They also didn’t have any money for lawyers, so Kadirgamar stepped in. “I was privileged to take on some of those cases on a pro bono basis.” The laws were toughening and intractable, the work is, in his words, “politically charged”. He adds: “And the more concerning [cases] related to young people and children who are just left with no legal avenue at all and face life in absolute limbo.” Mojgan Shamsalipoor, now 29, was in a Darwin detention centre when she met Kadirgamar. “I couldn’t afford to pay a lawyer, I had no hope. He just came into my life like a miracle and started working for me. When I didn’t have a voice and he became my voice and fought for me.” Shamsalipoor fled Iran as a teenager after suffering sexual abuse at the hands of relatives. Her sexual abuse, says Kadirgamar “was from people who had links to the Iranian government which made it far worse”. She was released into the community on a bridging visa while her application for refugee status was being considered. She was enrolled in a school in Brisbane and received treatment for post traumatic shock, before marrying an Australian permanent resident of Iranian descent. “She was among caring compassionate Australians and began to flourish”, says Kadirgamar. Yet her application for a protection visa was rejected, after she didn’t feel able to fully disclose her sexual abuse to the authorities. Without notice, she was dragged into a vehicle and flown to Wickham detention centre in Darwin. She was faced with returning to Iran or indefinite detention. “I could see the impact that was having on her mentally,” Kadirgamar says. “I see that in a lot of my clients. It is not the physical confines of the detention centre, or the conditions that cause the greatest harm. It is the mental anguish of not being able to see past the next day that has a draining impact.” While the immigration minister chose not to use his discretionary powers to intervene, numerous Australians have supported Shamsalipoor. She is now back in the community on a bridging visa. “What I have found is that government policy stands in stark contrast to the attitudes of many thousands of normal Australians who believe in fairness and compassion. That is what defines Australia,” says Kadirgamar. “He made us feel there is hope. Not false hope, but he approaches things in such a pragmatic way. He is just the most authentic person, he lives his beliefs and he lives his values,” says Jessica Walker, one of the teachers at Yeronga State High in Queensland who have advocated for Shamsalipoor. When he was a finalist for 2018 Young Australian of Year, Kadirgamar told reporters the treatment of asylum seekers is “a stain on the soul of our nation”. Now he says: “I was talking about people in offshore detention, Manus and Nauru. I have clients as young as five detained in those places. It leaves a lot to be desired in terms of fairness and compassion. There is a duty of citizenship for all of us to stand up and say no, that is not the country that we are, we do not accept that, and to jealously guard Australian values. We all have the opportunity to help them find a much brighter future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/01/donald-trump-white-house-trade-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T01:15:22Z","webTitle":"White House in turmoil: a tumultuous 24 hours – even by Trump standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/01/donald-trump-white-house-trade-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/01/donald-trump-white-house-trade-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"White House in turmoil: a tumultuous 24 hours – even by Trump standards","bodyText":"First Donald Trump ignited the fury of conservatives by embracing gun control measures in his signature freewheeling style. Then came the resignation of his longest-serving political aide. By the next morning, the stock market was plunging in the wake of Trump’s unexpected policy announcement on trade. While the US president is no stranger to chaos – it has been a hallmark of his year-long tenure – the last 24 hours brought turmoil to the White House that was exhausting, even by Trump’s standards. The perfect storm has arrived as Trump seeks to broker a deal on gun control following the 14 February high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead. The president convened a meeting on Wednesday afternoon with a bipartisan group of senators, reminiscent of a similarly televised policy discussion he held on immigration. But within hours, Trump had left lawmakers on Capitol Hill scrambling by backing comprehensive gun control measures long opposed by the National Rifle Association and congressional Republicans. The president signaled he would support universal background checks and new age restrictions on gun purchases; he even toyed with the idea of an assault weapons ban. Lawmakers had been eyeing a narrow compromise on background checks. But Trump’s endorsement of more expansive reforms, however temporary, gave ammunition to Democrats to bolster their demands of the Republican-led Congress. Back at the White House, the focus on policy was short-lived. Late on Wednesday afternoon, the White House communications director, Hope Hicks, announced her resignation. Hicks had testified the day before to congressional investigators on Russia that she occasionally had to tell white lies to appease her boss. While Hicks said she had long been mulling her exit, her decision to leave marked the latest high-profile departure from the White House and left Trump without one of his closest and most loyal confidantes. By Thursday morning, Trump had moved on to other matters. He used Twitter first thing to blast his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over the justice department’s handling of the Russia investigation. The attack drew a rare riposte from Sessions, prompting speculation over his future in the administration. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, was later unable to say if Trump planned to fire Sessions, simply stating: “Not that I know of.” The turbulence continued throughout the day. On Thursday afternoon, Roberta Jacobson, the US ambassador to Mexico, said she was resigning from her post. Although the veteran diplomat did not specify the reason for her departure, the announcement came amid strained relations with Trump, who has overseen a swift deterioration in US-Mexico relations. Trump was meanwhile poised to set off another firestorm. In a sudden move, Trump said his administration would impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as early as next week. The decision, made against the will of some of the president’s top advisers, sent the stock market into a tailspin and escalated the prospect of a global trade war. Even Trump’s former aides acknowledged the volatility at the White House had soared to new heights. “The morale is terrible … It’s messed up,” another former White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, told CNN Thursday. “It’ll be up to the president to figure out if he wants to fix it or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/02/oscars-2018-the-australian-contenders-and-their-chances","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T04:56:12Z","webTitle":"Oscars 2018: the Australian contenders and their chances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/oscars-2018-the-australian-contenders-and-their-chances","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/02/oscars-2018-the-australian-contenders-and-their-chances","fields":{"headline":"Oscars 2018: the Australian contenders and their chances","bodyText":"From Nicole Kidman’s prosthetic nose to acting royalty Cate Blanchett, nothing swells Australian pride like a national icon sweeping the Academy Awards. Geoffrey Rush was the first (living) Australian to win an Oscar in the best actor category. Russell Crowe followed suit four years later in 2001 with Gladiator, his Kiwi-ness swiftly forgotten in a flurry of popcorn parochialism. Despite Australia picking up a record 14 Oscar nominations in 2017, it has been a while since an Australian took out a top gong for acting. The number of Aussies nominated this year has been whittled down to just a handful – and all hope is being pinned on a former soapie star. Margot Robbie in the spotlight Margot Robbie is the Australian headliner at the 2018 Academy Awards – the Queensland-born star is one of five locals up for a gold statue. The Neighbours actor turned Hollywood household name has received a best actress nomination for her turn as American figure skater Tonya Harding in the mockumentary I, Tonya. Robbie, who is also one of I, Tonya’s producers, is up against Oscar royalty (namely Meryl Streep in The Post) and also faces fierce competition from Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water), Frances McDormand (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) and Saoirse Ronan (Lady Bird). While Robbie has received rapturous reviews for her “fantastically uninhibited performance as Tonya, fighting her way to the top from humble beginnings, frizzy of hair, angry of demeanour, often bringing out a raptor grimace on the ice”, she has already missed out on the Screen Actors Guild and Bafta awards (McDormand won both) and a Golden Globe (she lost to Ronan) for her portrayal. Whatever the outcome on the big night, Robbie has an appropriate Oscars face prepared. Behind the scenes Two Australians have been nominated this year in the best editing category – Lee Smith for Dunkirk is up against Paul Machliss for Baby Driver. Smith, a two-time Oscar nominee for The Dark Knight (2008) and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), is considered the favourite for his work on the spectacular second world war epic. Critics aren’t discounting him being beaten by co-editors Jonathan Amos and Machliss for Baby Driver, an action musical about a teenage getaway driver with tinnitus. Melbourne-born Machliss said Baby Driver was “the hardest job I’ve ever worked as an editor”, in which he cut the film in real time on location, ensuring the scenes synchronised meticulously with the soundtrack. Australian duo director Derin Seale and actor Josh Lawson are also up for awards as the only comedic contenders in the best live action short category for The Eleven O’Clock. The short film, which started life 13 years go as a script for Sydney’s Short + Sweet theatre competition, is about a new psychiatric patient who believes he is a psychiatrist. Comedies rarely take out the top prize, but as Lawson told Fairfax Media, maybe the timeliness of the topic will resonate with judges. “It’s a happy accident that it’s coming out now because for a short film about delusion and about someone who’s desperate to convince other people that they’re not crazy and to be respected and to crave power, which is what the film is about, I’d say look no further than the White House for parallels,” he said. “So it’s a timely piece that has accidentally found resonance in the current political climate.” In the bag Australian actors also make appearances in two films nominated for this year’s big picture award – former Home and Away star Jordan Rodrigues who plays Miguel in Lady Bird, and Ben Mendelsohn, who portrays King George VI in Darkest Hour. Even if no Australians walk off with a gold statue this year, they won’t go home empty-handed: a goodie bag worth an estimated A$130,000 awaits attendees. This year’s gifts are rumoured to include a “conflict-free” diamond necklace, a trip to Hawaii, gluten-free chocolate vodka, a genetic testing kit and a gum rejuvenation dental treatment. In 2017, Australia received a record 14 Oscar nominations, including two for best picture (Lion and Hacksaw Ridge). The only Australians to win were Andy Wright, Robert Mackenzie and Peter Grace for best sound mixing for Hacksaw Ridge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-bad-habits-undoing-again-manchester-city-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T22:13:51Z","webTitle":"Arsenal’s bad old habits prove their undoing once again in City defeat | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-bad-habits-undoing-again-manchester-city-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-bad-habits-undoing-again-manchester-city-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal’s bad old habits prove their undoing once again in City defeat","bodyText":"Contrary to recent evidence though it may seem, this was the most un-Arsenal of outcomes. The bigger disappointments of the past decade have generally been followed by flickerings of life, results pulled out of the fire in the nick of time, signs of enough incipient quality to maintain the illusion that it is darkest before the dawn. But Arsenal do not even have that to lean on any more. Arsène Wenger sent his team out with good intentions, a top-heavy starting XI designed to trade blows. But for the second time in five days they crumbled at the first sign of pressure from Manchester City, losing the game well before half-time where previously they would have summoned a germ of hope. An end-times feel permeates this team, this stadium, and there is no sense things will brighten before the most painful – but surely inevitable – of decisions is forced. Stripped of Sunday’s inconvenient context, this could even have been as good a time as any to face City. The continued absence of Raheem Sterling and fresh injury to Fernandinho were obvious points to exploit. City had been pegged back at Burnley and stumbled at Wigan in the past month while Arsenal have made a habit this season of showing up for home games against garlanded opponents. If they needed further encouragement, there was also their extra Thursday night know-how to fall back on. At the outset it was clear many of the home support had given this the full Thursday treatment. The gaps in the stands were redolent of a dark night of the soul against Östersund – or, to move things on, a meaningless final half-hour at Wembley. Social media rumblings during the day had suggested a consensus in favour of calling the whole thing off, a view that owed as much to Arsenal’s League Cup final freeze – and its wider ramifications – as the one that set bones rattling around north London. Flip things around, though, and there were points to be proved, mental strength to be shown off. Few of those present seemed to hold faith in those time-honoured maxims; the match kicked off to near-silence, obligation trumping belief for all bar the vocal segment of away fans, for whom the journey had seemed rather less trouble. Where there is a will, there is a way. The irony was that Arsenal, unlike the disinclined among their fanbase, turned up in the first quarter and might have scored either side of the two Silvas’ efforts. An off-beam Kevin De Bruyne diagonal intended for Leroy Sané had even sent Pep Guardiola pirouetting in frustration during a loose spell from City between the two. As on Sunday, the champions-elect did not look impregnable. City discovered again, though, that Arsenal are the great recidivists. Time and again it is the fine details that catch them out. At Wembley it was Claudio Bravo’s kicking range and this time it was Bernardo Silva’s liking for a left-foot curler. Silva is not Arjen Robben but anyone with the slightest knowledge of his oeuvre would have shown him outside after Sané’s snaking run had made the opportunity; instead Sead Kolasinac, surely one of the most premature recipients of cult hero status, offered the invitation and from there the die was cast. The second and third goals, each thrillingly conceived, bore testament both to the devastating quality of Arsenal’s opponents and their own confused, lumpen defending. When Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was gifted the chance to make a game of things his penalty, far too close to Ederson, perfectly fitted the tone of an evening whose backdrop had teetered from near-apathy to the brink of outright mutiny. Aubameyang is a world-class talent, and the Emirates has nurtured plenty of those. But he might wonder, now, at the environment he has wandered into; everything about Arsenal, in this deeply unhappy period, smacks of a club in cold storage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/04/our-final-mardi-gras-march-a-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"Our final Mardi Gras march – a photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/04/our-final-mardi-gras-march-a-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/04/our-final-mardi-gras-march-a-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"Our final Mardi Gras march – a photo essay","bodyText":"Dr Mark’s Marching Academy marches in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade to highlight issues facing its community. Over the past 19 years, 2,500 people have been part of the group’s float, while 6.1 million people have seen the float on the parade route. The group has been broadcast to more than 50 million viewers worldwide. This year was the float’s final appearance, with the group citing the parade’s growing commercialisation. Dr Mark who started Dr Mark’s Marching Academy in 1998. This year dance coach Bradford Jefferies and a team of organisers planned to put on the best show yet, to farewell one of the most recognised floats in the parade. Jefferies said: “Had I not witnessed community floats like ours, that began to transform how I saw myself and my sexuality, I would not be the person I am today. There are so many people this parade has an effect on and there are so many people that read stories and watch broadcasts of us from all over the world that see this as a bastion of hope. That we can celebrate who we are. That we are proud.” This year, the group’s theme was Ignite my Fire, encouraging the participants to be true to their own individual stories, and six of those stories stood out. We all have a shared story and a shared narrative by being in this float and in that, we have a shared solidarity. We all belong. We all have a place. And you are loved. Don’t forget that – Bradford Jefferies Kym Doherty marched with her son in a previous Mardi Gras. He couldn’t participate this year but she still wanted to take part. The spirit and sense of community is slowly being eroded from the parade. We have gone from a group of 400 to a group of 80. And community groups are continually pushed to the side to make way for commercial floats that have money to spend – Bradford Jefferies Amanda Jane Baus I am marching this year because this time last year I was fighting for my life undergoing chemo and radiation for lymphoma. I was pretty much at my worst and we had a small celebration at home. I told myself and my best friend, Claire, that we would march in 2018. That was my goal. It’s such a great feeling to not only be alive but to be able to be a part of this amazing experience to celebrate love, equality and acceptance. To be able to be who you are without judgment. That’s what it’s all about. This was my first time marching in the parade and I also performed at the after party as one of 20 dancers chosen to open the show. This time last year I was not sure I would be here to see another Mardi Gras but I fought and I am now in remission. Tamara Mason in Hyde Park ahead of the march. Molly Taifik on the stairs at Hyde Park before the March Kelly Bassett, Nathan Kelly and Briana Charters-Wood We are marching this year because, as with most people in Sydney, we tend to come from different backgrounds and countries and, like many a Sydney tribe, our group became more than simply a group of friends and leaned further toward a family. Our Sydney family would do almost everything together and an extremely close bond was formed. One of the closest bonds was with myself and Dean Cobbe, who we would joke was my “symbolic husband”. Dean and myself would spend hours on the phone, weekends together, evenings together. When our Sydney tribe got together, Dean was always key to the dynamic of the group. In 2016 our close group took part in Mardi Gras and this was a huge deal for us as the message Mardi Gras presents is core to the values we all believe in so much. Dean, unfortunately, took his own life not so long ago and, after the tears had subsided, Nathan, Briana and I could think of no better way to celebrate Dean’s energetic life than by taking part, once again, in Mardi Gras. Only this time without our Dean and instead dedicating it to his memory. Dr Mark’s Dancing Academy during a pre-march rehearsal. Leanne Elliot Jay McAlister I am marching this year because before Mardi Gras I avoided LGBTIQ events like the plague. As a queer trans guy with mental illness, living in the “not as rainbow as it preaches” city of Canberra, my dysphoria and anxiety were out of control. I was, and am, misgendered daily, so when I went to queer gatherings, continuing to be called “she” and mistaken for a butch woman, I felt betrayed and rejected by the community that I was meant be accepted by. The idea of participating was rather forced upon me by my cousin two years ago – I got a text in December saying “Merry Xmas, you’re doing Dr Mark’s with me!” Usually I’d overthink and convince myself not to, but I impulsively agreed and I wouldn’t have it any other way. When I marched in the parade, it was the first time that I felt safe in a group of people and in my own community. I was euphoric. It is now over a year since I started my medical transition and a year since my first Mardi Gras. Needless to say, Mardi Gras will always hold a special place in my heart. Bradford Jefferies’ whole family including his parents marched this year. Above, his sister, Jessica Rooker. Bon Kuil-Hartikainen and David Kuil-Hartikainen We are marching this year to celebrate being newlyweds, having our wedding three weeks ago. We shared the day with our close family and friends and we wanted to celebrate with the larger community being recognised as equal under the law. Coming off the back of a rough public vote for our rights, it almost feels like a victory lap in a strange way. In what will be our first year of marriage and Mardi Gras’ 40th anniversary, what better time to march and celebrate? Arlene Jefferies, Bradford’s mother. Jason Bush marching with the Dr Mark’s Dance Academy for his fourth year. Kevin Jefferies I am marching this year to show my support that it is never OK to take away an individual’s rights – everyone has a right to choose and the parade is a celebration about returning this right through the recent law change. It is also an opportunity to support our son who has organised this float and brought together this team to help celebrate a new era. It is really important for me to be marching with my son to demonstrate how proud we are of him, the open relationship we have, that he has our total support and to acknowledge that he has a right to choose. It is not about what I may or may not think, this is about individual rights so I am pleased to be celebrating this momentous occasion in our history with Bradford. Maddi Button in the middle of the dance routine. Monica Ulibarri I’m marching this year because, growing up in Mexico and attending Catholic school for 12 years, I never had any interaction with the gay and lesbian community – in fact, it was not accepted. When I worked at SBS, I had the fortune of working with several coworkers of the LGBTIQ ️‍ community who invited me to participate in my first Mardi Gras in 2008. It was an eye opener. I felt so connected and so happy to support their right to be considered equal and to fight for their rights. This year marks the 10th anniversary of participating in the parade and Dr Mark’s Marching Academy has been a wonderful group of people. I encourage all of us to “ignite” the fire within us, be proud of who we are and support equality. Gina Kelly and Chrystie Klein We are marching this year to celebrate four years since the event that changed both our lives – Mardi Gras 2014 – one of us married with two children, the other a single lesbian from Melbourne. We met under the giant mirror ball in the Royal Hall of Industries at the start of the Mardi Gras after party. Our eyes locked, a flame ignited in both of us and we kissed before even speaking. We both knew at an incredibly profound level that we had found each other and were destined to be together even despite our circumstances. It was the most exciting and fabulous public event we had ever been a part of. Four years on, we are happily living together and plan to get married."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T21:53:17Z","webTitle":"Leroy Sané is catalytic converter as Manchester City pummel Arsenal again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/01/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leroy Sané is catalytic converter as Manchester City pummel Arsenal again","bodyText":"The countdown has started. Manchester City now need just five wins from their remaining 10 games to secure a third Premier League title in seven years. If everything goes as serenely as it has done for most of the season, they could sew it up at Tottenham Hotspur on the night of Saturday 14 April. Circle it in your diary. It would be the coronation of a superbly slick and worthy champion team and the latest layer to Pep Guardiola’s managerial legend. As for Arsenal, a more macabre countdown is in train. Arsène Wenger has pledged to fight into next season – the last on his managerial contract – but nobody believes he can stay beyond the summer. On this evidence, his players are the principal naysayers. After the 3-0 humbling at City’s hands in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final, they needed a performance to restore a measure of pride. Instead they got another one of those 90 minutes when their fragility was exposed in glaring fashion. Arsenal have not lost this heavily at home to City since they dropped the Woolwich from their name, but there was nothing surprising about the result. Their self-belief has come to feel non-existent and the manner in which they were picked off by City in the first half reflected the sense of drift. Leroy Sané made the difference. The City winger helped set up goals for Bernardo Silva and David Silva before he scored the third himself and Arsenal were left to consider a 30-point chasm that has opened up between themselves and their opponents. It was an occasion when the home support appeared to vote with their feet. The Emirates was half-empty and at kick-off time there was the feel of an early round cup replay. The biting cold was a factor but – on paper, at least – this was one of the showpiece fixtures of the season. The low attendance laid bare the supporter disenchantment. Wenger’s team had actually started well. With Aaron Ramsey prominent, they hustled and probed. Ramsey cut back a cross that hit Vincent Kompany and forced Ederson into a smart save while Henrikh Mkhitaryan also worked the City goalkeeper. But it took only one flicker from City to see them in front and, very quickly, Arsenal’s confidence disintegrated. “You go up by the stairs, you go down by the lift,” Wenger said of the difficulty in building belief and the ease with which it can slide. Arsenal’s movement and spontaneity abandoned them, but not nearly as noticeably as their resolve at the back. It felt as though City would score with every forward thrust before the interval. Sané was the catalyst. Showing his balance, control and acceleration, he left three Arsenal players for dead before working it wide right for Bernardo Silva. Sead Kolasinac decided to show the winger inside, on to his favoured left foot, and the finish was curled beautifully into the far corner. Arsenal tried to look forwards and they had half-chances in the first half. But they were cut to shreds on the counterattack and, if it was easy to wince at the defending, it was also pertinent to scrutinise the lack of defensive midfield cover. Arsenal were grotesquely open. That said, City’s cohesion and ruthlessness was really something. Sané was the architect of the second goal, dropping his shoulder to destroy Shkodran Mustafi before squaring for Sergio Agüero. He touched through for David Silva, who fired high inside Petr Cech’s near post. City’s third came with indecent haste. Agüero spun clear and they worked the ball with precision via Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker to Sané, who had got in on Héctor Bellerín’s blindside. He finished almost apologetically. Agüero ought to have added a fourth before the interval, only to be denied by Cech, and there were the inevitable boos from the home crowd at half-time. A small section of the Arsenal support chanted that their players were not fit to wear the shirt. Arsenal even threw in a penalty miss early in the second-half – Ederson springing to his left to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, after Nicolás Otamendi had fouled Mkhitaryan – and it would have been worse for them had Cech not saved from Agüero on 78 minutes. The stadium was practically empty of Arsenal fans at full-time but those who did stay jeered the players as they left the field. It felt like the end for Wenger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/01/skunk-criminalisation-drugs-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T18:43:47Z","webTitle":"Skunk is causing misery – criminalisation isn’t working | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/skunk-criminalisation-drugs-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/skunk-criminalisation-drugs-reform","fields":{"headline":"Skunk is causing misery – criminalisation isn’t working","bodyText":"Can Britain ever kill its worst taboo? This week’s news of the soaring prevalence of skunk, in place of weaker and less harmful herbal forms of cannabis, is appalling. With other news of prison chaos due to an epidemic of artificial cannabis (spice), government drugs policy is devoid of coherence – and clearly lethal. Deaths from drug misuse are now at an all-time high. You can tell the state of a society, said Alexis de Tocqueville, by its prisons. Today you tell it by its attitude to drugs. Ten years ago the Labour government recklessly upgraded cannabis from class C to class B, “because of concerns of its impact on mental health”. Then they were minimal. After reclassification, police evidence is that 95% of cannabis used is now skunk. Older forms of “weed” are vanishing. I regard drugs as the most serious avoidable cause of mental disorder, misery, crime and imprisonment, and have done my time on drug reform committees, including the 2000 Police Foundation inquiry. We advised a downgrading (though sadly not legalisation) of cannabis. Labour’s home secretary, Jack Straw, was horrified, and his successors reacted by upgrading. All evidence I saw on narcotics led to two conclusions. One is that most psychoactive drugs, which include alcohol and nicotine, are a bad idea and some are unquestionably dangerous. The other is that, since suppression is impossible, criminalisation leaves supply in the hands of crooks and is therefore a menace. It creates crime at every point in the market and makes all drugs more dangerous – as prohibition did alcohol. The only answer is legalisation and control. British drug consumption has marginally fallen over the past decade, but with a shift from softer drugs to harder ones. The rise is of chemical and synthetic drugs that are easy to adulterate. As for skunk, Marta Di Forti of King’s College London said of this week’s findings: “The increase of high-potency cannabis on the streets poses a significant hazard to users’ mental health.” It induces personality changes, memory loss and deterioration. It can wreck young lives. Narcotics will never be eliminated – nor have they ever been. But driving them undercover makes it impossible to license or monitor quality. The government cannot even police its own prisons, Britain’s most concentrated market for spice and for the lethal opioid fentanyl. While some police forces such as Durham have, along with most prison governors, de facto decriminalised cannabis by declining to prosecute possession, others are less liberal. Even outside prison, the police over the past five years have reportedly locked up 30,000 cannabis users overnight at a cost of £13.5m. As for spice, last year Manchester police recorded 58 ambulance callouts to victims in one weekend alone. The NHS must sweep up the home secretary’s mess. Every move towards liberalising Britain’s drug laws is opposed by every government. Reform has been proposed by doctors, backbenchers, police chiefs, the press and pressure groups from right and left. Even the Mail on Sunday once featured a Mori opinion poll supporting legalisation. Yet in 2014, when MPs investigated foreign experience with legalisation, the home secretary, Theresa May, was so scared of the findings she sought to censor publication. She reflected a deep cultural aversion to letting other people enjoy, or make a mess of, their own lives. Her attitude to drugs was, like the Saudi attitude to women, an ingrained prejudice, deaf to reason. British policy is now completely adrift of the rest of the western world. It is light years behind Donald Trump’s America, where half the states have legalised cannabis to some degree. In 1990 Trump himself said: “You have to legalise drugs to win the war.” Even today he supports medicinal cannabis. In California, recreational marijuana will be freely available in licensed premises from next month. The US cannabis market is predicted to reach $50bn in 10 years. Colorado’s state revenues have already been transformed by an annual $200m in drug taxes, with the money going to schools and clinics. There are even courses for “cannabis sommeliers”. Canada is bidding to become a major producer of marijuana. In Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany – almost everywhere – hard and soft drugs are being brought under state regulation. In the Netherlands there is no market for synthetic cannabis, as the real stuff is legal. Dutch prisons are being closed down, or rented to Norway to keep going. Of course experience is mixed. A common mistake is to legalise consumption but leave supply criminalised, unlicensed and therefore untested. In some countries consumption has risen, in others fallen. Nowhere has society collapsed. Everywhere, drug-related crime has been reduced. As it is, the market booms thanks to the internet. The UN drugs agency last year recorded some 700 “new psychoactive substances”, flooding both the open and the dark web. Britain’s response, almost unique, is to turn a blind eye and leave its virtually open market unpoliced. The 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act on “legal highs” made no effort to discriminate good from bad. It just banned everything – except of course alcohol. It pretended that “something had to be done”. Back in 2002 a certain opposition MP pleaded for an end to Britain’s “lowest common denominator” approach to drugs, to “posturing with tough policies and crackdown after crackdown” – all to no effect. The MP was David Cameron, who went on to oversee the passage of the 2016 act. The truth is that the prevalence of harmful drugs in Britain is not caused by policy. It is caused by politicians. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/02/sadiq-khan-vows-action-over-london-public-workers-ethnicity-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"London mayor Sadiq Khan vows action over public workers' ethnicity pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/02/sadiq-khan-vows-action-over-london-public-workers-ethnicity-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/02/sadiq-khan-vows-action-over-london-public-workers-ethnicity-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"London's public workers face 'ethnicity pay gap' of up to 37%","bodyText":"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has pledged to take action after a pioneering pay audit found that the city’s black and minority ethnic public employees were paid anything up to 37% less on average than their white counterparts, with an especially severe difference in the police. The ethnicity earnings audit covered all organisations in the Greater London authority group, which covers the mayoralty and City Hall, Transport for London (TfL), the city’s police and fire services and various development corporations. The ethnicity audit found that the pay gap was “particularly stark” at the Met police, the Greater London authority and the two development corporations. It found varying pay gaps, ranging from none at all in the London fire brigade to 9.8% at TfL, 16.7% at the Metropolitan police and 37.5% at the Old Oak and Park Royal development corporation, which runs a major redevelopment project in the north-west of the city. A report into the gaps found they were caused not by black and minority ethnic (BME) employees being paid less for the same job, but by an under-representation of people from such backgrounds in senior jobs. This mirrors the findings of a gender pay audit published by the mayoralty in late 2016, which found gaps ranging from nothing to more than 30% because of a lack of women in top jobs. Khan said: “I am deeply troubled that members of the black, Asian and minority ethnic community who work at these organisations earn on average less than their white counterparts, and I am determined to confront this inequality. “This sort of injustice takes many years to develop and it becomes deeply entrenched. My administration is finally beginning the process of turning this around.” Steps introduced to try to close the gap include anonymised recruitment, which removes names from applications, as well as unconscious bias training and a new diversity and inclusion management board. Khan said he urged all London businesses and public bodies to take similar action, and said the government should consider legislation to make ethnicity pay audits a legal requirement, as they are for gender pay. Scotland Yard said in a statement: “The report makes it very clear that the pay of police officers and staff in the Met is determined by role, with no reference to ethnicity. Individuals of different ethnic backgrounds who undertake the same role, have the same length of service and work the same hours, receive the same pay. “However, a gap emerges when the average pay of BME officers and staff in the Met is compared to the average pay of their white colleagues due to a number of factors including; less length of service for BME officers and staff; fewer BME officers and staff in higher-paid roles; and historical allowances such as rent and housing allowance that some colleagues with longer service still receive. The Met is working hard to address the gap.” The ethnic pay gaps for the organisations were: Old Oak and Park Royal development corporation: 37.5% London legacy development corporation: 30% Metropolitan police: 16.7% Greater London authority: 16% Transport for London: 9.8% Mayor’s office for policing and crime: 3.5% London fire brigade: 0%"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/us-ambassador-to-mexico-resigns-amid-strained-relations","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T19:12:21Z","webTitle":"US ambassador to Mexico resigns amid strained relations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/us-ambassador-to-mexico-resigns-amid-strained-relations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/us-ambassador-to-mexico-resigns-amid-strained-relations","fields":{"headline":"US ambassador to Mexico resigns amid strained relations","bodyText":"The US ambassador to Mexico is resigning from her post as the US-Mexico relationship sours and Donald Trump’s discourtesies toward Mexico make diplomacy increasingly difficult. Veteran diplomat Roberta Jacobson told embassy staff in a note on Thursday that she was leaving at “a critical moment” in the US-Mexico relationship. Jacobson’s resignation will take effect on 5 May, two years to the day after she was sworn in as ambassador. “After 31 years in US Government service, I will be leaving in early May to pursue other opportunities. I do it knowing the US-Mexico relationship is strong and vital and that this amazing Mission Mexico team will continue to ensure it remains so,” she said. “Mexico is in my heart and soul, and I will continue to do all I can to live up to my own words: somos más fuerte juntos! [We are stronger together]” She did not say why she made the decision, but tweeted that was leaving “in search of other opportunities”. Diplomatic ties between Washington and Mexico City have been strained since before Trump took office, and appear to be further deteriorating as the US president continues insisting Mexico pay for his proposed border wall – something the Mexican government has rejected out of hand. “Even at a time of bilateral tension she tried to serve as a communications link. At the same time, she had to be some sort of buffer for President’s Trump criticism of Mexico,” said foreign affairs analyst Brenda Estefan. Trump recently “lost his temper” in a telephone conversation with Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, according to the Washington Post, prompting the Mexican leader to cancel a planned trip to Washington for the second time. Along with Canada, the two countries are currently in a seventh round of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Former Mexican diplomats expressed dismay with Jacobson’s departure and praised her professionalism when Trump’s intemperate language and tweets have tormented bilateral relations. “She was always a partner in building a strategic, forward-looking relationship between Mexico and the US, and understood that the security, prosperity and wellbeing of our two peoples and nations were intricately bound,” said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. “She will be sorely missed at a time when this relationship is being severely challenged.” The Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, has dealt with the Trump administration by working closely with the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and at times appearing to bypass the state department. “A country’s bilateral relationship should be managed institutionally and I’m not sure we see that now,” said Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China. “Even though there are many areas of cooperation between Mexico and the United States, at the end of the day the message that both administrations try to put forward is the fact that Videgaray is good friends with Kushner.” Jacobson previously served as assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs. After the United States and Cuba re-established diplomatic relations in 2014, Jacobson led negotiations with Havana – making her the target of criticism from Cuban-American politicians and triggering a long delay in her Senate confirmation as ambassador to Mexico. Since arriving in Mexico, Jacobson – the first female US ambassador in the country – has often spoken out on contentious issues such as human rights violations and the murders of journalists. Her participation in Pride celebrations has drawn scorn from Mexican conservatives. Jacobson is the latest in a string senior diplomats to leave the state department after Donald Trump’s election: the US has lost more than half its career ambassadors and many other senior diplomats since Trump took office. Last month, Tom Shannon, the state department’s most senior career diplomat – and another Americas expert – announced that he was stepping down. In January, the US ambassador to Panama resigned, saying he was no longer able to serve under Donald Trump. Jacobson offered no news on her replacement. José Díaz-Briseño, Washington correspondent for the newspaper Reforma, reported on Thursday that Trump would name the former General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre as ambassador to Mexico. Whitacre was once a business partner of Carlos Slim when the Mexican telecom magnate won an auction privatising the Telmex telephone monopoly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/06/stable-hand-beekeeper-trainee-spy-the-unorthodox-apprenticeships-filling-a-niche","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T15:45:31Z","webTitle":"Stable hand, beekeeper … trainee spy: the unorthodox apprenticeships filling a niche","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/stable-hand-beekeeper-trainee-spy-the-unorthodox-apprenticeships-filling-a-niche","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/06/stable-hand-beekeeper-trainee-spy-the-unorthodox-apprenticeships-filling-a-niche","fields":{"headline":"Stable hand, beekeeper … trainee spy: the unorthodox apprenticeships filling a niche","bodyText":"Want to try something different? Apprenticeships are a way into unusual careers that you may not have heard of. Employers in niche parts of the economy are looking for people prepared to break the mould and step into their sometimes very different worlds. And you don’t have to be a school leaver. Career changers, too, can become apprentices and learn whole new skills. Take the wine industry, for example. England has 502 vineyards and 133 wineries according to the Wine Standards Board and it’s a growing industry. If you have a taste for the finer things in life and want the chance to work outdoors, then training to run a vineyard might be the one for you. The chance to work the land attracted Lucy Walker when she saw an advert for an apprentice vineyard operative. “I had an administrative job in an English language college,” she says, “and then went to Egypt to teach English. While I was there, I volunteered at a sustainable farm in the Sinai and started to think about growing things and living off the land and ecology.” She is now at Plumpton College, East Sussex, on the two-year apprenticeship, working alongside a former apprentice who now has a full-time job at the vineyard. The college offers a range of courses linked to the wine industry and has its own vineyards, producing 40,000 bottles of wine a year. “There are a lot of vineyards around here and they do need workers,” says Walker, 39, who lives in Hove. “And once I have qualified, I will be able to get work and potentially become a vineyard manager. I studied French and Spanish at university and that might come in useful if I want to work in different parts of the world, such as the south of France or northern Spain. “It’s a change of lifestyle for sure. I’ve given up a salary of £26,000 a year to live on £5.60 an hour for a 37-hour week. Next year, it will go up to £7.50 an hour. It will be a struggle financially but I’m getting paid to learn and I should be able to get a well-paid job in the end so it’s worth it. Also, it’s nice to be out in the field in the college vineyards, especially on a sunny day, and it pleases my dad! He has a huge wine cellar and while my mother was worried about my pay cut, he said: ‘It’s really interesting, go for it,’” she adds. There are lots of other unorthodox apprenticeships around. Here’s a taster: Automotive clay modeller Today’s cars are designed with the use of sophisticated computer technology, but when it comes to a model of the finished product they turn to old-fashioned clay. Modellers transform the design drawings into quarter or full-size 3D models. Farrier Blacksmiths can make horseshoes but, by law, only registered farriers and their apprentices or qualified veterinary surgeons are allowed to fit them. It’s an ancient craft but it is unlikely to be taken over by technology. Radio plugger You might think that hit singles get to the top on pure merit. Think again. Behind the scenes is an army of radio “pluggers” employed by artists and labels to lobby radio stations and get on their playlists. It can be a lucrative career, but not one for the fainthearted. Glass blower An apprenticeship with a master glassblower is the best way to learn this traditional craft which is still in demand today. It’s not all puff though. You will need a good eye for design and a grasp of the industry and the market. Stable hand If you love riding, then this is a way to make your passion your career. You train to manage the yard, which means responsibility for the overall welfare of horses. But you will also deal with trainers and vets, so you’ve got to like people as well. Computer games tester A dream job for gamers, but it could be a test of your patience. Testers need to check different levels, detect and find the cause of faults, compare games with others on the market and even check the spelling. Beekeeper You’ve heard of dairy farming and pig farming but what about bee farming? The UK produces only 14% of the honey it consumes compared with the European average of 60%. Bee farmers are taking on apprentices to help them improve crop yields, so this could be a growth area post-Brexit. Diamond mounter Once you’ve mastered the skills of jewellery making, you can take a leap into the luxury market through an advanced level apprenticeship in diamond mounting. You will be handling valuable stones and, one day, you might be able to afford them. Trainee spy Get an insight into the hidden world of national security and help keep the country safe.

It has been more than three decades since FGM was made illegal in the UK, but there is yet to be a successful prosecution. The first case, in 2015, resulted in an NHS doctor being acquitted in less than 30 minutes. In the runup to the trial DCI Pook, the FGM police lead for Avon and Somerset, said she felt a huge sense of responsibility to prove the police were taking the hidden crime seriously. Yet, far from becoming a landmark victory, the Bristol case collapsed last month after a judge at Bristol Crown Court ordered the jury to return a verdict of not guilty and described aspects of the case as “deeply troubling”. According to estimates by City University, there are 137,000 girls and women living with FGM, and 144,000 girls at risk of FGM in England and Wales. The Home Office has identified women from a number of east African communities – including Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia – as well as Nigeria, the Middle East and Indonesia, as being most at risk. As a third trial is set to open at the Old Bailey next week – this time a case brought by the Metropolitan police – new figures obtained by the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organisation (IKWRO) show a nearly fivefold increase in reports of alleged FGM to police forces in the UK. Over a three-year period between 2014 and the end of 2016, responses by 47 police forces to freedom of information requests show there were 1,337 reported cases of FGM, and that they had risen from 137 in 2014 to 647 in 2016. But, according to the latest data from the Crown Prosecution Service, there have been just 36 referrals of alleged FGM to the CPS since 2010. Diana Nammi, executive director at IKWRO, a charity that supports survivors of “honour” crimes, says: “While I am encouraged that the statistics show more cases of FGM than ever before are being reported to the police, following the introduction of mandatory reporting [by health and social care professionals and teachers in October 2015], I am extremely concerned that we are not seeing more cases progress through the criminal justice system.” Part of the problem is obtaining enough proof to secure a conviction. A CPS spokesman says: “Prosecutors work closely with police offering early advice, but when a case is referred to the CPS for a charging decision, a prosecution can only be brought where there is sufficient evidence.” Inspector Allen Davis, the FGM lead for the Met, points out that the reports it receives include many where a child might be at risk but no offence has been committed – as well as cases where a person may have undergone FGM before taking up residency in the UK. Davis says enforcement is important because of the message it sends out, and he insists that the police are “absolutely committed” to securing prosecutions. But he acknowledges this is not easy. “Often you are relying on a child giving evidence against someone close to them,” he explains. He urges professionals to fulfil their duty in sharing information with the police. “The police can only respond to what they are told about.” The data does not tell the stories of children at risk who the police have protected through FGM protection orders, says Davis. There have been more than 200 such orders issued in the last three years in the UK. They include a number of restrictions such as surrendering passports in order to prevent a girl being subjected to horrific abuse. “That is a far better outcome than any prosecution,” says Davies. Leethen Bartholomew, head of the National FGM Centre, agrees: “Yes, we want a prosecution but prevention is also key.” Charlotte Proudman, a human rights barrister, who has recently completed a PhD in FGM law and policy, interviewed 40 women from Somali communities in London, Leicester and Birmingham, held two focus groups on FGM and also spoke to 39 professionals. She says finding out who performs FGM in the UK is extremely difficult. “I was told girls are being cut, and sometimes women before they get married,” she says. “They know where to go in the community but keep it very close to their chests and don’t inform people about what is going on.” It is so underground that the task of locating those carrying it out remains incredibly difficult.” “I was told anecdotally that type 4 FGM [where a smaller incision or prick is made to the female genitals] is on the rise as a way of performing FGM without it being easily detectable. But, symbolically, it can still be said the woman has had FGM.” Her research also indicates that some girls were being cut as babies before they went to school to keep the illegal practice under the radar. At one focus group in London, she says participants spoke about women travelling to Birmingham to have FGM done by a quasi-medical practitioner but couldn’t get any more details. Proudman found that because many affected communities are socially isolated, or resistant to dealing with public services, it makes gathering intelligence incredibly difficult. “Those involved are savvy and know what the law is, but will find ways to evade it.” Aneeta Prem, founder of the Freedom Charity, has written a fictional account of FGM called Cut Flowers, which includes lesson plans that have been used in more than 200 schools to raise awareness of the illegal practice. Since more than 8,000 copies of her book have been distributed to pupils, a number of girls, and some as young as 13 in London, have come forward to disclose they have been cut, says Prem. “At one school in London, two girls aged 13 and 14 revealed they had had FGM performed on them in this country. The 13-year-old said she had been cut by her aunt.” At another school in the Midlands, eight girls disclosed they had undergone FGM, with many saying they had been cut abroad, says the charity. “One 16-year-old who came forward to her teachers said she had been cut at the age of 14 and her family had told her that is what happens to all girls. She was full of rage and said, ‘I’ve been lied to.’” Even though there is an anonymous helpline they can call, Prem says many teachers feel uncomfortable reporting abuse because the girls do not want the police involved. “It is very delicate, but the key thing about FGM is that it is child abuse and should be treated as such,” she stresses. Prem says that one woman from the Somali community in London told her that it costs £200 to be cut in the UK. “She said if you get a number of girls together it is much cheaper than going abroad. But when pressed for more information she realised she had said too much and clammed up.” Nammi says more work is needed to improve evidence gathering. “It is worrying that we are hearing reports that some professionals are still not reporting cases despite their duty to do so. It is crucial those at risk are safeguarded.” Rakhia Ismail, an Islington in north London and a Somali community leader, says: “If people are carrying out FGM they should be convicted, but in three decades we are yet to see any concrete evidence that this is happening in the UK.” • The NSPCC FGM helpline is 0800 028 3550"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/01/boris-blusters-his-way-around-his-40m-garden-bridge-fiasco","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T17:40:15Z","webTitle":"Boris blusters his way around his £40m garden bridge fiasco | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/01/boris-blusters-his-way-around-his-40m-garden-bridge-fiasco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/01/boris-blusters-his-way-around-his-40m-garden-bridge-fiasco","fields":{"headline":"Boris blusters his way around his £40m garden bridge fiasco","bodyText":"This hasn’t been the best of weeks for the foreign secretary. First he got caught out comparing Northern Ireland to London’s congestion charge zone. Then a letter he wrote to the prime minister suggesting a hard border was a price worth paying for Brexit got leaked to Sky News. Now he had to face the Greater London Authority’s oversight committee to explain why, when he was London mayor, he had wasted the best part of £40m on a garden bridge project for the Thames that never got built. There’s a growing sense the past is beginning to catch up with him. The noose is tightening and there will be a reckoning to be paid. Boris Johnson was a few minutes late for the session, which allowed several committee members to be overheard discussing whether he would be a suitable contestant for the TV dating show Take Me Out. The committee chair, Len Duvall, hurriedly reminded everyone that their microphones were on and the session was being broadcast so they might want to be careful about what they were saying. “That Boris Johnson is a brilliant chap,” said another member sarcastically. Once the foreign secretary was in place, Duvall laid out the line of questioning. How there had been serious irregularities in the tendering and procurement process, with the former mayor appearing to have clearly backed one bid right from the start, and how public money had been poured into the project even when it was clear it was in serious difficulties as the necessary land had not even been acquired nor planning conditions met. “May I say what a pleasure it is to be back here,” said Boris. Duvall quickly reminded him that it can’t have been that much of a pleasure as he had resisted all previous attempts to get him to explain his actions while in office, and that the only reason he was here today was because he had received a formal legal summons. Boris shrugged. Whatever. The truth is a moving target for the foreign secretary and he would rather believe he had come under his own volition. “I take these proceedings very seriously,” he said. But he didn’t. He really didn’t. He treated them in the same way as he treats most things. As a joke. Apart from anything else he couldn’t really see what the problem was. To him £40m of public money is neither here nor there. It’s chicken feed. Money that can be conjured out of the public purse to feed his own fantasies. Time and again, the committee would try to get Boris to focus on the details. “All the evidence that we have contradicts the version of events you are giving,” Duvall interrupted. Boris took no notice. This may have been a GLA oversight committee, but it was his show. Everything always is for Boris. He is his own one-man reality show. A real-life version of the Truman Show. The Johnson Show, with everyone else bit part players, orbiting his sun like satellites. So he just rambled on, resisting all attempts to silence him. For Boris, the real tragedy wasn’t that the money had been wasted but that more hadn’t been spent. If only Sadiq Khan hadn’t pulled the plug on a scheme that would rival his disused cable-car crossing, then London would have had a landmark bridge to make it the envy of the entire galaxy. The normal rules of engagement didn’t apply for visionaries like him. Sure a few corners might have been cut, but that was all for the benefit of a glorious future that small-minded bureaucrats like the committee couldn’t begin to comprehend. The world should be thanking him, not questioning him. Besides, he had so much more to give than a piddling garden bridge. What he really wanted was to build a bridge across the Channel. Vanity, thy name is Boris. Look on my works ye mighty and despair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/02/will-corporate-backlash-against-guns-actually-change-anything","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Will corporate backlash against guns actually change anything?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/will-corporate-backlash-against-guns-actually-change-anything","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/will-corporate-backlash-against-guns-actually-change-anything","fields":{"headline":"Will corporate backlash against guns actually change anything?","bodyText":"Corporations – at least according to the US supreme court – are people too. And it seems in the wake of last month’s horrific school massacre in Florida they have had enough with America’s seemingly endless cycle of mass shootings. Driven by popular outrage over the last week companies across the spectrum have severed ties with gun lobby group the National Rifle Association (NRA) or moved to tighten up sales of guns in ways the federal government has consistently failed to do. While companies usually try to steer clear of political debate this is not the first time that US corporations have successfully pushed liberal social issues in recent years. Big companies including Apple and Bank of America have backed same-sex marriage and forced North Carolina to water down a bill that forced transgender people to use the bathroom that matches the gender on their birth certificate. But despite the fact that most Americans are in favour of greater gun control, it has proved depressingly difficult to push Washington or the gun companies and their retailers to tighten up ownership rules. There is no doubt, however, that after the murder of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, the pressure for action is mounting. Following that massacre on 14 February protesters have taken to social media demanding change and later this month they will take to the streets. The initial campaign to force companies to stop offering discounts to NRA members has been a success. The NRA claims to have 5 million members – the figure is disputed – but those numbers were not enough to stop companies including Delta, United Airlines, Alamo, Hertz and Best Western to drop their NRA deals. The NRA – a potent force in US politics – called them “cowardly”, but the backlash has continued. On Wednesday Dick’s Sporting Goods and WalMart, two of the country’s largest gun retailers, moved to tighten up sales of guns. WalMart said it would no longer sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age, raising that from 18. Dick’s immediately ended sales of all assault-style rifles like the one used in Florida in its stores. “We did everything by the book,” Dick’s CEO Ed Stack said of accused Florida shooter Nicolas Cruz, who bought a gun from his company, although it was not used in the killings. “We did everything that the law required, and still he was able to buy a gun. And when we looked at that, we said the systems that are in place across the board just aren’t effective enough to keep us from selling a gun like that. And so we’ve decided we’re not going to sell the assault-type rifles any longer.” In part, this campaign has been driven by the extraordinary response from survivors of the Florida shooting. Parkland students including Emma Gonzalez have emerged as media stars in the wake of the tragedy and are organizing a march on Washington in support of greater gun control later this month. Gonzalez now has 1.15 million followers on Twitter, nearly twice as many as the NRA. David Hogg, another survivor, has used his Twitter feed to call on FedEx, which offers NRA discounts, to sever its ties and for Amazon to drop NRATV, the gun lobby’s digital channel. “This is the moment when business leaders across the country get to decide if they want to stand on the right side of history,” said Shannon Watts, founder of gun control group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “Mothers make the majority of spending decisions for their families, and we want to shop with businesses that care about the safety of our families – making this a smart business move, too.” Robert Spitzer, professor of crime, law and policy and gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland, said corporations can have an impact on the national debate, precisely because corporations do not normally jump into the political fray. “They seem to be sensing that the great middle of America is being roused and moved, that the NRA is seen as ever more marginal, dogmatic, and unyielding, so there is both a PR and commercial reason for them to stake out their recent public positions. It is a notable moment that helps keep this issue in the news,” he said. But the backlash from pro-gun rights lobbyists and politicians has only just begun. In Georgia lawmakers dropped a jet fuel tax break that would have benefitted Delta after its decision to drop NRA discounts. “I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Casey Cagel, Georgia’s lieutenant governor wrote on Twitter after Delta’s announcement. Companies have fought to change the gun debate before. Most notably Smith &amp; Wesson (now American Outdoor Brands), one of the world’s biggest gun manufacturers. After a teacher and a dozen children were killed in a mass shooting in Litteton, Colorado, in 1999, the US government sued Smith &amp; Wesson. To settle the case, the company agreed to a set of voluntary reforms including child safety triggers and the development of “smart guns” that could only be fired by the owner. But the NRA was not having it and gun groups organized a boycott that effectively ended the agreement. This time gun reformers are hoping things will be different. Even Donald Trump, who styles himself as “a very strong supporter of the second amendment” has said it is time for change - although the NRA claimed he had backtracked on Thursday night. Will it work? Spitzer, author of five books on gun control, is not sure. “It’s too early to tell. If pressed, I’d say no, but the atmospherics are different, at least for right now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/puigdemont-abandons-bid-to-reclaim-catalan-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T19:45:40Z","webTitle":"Puigdemont abandons bid to reclaim Catalan presidency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/puigdemont-abandons-bid-to-reclaim-catalan-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/puigdemont-abandons-bid-to-reclaim-catalan-presidency","fields":{"headline":"Puigdemont abandons bid to reclaim Catalan presidency","bodyText":"The former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, whose push for regional independence plunged Spain into its worst political crisis for 40 years, has abandoned his attempt to return to office and is stepping aside in favour of a candidate who is currently in prison.

He added that he had “provisionally” called off his candidacy and was instead proposing Jordi Sànchez, an MP in his Together for Catalonia (JxCat) party and the former leader of the influential grassroots Catalan National Assembly (ANC). “No one represents the values of JxCat better than him and he is a man of peace who is unjustly locked in a Spanish prison,” said Puigdemont. In a move likely to be seen as the formation of a government in exile, Puigdemont said he was planning to set up a foundation abroad – the Council for the Republic – to promote Catalan independence. “I will not throw in the towel, I will not quit, I will not give up in the face of the illegitimate behaviour of those who lost at the ballot box or the capriciousness of those who are prepared to forfeit the rule of law and justice as the price for national unity,” he said. “Madrid no longer has any excuse for continuing its occupation policy nor for carrying on ignoring our voice or imposing a colonial vision on our future.” Puigdemont also revealed that a team of lawyers had lodged a formal complaint about the Spanish state’s actions with the UN human rights committee. The deposed president denied that there had been any kind of capitulation on the part of the Catalan independence movement, insisting it had now regrouped and was moving to a different battlefield. Sànchez has been in custody since mid-October, when he and another pro-independence civil society group leader, Jordi Cuixart, were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged sedition in the runup to the regional independence referendum a fortnight earlier. Both have been accused of using huge demonstrations to try to stop Spanish police officers from following a judge’s orders to halt the vote, which had already been suspended by the country’s constitutional court. Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels last October after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence, faces arrest on possible charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds if he returns to Spain. He said: “I’m confident that we will win in the end, and one day I will be able to return to Catalonia as a free man.” His withdrawal is unlikely to bring a swift end to the stalemate, given Sànchez’s legal predicament and the Spanish government’s insistence that the Catalan parliament put forward a “clean candidate”. The announcement came hours after the three pro-independence parties in the Catalan parliament approved a motion recognising both the legitimacy of Puigdemont’s candidacy and the results of the referendum. It did not, however, endorse the earlier independence declaration. Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the unionist Citizens party in Catalonia, said the session had shown that there was “no road map or design for the future for the Catalan people”. Puigdemont accelerated Catalonia’s collision course with Madrid last June when he announced that an independence referendum would be held in defiance of the Spanish constitution. Although 90% of those who voted in the 1 October poll cast their ballots in favour of independence, only 42% of the region’s voters took part, as pro-unionist Catalans boycotted the referendum. Almost a month after the vote, which was marred by violence from Spanish riot police, separatist Catalan MPs approved a unilateral declaration of independence. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, responded by using the constitution to sack Puigdemont and his cabinet, assume direct control of Catalonia and call snap elections. However, the move backfired after the three separatist parties held on to their parliamentary majority. At the end of January, Puigdemont privately admitted that his bid to achieve independence had failed. In messages to a former colleague that were captured by a TV camera, he said “the [Spanish government’s] plan has won”, adding: “I guess you’ve realised that this is over.” Amnesty International has called for the release of Sànchez, calling his continuing detention “an excessive and disproportionate restriction on his right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly”. Lawyers for Sànchez, Cuixart and the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras are appealing to the United Nations, claiming the men are unlawfully imprisoned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/02/carillion-directors-dismissed-plan-to-secure-218m-for-pension-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T00:01:34Z","webTitle":"Carillion directors dismissed plan to secure £218m for pension scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/carillion-directors-dismissed-plan-to-secure-218m-for-pension-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/02/carillion-directors-dismissed-plan-to-secure-218m-for-pension-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Carillion directors dismissed plan to secure £218m for pension scheme","bodyText":"The board of Carillion dismissed a proposal that could have poured £218m into the government contractor’s ailing pension scheme, believing a month before the company’s collapse that they could still revive its fortunes. Details of a plan drawn up by accountancy firm EY, but rejected by directors, emerged as MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion’s failure released evidence they said proved “pervasive institutional failings” at the company. They published extracts from a presentation made by EY to the board in August 2017 as part of an exercise called “Project Ray”, which they said cast doubt on directors’ claims of a sudden descent caused by several external factors. The presentation highlighted longstanding company-wide failings including a shortage of expertise and transparency, inefficient corporate structures and a lack of “commercial acumen”. After presenting its findings, EY monitored Carillion’s cashflow on a month-by-month basis, warning in October that the company was in danger of insolvency by March 2018. The accounting firm produced two scenarios, one of which was an unplanned insolvency that would see just £49.6m recovered from the business, including £12.6m for pensioners. It also offered a second option that could have raised £364m by breaking up the company and selling profitable assets prior to liquidation, securing £218m for a retirement scheme now estimated to be nearly £1bn in deficit. MPs on the work and pensions committee and business committee said the board “dismissed a break-up as not practical, instead choosing to believe they could successfully restructure [the business].” A spokesperson for the company’s former executives said: “The recommendation of the company’s advisers was to start to progress a debt for equity transaction with financial stakeholders and this was supported by the board.” Documents released by the committee detailed EY’s many concerns about Carillion’s corporate culture after completing Project Ray. The accountants flagged up a “lack of professionalisation and expertise”, as well as the “consistent use of quantity of people to compensate for limitations in quality or skill set (particularly commercial acumen).” There were also too many layers of management, according to EY, while short-term benefit was prioritised over sustainable performance amid a “culture of non-compliance”. Work and pensions committee chair Frank Field said the papers “reveal a wholly deficient corporate culture, studded with low-quality management”. “They reveal also pervasive institutional failings of the kind that don’t appear overnight; long-term failings that management must have been well aware of,” he added. Minutes of an August 2017 board meeting show that Carillion directors admitted the possibility that the longevity of some of its staff had led to “wilful blindness” about the firm’s shortcomings. Business committee chair Rachel Reeves said directors “either took their eye off the ball or they failed to see the warning signs that investors, Carillion staff and [...] EY flagged to them. “Directors didn’t just drop the ball once, they made a habit of it, giving every indication that it was the long-term failings in the management and corporate governance at Carillion which finally sank the company.” Separately, former Carillion chair Philip Green has stepped down from his role as chair of Sentebale, Prince Harry’s charity dedicated to supporting children in southern Africa affected by HIV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/06/skills-minister-anne-milton-the-default-should-not-just-be-university","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T11:57:14Z","webTitle":"Skills minister Anne Milton: ‘The default should not just be university'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/06/skills-minister-anne-milton-the-default-should-not-just-be-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/06/skills-minister-anne-milton-the-default-should-not-just-be-university","fields":{"headline":"Skills minister Anne Milton: ‘The default should not just be university'","bodyText":"Anne Milton is passionate about apprenticeships and struggles to see why anyone would think differently. “It’s on-the-job training. What’s not to like?” says the skills minister, who is also a qualified nurse. At the time Milton became a nurse, there was no expectation that entrants to the profession would hold a degree. Although she is keen to stress that she is not anti-higher education, she rails against “intellectual snobbery” that can put unfair pressure on young people to choose higher education. Apprenticeships, she says, give people the opportunity to “sail ahead of their peers” who embark on a full-time degree (and incur significant debt). “The default should not just be university,” says Milton. “No matter how bright you are, there are other options out there.” Having become skills minister last June, Milton is responsible for ensuring the government hits its target of 3m apprenticeship starts in England over a five-year period ending in 2020. She hopes that the likelihood of hitting this target will be boosted by an influx of apprentices from the public sector – in which employers with 250 or more staff are expected to have 2.3% of staff (including existing workers) starting an apprenticeship each year. “The public sector wants nurses, teachers and police men and women,” she adds. “There is a shortage of people coming through.” Following last summer’s 59% drop in the number of people starting apprenticeships, she is confident numbers will rise, but declines to say when or how rapidly. Employers that pay the apprenticeship levy need time to decide how they spend money accumulated in their accounts, she says. In 2018-19, levy-paying employers will be able to transfer 10% of funds in their account to another employer, including employers in their supply chain. By 2020, meanwhile, she expects standards for new-style apprenticeships to be available wherever employers want them. “We will meet employer demand,” she promises. Other teething problems included last year’s awarding of contracts for training involving employers that do not pay the levy. The Department for Education was forced to rerun the procurement process after seriously underestimating how many training providers would make bids. But Milton is unapologetic, insisting the DfE “got it right” second time around. “It’s important trainers, employers and apprentices have confidence in the system,” she adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/01/chief-coroner-says-officers-cab-rank-approach-to-burials-is-unjustified","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T17:46:18Z","webTitle":"Chief coroner says officer's ‘cab rank’ approach to burials is unjustified","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/chief-coroner-says-officers-cab-rank-approach-to-burials-is-unjustified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/01/chief-coroner-says-officers-cab-rank-approach-to-burials-is-unjustified","fields":{"headline":"Chief coroner says officer's ‘cab rank’ approach to burials is unjustified","bodyText":"The chief coroner of England and Wales has said the controversial “cab rank” policy of one of his senior officers is over-rigid and unjustified ahead of a judicial review later this month. Mary Hassell, the senior coroner for inner north London, has enraged Jews and Muslims by refusing to prioritise any death on the grounds of the religious beliefs of the deceased or their family. Last month, a high court judge granted an application for a judicial review of Hassell’s policy, saying it raised issues of importance to Jewish and Muslim communities. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. Hassell’s area of jurisdiction covers Hackney, which has the biggest concentration of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Europe, and Tower Hamlets, the UK’s biggest Muslim community. Her refusal to expedite burials on religious grounds has led the Board of Deputies of British Jews to call for her to be sacked. The Muslim Council of Britain; the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis; and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have called on the coroner to reconsider her policy. Theresa May has also said religious requirements should be taken into account, “especially when [families have] lost a loved one and they are grieving”. In his submission to a judicial review of the policy, scheduled for 27 and 28 March, Judge Mark Lucraft, the chief coroner, described Hassell’s conduct as “over-rigid”, “not capable of rational justification” and “not lawful”. Hassell’s failure to respect Jewish and Muslim requirements for quick burials was in breach of the Human Rights Act, he said. “The interest of a Jewish or Muslim person in having a close relative buried on the day of death or as soon as possible thereafter qualifies as a right protected by article 9 [Human Rights Act],” he stated. “Early burial is a manifestation of religious belief.” The submission said: “In summary, the chief coroner’s position is that a coroner may properly address a reported death with greater urgency or prioritise some task (eg the ordering of an examination) on the ground that the bereaved family have a strong and sincere desire for the body to be released quickly founded on religious belief.” The application for a judicial review was made by the Adath Yisroel Burial Society (AYBS), which complained of unnecessary bureaucratic delays in releasing the body of an Orthodox Jewish man for burial last October. Hassell denied their claims and alleged that her staff were bullied and intimidated by family members and the burial society. She announced a new protocol, that “no death will be prioritised in any way over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family”. In a letter to lawyers for AYBS, she said: “I believe the cab rank rule is the fairest way.” In her submission ahead of the judicial review, Hassell defended her policy, saying: “My approach reflects my best attempt to consider the rights of all those who are in my jurisdiction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/01/ben-carson-cancels-order-for-31000-dining-set-amid-ethics-controversy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T19:01:46Z","webTitle":"Ben Carson cancels order for $31,000 dining set amid ethics controversy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/01/ben-carson-cancels-order-for-31000-dining-set-amid-ethics-controversy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/01/ben-carson-cancels-order-for-31000-dining-set-amid-ethics-controversy","fields":{"headline":"Ben Carson cancels order for $31,000 dining set amid ethics controversy","bodyText":"Ben Carson, the US secretary for housing and urban development (Hud), has scrapped an order for a $31,000 dining set for his Washington office amid a growing ethics controversy. Raffi Williams, a Hud spokesman, said in an email on Thursday: “At the request of the secretary, the agency is working to rescind the order for the dining room set.” The decision, first reported by CNN, followed a promise from Carson of “full disclosure” over his use of public funds to buy expensive furniture, in his first public remarks since the Guardian revealed a senior Hud official’s allegation that she was demoted for refusing to break a legal spending limit on redecoration. The pressure has been growing on Carson amid reports that the White House was angered by his spending. Facing a question about the expensive dining set, and whether the president was considering Carson’s future, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said: “In terms of if you are asking if he is getting rid of anyone in the cabinet, I’m not aware of that. The order you reference, that was cancelled,” she said, noting that Carson’s department was “looking for another option that is much more responsible to taxpayer dollars”. Carson and his wife, Candy, denied wrongdoing in a post to their personal Twitter account on Wednesday evening and struck out at unidentified enemies. “We suspect, based on past attempts, that they will continue to probe and make further accusations even without evidence or substantiation,” they wrote. The Republican-controlled House oversight committee told Carson on Wednesday to turn over all documentation relating to the reassignment of Helen Foster, who was moved from her job as chief administrative officer last year following a series of disagreements with managers. Foster alleged to a whistleblower-protection watchdog that she lost her job partly as retaliation for her refusal in January and February last year to find a way to exceed a $5,000 limit on spending on improvements to Carson’s office. She said she was told by Craig Clemmensen, who was Hud’s acting director while Carson went through the Senate confirmation process, to find more money for use by Carson’s wife, Candy, and that “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair”. Following Foster’s reassignment, the department spent $31,000 on a dining table and accompanying items for Carson’s suite. The findings came after Donald Trump proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Hud’s budget, reducing programs for poor and homeless people. Carson’s department also signed a contract last year to spend $165,000 on “lounge furniture” for its Washington headquarters from the retailer OFS Brands of Huntingburg, Indiana, according to federal procurement records. The president and chief of executive of OFS Brands, Robert “Hank” Menke, has made donations to Republican politicians including Mike Pence, the US vice-president, who as Indiana governor in 2013 appointed Menke to a “blue ribbon panel” on transportation and infrastructure in the state. Menke, whose family founded OFS Brands, has contributed $49,000 to Republican campaigns in Indiana since 2004, according to state campaign finance filings. He has also given $35,700 to Republican campaigns at federal level since 2011, according to filings to the federal election commission. OFS Brands also supplied furniture to federal government departments during Barack Obama’s presidency. Emails to the company from the Guardian were not returned when comment was sought about the Hud furniture, some of which came from a range that OFS describes as “glamorous, with a beau mondes presence”. Democrats in Congress and the campaign group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) on Wednesday urged Hud’s inspector general, Helen Albert, to investigate the allegations made by Foster. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate’s banking committee, said Albert should expand an inquiry that he and colleagues asked for earlier this month following reports on Carson’s involvement of his family members in government affairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/02/jan-kuciak-slovakia-journalists-defiant-after-reporter-shot-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:46:30Z","webTitle":"‘They can’t kill us all’: Slovakian journalists defiant after murders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/jan-kuciak-slovakia-journalists-defiant-after-reporter-shot-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/02/jan-kuciak-slovakia-journalists-defiant-after-reporter-shot-dead","fields":{"headline":"‘They can’t kill us all’: Slovakian journalists defiant after murders","bodyText":"At 6.30am on Monday, Peter Bárdy, the editor-in-chief of aktuality.sk, a Slovakian news website, received a phone call to inform him that one of his employees had been murdered. Ján Kuciak, a 27-year-old investigative reporter, and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, had been found shot dead at their home in Vel’ká Mača, 40 miles (65km) east of Bratislava. “It was the worst moment of my career, to tell 27 people from my editorial team …,” Bardy checks himself, “to tell 26 people from my editorial team that one of them, Ján Kuciak, is dead.” Peter Habara, an editor at aktuality.sk, was in the office early that morning too. “It’s impossible to comprehend – my wife and I were making plans to visit Ján and Martina in their new house,” he says. His colleagues had been cheerful when they arrived at the office. Soon after, the newsroom was in tears. In the days since, Habara has woken in the night thinking someone is standing over him with a gun. Colleagues describe Kuciak as a modest, dedicated and serious-minded reporter who specialised in data journalism and eschewed the limelight. “He was in journalism because he wanted to make Slovakia a better country, not because he wanted to be famous,” recalls Bárdy. “I used to struggle to convince him to let me publish his photo alongside his stories. Eventually, he said, ‘OK, but could you make my face as small as possible?’ And now he’s the most famous journalist in the world.” In the midst of their grief, the editorial team came to an immediate, collective decision: in tribute to Kuciak, they would get to work fact-checking, editing and publishing his final, unfinished investigation. Despite members of the investigative team now having to live under police protection, Kuciak’s article was published less than 48 hours after his colleagues had received the news of his death. Aktuality.sk shared the text of the investigation, which is also available in English, with all their Slovakian competitors, who published it simultaneously in solidarity. “Our message is that if you kill a journalist, more information will come out,” says Bárdy. “They can’t kill all of us.” Fittingly, Kuciak’s last story has significance that reaches far beyond his home country: it reveals that criminal clans from Italy infiltrated poor parts of eastern Slovakia and allegedly developed close ties with local politicians to exploit weak state institutions and misappropriate generous EU subsidies. Pursued in cooperation with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, the Czech Centre for Investigative Journalism and the Investigative Reporting Project Italy, the story began as an investigation into why the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, had hired Mária Trošková, then a 27-year-old former Miss Universe contestant, as one of his assistants, despite her relative lack of political experience. The investigation took a dramatic turn after it emerged that Trošková had been a business partner of Antonino Vadala, an Italian living in Slovakia with alleged close ties to the ’Ndrangheta, a notorious Italian organised crime group. Having worked for Vadala, she was recruited to work in the office of Viliam Jasaň, an MP and member of Fico’s ruling Smer party, who served on Slovakia’s state security council and is also alleged to have close business ties to Vadala. The story outlines a series of allegations that paint a picture of Italian mafia infiltration of Slovakian political and economic life, whether through relationships with politicians, violent cases of extortion, VAT scams linked to the acquisition of luxury properties, or fraudulent claims for millions of euros in agricultural and energy subsidies. According to reports in the Slovakian press, Vadala was one of about 10 people detained by Slovakian police on Thursday, some of whom also appear to be Italian businessmen. Slovakia’s police chief, Tibor Gašpar, told reporters that those taken into custody were “persons mentioned” by Kuciak in connection with the “Italian track”. Scotland Yard, the FBI and other foreign agencies have been assisting the Slovakian authorities with their investigation into the killings. Trošková and Jasaň have stepped down, despite being defended by Fico at a press conference on Tuesday, during which he attacked opposition parties for politicising the issue. “We categorically refuse any connection with this tragedy,” Trošková and Jasaň said in a joint statement. “However, since our names are abused in the political fight against PM Robert Fico, we decided to leave our posts at the government’s office until the investigation is over.” Allegations of corruption and questionable relationships between politicians and business people will come as no surprise to many Slovakians, but the shocking death of a young journalist investigating such relationships has forced many to look at their leaders in a new light. “There has long been a feeling that businessmen who are close to the government are regarded as ‘untouchable’, and they are often described metaphorically as a kind of mafia,” says Zuzana Kepplová, a columnist at SME, a Slovakian daily newspaper. “But now the word ‘mafia’ has lost its metaphorical feeling.” The murders have put pressure on the pugnacious Fico, who has served as prime minister for all but two of the past 12 years. On Wednesday, hundreds of people joined a silent protest march organised by opposition parties, snaking their way through the freezing streets of Bratislava and laying candles at the perimeter wall of the prime minister’s office, as if to symbolically lay the blame at his door. More marches are planned for Friday night. “Fico is not directly responsible for the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová,” says Samuel Abrahám, rector of the Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts. “He does, however, bear responsibility for the environment in which mafia infiltration blossoms. The sad irony is that if this murder hadn’t happened, then almost nobody would have noticed it was happening.” Kuciak’s friends and colleagues at aktuality.sk stress that they will continue to pursue the story, regardless of who was responsible for the killings. “The mafia is doing business in this country and they have connections with the highest offices of state: they are building Palermo in Slovakia,” says Habara, noting that Kuciak had left behind enough material for months of further investigation. “They held a minute’s silence for Ján in the European parliament, but what are they actually doing to help us fight this?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/10/blake-morrison-the-executor-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Blake Morrison: ‘You must write a memoir as if you’re writing a novel’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/10/blake-morrison-the-executor-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/10/blake-morrison-the-executor-interview","fields":{"headline":"Blake Morrison: ‘You must write a memoir as if you’re writing a novel’","bodyText":"Blake Morrison is an award-winning poet, novelist, journalist and librettist, and a professor of creative and life writing at Goldsmiths, University of London. He is best known for his acclaimed memoir, And When Did You Last See Your Father?, which was made into a film starring Jim Broadbent, Juliet Stevenson and Colin Firth, and for his study of the murder of James Bulger, As If. His novel The Last Weekend was adapted for television in 2012. His latest novel is The Executor (Chatto &amp; WIndus, £16.99). Your new book is about a journalist, Matt, who reluctantly agrees to become the literary executor of an old friend, a poet called Robert Pope, only for him to die unexpectedly. What drew you to this situation? A very old friend asked me to be his executor, so maybe that got me thinking about it. But I also have many students who worry about writing about their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and partners, so that was in my mind, too. I got interested in the rights of people who are being written about, rather than the rights of the writer. Since my memoir came out [in 1993], it seems like there have been a lot more cases of people feeling their right to privacy has been violated – either that, or I got off lightly. Robert Pope’s widow responds very badly to Matt’s discoveries. Yes. But think of all the biographies that have been written where the widow was furious: TS Eliot, Stephen Spender, Ted Hughes. That’s the background to her reaction. My feeling is that it’s all going to come out in the end; there’s no point trying to stop a book. I’ve always felt, too, that there’s the writing, and the life; that they’re separate. But if you’re the widow, and there was another woman or man before you, you’re hurt and your instinct is to stop the book. The Executor includes several poems ‘by’ Robert Pope: his reworking of some of Ovid’s Amores. How should we read these? To what degree are they poems by Blake Morrison? I was working on the poems first. Lots of people have had a go at [reworking] Ovid’s Metamorphoses, so I thought I would have a go at the Amores; they’re very male poems, and I wanted to see if they could be made to work today. In the end, though, I found I couldn’t make some of them work, and others I didn’t feel I had remade sufficiently in my own voice. I was left not knowing what to do with these poems I’d written – and then I started to work on this novel. To answer your question, they’re neither Ovid nor Blake Morrison, really. But then again, I did them, not “Robert Pope”. Someone said to me I should have owned them, put my name to them, but I don’t feel that I’ve thrown them away, or that they’re wasted. They’re out in the world, at least. I like the idea that you could read the novel without the poems, or vice versa – I put them at the end for that reason, and also because, like lots of people, when I read Possession [AS Byatt’s Booker prize-winning novel of literary detection, which includes pastiche Victorian poems], I skipped the poems. I wanted to give people the option of doing that. Matt is a bit sententious, easily shocked. But perhaps he also experiences Robert’s slightly racier life as an implicit criticism of his own. There’s a bit of social commentary in his character, isn’t there? Yes. He’s envious of Robert’s adventure, but he can’t admit it to himself. He’s a different generation to me, and to Robert, with different values. Don’t you think that younger men are more puritanical, more shocked by infidelity or even the merest hint of it, than older men? There are questions about Rob, and the kind of man he is, questions that play into this debate we’re having [about sexual harassment], though of course I finished writing it long before all this happened. I don’t think he’s so bad. But then again, how do we know? Part of what the novel is about is the idea that you think you know someone, but actually you don’t. Do you blame yourself for the deluge of memoirs that followed the success of And When Did You Last See Your Father? Are too many memoirs published nowadays? It’s funny. At the time, I had no idea what was going to happen. At that point, I’d only published poems, for which you don’t have much of an audience. This was just a book about my dad. I’d no expectations. But then it took off – though remember Fever Pitch [by Nick Hornby] came before mine, and Philip Roth’s Patrimony. There probably are too many now – and yet, among my students, a couple of really interesting ones have not been able to find a publisher. You’re one of a growing number of university creative writing teachers. Do you believe writing can be taught? Yes, skills can be learned and developed, just as with playing the piano or painting landscapes. With life writing, the work is about getting past the idea that the experience itself is enough, that you’ve only to transcribe it. You must write a memoir as if you’re writing a novel; you have to give it a shape. So it’s not about catharsis. What’s that word people use? Closure. There is no closure. I still find myself writing about my dad, even now. I go on thinking about him. What books are on your bedside table? Maggie Nelson’s The Red Parts, Wendy Cope’s Anecdotal Evidence, Nikesh Shukla’s The Good Immigrant, Svetlana Alexievich’s Chernobyl Prayer, Adam Kay’s This Is Going to Hurt, Aida Edemariam’s The Wife’s Tale. What book might people be surprised to see on your bookshelves? The Penguin Rhyming Dictionary. I know poetry’s meant to come as naturally as leaves to a tree, but sometimes it needs artificial stimulants. What book did you last put down without finishing? I’m a puritan. Or perhaps a masochist. I might skim but I always get to the end. Which book or author do you always return to? Philip Larkin. The funniest, saddest and most quotable of poets. What do you plan to read next?

Now I couldn’t think of doing anything else. I like to come into work because I enjoy my job. There’s something different every single day and no matter how long you have been making glass, you will always be learning something new. “Before joining Bristol Blue Glass as an apprentice, I did a two-year diploma at City of Bristol College and then another two-year diploma in video games design to eventually become a concept artist. I was also working as a cleaner to get money to live off. My friend Reece studied business for two years and worked at Blue Glass in Bristol, learning how the business works. He found his way into the workshop and got very good at glassblowing. He would come back with pictures of what he had made and I knew that I wanted to be a part of this ancient craft. “I went in to take photographs and it was hypnotic, in a sense, watching people work the molten material, and I just fell in love with it. A vacancy came up for an assistant glassblower and I got the apprenticeship. They put me on a course at Bridgwater and Taunton College and the tutor used to come here once a month to see me, because it was a long way for me to travel to the college by train. I was getting paid £6.95 an hour and it was a lot better than cleaning, plus I got a level 3 diploma in craft skills for creative industries/advanced level apprenticeship in creative craft practitioner. “When the two years were up in December, I was taken on as an assistant to the maestro, David Barry, who is in charge of the hot floor. Every glassmaker works slightly differently and each piece is like a fingerprint because makers have their own style. Of course, we measure with calipers to make sure we get the sizes correct, but we work in the style called free blowing so everything is unique and 100% handmade, and that’s what I love about it. The temperature of glass in the furnace is 1080C, the same as an erupting volcano, and it has to be cooled slowly, over 18 hours in an oven at 510C. It’s going to take a lifetime to master the skills for this craft but I wouldn’t have it any other way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/02/mega-colonies-of-15-million-penguins-discovered-in-antarctica","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"'Mega-colonies' of 1.5 million penguins discovered in Antarctica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/mega-colonies-of-15-million-penguins-discovered-in-antarctica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/02/mega-colonies-of-15-million-penguins-discovered-in-antarctica","fields":{"headline":"'Mega-colonies' of 1.5 million penguins discovered in Antarctica","bodyText":"Huge “mega-colonies” of penguins have been discovered near the Antarctic peninsula, hosting more than 1.5 million birds. Researchers say it shows the area is a vital refuge from climate change and human activities and should be protected by a vast new marine wildlife reserve currently under consideration. The huge numbers of Adélie penguins were found on the Danger Islands in the Weddell Sea, on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is a difficult place to reach and has seldom been visited. But scientists, prompted by satellite images, mounted an expedition and used on-the-ground counts and aerial photography from drones to reveal 751,527 pairs of penguins. The researchers then examined satellite images going back to 1959 and believe the colony has been stable over that time. In contrast, Adélie colonies to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, where the impact of climate change and human activity are much greater, are in decline. “This was an incredible experience, finding and counting so many penguins,” said Tom Hart, at the University of Oxford and part of the international research team. Its report, Survey of Adélie Penguin Mega-colonies Reveals the Danger Islands as a Seabird Hotspot, is published in the journal Scientific Reports. Michael Polito, at Louisiana State University and also part of the team, said: “I was amazed by the sheer number of Adélie penguins I saw. The water around the island boiled with penguins.” Hart said: “The size of these colonies makes them regionally important and makes the case for expanding the proposed Weddell Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA) to include the Danger Islands. More than that, I think it highlights the need for better protection of the west Antarctic Peninsula, where we are seeing declines.” Rod Downie, at WWF, said: “This exciting discovery shows us just how much more there still is to learn about this amazing and iconic species of the ice. But it also reinforces the urgency to protect Antarctic waters from the dual threats of overfishing and climate change.” The proposed MPA is huge – 1.8m sq km or five times the size of Germany. It would ban all fishing in a vast area of the Weddell Sea and around the Antarctic Peninsula, safeguarding killer whales, leopard seals and blue whales, as well as penguins that rely on the krill targeted by fishing ships. The MPA already has the support of several countries, including the UK, and will go before a conference of the Antarctic nations in October. The discovery of the mega-colonies is a major development for polar scientists – and welcome good news. In October, they reported that just two chicks had survived from a colony of 40,000 at Petrel Island, a few thousand kilometres west of the Antarctic peninsula. Other penguins are also facing an uncertain future. On Monday, researchers warned that king penguins could almost disappear from Antarctica by the end of the century unless climate change is curbed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/08/apprenticeships-pay-but-youre-not-rich-yet","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T10:54:38Z","webTitle":"Apprenticeships pay – but you're not rich yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/08/apprenticeships-pay-but-youre-not-rich-yet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/08/apprenticeships-pay-but-youre-not-rich-yet","fields":{"headline":"Apprenticeships pay – but you're not rich yet","bodyText":"Apprenticeships offer a salary while you study and, unlike going to university, your employer pays the training fees. So there is no need to take out a huge loan to cover the cost of tuition and end up tens of thousands of pounds in debt. But you still need to support yourself through the apprenticeship, which is at least 12 months long and could be as long as five years. The pay may be low, and varies greatly from scheme to scheme. From April, the national minimum wage for apprentices will be £3.70 an hour for anyone under 19 (or over 19 and in the first year of the scheme). This may sound like a decent wage to school leavers living at home, but much of it can be eaten up in travel expenses. Check your contract to see if you can get help with travel costs, not only to the job but also to the training centre. Will the employer help pay for tools, clothing and training equipment? The contract will also provide information on statutory holiday pay and sick leave – some may even include a pension scheme, offer of a car, or help with relocation and leisure opportunities. Government research into apprenticeship pay shows that in 2016, the average for a level 2 or 3 apprenticeship – equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels, respectively – was nearly £7 an hour. The lowest-paid apprenticeships were in hairdressing – a median of £3.47 an hour (when the national minimum wage for apprenticeships was £2.73) and childcare. The highest paid were in management; customer service; health, social care and sport; and retail. Some apprenticeships pay a lot more. For example, starting pay for Transport for London apprenticeships is £17,802 a year. You won’t be entitled to student discounts, but the National Union of Students has an apprentice extra card, and you may also be eligible for transport discounts. London-based apprentices are eligible for an Apprentice Oyster photocard, which gives them 30% off certain journeys. Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, says the new degree-level apprenticeships can pay almost as much as a normal wage. But with apprentices not qualifying for government loans, they may struggle to live anywhere but at home, limiting them to local opportunities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/01/oswald-mosley-the-unpopular-populist","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T18:09:22Z","webTitle":"Oswald Mosley, the unpopular populist | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/oswald-mosley-the-unpopular-populist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/oswald-mosley-the-unpopular-populist","fields":{"headline":"Oswald Mosley, the unpopular populist","bodyText":"I was at a meeting in the students union at the University of Manchester in 1961 which was addressed by Oswald Mosley, accompanied by his son Max (Report, 1 March).

Based in High Wycombe, the university is one of a handful offering a degree apprenticeship in registered nursing for NHS trusts that not only have to recruit more nurses, but are keen to spend the money they pay each month through the apprenticeship levy. Steve Dewhurst, director of apprenticeships at Bucks New, says there is no reason why degree apprenticeships should not be viewed as equal to traditional degrees, given they take a similar amount of time and even have the added asset of work experience. He says the differences are that apprentices already have a job contract, earn money as they study and avoid a student loan. For Bucks New, which generally specialises in vocational degrees, and also offers degree apprenticeships in management, engineering and digital technology, it’s “evolution not revolution”, says Dewhurst. Apprenticeships take between one and five years to complete, with at least 20% of training taking place “off the job” – at a university, college or other training provider, or in the workplace, but away from the apprentice’s normal job. Since last year, new-style apprenticeships designed to better reflect job roles have been available for numerous occupations. Based on revised standards drawn up by the employers themselves, they include a final test or assessment, which has not always been the case. Standards must be approved by the Institute for Apprenticeships. Sir Gerry Berragan, its chief executive, says the new apprenticeships should give employers greater confidence, given that they are more rigorous than old-style apprenticeships, which are being phased out. They include an assessment plan, which shows that an apprentice can perform identified tasks or functions. “It’s focused on achievement,” he says. He points out that 216 standards have been approved – ranging from level 2 (equivalent to GCSE) to level 7 (master’s degree). For now, you are more likely to find a level 7 apprenticeship in management than in manufacturing, but, with a further 314 standards in the pipeline, the variety of courses available gets ever greater. Patrick Bailey, deputy vice-chancellor at London South Bank University, advises against young people taking the apprenticeship route simply to avoid a student loan, but says they are a good option for those “who enjoy being around a job and learning at the same time”. Further education colleges also offer apprenticeships and, in some cases, collaborate with universities. Teresa Frith, senior skills policy manager at the Association of Colleges, sees one of their main benefits as allowing people to develop new skills, rather than just rubber-stamping what they already do. “Apprenticeships are absolutely pertinent to work because you are learning in work,” says Frith. “They provide a particular way of getting skills and behaviours you need to progress during your career.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/01/gary-neville-pundits-liam-rosenior","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T16:37:42Z","webTitle":"Pundits are good for the game even if ex-players’ censure can feel out of line | Liam Rosenior","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/01/gary-neville-pundits-liam-rosenior","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/01/gary-neville-pundits-liam-rosenior","fields":{"headline":"Pundits are good for the game even if ex-players’ censure can feel out of line","bodyText":"“Three … two … one … and we’re live on air.” It’s a phrase I have heard more and more over the last few months because of my first steps into the world of sports broadcasting and punditry. I must admit that as a player I didn’t have an appreciation of the hard work by the floor staff, the producers and directors constantly instructing you through your earpiece, and the presenters with their impressive array of knowledge and awareness to stay within time constraints, and nor did I have an understanding of actually how difficult it is to be in front of lights and a camera while a vast audience evaluates your every word as you try to be as interesting and informative as possible, while knowing that any slip-up cannot be re-recorded. With the ever-growing popularity of the Premier League all over the world and the increasingly competitive battle for TV rights and viewing figures, the art of punditry is becoming an increasing part of our sport with millions of fans expecting not only great games but informative, insightful analysis during and after matches because of the money they are paying to watch. After Manchester City’s 3-0 win against Arsenal in last Sunday’s Carabao Cup final much of the furore wasn’t about City’s dominant performance or a bad day at the office for the Gunners, it concerned the in-game analysis of Gary Neville and his damning appraisal of the performance of Arsène Wenger’s team. As Neville stated afterwards there has now become an “analysis of analysis”, which is the perfect way to sum up what happened. From a current player’s perspective, before I had any kind of understanding of the difficulty of being a live TV pundit, I would have taken the position that what Neville said during the game and the manner in which he said it were a step too far from someone who has been in the very same position that those Arsenal players found themselves in on Sunday afternoon. Being outclassed in a final is hurtful enough, but then having your name picked out as someone lacking effort and desire during the match is not what you would expect from a fellow, if former, pro. It’s almost like the unspoken rule of protection had been broken. However, being fortunate enough to have had first-hand experience of being in Neville’s shoes, I understand that he’s being paid to give his expert opinion and call football matches as he sees them, live without the luxury of time to think, something that every fee-paying member of the public is more than entitled to hear and dissect in their own way. The fact is that Neville is no longer a player and, because he is now being paid to be a TV pundit, he is at liberty to say what he thinks and accept the repercussions of his words in his new occupation. Since he has started working for Sky, Neville has raised the bar in terms of tactical analysis of football – not only commenting on what is happening on the field of play but why it is happening and the outcomes of every individual and team performance in the Premier League, which is now being appraised in a much more intelligent, in-depth and objective manner to the general public. This can only be good for our game, even if for players such as me it means that any defensive mistake is critically analysed in front of millions of people on a Monday night. But surely objectively critiquing tactics, player performance and a coach’s decisions in an impartial manner creates an increased pressure on players and coaches, and in turn an acceptance of responsibility and accountability for our actions on the field of play. With the increased profile of pundits such as Neville, Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard on our TV screens with their extensive knowledge and experience of football at the highest level, they educate not only supporters but younger players listening to every word while continually raising standards – in terms of objectively and impartially analysing matches, giving their insight without resorting to making scapegoats of players and making them easy targets for abuse in the stadiums and sensationalist phone-in radio stations, not to mention social media. We have repeatedly seen assertions from players and managers who complain that it’s easy to talk about football away from the game in the comfort of a TV studio, out of the hotseat and away from the pressures at sharp end, and I understand that viewpoint, but in my experience it is not as easy as some make it look! I believe that if TV punditry is performed correctly, with the homework, impartiality, professionalism and diligence that Neville exemplifies in his broadcasting, it can bring a huge benefit to our game, increasing the football knowledge of supporters at home who are a lot more intelligent than many of our previous media have catered for. And as players and coaches in an era when we are being analysed more than ever we must remember that the analysts must be analysed and challenged too because that is the nature of the game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
