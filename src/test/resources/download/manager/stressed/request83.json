More than three decades on, it remains a masterful study of self-deluded blowhards convinced of their inherent majesty. But by also skewering the pit-stop road rhythms of the rockumentary, the movie’s meta was as heavy as its metal. It acknowledged the parasitical nature of its chosen genre because for your mockumentary to really sing, it helps to spoof something that has already accrued plenty of recognisable signifiers, familiar elements to play up to or against. The unexpected but apparently unstoppable explosion in long-form true crime investigations – from the rough-justice podcast Serial to HBO’s killer nailbiter The Jinx – has pulled the genre up from its lurid roots and popularised a loftier, more austere tone. Where once true crime programming suggested kitchen knives spilling ketchup in wobbly reconstructions, the popular focus has now shifted to forensic analysis, seeking justice by walking the viewer patiently through a maze of evidence using data visualisation techniques to help construct a convincing case. It was only a matter of time before someone held up a cracked mirror to serious-minded deep-dive crime series like Netflix’s Making A Murderer and The Keepers, and credit where it’s due: by giving the green light to American Vandal, Netflix happily handed creators Dan Perrault and Tony Yacenda the freedom to undercut some of its most popular original programming. The streaming service even stumped up enough cash to ensure that this eight-episode investigation into a miscarriage of justice – school prankster Dylan being suspended for allegedly spraying graffiti penises on all 27 cars in the faculty car park – would have the same cumulative, multi-part heft of the best true crime big-hitters. American Vandal’s secret weapon – apart from Jimmy Tatro, who plays Dylan as a biddable dimbulb with the ground-trembling voice of Vin Diesel – is the way Perrault and Yacenda mimic both the sleek, gimmicky infographics of nu-true crime but also interpolate the messy mixed-media bombardment of life at your average high school, from Instagram posts and YouTube videos to poorly shot smartphone footage and misspelled instant messaging. It all feels surprisingly, tangibly real and helps extend what is essentially a playground dick joke into a JFK-style, hall-of-mirrors investigative four-hour epic. The exactness of your spoof can sometimes backfire. The ongoing IFC series Documentary Now! is essentially a wide-ranging anthology where SNL veterans Bill Hader and Fred Armisen mimic existing documentaries with such verisimilitude, it can feel like you might be missing half the gags if you have yet to see Errol Morris’s classic The Thin Blue Line or foodie sensation Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Fellow SNL star Andy Samberg has, between series of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, taken a rather more scattershot approach, assembling star-studded casts for daft sports mockumentary one-offs like Seven Days In Hell, featuring a ridiculous Wimbledon men’s match that lasts a week, and Tour De Pharmacy, a tell-all about a fictional 1980s cycling doping scandal that somehow convinced Lance Armstrong to appear as a talking head. Both felt like gleefully oversized spins on ESPN’s 30 By 30, the lauded documentary strand that lionises sports stories large and small. In the UK, the genre has quietly made a tangible comeback on the BBC, the incubational home of Ricky Gervais’s original the Office, still a high watermark of TV mockumentaries. The corporation has rubbing up against itself in W1A, a bumbling fly-on-the-wall workplace farce starring Downton Abbey’s Hugh Bonneville as a bemused executive trapped in an inescapable series of vapid, buzzword-dense meetings. The BBC’s digital channel BBC3 also has This Country, a slice-of-life doc about kids looking for kicks in a rural English village and the excellent People Just Do Nothing, a profile of the blustering staff of underground London radio station Kurupt FM that, over the course of four skunk-swamped seasons, has become steadily more emotionally invested in its thwarted characters. So why the rise of mockumentaries now? The best examples often orbit around characters who, consciously or not, clearly have no real idea what they’re doing. This dangerous mix of hubris and mental flat-footedness now seems more prevalent than ever. Are we subconsciously recognising and responding to the inescapable echo of mockumentary in everyday life? Perhaps that’s why HBO’s Veep – not technically a mockumentary but a show that, with its roaming, eavesdropping camera, certainly borrows from the fly-on-the-wall toolbox – is wrapping up with its eighth season next year. The real world has, sadly, caught up. American Vandal is now streaming on Netflix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/17/trump-pick-for-drug-czar-tom-marino-withdraws","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T23:15:04Z","webTitle":"Trump pick for drug czar Tom Marino pulls out after report on opioid bill role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/17/trump-pick-for-drug-czar-tom-marino-withdraws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/17/trump-pick-for-drug-czar-tom-marino-withdraws","fields":{"headline":"Trump pick for drug czar Tom Marino pulls out after report on opioid bill role","bodyText":"Tom Marino, the Pennsylvania congressman who Donald Trump nominated to be his “drug czar”, has withdrawn from consideration, the president announced on Tuesday. “Rep Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar,” the president tweeted. “Tom is a fine man and a great congressman!” Marino is a four-term representative who in February 2016 became the fifth member of Congress to endorse Trump’s campaign for the White House. From 2002 to 2007 he was US attorney for the middle district of Pennsylvania, under George W Bush. Marino was nominated to lead the National Office of Drug Control Policy, a key role in efforts to tackle the epidemic in opioid addiction and abuse that Trump on Monday called a “massive problem”, saying that he would make a major announcement on the subject next week. On Sunday, Marino was the subject of a joint report by the Washington Post and 60 Minutes about his role as the sponsor of a bill that critics say undermined federal enforcement efforts against the opioid epidemic. The bill made it far more difficult for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to crack down on drug companies that made suspicious shipments of opioids. On Tuesday afternoon, Marino said in a statement that he had decided “to remove the distraction my nomination has created to the utterly vital mission of this premier agency”. “At the same time,” he added, “given my lifelong devotion to law enforcement, I insist on correcting the record regarding the false accusations and unfair reporting to which I have been subjected.” Citing his legislative work as evidence of his commitment to fighting drug abuse, he blamed “conspiracy theories from individuals seeking to avert blame from their own failures to address the opioid crisis that proliferated during their tenure”, specifically “false allegations made by a former DEA employee”. Trump said in an interview with Fox News Radio on Tuesday, “Tom Marino said, ‘Look, I’ll take a pass. I have no choice. I really will take a pass, I want to do it.’ “And he was very gracious, I have to say that. He didn’t want to have – he didn’t want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies.” On Monday, at a Rose Garden press conference with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Trump called Marino “a good guy” but said: “We’re going to look into the report. We’re going to take it very seriously.” The president then said he planned to speak to Marino and “if I think it’s 1% negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change”. Among Democrats, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a conservative representing a state ravaged by opioid addiction, called on Trump to withdraw Marino’s nomination. In a letter to the president, Manchin said the opioid crisis was “the biggest public health crisis since HIV/Aids”. The leader of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, he wrote, should “protect our people, not the pharmaceutical industry”. “Congressman Marino no longer has my trust or that of the public that he will aggressively pursue the fight against opioid abuse,” Manchin wrote. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday confirming Marino would be like “putting the wolf in charge of the henhouse”. On Tuesday morning, the New York Democrat welcomed Marino’s decision to withdraw. “[Representative] Marino’s decision to withdraw from consideration as drug czar is the right decision,” Schumer said, “though the fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk but refuses to walk the walk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/17/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-libyan-dead-bodies-remark","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T13:17:17Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson refuses to apologise for Libyan 'dead bodies' remark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/17/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-libyan-dead-bodies-remark","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/17/boris-johnson-refuses-to-apologise-for-libyan-dead-bodies-remark","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson refuses to apologise for Libyan 'dead bodies' remark","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to resign after he sidestepped calls to apologise over his claim that a Libyan coastal town could be turned into a luxury resort once the dead bodies were removed. The foreign secretary was also challenged over why he described war-torn Mogadishu as a thriving international city. Johnson caused uproar, and infuriated Theresa May at the Conservative conference, when he suggested the town of Sirte in Libya could become the next Dubai once the dead bodies were cleared away. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, he refused to apologise and said the attacks on him were political point scoring and trivialised a serious issue. The Scottish National party’s international affairs spokesman, Stephen Gethins, had challenged Johnson, saying: “He’s certainly right that he’s managed to bring people together in Libya. “Quite remarkably, he’s been criticised across the political divide and by a former British ambassador, and he was described as having dishonoured the sacrifice of those who fought and died in Sirte.” Labour’s Emily Thornberry tweeted: In his appearance at Foreign Office questions in the Commons, Johnson accused Russia of behaving as if it was in a new cold war. The foreign secretary is due to visit Moscow in December. He told MPs: “In many ways Russia is behaving as though there is indeed a new cold war and our objective is to prevent that from getting any worse, to constrain Russia, to make sure we penalise Russia for its malign and destructive activities where they are taking place, but also to engage where we can. “The UK couldn’t have normal relations with this country [Russia], but we understand that we should keep a dialogue.” Johnson also chose a surprising form of words to describe the political reality in Somalia. Discussing the deadly bomb attack, he said: “The whole house will wish to join me in condemning the atrocity in Mogadishu on Saturday, which claimed at least 281 lives. Those who inflicted this heinous act of terrorism on a thriving capital city achieved nothing but to demonstrate their own wickedness.” The US state department and most western embassies have long advised against any travel to Mogadishu."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/03/country-tailor-sidecar-cocktail-recipe-brandy-cointreau-lemon-salon-brixton","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-03T16:00:24Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: Salon Brixton’s country tailor sidecar – recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/03/country-tailor-sidecar-cocktail-recipe-brandy-cointreau-lemon-salon-brixton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/03/country-tailor-sidecar-cocktail-recipe-brandy-cointreau-lemon-salon-brixton","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: Salon Brixton’s country tailor sidecar – recipe","bodyText":"A twist on the classic sidecar, which traditionally uses cognac.

Rudd, the home secretary, appeared to undermine the government’s position that “no deal is better than a bad deal” on Tuesday as she dismissed the idea of not getting an agreement that at the very least covered security. “It is unthinkable there would be no deal. It is so much in their interest as well as ours … We will make sure there is something between them and us to maintain our security,” Rudd told parliament’s home affairs committee. An hour earlier, Davis had told the House of Commons that it was necessary to keep the option of no deal open. He said the UK was “straining every sinew” to get a deal with the EU, but it was necessary to prepare for all outcomes. “The maintenance of the option of no deal is both for negotiating reasons and sensible security. Any government doing its job properly will do that,” the Brexit secretary said. Rudd later insisted she was not contradicting the government position on walking away with no deal, highlighting Theresa May’s Florence speech that said the UK’s proposal on security cooperation was unconditional. “There are no threats either way on security,” Rudd said, denying that there were different messages coming from individual members of the cabinet. However, the divisions between cabinet members were further highlighted when Liam Fox, the trade secretary, took a very different tone from both Rudd and Davis in an interview with the BBC, saying there was “no need to fear” no deal. “Leaving without a deal will not be the armageddon that some people project and leaving with a deal will give us a slightly better growth rate,” he said. “We need to concentrate on the realities, get rid of the hyperbole and focus on the fact that if we can get a good agreement with the EU both Britain and the EU will be better off for it.” It comes after hardline Conservative Brexit supporters have accused Philip Hammond, the chancellor, of failing to put enough effort into getting ready for the possibility of no deal. May has promised Eurosceptic MPs that everything necessary will be done to prepare for leaving the EU without an agreement, while insisting that the government’s preferred plan is to achieve a deal. In the Commons, Davis reassured MPs that a deal was likely to be done despite the stalemate in talks, but also accused the EU of trying to drag out the negotiations to try to get more money out of the UK. The Brexit secretary said the UK was ready to start discussions on the future trading relationship, as a deal needed to be struck before exit day in March 2019. “They are using time pressure to get more money out of us. Bluntly, that is what’s going on. It’s obvious to anybody,” he told MPs. “We must be able to talk about the future. We all must recognise that we are reaching the limits of what we can achieve without consideration of the future relationship. “At the European summit later this week, I hope the leaders of the 27 will recognise the progress made and provide Michel Barnier [the EU chief negotiator] with a mandate to build on the momentum and spirit of cooperation we now have. Doing so will allow us to best achieve our joint objectives and move towards a deal.” Davis suggested he was confident of some progress on the issue soon, saying: “Let’s just see what the European council comes up with on Friday, shall we?” The UK is lobbying hard for EU leaders to widen the scope of talks when they meet for a summit in Brussels on Friday in order to achieve a deal within the time limit. Discussions are currently limited to EU citizens, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement. The issue of money appears to be causing the deadlock between the UK and EU, which led the prime minister to make a last-minute trip to Brussels on Monday for dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. By the time of the summit May will also have spoken individually to the leaders of France, Ireland, Spain and Italy in an attempt to get them on board for moving on to trade talks. However, Barnier suggested the talks remained at an impasse as he arrived in Luxembourg on Tuesday for a Brexit meeting with 27 EU ministers. Asked whether Monday night’s Brussels dinner had changed anything, he said: “I said three weeks ago I am ready to accelerate the rhythm, but to accelerate it takes two. It was a good working dinner and what we told Prime Minister May is just that is very important to maintain this constructive dynamic in the coming two months.” Barnier rejected accusations that Europe was holding back progress, pointing out that the EU had had to wait for May to trigger article 50 and for the result of a general election. “The EU is not holding anything or anybody back. We are ready and willing to even speed up the negotiation.” A senior EU official said May’s Florence speech, which contained a promise of a €20bn (£18bn) transition payments, had helped to unlock progress. Before the speech, EU capitals were “more and more were afraid we were heading to a no-deal scenario”, but after the speech “the reading is we are negotiating in good faith and that a deal is still in reach”. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said in the Commons that Davis was failing to acknowledge the “seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in” and called on both sides to show more flexibility to break the deadlock. “Every passing week without progress on transitional arrangements make things worse, not better,” he said. Starmer accused the government of sounding too enthusiastic about failing to strike an agreement with the EU, saying: “Only fantasists and fanatics talk up no deal”. Davis responded by saying Starmer had no strategy of his own, and he denied accusations that he was talking up the prospect of not achieving a deal. But he also said it was “scaremongering” for the Resolution Foundation thinktank to say no deal would lead to a sharp increase in prices for food and other goods. Conservative MPs are deeply split over whether the UK should be contemplating a no-deal outcome, with some of the most strident Brexit supporters arguing that the UK should simply walk away without wasting time on talks. James Duddridge, a former minister and Brexit supporter, said no deal was his preferred way to “achieve a fast, clean and boring Brexit” and “the sooner we get on with it the better”. On the other side of the argument, Nicky Morgan, a former Conservative education secretary, urged Davis to beware the “siren voices” calling on him to walk away from Brexit talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/17/mike-samwell-run-over-by-own-car-in-burglary-that-became-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:12:59Z","webTitle":"Man run over by own car in burglary that became murder, court hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/mike-samwell-run-over-by-own-car-in-burglary-that-became-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/mike-samwell-run-over-by-own-car-in-burglary-that-became-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Man run over by own car in burglary that became murder, court hears","bodyText":"A Royal Navy veteran was run over by his own sports car in a botched burglary that turned into a murder, a court has heard. Mike Samwell, 35, from Chorlton, a suburb of south Manchester, was crushed by his Audi S3 when he tried to stop a burglar from stealing it earlier this year. Ryan Gibbons, 29, has admitted burglary and aggravated vehicle taking, but he denies both murder and the alternative, lesser charge of manslaughter. He insists he had no idea he had reversed over Samwell, a claim the crown describes as incredible given that a CCTV camera at least 80 yards away picked up the sound of the victim shouting and also because Samwell was a big man. “Just imagine reversing backwards over a body … Even if you were panicking, could you possibly miss it? Mike Samwell was 5’11” tall and weighed just under 14 stone,” Alistair Webster QC told Manchester crown court. The prosecutor said Samwell’s presence must have been “glaringly obvious to the person or persons taking the car”. Like any “sober and rational” person, Gibbons “must have realised that the object he was crushing under the wheels of the car was a human being”, he said. The jury heard that Samwell, a former submarine officer and nuclear engineer, had enjoyed a pleasant evening with his wife, Jessica, at home in Cranbourne Road on the night of the alleged murder. Before going to bed he had left the keys to his Audi in the kitchen. At 3am Jessica was woken by a sound similar to bins being moved, followed by a bang. Her husband ran downstairs and while she was ringing the police she heard him shouting: “Oi, oi, no, oi, oi! Oh not the fucking car!” When she ran outside she saw him still in his underpants under the wheels of the Audi. There were tyre marks on his chest and he was trapped between the front and rear wheels, suggesting the low-slung vehicle had been reversed over the top of him, the court heard. Samwell was rushed to hospital in an ambulance but died shortly afterwards. There were 39 external injuries to his body, “entirely consistent with him having been run over by the vehicle, dragged across the floor, and with the tyres having gone over him”, Webster said. Gibbons, meanwhile, had sped off in the car, he said. The next day he went to a hotel in Manchester city centre after his girlfriend, Stacey Hughes, booked him in under a false name. He then escaped to Scotland, but was arrested on 27 April in Glenrothes, Fife. Two other figures were caught on CCTV running away from the alleged murder, but neither have yet been identified. A BMW alleged to have been driven by Gibbons’ friend, Raymond Davis, was seen 14 seconds behind the Audi, the court heard. An informal neighourhood watch group had spotted the same BMW in a nearby street a few days earlier and logged it as suspicious. Davis tried to contact Gibbons a few minutes after the alleged murder, mobile phone records show. It was not a spur-of-the-moment crime, Webster said: “This was not a car at the side of the road, easy to see, casually stolen. This was a high value car, parked out of sight, which could only be stolen by means of a burglary, getting the keys out of the house.” Jessica Samwell sobbed as she gave evidence to the court behind a curtain. She described rushing downstairs after hearing “the most awful noise” and finding her husband under the car he had bought just a few months previously. In the dock, Gibbons blinked hard and bowed his head, pressing his skull against the bullet-proof glass as the widow recalled trying to hold Samwell’s hand, desperately hoping he would be ok. After she had finished answering questions, the judge, Mr Justice William Davis, offered his condolences. “I’m really sorry, “he told her. “I’m merely the judge in this case but I know I speak for everybody when I say how desperately sorry we are.” Hughes, 28, denies assisting an offender. Davis has admitted a count of burglary, but denies manslaughter and aggravated vehicle taking without consent. The case continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/why-pro-lifers-who-target-pregnant-women-are-missing-the-point","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Why pro-lifers who target pregnant women are missing the point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/why-pro-lifers-who-target-pregnant-women-are-missing-the-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/why-pro-lifers-who-target-pregnant-women-are-missing-the-point","fields":{"headline":"Why pro-lifers who target pregnant women are missing the point","bodyText":"After a life of living in London, there are still three sights that make me stop, my mouth an open ooh. The first is the queue outside Madame Tussauds on Baker Street, which is, if you’re being pedantic, and I know you always are, three or four queues, each waiting for half a boiling hot day (there are signs pitted along the pavement advising the busloads of visitors to expect to be inside in two hours, or three) to take a selfie with a wax likeness of Johnny Depp or some notorious criminal, having paid a small fortune for the privilege. The second are the people lining up overnight in freezing weather for the annual Next Christmas sale, who I am convinced are false flag extras, participating in some long-term conspiracy à la 9/11 or the moon landings because, honestly, who cares enough to set their alarm for a half-price Lipsy top? The third is the sight of “pro-life” protestors flapping their foetus placards outside our Marie Stopes clinics. It was raining when I passed the Fitzrovia clinic the other day, and a group of people holding umbrellas (including a man with long blond rock-god hair and some natty rosaries who was guarding the door with venom) had gathered with placards and bibles in order to make pregnant girls think twice. I stopped for a moment, contemplating whether or not it was worth talking to them, asking them whether maybe their time would be better spent helping living children, rather than crowding the pavement to shout at sad women in bad weather, like fans at a Zoella book launch. My new thing is “empathy”, but it was raining. One issue I have, apart from all the “mind your own bloody business, you awful people”, is the method of protest itself. Standing there shouting at women in trouble, the idea is ideally, what? For her to see the photos blown up to A1 size, of the foetus born at six weeks or whatever that went on to live a happy life and now has three children of his own, of all the red-paint-blood spatter and for her to hear their prayers and be saved? Or at least be so intimidated by the strangers shouting at her that she gets back on the tube and makes an appointment somewhere else, quickly. Is it worth it? Is it worth their time? Or isn’t it a bit, I don’t know, shit? As a plan? Isn’t it a bit like spilling someone’s pumpkin spice latte rather than going after Starbucks for tax avoidance? Or vegetarians screaming at pigs? Don’t attack the people who need help, idiots. If you want to fight abortion, fight the government that sanctions it. Or, even simpler, just don’t have an abortion. There. Last week, politicians from Ealing council voted to take the first step towards creating a “buffer zone” around the Marie Stopes West London Centre, a clinic that’s been targeted by anti-abortion protesters for years. At the meeting, councillors were shown footage of a woman being followed in by a man calling out “Mum” as he rattled his rosary beads, and anti-abortion activists holding up images of mutilated foetuses. One entry from the staff logbook read: “Client very tearful after being called a murderer.” The vote, taken in this gentle west London suburb, is being hailed as an important leap forward for abortion rights in the UK. Which is a rare blast of goodness in a news cycle that is otherwise a fatberg of horror for women. A wodge of sexual harassment sluiced down with rape allegations. The realisation that, however many men are punished for bullying and abusing their female staff, the project is worthless if it doesn’t destabilise the pyramids of power in every industry that allows girls to be exploited, hourly. A huge blockage in our collective sewer, a mound of evidence that women are routinely crushed, forgotten, ignored, damned. And then this, a crumb of success. A suggestion, however faint, that we are being listened to. While it might remove some familiar texture from a walk through the city, the loss of these organised sites of harassment would make us feel not just less confused, less angry, but safer, too.

As a child, I was more interested in becoming an author or a pop star than a princess or duchess. But I’m 100% here for Meghan Markle and her potential shakeup of Buckingham Palace. If the rumours of her forthcoming engagement to Prince Harry turn out to be true, it will redefine royalty for a new generation of Brits, because not only is Meghan an accomplished American actress and a philanthropist who is shunning many traditional royal dating protocols, but she is also a black, mixed-race woman. A union between her and Prince Harry would be socially momentous for the country, and especially so for us brown-skinned Brits who never saw ourselves reflected in the all-white Palace lineage. This week, it was announced that Meghan had quit her role in the TV show Suits in an apparent bid to prepare her for the royal wedding. And last month she spoke candidly about being in love in an interview with Vanity Fair. In a weird first for me, I discussed the article with my mates. I don’t usually speak about the royals except to disparage them. Buckingham Palace is an antithesis to diversity, and so has never really interested me. But mixed-race, California-born Meghan – her mother is an African-American with dreadlocks, and her father is Caucasian – is here to disrupt (in a good way). A self-described “activist” on Twitter, she is something of a humanitarian icon for brown-skinned women all over the world. Earlier this year, she went to India, to highlight the stigma surrounding menstruation for poverty-stricken women in Delhi and Mumbai, writing a piece for Time magazine in which she advocated “policy-making surrounding menstrual health initiatives”. In 2015, she also spoke about her battle with her mixed-race identity, telling Elle that she was always fighting to define herself on her own terms, personally and professionally. “You push for colour-blind casting, you draw your own box … You create the identity you want for yourself, just as my ancestors did when they were given their freedom,” she said. I never understood the hype surrounding Diana or Kate. I remember being confused, aged four, when I got up to find my mum sobbing in front of the television as reports of Diana’s death flashed across the screen. But Meghan’s presence within the palace feels different: she is initiating real change when it comes to UK race relations. When Kensington Palace released a statement on behalf of Harry condemning the British press for their “outright sexism and racism” in 2016, to me, it signalled new levels of wokeness for British society. To hear the royal family publicly defend a mixed-race relationship and inadvertently highlighting the intersectional politics that many women like me and Meghan face on a daily basis, was pretty exciting. If Meghan does marry Harry, it will destroy the long-held notion that being regal means being white, or that the main link between Africa and Buckingham Palace is one of colonial importance. There is no escaping the fact that the royal family has benefited directly from years of violent slavery, but I delight in the fact that, despite the disgusting headlines linking Meghan’s own family to shackles and chains, or the think pieces expressing fear around the Windsor gene pool being infiltrated with a “rich and exotic DNA”, Meghan’s position beside her partner, Harry, means she is subverting social hierarchy and upending the British class system in the process. Of course, Meghan is more white-passing than African in appearance, and her good looks and accumulated wealth exclude her from many of the hardships that women of colour face in the UK today. But her proximity to the palace is helping to spark dialogue around the often-overlooked complexities of mixed-race identities in Britain. So for the first time ever, I’ll be keeping an eye out for a royal wedding. @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/17/richard-wilbur-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T12:23:46Z","webTitle":"Richard Wilbur obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/17/richard-wilbur-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/17/richard-wilbur-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Richard Wilbur obituary","bodyText":"In 1957, when he won the Pulitzer prize for his third book of poetry, Things of This World, Richard Wilbur, who has died aged 96, was clearly one of the leading young poets in the US. He combined seemingly casual elegance with painstaking craft, and his ability to touch unsettling truths beneath the surface made him heir apparent to Robert Frost. Tall, handsome and as graceful as his poetry, Wilbur might have been cast as a poet by Hollywood. That his reputation never matched that of his mentor Frost was not due to any failing in his work, but to the times in which he lived. Wilbur’s ascent coincided with a sea change in the landscape of American poetry, a reaction to the academic strictness of “new criticism” in the 1950s, and to the highly structured poetry that it prescribed. The poet Donald Hall said: “The typical ghastly poem of the 50s was a Wilbur poem not written by Wilbur.” In this context, Wilbur’s extraordinary ability became somehow a liability. Even while praising a Wilbur poem as “the most nearly perfect any American has written”, Randall Jarrell complained that his poems “compose themselves into a little too regular a beauty”. The Beats and Black Mountain poets offered a more direct, less formal alternative, and by the 60s even the poetic establishment became dominated by “confessional” poetry, and spawned whole generations of earnest, writer’s workshop verses. Thus, although Wilbur was to serve as US poet laureate (1987-88), his poetry never assumed the sort of centrality in American culture that saw Frost reading at President John F Kennedy’s 1961 inauguration. In the 30 years following his Pulitzer, Wilbur produced only five more collections, one of which, Walking to Sleep (1969), won the Bollingen prize; he received his second Pulitzer for New and Collected Poems (1988). He also established himself as Molière’s finest translator with seven plays, starting with his rhymed English version of The Misanthrope (1955). That led to him writing the lyrics for the 1956 Leonard Bernstein/Lilian Hellman comic opera Candide. In the 80s he moved on to Racine, translating Andromache and Phaedra. He translated poetry from languages he did not speak, including that of the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and the Bulgarian Valeri Petrov. He wrote five children’s books, including the award-winning Loudmouse (1963), some of which he illustrated himself, and published two collections of prose. Wilbur was born in New York, to which his father, Lawrence, had moved from Nebraska to pursue a career as a commercial artist and portrait painter. His mother, Helen (nee Purdy), came from a family of New York journalists. He grew up on a farm in West Caldwell, New Jersey. In 1942 he graduated from Amherst College, Massachusetts, where he edited the paper, and married his university sweetheart, Charlotte Ward, whose grandfather had been Frost’s first publisher. He joined the army intending to serve as a cryptographer, but his leftwing political background created a suspicion of “disloyalty” and he was transferred to the infantry. He fought at Anzio and Monte Cassino, in France and Germany, reaching the rank of staff sergeant. After the second world war ended he gained an MA at Harvard, where he was appointed to a junior fellowship, assisting the pioneering American studies scholar FO Matthiessen and the literary critic IA Richards. It was there he met Frost, whose work became an important influence. Like Frost, Wilbur had a deep sense of nature, and a gift for seeing human life reflected in the natural world. After Harvard, he taught briefly at Wellesley College, then for 20 years from 1957 at Wesleyan University, where he helped found the university publisher’s excellent poetry series. As a former student, I can testify to his dedication, and the kindness with which he provided serious criticism of even the most banal and awkward attempts at poetry. His teaching, whether of influences as obvious as Frost, Wallace Stevens or EE Cummings, or more distant, such as George Herbert or Gerard Manley Hopkins, was based on an ability to dissect the inner workings of both poem and poet. Despite his celebrity and his patrician grace, he was remarkably attuned to his students. His 1970 poem For the Student Strikers was written for the unofficial newspaper produced at Wesleyan during the strike in protest against Richard Nixon’s invasion of Cambodia and the jailing of the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale. Wilbur had not lost touch with his own student radicalism. After leaving Wesleyan in 1977, he served as writer-in-residence at Smith College for 10 years before retiring. He continued to write, and in 2006 was awarded the Ruth Lilly poetry prize for his lifetime achievement. Few modern poets have focused so intensely on the way sorrow and joy, tragedy and wonder, combine in the richness of life. No other poet’s writing seems to celebrate and enjoy life more. Wilbur’s 2000 collection Mayflies contained the stunning poem This Pleasing Anxious Being, first published in the New Yorker in 1998. It is a meditation on life and memory – as if he were writing his own, elegant epitaph. The poem’s third section recalls a seven-year-old, wrapped in blankets, in the back seat of a Buick being driven through a storm to Christmas with relatives. It is 1928; his mother leans out the window to wipe snow off the windscreen, and through the child’s “half-closed eyes” the “dark hood of the car” suggests and recalls his life to come. Those eyes “might foresee” The steady chugging of a landing craft Through morning mist to the bom- barded shore, Or a deft prow that dances through the rocks In the white water of the Allagash, Or, in good time, the bedstead at whose foot The world will swim and flicker and be gone. Charlotte died in 2007. Wilbur is survived by his daughter, Ellen, and his sons, Christopher, Nathan and Aaron. • Richard Purdy Wilbur, poet and translator, born 1 March 1921; died 14 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/19/how-to-cook-the-perfect-carrot-halwa-diwali","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"How to cook the perfect carrot halwa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/19/how-to-cook-the-perfect-carrot-halwa-diwali","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/19/how-to-cook-the-perfect-carrot-halwa-diwali","fields":{"headline":"How to cook the perfect carrot halwa","bodyText":"Diwali, the Hindu festival of light also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and some Buddhists, falls today and continues until Saturday. Spiritually, it signifies the triumph of good over evil, hope over despair and knowledge over ignorance. Culinarily, it mainly delivers sugar. Crumbly laddoo, fudgey barfi, sticky gulab jamun and creamy kheer are just a few of the dizzying array of sweet snacks that will fuel the busy round of family visits, ceremonies and parties this week. Diwali is a golden opportunity to crack out a few regional specialities from around the subcontinent – syrup-soaked mung beans, Rajasthani cream fritters, rice flour doughnuts and many, many others – but halwa is a near-universal treat: a sweet, buttery pudding made with everything from mung beans to pineapples, but which is often carrot-based. Carrots are grown in abundance in the UK and are cheap and healthy, so gajar ka halwa offers the perfect excuse to crack open the celebratory sugar and ghee. As Meera Sodha puts it in Fresh India: “If eating carrots as a pudding strikes you as odd, remember how good a spiced carrot cake is. This isn’t too distant a cousin.” The carrots Although a carrot is a carrot, the native variety – “deep red, sweet and intensely crunchy” is how Pakistani food writer Sumayya Usmani describes them in Mountain Berries and Desert Spice – tends to be favoured for this dish. The taste is similar, but our orange versions can’t compete on colour; she suggests adding a little natural red food colouring if you want your dish to look more authentic. The chef Kaushy Patel uses finely grated carrot in her book Prashad, giving her recipe a more homogenous consistency. My testers preferred a chunkier texture, although this will make the halwa take slightly longer to cook, so follow Patel’s lead if you are in a hurry. Simon Daley and Roshan Hirani, in their book Cooking With My Indian Mother-in-Law, start by boiling the grated carrot in water, while chef Cyrus Todiwala recommends something similar, with added ghee. As usual, the less healthy option proves more delicious – softening the carrot by sautéing it in ghee, as chefs from Vivek Singh to Maunika Gowardhan recommend, seems to give the vegetable a more intense flavour. Patel supplies another helpful tip for time-pressed cooks: “Constant stirring and varying the temperature during frying both help to speed up the process of cooking off the carrot juice.” The dairy Although it is certainly possible to make this dish vegan by using nut milks (cashew might be nice), carrot halwa is made traditionally with whole milk, slow simmered until it is rich and sweet. Todiwala is the only chef to use milk alone, cooking it gently with the carrots for almost an hour – a process, he writes in Mr Todiwala’s Bombay, that is “better not rushed”. Patel throws caution to the wind and boils the milk hard, “stirring continuously”, then adds some milk powder at the end to help thicken the dish and “absorb any excess moisture from the carrots”. It also gives her halwa the slightly grainy texture that I consider characteristic of many Indian sweets. If you’re not a fan, leave it out. Usmani cooks her carrots in a blend of milk and double cream, heavily weighted towards the latter, which lends her halwa the luxurious richness of an excellent rice pudding. Everyone else accelerates the process with either evaporated or condensed milk, or a mixture of these and fresh milk. While the classic recipe is lovely – and thick, gloopy condensed milk gives the dessert what Gowardhan describes as “a really nice gooey, fudgey consistency” – I am surprised how popular the slightly caramelised tang of evaporated milk proves with my testers. It gives Singh’s dessert a complex, interesting flavour – and cuts the preparation time considerably. Double win. Usmani’s is the only recipe not to use ghee or butter, but, unless you are equally free with the double cream, this is a dessert that really needs a bit of butter – otherwise, it’s just grated carrot with a bit of sugar. The sweetener Speaking of sugar, those carrots need to be sweetened with something. White sugar seems to be the standard choice (caster will dissolve fastest), but Sodha’s use of jaggery, or unrefined palm sugar, for her garnish is intriguing: it strikes me that its treacly notes would work well with the caramelised flavours in the pudding. With jaggery being hard to find outside Asian grocers, soft brown sugar would make a decent substitute. Feel free to use either – or, indeed, white sugar, if you are after a simpler, more vibrantly coloured halwa. Similarly, if you would prefer a sliceable sweet to a spoonable pudding, keep cooking the mixture until it is dry and crumbly, as Todiwala describes it, then smooth into a dish and allow to cool before cutting into squares. The fruit, nuts and spices Not only is this a pudding made of vegetables, but it is also studded with fruit and nuts – stick a bit of coconut oil and date syrup in there and you could almost call it “clean”. Use whatever you have to hand – almonds, pistachios, desiccated coconut and raisins are popular – but take a tip from Gowardhan and add any dried fruit during the cooking process; “the heat of the pudding will ... puff up the raisins, making them taste even better”. If you are really looking to impress, nuts caramelised in butter and sugar that is lightly spiced with garam masala, as Sodha suggests, make for a fancy garnish. Spice has a role to the play in the pudding, too: cardamom is the most popular flavouring in the recipes that I try. Daley and Hirani also add nutmeg, while Usmani opts for cloves and saffron, all of which prove delicious. Saffron seems like a wise bet as much for its vivid colour as its delicate perfume, but, if you use only one spice, zesty cardamom would be my choice; its freshness is the perfect foil for the rich sweetness of the carrot. Spring rolls, anyone? In Vivek Singh’s Indian Festival Feasts, the chef writes that, although there is “something special” about the dish at Diwali,“the idea of having bowl after bowl of rich, sweet halwa seems less and less appealing”. If you feel a similar sinking feeling at the prospect of being fed carrot pudding, you may wish to follow his example and turn your halwa into spring rolls. Personally, I think it will be a while before I reach that stage. The perfect carrot halwa Serves 4 6 cardamom pods 25g ghee 500g carrots, peeled and grated 250ml evaporated milk Pinch of saffron 50g soft light brown sugar 50g white sugar Handful of raisins or sultanas 20g milk powder (optional) Handful of pistachios, almonds or cashews, roughly chopped Squash the cardamom pods to remove the seeds, then roughly crush these to a powder in a pestle and mortar. Heat the ghee in a wide, heavy-based pan on a medium high heat and fry the powder for a minute or so until aromatic, then add the grated carrot and a pinch of salt. Fry for five minutes on a medium heat, then turn up the heat and fry for another five, stirring all the time. Repeat if necessary until the carrots are soft and dryish – this should take 10-15 minutes in total. Pour in the evaporated milk, add the saffron and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium and simmer, stirring regularly, until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the sugar and dried fruit and continue cooking, stirring so the mixture doesn’t catch, until thickened, then stir in the milk powder if using and cook for another minute or so. Allow to cool slightly before serving with the nuts on top. Is carrot halwa your favourite Diwali sweet? If not, what will you be indulging in today?

The Proviz Reflect360 Backpack is one such thing. I first bought one about five years ago. I’ve used it to lug my kit to work every day since then. I’ve torn out the netting side pockets and scraped off so much of the reflective coating that it was beginning to look very shabby. It was time to buy a new backpack and there could only be one contender. It’s tough, durable, capacious, comfortable, well designed and dazzlingly reflective. The sweep of a car’s headlights sets it shimmering in the dark. Cycling home wearing this makes you feel you have spotlights all over your back. Using 100% CE EN 20471 certified reflective material, the Proviz backpack’s millions of integrated reflective beads ensures other riders and drivers will always see you in the dark and poor light. It’s unisex, fully adjustable and has been designed to fit closely to your body so that you are completely stable while riding. And Proviz had not been idle these past few years. I’d have been happy to buy the exact pack again but it now has numerous improvements. The material is thicker and feels more substantial. There is more padding over the shoulders and round the hips. The zips are water resistant, there’s adjustable waist/hip straps, chest straps, webbing haul, gear loops, mesh pockets and a light loop. It’s been built with a decent ventilation system to ensure good airflow between the bag and you to help avoid that uncomfortable sweaty back when you arrive at the office. Oh, and it looks pretty cool in daylight, too. It costs £69.99 and is available at Provizsports.com.

Nobody wants a “Jeremiah next door”, which is how the Daily Mail recently described Philip Hammond’s relationship to Theresa May. The chancellor was accused of spooking the prime minister with Old Testament fire-and-brimstone economic forecasts. His refusal to spread the Good News about Brexit was cited as grounds for dismissal. Jeremiah was right, of course. That’s what made him a good prophet. Still, the book that carries his name is not without Brexit parables. Chapter 28 introduces Hananiah, who promises to release the people of Judah from the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar. He will repatriate powers from Babylon (I paraphrase only slightly) and it will take only two years. But Hananiah is a shyster. “The Lord has not sent thee,” Jeremiah tells him. “Thou makest this people to trust in a lie.” Scripture does not record whether reclaimed Babylonian gold had been pledged for the Judean health service. It is easy for pro-Europeans to scoff at Brexiters who blame insufficient exuberance for the slow fulfilment of their dream, when it is the dream itself that is failing to measure up to reality. But anyone so tempted should remember that leavers also laugh at shroud-waving remainers, on whose head the post-referendum sky failed to fall despite apocalyptic forecasts. One side cries delusion; the other, hysteria. I happen to think that facts favoured the anti-Brexit argument last year and that the leavers now demand positive thinking because they feel events unfolding at a negative angle. If there wasn’t a gap between what was promised and what can be delivered, there would be no need for leaps of faith. But harrowing jeremiads didn’t win the referendum campaign and they aren’t helping now, except perhaps as therapy for despondent pro-Europeans. It might be comforting, too, when venerable institutions keep the old remain-flame burning. The OECD today warned that divergence from the EU would lead to the UK’s long-term economic decline. The thinktank also suggested that a Brexit reversal, perhaps by a second referendum, could repair the damage. Last week the IMF identified British economic under-performance as a “notable exception” to an otherwise upbeat global forecast. No prizes for identifying the exceptional decision Britain made in 2016 that might yield such an effect. But people who voted leave do not relish being told that they embraced national ruin. They appreciate still less the inference that their vote expressed intellectual or moral deficiency: vulnerability to a con or racist dyspepsia in their guts, caused by failure to digest modernity. If minds were easily changed by a patronising eye-roll and a finger-wagging demand to get real, Jeremy Corbyn would not be leader of the Labour party. His opponents tested those methods to destruction. Recent Labour history is also instructive on the limited utility of doomsday scenarios. The extreme worst-case outcome is, by definition, less probable than something milder. Catastrophism sets the bar low for an opponent. Technically, Labour lost the 2017 general election. But predictions of annihilation, served with macabre relish, made Corbyn’s creditable second-place glisten like a gold medal in his supporters’ eyes. Brexiters are now surfing a falling tide of expectations. There is a whole sub-genre of chutzpah pioneered by the likes of Chris Grayling and David Davis, claiming that no one said Brexit would be easy in the exact blithe tones in which they once said it would be a cinch. It is quite common to see leavers compare the scale of the task ahead to mobilisation for the second world war. The analogy is meant to invoke a patriotic blitz spirit, but it sets a grotesque benchmark for success. Anything short of the imperilment of civilisation counts as a good result. Remainer horror stories unwittingly accept that metric. I don’t think it is asking too much that Brexit rather be judged against the terms of its sale to the public: a quick fix for porous borders, a cost-free carnival of sovereignty and a cash rebate. The pitch was not, as I recall, that it would be safer than bombardment by the Luftwaffe. The current impasse in negotiations makes a messy outcome look temporarily more likely, although there is a way through. At their summit later this week, the EU27 will offer “internal preparatory” discussions about the terms of the UK’s transition and future trade deal. That is a concession on the timetable, although many Tories will struggle to call it one. Theresa May will then loosen the purse-strings a bit further in discussion of the UK’s outstanding budget commitments. If both sides choreograph their moves, side-stepping the hardliners in May’s party, phase two of the talks can be unlocked in December. The principle is crude but effective: pay to play. There are still many ways the process can be derailed. Even if a deal is done, it can be undone on its ratification journey through continental parliaments. The most probable outcome, on the current trajectory, is a ragged compromise that meets a technical definition of Britain no longer being a member of the EU, but with enough continuing integration for Eurosceptics to feel betrayed. The UK will be worse off than it needed to be, angrier, and diminished on the world stage. But it will not be a smouldering crater. Yet Westminster is not equipped to navigate the space between the best and worst cases imaginable. It is a feature of polarisation, accelerated by self-segregation in digital opinion ghettos, that public debate on many issues is framed as if the only options are rapture and calamity: building the New Jerusalem or a Fourth Reich. But soon we will be confronted with choices from the more mundane, middle part of the spectrum: neither perfection nor perdition. I wonder if we can recall the vocabulary to argue in terms of least-worst options. Do we remember how to debate without impugning each other’s motives and integrity? Last year’s referendum whipped up a millenarian frenzy that only dedicated fanatics would choose to sustain. Pro-Europeans should avoid that trap. British politics does not need more hallucinatory arguments between Jeremiahs and Hananiahs. Promises were made. That is a point of fact, not faith. Whether Brexit can match those promises is a question of evidence. There is no more need for prophecy. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/17/after-five-rounds-of-brexit-talks-david-davis-runs-out-of-bluster","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T15:51:33Z","webTitle":"After five rounds of Brexit talks, David Davis runs out of bluster | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/17/after-five-rounds-of-brexit-talks-david-davis-runs-out-of-bluster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/17/after-five-rounds-of-brexit-talks-david-davis-runs-out-of-bluster","fields":{"headline":"After five rounds of Brexit talks, David Davis runs out of bluster","bodyText":"Same time, same place, same speech. The humiliation is now almost complete. Five times David Davis has come back to the Commons to report on the progress of his talks with Michel Barnier, and on each occasion the Brexit secretary has had little to say. In the early days, he used to claim that the lack of progress was a sign of how much progress had been made, but now he has lost the will to even bluster. The former SAS man has barely got the strength to fight his way out of a paper bag. Throughout his five-minute statement, Davis could barely bring himself to raise his eyes towards the opposition benches. The contempt he could have taken. But it was the pity that got him every time. Some important steps had been made, he said in a barely audible mumble. He couldn’t say exactly what they were but they had been made. The negotiations were being conducted in a good spirit. As in, no one had actually walked out yet. But he was reaching the limits of what was possible. Realising Davis was on the verge of mental and physical disintegration, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, chose his words carefully. He didn’t want to finish Davis off for good, but neither could he afford to let him off the hook entirely. Rather, he acted as a therapist. He understood Davis’s pain but he had to be aware that it was he who had agreed to the sequencing of the talks so he could hardly blame the EU for sticking to it. If we weren’t ready to negotiate, why had we triggered article 50? At this point, Davis looked like he might burst into tears. Starmer backtracked a little. Maybe he had been overdoing the tough love. Yes, there had been some acceleration since the prime minister’s Florence speech. From 2mph to 4mph. And that was to be applauded. It really was. But now was the time to aim just a little higher. Maybe go all out and see if he could creep up to 6mph. And while he was about it, could he drop the fantasy that no deal was better than a bad deal? This was a step too far for Davis. There was only so much reality he could take at any one time. Vulnerability gave way to aggression. “All he does is carp,” he said tetchily, putting on and taking off his glasses with increasing neurotic energy. “He never comes up with any solutions of his own.” In his fugue state, Davis had now apparently forgotten that it was the government’s responsibility to dig itself out of the hole it had created. “It’s not true that I talked up a no deal,” he added. He just hadn’t made any effort to talk one down. There was some respite for Davis from his own benches. Almost exclusively from the likes of Bill Cash, Owen Paterson and Richard Drax, who are even more deluded than he is over Brexit. Shouldn’t we seriously consider the no deal option? Davis nodded his head vigorously. The cunning Europeans were using the negotiations to get as much money as they could out of us. Worryingly, it sounded as if this thought had only just occurred to him. Sometimes, he really isn’t that bright. The Labour benches tried to bring Davis back to reality. Business needed certainty, not a cliff edge brought about by government incompetence and infighting. It’s a measure of just how out of whack the Tories have become that Labour is now the official voice of business. Several MPs quoted key reports that had just been published on the damaging effects of Brexit on the economy. Fake news, Davis screamed. He was sick to death of so-called experts in the pay of the Russians and the EU talking down the British economy. The economy was actually in a far better state now than it had been at any time since lunchtime the day before. So what if inflation was rising at 3%? La, la, la. Everything was going to be just fine. Trust him. Even a no deal wouldn’t be so bad; once everyone had gone broke, things could only get better. And besides, it was even possible that the EU council might surprise everyone by agreeing to progress the talks on Friday. Though highly unlikely if it had spent the last 45 minutes listening to him slagging it off. There wasn’t anything more to be said after that mini-rant so the session ended earlier than expected. In any case, it was time for Davis to take his medication. The men in white coats were ready and waiting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/20/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T09:36:09Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: leaders, vulgar gestures, misers and Shakespeare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/20/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/20/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: leaders, vulgar gestures, misers and Shakespeare","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/25/us-may-intervene-in-qatar-crisis-as-fears-grow-over-long-term-rupture","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"US may intervene in Qatar crisis as fears grow over long-term rupture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/us-may-intervene-in-qatar-crisis-as-fears-grow-over-long-term-rupture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/25/us-may-intervene-in-qatar-crisis-as-fears-grow-over-long-term-rupture","fields":{"headline":"US may intervene in Qatar crisis as fears grow over long-term rupture","bodyText":"Gulf states expect Donald Trump to intervene to try to end the bitter feud between Qatar and four other Middle East states that has destabilised the region. The US is concerned that the four month-long dispute involving its chief allies in the region is entrenching divisions and may end up forcing Qatar – home to the US’s primary Middle East military base – into a closer relationship with Iran. Washington is expected to give the regional mediator, Kuwait’s Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, another chance to try to persuade the warring parties to meet at a long-scheduled Gulf Cooperation Council summit in December, but it may intervene soon afterwards. “We will not and cannot dictate the terms of any resolution, but we are happy to be available in any way that the parties would like,” the US assistant secretary of state Tim Lenderking said this month. He said the rhetoric surrounding the dispute, including “personal and often humiliating attacks”, made a verbal ceasefire a precondition of any talks. “At the moment there is an erosion of trust between the Gulf leaders,” he said. Hacked emails, secret tapes, “fake news” and conspiracy theories have proliferated as the once secretive monarchies hurl abuse at one another across social media. Apparent efforts by the quartet – Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt – to foment internal strife in Qatar or even a coup against the Harrow- and Sandhurst-educated emir, Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani, have backfired. The blockade has instead resulted in a rallying to the flag by the country’s 250,000 Qataris and its many other residents. Many of Doha’s buildings, cars, airport signs, mobile phone covers and even Qatari Twitter handles are festooned with the same drawing of the emir, nicknamed “Tamim the Glorious”. In universities, students report an upsurge of patriotic feeling. Alanood al-Jalahma, a 21-year-old medical student, said the dispute had led to a growing interest in politics on university campuses. “People are speaking up and saying this could be done better. Change is happening,” she said. But Jalahma said it was also leading towards a long-term rupture in the Gulf. “People are so scared that if I send a note of congratulations on social media to a friend in Bahrain, they will not reply.” The crisis erupted on 5 June when the quartet imposed a diplomatic and physical blockade of Qatar. They demanded the country end its alleged support for terrorism, cut its links with Shia Iran and end its subversion of their regimes. They claimed Doha had harboured key figures from Hamas, the Taliban and the Muslim Brotherhood, and financed dissident clerics in Saudi Arabia. In an interview with the Guardian, the chair of Qatar’s national counter-terrorism committee, Abdulaziz al-Ansari, went on the offensive over claims that his country had been soft on UN-designated terrorists, the wedge issue with which the quartet has sought to sway US public opinion. “We wake up every day with a new made-up list of alleged terrorists that the blockading countries say we are harbouring and that must throw into jail, but there is an international system for dealing with such cases,” he said. He pointed to a new bilateral memorandum of understanding that his government had signed with the US. “The memorandum creates an agreement with the US and a model that other countries in the region could replicate. The whole world has to collaborate in the exchange of information because delay can cause disaster. We have energised all of Qatar’s relevant government agencies and to put them to work under one umbrella.” Ansari insisted travel bans and asset freezes had been imposed on all those designated as terrorists by the UN in Qatar. A domestic list of designated terrorists has been established, and three men previously discharged for lack of corroborative evidence are again facing prosecution. The threshold for prosecution has been lowered. In addition, it is expected that a small number of US Treasury officials will be permitted to work inside Qatar’s government. Meanwhile, Qatari officials claim outside financing may no longer be central to much of the terrorism that afflicts Europe. “Most of the terrorists in Europe have records as criminals, drugs addicts, problems at school. They are recruited by Daesh off the internet,” he said. The director of Qatar’s government communication office claimed Saudis were jeopardising regional security by refusing to conduct joint military exercises with the US if Qatar was involved. Sheikh Saif al-Thani said: “The US would never have established such an important military base in Qatar if it thought the country was a nest bed for terrorism.” Many western diplomats argue that the ostensible reasons for the dispute do not add up, and that what lies at its root is a regional competition between Qatar and the UAE and, increasingly, Saudi. Tensions have grown in the wake of the Arab spring in 2011 and the two sides support different factions in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Syria and Egypt. Some say the dispute is primarily ideological and that Qatar has always backed the Islamist side with guns and money. Others say it is more personal, and predominantly the product of a 20-year grudge held by the father of Qatar’s current emir over the way other Gulf states failed to support him when he deposed his own father in 1995. They suggest the emir’s father remains the power behind the throne, still using the vast income from liquid gas production, the outsize reach of al-Jazeera and the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood to challenge Saudi hegemony. One of the quartet’s leading ambassadors claims their actions in the dispute have succeeded in throwing a revealing spotlight on Qatar’s foreign policy, forcing the tight group around the emir to be much more cautious than it was at the height of the Arab spring. He claims Qatar’s interference in Libya, Syria and Gaza has been reduced, creating space for the alternative anti-Islamist foreign policy of the UAE and Saudi to start to bear fruit. It is no coincidence, he claims, that in Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, backed by the UAE and Egypt, is in the ascendancy, or that Fatah and Hamas are merging – something the UAE foreign ministry helped engineer. Qatar, for its part, protests its innocence, saying it is content to expel Taliban representatives if the US so wishes. A Qatari official said: “The new emir, on succeeding his father in 2013, himself promised to reduce the focus on foreign policy in favour of domestic reform, including education. That has happened.” The collapse of the Arab spring, once seen as an existential threat to autocratic regimes, has left Qatar with fewer openings. But the danger is that in a region where no monarchy will want to be seen as the loser, and where personal relations are deteriorating, Iran could yet be the beneficiary. Qatar, unlike Saudi, did not praise Trump’s decertification of the Iran nuclear deal. Either way, the US state department’s Lenderking said: “This dispute does not get any better with the passage of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/17/winds-have-generated-power-for-centuries","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:17:28Z","webTitle":"Winds have generated power for centuries | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/17/winds-have-generated-power-for-centuries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/17/winds-have-generated-power-for-centuries","fields":{"headline":"Winds have generated power for centuries","bodyText":"“Walsall was never a pretty town”, according to Roy Boffy (Letters, 16 October); this may be true now but has not always been the case.

Shakespeare was only four months into a three-year contract when the board decided to act after losing faith following a poor start to the season. Jon Rudkin, Leicester’s director of football, informed Shakespeare of the news at the club’s training ground, where the 53-year-old had overseen a friendly match against a Nottingham Forest side earlier in the day, totally unaware that he was about to be relieved of his duties. Leicester are third bottom, with six points from eight games, and Michael Appleton, Shakespeare’s assistant, has been asked to take charge of the team for Saturday’s game at Swansea as the board start the process of putting together a shortlist with a view to making an appointment as soon as possible. It is understood that no one has been lined up for the post, with Leicester remaining tight-lipped other than to categorically rule out the prospect of Nigel Pearson returning to the club. Pearson was recently appointed head coach of OH Leuven, the second-tier Belgian side owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family, who also control Leicester. Names likely to come under consideration include Sean Dyche, Sam Allardyce, Roberto Mancini, Carlo Ancelotti, Martin O’Neill and David Wagner. Much could depend, however, on how difficult it is to prise managers out of their current jobs – something that is likely to rule out any move for Marco Silva, who has made an excellent start to the season at Watford. Leicester’s opening results have been nothing like as impressive, yet it still came as a shock to players and staff when it emerged that he had lost his job. Having served as Claudio Ranieri’s No2 when the club won the Premier League title in 2016, Shakespeare was asked to take over in a caretaker capacity when the Italian was dismissed in February. He led Leicester into the Champions League quarter-finals and to a 12th-place finish in the Premier League, prompting the club to give him the job on a permanent basis. The summer transfer window brought frustration to the manager when Danny Drinkwater was sold to Chelsea on deadline day and Leicester were 14 seconds late in their attempt to sign Adrien Silva, another midfielder, as a replacement. A tricky opening to the campaign, including fixtures against Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, hardly helped Shakepeare’s cause but Leicester’s owners still expected more than only one league victory at this stage. Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the club’s vice-chairman, said: “Craig has been a great servant to Leicester City – during his spells as an assistant manager and since taking over as manager in challenging circumstances in February. His dedication to the club and to his work has been absolute and the contribution he made to the most successful period in Leicester City history is considerable. “However, our early promise under Craig’s management has not been consistently evident in the months since and the board feels that, regrettably, a change is necessary to keep the club moving forward – consistent with the long-term expectations of our supporters, board and owners.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/18/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-la-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T23:01:07Z","webTitle":"The Book of Dust Vol 1: La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman review – worth the wait","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/18/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-la-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/18/the-book-of-dust-vol-1-la-belle-sauvage-by-philip-pullman-review","fields":{"headline":"The Book of Dust Vol 1: La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman review – worth the wait","bodyText":"Philip Pullman is the living heir of Lewis Carroll and George MacDonald and, yes, CS Lewis – in spite of Lewis being his chief bugbear, whom he attacks furiously for his religiosity and misanthropy. While JK Rowling carried on the tradition of jolly school adventures and gripping supernatural yarns, he has chosen the pilgrim road of fantastic metaphysical allegory, and his new book nods to Spenser’s The Faerie Queene in the same way as His Dark Materials took on Milton and Paradise Lost. In this longed-for opening volume of the new trilogy, Pullman faces his lineage without apology: his young heroine is even called Alice, and the story follows her as she is swept down the Thames in the eponymous canoe of the hero, Malcolm. But whereas the Thames offered Carroll’s Alice an idyllic, pastoral meander, a very contemporary apocalypse explodes around this older Alice. To begin with, La Belle Sauvage feels old-fashioned and comfy, set in a picture-book Oxford redolent of stewed cabbage, meat pies and generous helpings of pudding, lit by naphtha lamps and warmed by brandwijn. The action takes place 10 years before Northern Lights, and unfolds how Lyra, the once and future heroine of His Dark Materials, will come to grow up in the Oxford college called Jordan. The hero, Malcolm, a red-haired, good-natured, savvy and inquisitive 11-year-old, works as a potboy in his parents’ pub, The Trout at Godstow, and helps out the nuns living in the priory on the island across the way. He is an ordinary lad in some respects, but a golden boy over all – like Pip and Oliver in Dickens, with a dash of Kim, and of Emil from another classic Pullman admires, Erich Kästner’s Emil and the Detectives. As for Alice, she is seen, early on, working as a barmaid; when a customer pinches her bottom, she smashes a beer tankard and flings the handle at the offender. One night, as Malcolm is watching great crested grebes nesting by the river, he accidentally observes a spy drop going wrong, and after that “everything just then seemed hung about with an unhappy air of suspicion and fear”. Pullman is a powerful voice for many endangered features of postwar society, which gave his (and my) generation so many chances. In Malcolm’s Oxford there are no free libraries any more; teachers are being bullied into dreary box-ticking; dissenting voices publicly humiliated and disappeared. The novel lets out an angry howl about climate change, inequality and criminal financial arrangements.On Pullman’s world map, however, the oppressors’ headquarters are in Geneva, the fountainhead of Calvinism, and of the doctrine of predestined damnation which Pullman has attacked so vehemently, while Uppsala in Sweden is the base of the organised resistance. The dreaded Consistorial Court of Discipline and its horrible offshoots are imposing full-scale surveillance and dreary intellectual compliance throughout schools, and urging children to denounce their parents for failing to conform. Worldwide, a craving for mysterious dust and its quantum possibilities drives the evil characters, and their machinations unfold in fractured glimpses as the mood grows ever more sombre. Malcolm and Alice embark on a quest to save Lyra from Mrs Coulter, her enthralling, wicked mother, even more beautiful, cruel and terrible here, and deliver the baby to her father, the glamorous Lord Asriel, with his snow leopard daemon. The survival of the country is at stake, and the children’s ark gives the book its title. Six-month-old Lyra is a sweet baby, much less turbulent than the wonderful wild scruff of a girl who brought such dynamic excitement to the earlier books. She already has her daemon, Pantalaimon, a mischievous, furry shapeshifter, and Alice and Malcolm have theirs, too, also not yet “fixed” because they are young. These doppelgangers are Pullman’s greatest invention, and show his naturalist’s interest in animals, especially birds; Malcolm’s daemons are a twitcher’s dream – kingfisher, greenfinch and, for night vision, an owl. The chief villain, vampire-like in his lust for dust and other things, is a charmer when he wants to be, but a rapist and pederast with a monstrous hyena for a daemon, who is given to howling laughter and pissing in her victim’s path; she loses one leg in her first, frenzied fight with Malcolm and, later, another. This hellhound of twisted gothic fantasy is truly ghastly, and fulfils a point of honour for Pullman: no reader, child or other, need be spared. In imaginative fiction, sentiment, softness and sweetness are simply condescending. Much mythological material is being brewed: a predestined wonderful foundling, a child snatcher, a few treacherously beguiling spectres and perilous fairylands. Pullman’s immense powers of kinaesthetic visualisation keep the story pulsing on an epic scale as enchanted allegory combines with a full-on retelling of the Biblical story of the flood: defences cave in and banks break under roiling storm clouds, and the familiar world of Oxford and its meadows is drowned. But as the waters rise and the canoe is swept up on the torrent, the Victorian social realism of the book’s opening remains in force in Malcolm’s struggles to build fires to warm Lyra’s milk, and the surrounding scene spins into vague, turbulent dreams of English pastoral wrecked by malefactors and beset by raging monsters who must be overcome in ferocious combat. Again Pullman targets religious political authority and its hypocrisies: but this time he paints one convent in a kindly light compared to another, where the grim Sisters of Holy Obedience torment the orphans in their care. For more than half of the book, the deluge pours down so vividly I thought of putting on a mac and waders: “And the rain had set in with a fury. It fell not in drops but in sheets, and the ground was running with it, so that you couldn’t see anything solid: just flowing fields of bitter cold water ... ” When Pullman retold the Grimms’ Fairy Tales, he singled out for admiration their austere style, and quoted James Merrill’s yearning for “the kind of unseasoned telling found / In legends, fairy tales, a tone licked clean / Over the centuries by mild old tongues”. “Tradecraft” is a term that he uses admiringly here: the gyptians’ knowledge of the waterways isn’t eldritch, but expertise born of hands-on traditional work. The carefully wrought and mended canoe is itself a character, a daemonic ally more closely described in its physical materiality than any of the dramatis personae. Coram the gyptian explains: “Every inch of her has been looked at and strengthened … She’ll be the slippiest vessel on the Thames … She’ll go through the water like a hot knife through butter.” Malcolm is handy, too: he helps the nuns fortify their convent against marauders, and there is even a chapter called “Glazing Sprigs” after the kind of nail needed to hold a pane of glass in place before pressing in the putty. He also works out the purpose of a carved acorn the spy network uses to pass messages: it does not unscrew in the usual way, but clockwise. Like the alethiometer, the truth-telling device that will become Lyra’s special clairvoyant tool, the subtle and contrary acorn captures the essence of Pullman’s methods. He likes to take received ideas – the sinfulness of the fall, legends of child-snatching Gypsies – and turn them round about and upside down until they ring false and hollow. His declared aim is to re-enchant life for his readers, young and other, in order to withstand the pleasure-denying forces of political pieties and religious doctrine about sin and damnation. In a lecture called “The Republic of Heaven”, to be published next month in a collection called Dæmon Voices, Pullman speaks of his desire “to reclaim a vision of heaven from the wreck of religion; to realise that our human nature demands meaning and joy ... to accept that this meaning and joy will involve a passionate love of the physical world.” In La Belle Sauvage, the possibility of hope and love rises from the helpful knowhow of many admirable minor characters – carpenters and boatwrights, cooks and gardeners – as well as from the friendship of the two young protagonists and their courage. Alice’s character unfolds with touching surprisingness, and the passages about Malcolm’s confused feelings for her, as adolescence begins to change him, are among the most perceptive in the book. Pullman himself is a woodworker, artist and calligrapher; his tradecraft aligns him with another important strand in the sensibility of Victorian Oxford and American transcendentalism: the independent-minded, visionary Henry David Thoreau building his cabin, William Morris with his ideals of beautiful handmade things, and John Ruskin, who shared those dreams. Pullman has come to resemble the Ancient Mariner, shaking hoary locks, demanding we pay attention to the calamities gathering on all sides. The radiant devices and other wishful dreams of alternative futures have rather faded from view in this new book, and the child heroes are beleaguered and alone in their valiant struggle against huge, massed forces of harm. The tension in Pullman between deep attraction to magic and fierce atheistic pragmatism resolves itself into a commitment to art – especially shipshapeliness; this is a properly Romantic attitude. Just as his concept of daemons owes a lot to Coleridge’s ideas about inspiration, and his absolute trust in imagination rings with the hopes and beliefs of Keats and Shelley, so the commitment to the making of things as well as possible in the here and now expresses his faith that a well-made story, like the small, well-trimmed boat that carries the children on their long, dangerous journey, will offer shelter in any storm. • Marina Warner’s Once Upon a Time: A Short History of Fairy Tale is published by Oxford.

Khizr Khan, speaking at the Democratic national convention with his wife, Ghazala, by his side, produced a copy of the constitution from his jacket pocket, held it up for all to see, and offered to lend it to the then Republican candidate Donald Trump. It also remains the most eloquent response to Trump’s bigotry. Khan, who grew up in a small village in Pakistan, was talking about the sacrifice his son Humayun had made for his country – America. Humayun was killed aged 27 in Iraq 13 years ago, protecting his men from suicide bombers. He is buried at Arlington cemetery, Virginia, alongside so many other war heroes, and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. “We are honoured to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims,” Khan began. He continued: “Donald Trump, you’re asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you, have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words ‘liberty’ and ‘equal protection of law’.” Still addressing Trump, he asked: “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing – and no one.” Now Khan has written a memoir simply, and pointedly, called An American Family. It tells the story of the Khan family, but it is also a universal story of migration – struggle, hope and achievement. Khan, one of 10 children, was 24 when he left Pakistan, first for Dubai then eventually the US. He faced many difficult decisions along the way – leaving the family behind in Houston while he fulfilled his dream of studying law at Harvard; not telling Ghazala that he was so broke after graduating that he had to sleep on a park bench until he got his first wage packet. But the most difficult decision was choosing to talk at the Democratic convention. The Khans had always been a private family, and now they were contemplating sharing their grief with the whole country for a political end – to help the Democrats. The irony is that Khan had spent his early days in the US idolising the Republican president Ronald Reagan. For Khan, politics had been a private matter. Then, in December 2015, just after Trump had made his speech calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US, he was called by a journalist who asked what he thought about it. Khan discovered he had plenty to say about Islam and US patriotism – not least about how his son Humayun had exemplified American values. The interview was published under the headline: “The father of a Muslim war hero has this to say to Donald Trump”. When Khan, now aged 67, was then approached by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, he sought advice from his two surviving sons. Both said he shouldn’t talk at the convention. “They said you will be fair game for criticism, your credibility and reputation will be questioned, you will be maligned.” But something nagged away at him and Ghazala. They talked to youngsters who asked whether it was true that if Trump were president he would ban Muslims from the US. Khan had carried a copy of the constitution around with him since 2005 (when he started to present visiting cadets paying tribute to Humayun with a copy of it). “I would pull it out, and read section one of the 14th amendment – that citizens have equal dignity and equal protection of the law – to hearten these children, but they remained concerned. Some wouldn’t go to school and some wouldn’t eat properly. Their sleeping habits changed.” How could he look the children in the eye and tell them he shared their concerns if he wasn’t prepared to talk at the convention? They thought about the sacrifice their middle son had made for their country. “We would sit in the room where Captain Humayun Khan’s picture and his memorabilia is kept and we would look at that and say: ‘What would he do?’” There was only one choice. Did Khan worry that speaking might reignite their grief? No, he says, because it had never left them. The couple had made a conscious decision to keep Humayun alive in their memory by establishing a scholarship for him at the University of Virginia, where he had studied, and by inviting cadets to their home. Even today, he says, they have not fully accepted their son’s death. “Pardon me if I lose my composure,” he says, quietly. “Whenever we encounter soldiers in uniform we see the amazing dignity in them, and it is a reminder of how Humayun conducted himself, how he talked to others, and we begin to feel he has just appeared from his room with his smile and amazingly graceful way.” His voice wobbles. “If you ask Mrs Khan this question, she says to me: ‘Why do people tell me he is not here? He is here, he is with us. I feel him every day.’” Khan asked Ghazala if she would speak first at the convention. “She just looked at me, and I knew that was a no. Ghazala could not even enter the room with Humayun’s picture in it for seven years. It was our youngest son’s job to clean that room. She said: ‘You think I’ll be able to even stand if his picture is on the screen?’ I said, ‘OK, just stand with me and hold me. I will hold you and you hold the podium.’ When we got off the stage you can see I’m trying to put my arm under hers to make sure she doesn’t fall.” An American Family gives the impression that Ghazala was by far the more active parent – for one thing, Khan seemed to be working all hours. “That is so true,” he says. “I say our three sons are a true reflection of Ghazala’s strength, care and love. Between the two of us, Ghazala has been the better person in the family.” Did he feel guilty for not being there enough when the boys were young? “Yes. We went to visit our eldest Shaharyar, who has three children now. There was a guest in the house and she asked: ‘What would you do differently raising your children now?’ I said: ‘I would raise my children as Shaharyar is raising his.’ He is there every night to give them baths. Whenever they have a bad dream they run to their father in the middle of the night. I wish I had been wise enough and able enough to do that for my sons.” Perhaps devoting so much time to Humayun’s memory is his way of making up? “I don’t know that it is deliberate … Maybe,” he says. As his sons predicted, there was fallout from the speech. Trump questioned why Ghazala, who has a master’s degree in Persian studies, had stood by her husband silently as he spoke. “She had nothing to say … maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say,” he said. How did Khan feel about Trump’s attack? “As a spouse, and knowing how mistaken this person is, I was upset. I was angry that this person again proves his ignorance to me. Ghazala responded to it so well. She said: ‘He doesn’t know me, and he doesn’t know Muslim women, and he doesn’t know how a grieving mother would feel if she’s asked to speak at such a moment.’ She answered that question better than I could. But I was angry.” Was it ignorance or Islamophobia? “It was intentional for political gains. And it is the characteristic of a person who is arrogant and ignorant and practises divisiveness. Every statement he has made since being elected president has been divisive.” You never mention Trump by name, I say. “I don’t dignify him by calling his name. He is president of the United States, but I don’t call him that.” Khan has received hate mail since the speech. “We get some bad letters and emails – threatening and really disrespectful.” But, on the whole, he says the response has been so positive. “We have also received the most wonderful cards and letters. Thousands and thousands of them.” So many people have told him that something in his speech resonated with them. Khan was recently recognised by an airport check-in worker during his book tour. “The fellow who was checking me in at the airport recognised my face and name. He came out and gave me a hug and said: ‘I also lost my son, Mr Khan. Both you and I know that hole in the heart is never filled. We just get used to living with it, so be strong, and you have my support and my prayers, and he went back to his counter and dealt with the rest of the passengers.’” He pauses. “It is true. That hole in the heart always remains.” The following is an extract from An American Family by Khizr Khan ‘He saw something. Maybe a look on the driver’s face. Captain Khan turned, yelled for everyone to hit the dirt. The taxi exploded’ My son was in a coffin. I saw him, looked at him, stared at him. He was my son. My beautiful boy. For days, I’d continued to convince myself the army was wrong. Even on the drive to the funeral home, I told myself there had been a terrible mistake. An army casualty officer, a captain, drove me, and only me; I was still the stoic one in the family because I had to be. I knew that when we got there, when we saw the body in the casket, I would shake with relief and gratitude. Then I would tell them to go, hurry, go to the family that needs you, the family of this poor, lost soldier. The captain stood behind me as I approached the casket. He stood at attention, saluting. A sudden tranquility interrupted my thinking. I nodded slightly. “Yes,” I said. “That’s my son.” Because it was. It is a cliche, but he looked peaceful, as if he was sleeping, perhaps even dreaming of something pleasant. There were no marks or blemishes on his smooth, brown skin. The dimple in his chin was unmarred. The only unusual detail was the bandage, a bright white stripe of gauze stretched across his forehead, covering the wound where a piece of shrapnel had hit him above his left eye. Humayun had been deployed to a forward operating base called Camp Warhorse. Tuesday, 8 June, was his day off, but he went out to the main gate that morning to check on his soldiers, who were responsible for, among other things, security. It was early, about eight o’clock, what everyone called rush hour because of the Iraqi civilians arriving for work. The camp employed about a thousand locals, which was both practical – work needed to be done – and strategic: giving people jobs improved the local economy, which in turn improved living conditions, and people in general are less likely to see as enemies the soldiers who are giving them, or their fathers or mothers or brothers, a pay cheque. The Americans were never meant to be the Iraqis’ enemy. That would become easy to forget as the war dragged on, but the point of invading Iraq was supposed to have been liberating the population from a despot, not subjugating it to American imperialism. It was right there in the name: Operation Iraqi Freedom. Still, by the late spring of 2004, an insurgency had taken root, and Diyala province was one of the seeding grounds. Camp Warhorse had been repeatedly attacked. Security was abundant and tight. There were a series of barriers and gates, a course of deliberate obstructions, leading to the main road. Vehicles were stopped and inspected, mirrors sweeping the undercarriage, the engine compartment and trunk poked through. Civilians parked in a fenced lot set well back from the perimeter of the camp proper. Vehicles coming into the base had to pass though a long canyon of blast walls laid out with sharp turns that forced drivers to manoeuvre through them at a crawl. Towers flanked the path, .50-calibre machine guns tracking anything moving. Sometimes, rarely, a car slipped through, the driver refusing to stop, ignoring the warnings. On that Tuesday morning, it was an orange taxi with a driver and a passenger. One of the guards notified Captain Khan. Humayun could have told his soldiers in the towers to put a few rounds through the windshield and into the engine block. He could have ordered the taxi destroyed, the driver and his passenger killed. If the vehicle was a threat, a short burst of gunfire could have easily stopped it. But what if the taxi wasn’t a threat? What if the driver was confused, didn’t understand what those foreigners were yelling, didn’t know if all the arm-waving meant stop or go or turn around? What if he was just trying to get some poor guy to work so he could earn a few bucks for his family? Humayun still could have told his soldiers to shoot him. That would have been perfectly legal. It also would have been prudent. It was hardly his fault that some Iraqi driver got confused. It had happened before, right in that very canyon of blast walls, happened a hundred times, a thousand times, all over Iraq. People die in wars. Mistakes, awful and tragic mistakes, happen. Captain Khan told everyone to stay down. He started walking towards the taxi, his arms up, a universal sign to stop. He wasn’t going to kill a man by mistake. He believed in his mission, the overarching point of which was to bring freedom and safety to people in a country where they’d had neither. He would tell Iraqis that, directly and explicitly. “We’re not here to hurt you,” he would say. “We are here to help you.” He and other officers had organised local men to patrol Baqubah, the provincial capital, paid them $5 an hour to go out with American soldiers, make them part of their own security, their own destiny. How much damage would one dead civilian cause? How much of that work would be destroyed? He took a few more steps, arms still up. I was told he took 10 steps, but I don’t know if anyone actually counted. He saw something. Maybe a look on the driver’s face, maybe the explosives packed around him. Captain Khan turned, yelled for everyone to hit the dirt. The taxi exploded. The concussion killed him instantly, almost certainly before the shrapnel even hit him. Two Iraqi civilians close to the car were killed, too, and 10 soldiers were wounded. And now my son was in a coffin, a white bandage on his forehead, peaceful, at rest. The army said he was a hero, awarded him a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Who knows how many would have died if the taxi had gotten closer to the gate? How many other fathers’ children weren’t in coffins? Dozens? Does the number matter? Is one enough? But there was also this: My son was dead because he was trying to make sure a stranger wasn’t killed by mistake. He stayed true to the shape of his heart. Humayun Saqib Muazzam Khan, a most fortunate one, destined for greatness, a king who would shine among the heavens. He was, and I believe he does. I studied his face, so young, so kind. I did not think of those things in that moment. I’m not sure what I thought of, or if I thought at all. Pride can be a balm, but it is not immediately effective, and it never, ever heals the wound. • An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice by Khizr Khan is published on 24 October (Sphere, £20).

The death toll from the bombing now stands at more than 300, making it one of the most devastating terrorist attacks anywhere in the world for many years. On Tuesday remains of victims were still being brought out of rubble spread over hundreds of square metres. Investigators believe the attack on Saturday may in part have been motivated by a desire for revenge for the botched US-led operation in August. Al-Shabaab has not claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack but a member of the cell detained by security forces has told interrogators the group was responsible, one security official told the Guardian. Following the raid, in which three children aged between six and 10 died, local tribal elders called for revenge against the Somali government and its allies. Not only was the bomber from the specific community targeted by the raid, but the investigation is also uncovering a series of other links to the town where it took place. Details of the attack are now becoming clearer. Officials say it involved two vehicles – a Toyota Noah minivan and a much larger truck carrying around 350kg of military grade and homemade explosives. The target for both vehicles was the heavily guarded airport compound in Mogadishu, where the United Nations, most embassies and the headquarters of the 22,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force, Amisom, are based, officials said. The smaller device was supposed to blast open the heavily defended Medina Gate entrance to the compound to open the way for the bigger bomb, a standard militant tactic. The minivan was stopped by at a checkpoint several hundred metres short of its target and the driver detained. This bomb later detonated, possibly set off by remote control or by security officials, without causing casualties, two officials told the Guardian. Officials also said the driver was a veteran militant who had been involved in previous attacks in Mogadishu, including one on the Jazeera hotel in 2012 in which eight people died. The bigger truck bomb was detonated at a busy crossroads at least a kilometre from the Medina Gate when it reached a checkpoint where security guards became suspicious. The explosion ignited a fuel truck nearby which caused a massive fireball. It has been impossible to identify the type of truck from the wreckage. Officials said the driver had joined the army in 2010 but defected from his military post to join al-Shabaab around five years later. The US involvement in Somalia intensified in the later years of the Obama administration but has increased significantly since Donald Trump became president, with greater latitude given to local commanders to order airstrikes or take part in raids. Critics have argued this risks greater civilian casualties, which, in the tight-knit world of Somalia’s complex clan system, can prompt feuds and revenge attacks. The raid in August targeted the small town of Bariire, 30 miles (50km) west of Mogadishu, which is a stronghold of al-Shabaab. Investigators have established that both vehicles used in Saturday’s attack appear to have set out from Bariire, and the owner of the truck used for the bigger bomb was from the town or the surrounding region, officials say. He has been detained. Investigators are probing the possibility that some individuals manning the checkpoints on the route taken by the bomb vehicles into Mogadishu from the direction of Bariire may have been complicit in the attack. All those on duty on Saturday have been removed from their posts and put under investigation, apart from those who successfully stopped the smaller vehicle. The personnel who tried to stop the truck bomb near the Kilometre Five checkpoint are all dead. Bariire is known as an al-Shabaab stronghold which has been a lanchpad for several major attacks on Mogadishu. The group has been pushed out of major cities but retains control of swaths of countryside in the south and centre of Somalia. In May a US Navy Seal was killed and two troops wounded in a raid on an al-Shabaab militant compound in Bariire, in what was the first US combat death in the African country since the 1993 “Black Hawk Down” disaster. The town was recaptured by government troops earlier this year but abandoned in a “tactical withdrawal” last week. Analysts say the retreat left Mogadishu exposed. The area has also been the site of intensive activity by US drones. Local media reported airstrikes around Bariire on Tuesday. The links between the attack and Bariire will raise questions about the tactics and strategy of the campaign against al-Shabaab. “If you go out more aggressively in this kind of environment you risk scoring some serious own goals. The extremists really cranked everything they could out of the botched raid in August. They put out images of the bodies of the kids, published the testimony of supposed witnesses,” said one western counter-terrorist expert with long experience of working with Somali authorities. A second expert, who works closely with regional security forces in Somalia, described as “very plausible” the possibility that al-Shabaab, which have always exploited clan allegiances, may have played on traditions of exacting vengeance to convince members of the clan to assist al-Shabaab in the bombings. A recent United Nations study found that in “a majority of cases, state action appears to be the primary factor finally pushing individuals into violent extremism in Africa”. Of more than 500 former members of militant organisations interviewed for the report, 71% pointed to “government action”, including “killing of a family member or friend” or “arrest of a family member or friend” as the incident that prompted them to join a group. • This article was amended on 18 October 2017 to clarify the context for the second expert’s view."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/17/courtesy-is-the-key-in-getting-people-to-talk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:21:59Z","webTitle":"Courtesy is the key in getting people to talk | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/courtesy-is-the-key-in-getting-people-to-talk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/courtesy-is-the-key-in-getting-people-to-talk","fields":{"headline":"Courtesy is the key in getting people to talk","bodyText":"The case for the effectiveness of non-coercive interrogation was made long before the examples given in Ian Leslie’s excellent essay on the subject (We have ways of making you talk, 14 October). In his late 18th-century short story The Criminal Driven by Lost Honour (Der Verbrecher aus verlorener Ehre), Friedrich Schiller tells of a petty criminal who goes on to become public enemy number one. When he is apprehended, the judge interrogating him initially opts for a decidedly aggressive and domineering tone. The criminal, when asked by the judge, “Who are you?”, replies: “A man who is determined to answer no question until it is put more courteously.” Realising that his rather brutal interrogation method is getting him nowhere, the judge eventually decides that perhaps it would be better to treat the suspect “with civility and moderation” and apologises for his harsh manner. The suspect then informs the judge that his previous behaviour would never have extracted anything from him, whereas the change of tone has given him confidence in and respect for his interrogator. He therefore reveals who he is. It looks as though a work of narrative fiction, and a great writer who had keen insight into the criminal mind, got there first. David Head Peterborough • One thing that struck me in your long read on interrogation techniques was that the interviewees are “interested to tell the ‘why’”. Understanding the motivation of terror suspects would seem to be extremely valuable, yet we don’t learn from it. Maybe their motivations should be made public, so that instead of professing bafflement at how someone could be radicalised, we can address the issues. I suspect that us invading and bombing other countries has a lot to do with it, but is this correct? Perhaps this uncomfortable aspect is why the motivations of people who commit atrocities are not being released and more widely discussed.

A look must have been exchanged because Kathrada stopped mid-flow to ask if I wouldn’t mind stepping out for a moment. As I was leaving, I heard the new arrival say: “He’s done it again.” I knew that “he” must be Nelson Mandela and I had a good idea what he must have done. That evening’s news soon confirmed it: Mandela had gone off-piste again. Never the most riveting of speakers, he would, every now and then, galvanise his country’s attention by breaking away from the monotonously good stuff his speech writers had compiled to speak from the heart. I had taken this as an endearingly maverick but spur-of-the moment act by an otherwise disciplined man who always insisted that he served the collective. But reading Dare Not Linger, which the writer Mandla Langa (who, in the interests of full disclosure, is a friend of mine) has compiled from Mandela’s handwritten notes and from interviews, I learned that Mandela did this deliberately. It was his way of breaking away from a consensus with which he disagreed: he went along with the majority decisions of his cabinet but could not resist making his real point of view public. He “did it again” in December 1997 during his farewell to the ANC conference. Then, as Langa writes, Mandela diverted from his speechwriter’s pages to caution the incoming leaders against surrounding himself with yes men and women. This he followed with a warning of the dangers when a leader hangs out with “powerful and influential individuals who have far more resources than all of us put together”. Those words have acquired ever greater resonance in the 20 years that have passed since Mandela said them. This was brought home earlier this year, at Ahmed Kathrada’s funeral, where the seemingly unthinkable happened. Kathrada had spent decades in prison with Mandela and in a country that uses funerals to venerate its freedom fighters, and in particular those Robben Island veterans, the serving president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, was conspicuous by his absence. Not that this was Zuma’s choice: he had stayed away only because the Kathrada family made it clear they did not want him there. Theirs was a protest that Kathrada himself had previously triggered. He was of Mandela’s generation, whose loyalty to the ANC (which, as Mandla Langa writes, “is an heirloom, passed down from one generation to the next”) had been absolute. But a year before his death, Kathrada broke his silence to publish an open letter to Zuma asking him to step down. This is how Kathrada ended his letter: “To paraphrase the famous MK [a shorthand for the ANC’s military wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe] slogan, there comes a time in the life of every nation when it must choose to submit or fight. Today, I appeal to our president to submit to the will of the people and resign.” Zuma survived this challenge as he has also survived an arms scandal, a rape trial, a constitutional court judgment against him and allegations that the state has been captured by the Guptas, one of South Africa’s new rich. Given that he has surrounded himself with people who owe their position to him and is the head of an organisation that, despite internal differences, traditionally speaks with one voice, this survival is not in itself surprising. But the fact that a loyalist such as Kathrada should publicly break with his president was an indication of how serious a contravention of ANC principles is this rising corruption in government. To read in Dare Not Linger of Mandela’s insistence on making his own hotel bed, or to look at the photo of him cleaning his own shoes on a plane, is to remember the man who, with his closest comrades, was responsible for the miracle of South Africa’s peaceful transition. But it is also to question what part those stalwarts, and in particular their leader, Mandela, played in laying the ground for South Africa’s current dystopia. After all, Mandela was succeeded by Thabo Mbeki, his chosen deputy, whose Aids denialism, according to a Harvard University study, led to the unnecessary deaths of 300,000 people. And then Mbeki’s attempt to cling on to the ANC presidency when his time as South Africa’s president was up led to Zuma’s ascendance. So how could it happen so fast? In its exploration of the run-up to the 1994 election, Dare Not Linger goes some way to answering this question. Hindsight tells us that apartheid’s extreme right did not have the wherewithal to prevent an election that they knew the ANC would win. But Mandela’s account of his meetings with apartheid’s heavy hitters shows how serious the threat seemed at that time. Mandela was the great conciliator, the prisoner who invited his guards to presidential tea parties, and he was clearly personally comfortable with forgiveness, but what this book highlights is the way in which the need to end rising political violence explains many of his efforts to keep the old apartheid state on board including, at one time, discussing with the far right the possibility of them having their own mini-state – their volkstaat. In the face of the far-right threat, Mandela’s call to move on from the past was understandable, while his stress on unity within his organisation was consistent with the way the ANC had functioned, particularly in its underground years. It had long been a broad front movement in which people with different political agendas, including communists, had banded together to bring about the end of apartheid (in their words, to achieve national liberation). This single-minded pursuit, together with Mandela’s generation’s early training in consensus decision-making, which is so well described in Long Walk to Freedom (the first volume of his autobiography), had kept the movement together in the most adverse of circumstances. But it could be argued that the continuation, post-apartheid, of such a disciplined unity, when combined with an emphasis on reconciliation, has had consequences that are today playing themselves out. The rise of the Rhodes Must Fall movement, which began by attacking symbols of white power and has expanded into demands for a more complete historical redress, along with the protests against the failure of the state to deliver services, are two signs of the rising discontent in the country. On top of that, there are indications that people within the ANC may be readying themselves to break with previous traditions – several prominent ANC MPs have already voted with the opposition in a recent vote of no confidence against Zuma. At the end of his preface to Dare Not Linger, Langa describes how at Mandela’s last ANC conference as leader, the singing crowd settled on a “valediction to a unique son and a sad admission that… South Africa would never be the same again. ‘Nelson Mandela,’ they sang, ‘there’s no other like him.’” Perhaps that is the problem: that he was so unique and he made it look so easy. That first peaceful democratic election was almost a miracle: tempting to assume that such effortlessness would continue. But given the constraints of the global economy, and South Africa’s terrible history, that now looks like magical thinking.

He’s now back out the other side, making his traditional “space disco”, but with some beautiful acid-flashback flourishes. Spire and Tensions evoke cocktail hour at an Ibizan villa, before But Isn’t It and Shinin nicely showcase house and Italo songcraft.

Her male professor promised Chicago he would talk about “women’s contributions” in the last class. But he lied – there were no great women thinkers in his curriculum. “It was the prevailing attitude in the 1960s that women had no history,” said Chicago, 78, over the phone from her New Mexico home. “There were no women’s studies, nothing.” It spurred the artist to not only found the feminist art program at the California State University in 1969, but to create one of the most iconic works of feminist art, The Dinner Party. The art installation is a long, triangular banquet table with plate settings for 39 figures of women’s history. From the grandmother of American modern art, Georgia O’Keeffe, to women’s rights activist Sojourner Truth, The Dinner Party has toured dozens of museums on three continents for an audience of 15 million people. This month, Chicago opens an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum called Roots of The Dinner Party: History in the Making. It’s the first ever exhibition to look into her creative process in making her most influential artwork. There will be over a hundred objects, from research documents to notebooks and drawings from 1971 to 1979, as well as the historic artwork itself. For Chicago (who hails from the Windy City – it’s her self-proclaimed artist name), it took the world long enough to tune into her forward-thinking vision. “The art world tried to pigeonhole me around The Dinner Party, but they have suddenly discovered my bigger career,” says the artist. “I’ve been making art and showing all these years, it’s just finally come more into the mainstream. It takes a long time.” This Brooklyn Museum exhibition shows how this deeply researched artwork originated and how it progressed, from its start in 1974 to its finish in 1979. “When I start, I have no idea how long it’s going to take,” she said. “I’m on a voyage of discovery.” The exhibition will also be about setting the record straight, as the artwork was made in collaboration with several other people in her Santa Monica studio in the 1970s – some say she exploited them. “There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about my collaborative process and how the studio was structured, which the show is going to help shed some light on,” said Chicago. While her assistants are often documented as volunteers, Chicago says her team of 400 participants – like embroidery artists, needleworkers, ceramicists, carpenters and office workers – didn’t work together all at once. “There was a core group of 20 or 25 people and some even got paid, so it’s not even true they were all volunteers,” said Chicago. “There were people who came in and out for short periods.” A close look at The Dinner Party reveals that each table setting for each woman has cutlery, a table runner with her embroidered name, a customised goblet and a colourful plate with (more often than not) a hand-painted, psychedelic-looking, sometimes three-dimensional vulva. The banquet is divided into three wings; from prehistory to the Roman Empire, early Christian times and the modern day. So forget everything you know about history because who knew about Hypatia of Alexandria, a Greek mathematician and philosopher? And who knew the first-ever female university student was Anna Maria van Schurman, a Dutch scholar who spoke 14 languages? And that Boston spiritualist Anne Hutchinson helped develop religious freedom in the 17th century? In the middle of the banquet, there is a Heritage Floor, which has 2,300 porcelain tiles with the names of 999 mythical and real women Chicago also wanted to honour; from Catherine of Aragon to Colette. When the artwork debuted at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, it was an immediate sensation – people lined up for hours to see it – but it wasn’t all critical acclaim. “Who knew the New York art critics were battering me and the piece with a sledgehammer?” she recalls. “In the 1960s, I was the only visible woman artist.” Male art critics like Hilton Kramer called the piece “failed art”, while female critic Maureen Mullarkey called it “preachy and untrue to the women it claims to represent”. For a female critic to bash the piece was a surprise to Chicago. “Now that was really upsetting, that was more upsetting than the men,” she said. Looking back at it now, Chicago is happy for the negative criticism and what it’s now added to the piece’s legacy. “Who knew there would come a time when The Dinner Party and the misogynist criticism that preceded it would be studied together in art history classes?” Chicago asks. It was as if the art criticism was written in stone. “The way the New York Times used to work in the time of Hilton Kramer; was that if one person in one department issued a verdict, nobody was allowed to contradict it,” said Chicago. “For 20 years, everyone referred to The Dinner Party as what Kramer said: ‘vaginas on plates’. Nobody called it the history of women in western civilization, which of course, is what it is.” Chicago starts off quiet when she speaks, but raises her voice when explaining, for the last damn time, what this legendary feminist artwork is about: “It was to make the point that there is nothing that groups these women together who are from all different epochs, eras, countries, races, ethnicities, religions, class, except they had vaginas, which meant we didn’t know who they were!” She pauses. “Duh!” It wasn’t until 2002, when the Brooklyn Museum acquired The Dinner Party, that things started to change. More than 20 years after the paper of record pooh-poohed Chicago’s art, the New York Times art critic Roberta Smith wrote that the artist’s piece was “getting better all the time” and “important”. “And just like that everybody followed suit,” said Chicago. “Talk about the power of the New York Times; the paper had approved of my piece and suddenly everyone was like [squeals] ‘OMG, The Dinner Party, it’s so great!’” “I was like, really?” she asks. “The New York Times gave me and The Dinner Party a halo in 2002, before that, I was shit.” Even 50 years after her European history class at UCLA, the same problems still exist about women’s history. “Upper-echelon universities in America still don’t teach the history of feminist art in their art history classes,” she said. “It reinforces one of the things I wanted to overcome, which was the erasure of women’s achievements – as one great woman thinker said: ‘Women grew up not knowing what women before them thought, taught, wrote or created, and as a result, they are constantly reinventing the wheel.’” Roots of The Dinner Party: History in the Making will show at the Brooklyn Museum until 4 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/17/letters-rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T15:16:53Z","webTitle":"Letters: Rodney Bickerstaffe obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/17/letters-rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/17/letters-rodney-bickerstaffe-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Rodney Bickerstaffe obituary","bodyText":"Janet Whitaker and Kate Green write: Mark Seddon noted that Rodney Bickerstaffe championed the cause of Travellers.

At home, I guess I do much the same with the things I live with.” She shares her three-bedroom Victorian house in Tunbridge Wells with her husband Paul and, though there has undoubtedly been more room since her two children left home some 10 years ago, Anne says she’s always been good at avoiding clutter. “If I don’t want to look at it or use it, I’m not keeping it,” she says, firmly. This philosophy has served her well in the kitchen, where open shelves hold just the right amount of brightly coloured plates, mugs and bowls from sources as varied as Marks &amp; Spencer, Orla Kiely and Arabia. There are purely decorative pieces, too – pottery birds, tiles and Royal Copenhagen dishes – all united by strong colour, shapes and graphics, and with a nod to midcentury design. Anne has long been drawn to this era, partly for sentimental reasons – the Scandi furniture of the period loomed large in her life when she was growing up in Canada – and partly for practical ones. “Midcentury furniture looks contemporary in any setting and the proportions work well in a house like this, where the ceilings are high even if the rooms are quite narrow.” While Paul’s family has donated pieces such as the buffet in the kitchen, Anne has supplemented the collection with a coffee table, a day-bed from Etsy and kitchen chairs from a local charity shop, which she customised with paint. Bang up to date, though, is a treasured modern piece: the magnificent heavy-gauge steel bookcase in the day room that came from a friend in Brighton. “It was lost in her enormous home, but it’s a perfect fit in mine,” says Anne. It’s not just the furnishings that keep this house looking fresh: a simple colour scheme that doesn’t compete with pictures or possessions helps, too. “We often use the house as an open studio and I certainly wouldn’t want my wall colour to dictate what sort of things I hang on them. When we moved in 20-odd years ago, we painted everything white and have built up slowly from there. One of the great things about buying a house when you’re short of cash is that you’re forced to take things slowly, to make the best of what you’ve got and to find affordable solutions – that’s certainly been the case here. We’ve got some beautiful Neisha Crosland wallpaper in the lounge and our bedroom – but just on feature walls, and bought at an end-of-line sale, so at a really affordable price.” Unsurprisingly, beautiful and often intricate textiles are to be found in every room, from Anne’s own framed works, often inspired by nature, to the Margo Selby cushions in the day room overlooking the garden – a bargain buy at Homesense. “The Josef Frank for Svenskt Tenn fabric on the kitchen cushions was more of a splurge,” she confesses, “but you don’t need much of it to make an impact and the colour and design are just lovely.” These days, when Anne isn’t sewing in her studio just beyond the kitchen, she’s writing (Textile Nature: Embroidery Techniques Inspired by the Natural World was published last year, with another book due in the next couple of years), exhibiting or teaching in the UK and abroad – this year has seen trips to India, Australia and Sweden. “Both Paul and I travel a lot so it’s great that this is a house that’s easy to lock up and leave. It’s large enough for socialising, but small enough to be manageable. And, after all these years, it’s still somewhere we’re always happy to come home to.” annekellytextiles.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/17/trevor-fawcett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T15:08:47Z","webTitle":"Trevor Fawcett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/17/trevor-fawcett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/17/trevor-fawcett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Fawcett obituary","bodyText":"My husband, Trevor Fawcett, who has died aged 83 in Bath, accumulated an encyclopedic knowledge of the city’s 18th-century heyday through intensive research, particularly through newspapers, directories, diaries and public records of the period. He lived in Bath for 33 years, moving there after taking early retirement from his post as a librarian at the University of East Anglia. He quickly recognised that research into Bath’s past was largely undertaken by non-professionals, and believed they would benefit from mutual support and collaboration. From this was born the History of Bath Research Group. Trevor was intrigued by all aspects of the city’s cultural life: entertainment, education, medicine, shopping, town planning and administration, printing, the place of horses and the diversity of the population. His monographs included Bath Entertain’d (1998), Bath Administer’d (2001), Bath Commercialis’d (2002), Voices of 18th Century Bath (1995), and Georgian Imprints (2008, about the history of printing and publishing in Bath). Many of his articles were published in journals and magazines. He was born in Leeds, the only son of Joseph, a wholesale florist in Leeds Market, and his wife, Irene (nee Beck). Trevor went to Leeds grammar school and subsequently studied geography, French and Portuguese at Leeds University. He spent national service learning Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists, based in Cornwall, London and Fife. Trevor developed an appetite for European travel, in particular leading groups on walking and cultural holidays for the Ramblers’ Association. It was on one of these holidays, in Positano, Italy, that he and I met in the unlikely habitat (for us) of the beach. We married in 1962. After a postgraduate course in librarianship at University College London, Trevor joined Leicester College of Art and Technology (now De Montfort University), then Southampton University. In 1965, he was appointed chief cataloguer with responsibility for art and music at the new University of East Anglia. It was in Norwich that Trevor began seriously to mine the local 18th-century newspapers, writing up his research into articles and a book, Music in 18th-century Norwich and Norfolk (1979). He became acutely aware of the difficulty of faithfully reproducing art works in print, and his stimulating writing on this topic led to him being invited to contribute to Grove’s Dictionary of Art (1996). Throughout his life, Trevor was alert to the natural world and environmental concerns. In his later years he focused on butterflies, observing and recording them for Bristol Regional Environmental Records. He edited and wrote reports for the Bath Natural History Society’s annual magazine. He tried to keep his environmental footprint as small as possible, never owning a car, and avoiding flying. Using public transport, we travelled widely in Europe and latterly in the UK (especially seeking out interesting churches). Trevor regarded his family to be his greatest achievement. He is survived by me, and by our sons, Adrian and Jon, and three grandchildren, Elsa, Oscar and Stella."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/oct/24/good-to-meet-you-chris-lane","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T12:43:31Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

It was a mixture of disbelief and deep regret. There were 71 minutes on the clock and, suddenly, Tottenham Hotspur’s main man was in. The pass from Fernando Llorente was made to measure and, when Kane shot, all eyes followed the ball to the bottom corner of the Real Madrid net. It squirmed agonisingly wide, Keylor Navas having got his fingertips to it and everyone seemed to take a moment to let it all sink in. Kane, who had been the pre-match story because of his explosive form and Real’s interest in him, might have made quite the statement. As it was, Tottenham still made one. Mauricio Pochettino knew this match would be a gauge of the club’s progress. “When you come here, you feel the reality about football,” he said on Monday. The reality was pretty sweet. Real showed their quality and there were periods when Tottenham had to dig in. Pochettino’s 3-5-2 formation was more like 5-3-2 and Real were fluent. They hogged 61% of the possession. Tottenham were grateful that Karim Benzema had an evening when his dead-eyed instincts deserted him while Hugo Lloris bailed them out on a couple of occasions. His second-half saves to keep out Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo were the latest illustration of his world-class ability. He was the Tottenham hero. Yet it said plenty about the maturity of the visitors’ performance that they closed out the draw with a measure of comfort and, when it was all over, the 4,000 travelling fans celebrated wildly. They sang their songs at full volume and the result from Nicosia, where Borussia Dortmund had managed only to draw with Apoel, furthered the feel-good factor. Tottenham played with savvy and personality while they also carved Real open on a number of occasions. It would now be a tremendous disappointment if they failed to qualify and nobody could have predicted that with any certainty when the draw was made. Above all, as Pochettino said afterwards, Tottenham showed they belonged at this level. Apart from his one-on-one miss Kane was good and he helped to provide Tottenham with their pinch-me moment. Gloriously from their point of view, they had grown into the tie and the breakthrough goal came at the end of a patch of deep purple. Raphael Varane will carry the can and it was the most unfortunate of deflections that sent Serge Aurier’s low cross looping past Navas but Kane had forced the error. The excellent Harry Winks released Aurier and, after Kane had tried and failed to execute a flick, Varane blundered. The goal had been advertised. Kane worked Navas with a powerful downward header in the 19th minute from a Christian Eriksen corner and then there was the penalty controversy. Kane turned away from two white shirts and switched on the power before crossing low for Llorente, whose surprise selection paid off handsomely. Navas got down but Llorente got a second bite and that was when Casemiro chased in and took away his standing leg. Even Spanish radio said that it was a penalty. The referee, Szymon Marciniak, was unmoved. He would point to the spot just before half-time – at the other end – and it was one of those decisions that Aurier allowed the referee to make by going to ground inside the area. The contact with Toni Kroos was a long way from being excessive but it was enough for the Real midfielder to feel it and go down. Ronaldo sent Lloris the wrong way with his kick. Aurier argued that Kroos had fouled him in the build-up. Real had started brightly. Ronaldo hit the post with a header and Benzema fluffed the rebound, with the far corner gaping, while Ronaldo fizzed inches wide of the far post. Isco would also test Lloris. At the other end Tottenham could point to a low blast from Aurier that extended Navas. Real turned the screw at the start of the second half and only Benzema knows how he did not convert Casemiro’s cross from point-blank range. All alone, he planted his header down but Lloris, who was going the other way, stuck out a leg to save. It was a marvellous piece of improvisation but it also went down as a gilt-edged miss. Ronaldo shimmered with menace and Lloris had to react brilliantly to tip over his snapshot. He had gone close moments earlier while, on 65 minutes, he outstripped three Tottenham players before working Lloris. The goalkeeper also scampered across his line to deny Isco. Back came Tottenham and, after Kane’s miss, Llorente ushered in Eriksen only for Navas to save again. Pochettino and his team were left to wonder what might have been but this was a night when the glass was half-full."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/17/alligators-sharks-florida-us-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T21:20:19Z","webTitle":"Snack attack: alligators like to eat sharks, study reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/17/alligators-sharks-florida-us-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/17/alligators-sharks-florida-us-study","fields":{"headline":"Snack attack: alligators like to eat sharks, study reveals","bodyText":"American alligators are frequently seen ambling around golf courses in Florida as players warily compete their rounds. But new research suggests the reptiles partake in a far more outlandish habit when away from the greens – eating sharks. US researchers have documented instances of alligators preying upon small sharks along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. A study, published in the journal Southeastern Naturalist, claims to be the first scientific study of the largely unseen struggle between the two feared predators. “The frequency of one predator eating the other is really about size dynamic,” said James Nifong, a researcher at Kansas State University. “If a small shark swims by an alligator and the alligator feels like it can take the shark down, it will, but we also reviewed some old stories about larger sharks eating smaller alligators.” Nifong and his colleagues spent nearly 10 years studying alligators along the Florida and Georgia coasts, typically using lamps at night to view their nocturnal hunting activities. More than 500 alligators were caught and had their stomachs pumped to see what they had consumed. Alligators typically eat fish, crustaceans and snails, but Nifong’s research found evidence that they had consumed three species of shark and a type of stingray. The sharks measured 3-4ft. By looking at the historical record, Nifong saw there was evidence of alligators tangling with sharks as far back as the 1870s, but the observations were limited to an island off the Georgia coast, including one episode in which sharks attacked a group of alligators that were feeding on fish. The new research found that shark-eating alligators are in fact found along the Atlantic coast of Georgia and Florida, around to Florida’s Gulf coast. Although sharks prefer salt water and alligators are fresh-water-dwelling, Nifong said that sharks and rays could swim into freshwater and GPS tracking of alligators demonstrated that the animals were opportunistic enough to take advantage. “Alligators seek out fresh water in high-salinity environments,” Nifong said. “When it rains really hard, they can actually sip fresh water off the surface of the salt water. That can prolong the time they can stay in a saltwater environment.” More research is required to discover if alligator attacks on sharks are increasing, but interactions may be influenced by coastal development that has pushed alligators out of their estuarine habitats. This has put pressure on alligator populations. “The findings bring into question how important sharks and rays are to the alligator diet as well as the fatality of some the juvenile sharks when we think about population management of endangered species,” Nifong said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/18/richard-spencer-university-of-florida-event-free-speech-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"After Charlottesville, white nationalist's campus event fuels free speech debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/richard-spencer-university-of-florida-event-free-speech-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/richard-spencer-university-of-florida-event-free-speech-debate","fields":{"headline":"After Charlottesville, white nationalist's campus event fuels free speech debate","bodyText":"Students at the University of Florida, where a white nationalist leader will speak on Thursday, are facing a difficult choice. They could listen to Richard Spencer, who wants to form a “white ethno-state” in North America, address the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left dozens of counter-protesters seriously injured and one young woman dead. They could protest as part of the “No Nazis at University of Florida” rally, which more than 2,000 people on Facebook say they plan to attend. Or they could go to Disney World. Valery Raymond, 22, said he believed going to Disney World with his college friends would be the best choice. “Protesting in this situation wouldn’t elicit anything positive,” said Raymond, who is black. “I just feel the best thing to do was just to get away, get far enough where I wouldn’t even think about it.” Spencer, he said, is “basically like a class clown, and they just want attention. If you don’t give them attention, then they lose power.” Thursday’s afternoon speech in Gainesville, Florida, will be Spencer’s first major public event since a joint rally of far-right groups Charlottesville sparked open fighting in the streets and a fatal attack on a crowd of counter-protesters. Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, has already declared a state of emergency in the county where the school is located, giving local law enforcement more resources and latitude to respond to unfolding events. On Twitter, Spencer has shared multiple posts comparing himself to a hurricane about to hit Florida. Since Charlottesville, American public universities have split over whether to allow him to speak or deny him a platform and face a lawsuit over free speech rights. In April, Auburn University in Alabama attempted to shut down Spencer’s visit to its campus over concerns that it would endanger public safety. But a federal judge handed him a victory, ordering Auburn to let Spencer speak, citing first amendment protections. “While Mr Spencer’s beliefs and message are controversial, Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence,” US district judge Keith Watkins ruled. He also wrote that to cancel Spencer’s speech “based on its belief that listeners and protest groups opposed to Mr Spencer’s ideology would react to the content of his speech by engaging in protests that could cause violence or property damage” was not a legal justification. For Spencer, the University of Florida speech may be a chance to try to reset the conversation from the intense public condemnation that followed Charlottesville. A speech at Texas A&amp;M University last year offered him the opportunity to garner new media attention after the outrage over Spencer’s choice to shout “Hail Trump! Hail Victory!” at a conference last November, which was met with Nazi salutes. But his visit is also part of an ongoing white nationalist strategy to force public universities to serve as platforms for extreme racist ideas under the banner of freedom of speech. Some first amendment experts say public universities are in a bind. Floyd Abrams, a prominent attorney and advocate who specializes in free speech, wrote in an email: “If non-students are permitted to rent space … the university generally may not make distinctions about to whom they rent it based on the content of what they will say.” But, he noted, if Spencer had incited violence in the past, that could be used to deny him access to public university spaces. Plus, advocates of free speech on campus have a powerful supporter in Donald Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who held a press conference in September promising that the justice department would pursue legal action against universities who infringed on speech freedoms. “Freedom of thought and speech on the American campus are under attack,” he said. “A mature society can tell the difference between violence and unpopular speech.” The University of Cincinnati, a public university, said this month that it would allow Spencer to speak on campus. But both Michigan State University – which was sued by one of Spencer’s supporters – and Ohio State University said they would not host him, citing safety concerns. Ohio State said, though, that it was “currently considering other alternatives”. Other universities, including Penn State, Louisiana State University, Texas A&amp;M and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, issued statements in August saying that Spencer was not welcome. While the University of Florida initially blocked Spencer from speaking in September, it later reversed course, giving him a new date to speak in October. W Kent Fuchs, the University of Florida’s president, has said the school is obligated by law both to allow Spencer to speak, as well as to shoulder the more than $500,000 it will cost to provide security while Spencer exercises his freedom of speech. “If you are like me, I expect you are surprised and even shocked to learn that UF is required by law to allow Mr Spencer to speak his racist views on our campus,” Fuchs said in a statement in early October, urging students to avoid Spencer’s speech but “speak up for your values”. Some faculty critics accused the university president of enabling Spencer’s activism. “The president has already announced, in effect, ‘Nazi of the Year’ day, where we can spend half a million dollars every year so we can hear a Nazi,” Thomas Auxter, a university philosophy professor, said at a campus teach-in on Tuesday night that attracted more than 100 people. Dwayne Fletcher, the president of the university’s black student union, said that reaction to Spencer’s visit among students of color was divided. “The majority of students, who don’t want anything to do with this event, they just want to be as far away as possible,” he said. A smaller number were determined to protest. To keep students safe, student groups were organizing a virtual counter-protest to Spencer’s speech, rather than an in-person event that might be targeted by his white nationalist supporters. In hopes of seeing Spencer lecture to an almost-empty hall, a local brewery in downtown Gainesville announced it would give patrons a free beer in exchange for each unused pair of tickets to the white nationalist’s speech. “We unfortunately can’t stop him from bringing his hate to Gainesville, but we can empty the room so his disgusting message goes unheard,” Alligator Brewing wrote in an Instagram post last week. In response, Padgett, Spencer’s college tour organizer, announced in a Twitter video on Monday that the university’s Phillips Center would no longer be distributing tickets to the event. Instead, Spencer’s supporters themselves will be distributing the tickets outside the Phillips Center about an hour before the speech. Organizers of the protest against the white nationalists have questioned why the university is allowing Spencer to control ticketing for his event, which will create a “volatile situation” outside the event space and is a “huge danger”, student organizer Chad Chavira said. While the University of Florida is not canceling all classes on Thursday, instructors are dealing with classes and student concerns on an individual basis, the university has said in statements. Raymond, whose one class on Thursday has been cancelled, later decided it did not make sense for him to spend the money to go to Disney World, so he plans instead to “relax by the pool, do some schoolwork”, far away from campus. Some friends may “make it a beach day, something like that – start off the weekend very early”, said Brendon Jonassaint, a first-year graduate student. Chavira, a junior who is one of the organizers of the “No Nazis at University of Florida” rally, said he understood if marginalized students made the choice to keep themselves safe and far away from the white supremacists. But white students, he said, had a responsibility to speak out against white nationalists on campus. “For those people who think ignoring fascism is a good idea, I would say it’s not,” he said. “If you look at the history of fascism in the 20s and 30s in Italy and Germany, it was those good, nice people who thought they didn’t have to do anything, that Hitler was stupid, and that people would see how stupid he was.” “We are committed to nonviolence,” Chavira added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/20/new-york-yellow-cab-taxi-medallion-value-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"'There's no future for taxis': New York yellow cab drivers drowning in debt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/new-york-yellow-cab-taxi-medallion-value-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/20/new-york-yellow-cab-taxi-medallion-value-cost","fields":{"headline":"'There's no future for taxis': New York yellow cab drivers drowning in debt","bodyText":"The premise is familiar: MD Islam left Bangladesh and came to the United States in search of a better life. He arrived in New York, became a taxi driver, and set about following the well-trodden path of the industrious American immigrant. Then he began to work towards buying his own taxi medallion. The medallion system regulates the yellow taxis serving New York City: since 1937, each vehicle has needed a medallion in order to legally operate. Few taxi drivers own theirs; most lease them, paying around $100 for one 12-hour shift. The limited number of medallions issued by the city made each one highly valuable; individual medallion sale prices went from $50,000 in the late 1970s to over $1m by 2014. For many taxi drivers, owning a medallion meant success. Homes would be purchased. Children would be sent to universities. Islam managed to put a down payment on his medallion in 2010, and for a few years, it seemed like a good investment. Then, in 2015, with the widespread popularity of Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing apps, his fortunes changed. Yellow Cab driver MD Islam, 40, from Bangladesh, owes $830,000 on a mortgage for his medallion which is now worth much less. Ride-hail cars saturated the market, and an exodus of drivers from yellow taxis made medallion values drop precipitously. “I’ll have to spend my whole life paying this loan,” said Islam, now 40 and in debt to the tune of $830,000. “And after that, I won’t get anything. The medallion has no value. No one wants to buy it now.” In the New York City of the public imagination, taxicabs dot the urban landscape. Taxi driving is an old, almost mythic profession in this city; the first yellow cabs appeared in the 1920s. Today, there are more than 13,000 yellow medallion taxis in New York, split among about 40,000 drivers – some own their own medallions and cars, but most do not; many drivers work for a fleet, like the characters from Taxi, and pay to rent each car on a daily or weekly basis. Dragan Lekic, 56, from former Yugoslavia, is calm and philosophical about the changes to the business that have come from Uber. “I always liked driving cars,” said Dragan Lekic, 56. He emigrated to New York from what was then Yugoslavia, shortly before the beginning of the Yugoslav wars. “You start something, and then you get caught into it. But as you well know, America has been a dream for everybody. So I’m here.” The job is not easy: the standard shift is 12 hours, and with the cost of leasing a car and filling the gas tank, a bad day means taking a loss. For every moment spent without a paying passenger, the driver loses money. Occasionally, passengers are abusive or violent; nationwide, taxi drivers are over 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than anyone else. But taxi driving provides the chance to make a living, however difficult or dangerous or meager – especially for working-class immigrants, who often have limited employment opportunities. “I have problems with my English,” said Jinder Singh, 55. “I can only drive.” Twenty years ago, Singh left the Punjab in northern India, where he had worked on a farm, and moved to New York. He followed his brother-in-law into the taxi business, and has been driving ever since. Jinder Singh, 55, formerly a farmer from Punjab, followed his brother-in-law into the taxi business. He has driven a taxi for about 15 years. “It’s stressful, very stressful, but you feel like a free man,” said Ignimora Atarouanourou, who also found his way to taxis through a family connection: his father, who has now been driving for almost 30 years. Originally from Togo, 39-year-old Atarouanourou has driven a taxi for the last six years. He leases a car from a Long Island City garage that allows him to set his own schedule, and provides him with free car repairs – as well as a massage chair to sit in while he waits. In the next room, drivers have access to a coffee machine and a small prayer area, lined with rugs. “For myself, personally, I’m satisfied with what I have,” said Atarouanourou. “But a lot of my friends, they’ve switched to Uber.” Ignimora Atarouanourou, 39, from Togo, followed his father into the taxi business. He sits in a massage chair in the taxi garage during a break Uber officially arrived in New York in 2011; by 2015, Uber cars outnumbered taxis – and took away millions of rides. Taxi drivers, noticing the drop in passengers, began to leave the business behind: many transitioned towards driving for Uber, for other ride-hailing services like Lyft, Juno or Via – or for all of them at once. Now, fleets struggle to find enough drivers, and empty yellow taxis sit dormant in garages throughout the city. “Somebody told me Uber was paying good, so I did it,” said Shahnoor Qurashi, 54, who had been driving taxis since the early 90s. Four years ago, he decided to try driving an Uber car. “At that time, four years ago, they were paying good. But not any more,” said Qurashi, who cited Uber’s various price cuts, and the sizeable commission the company takes from each fare. “They are exploiting the drivers,” he said. When a passenger lodged a complaint against him, Uber suspended his account – and Qurashi was unable to defend himself against the passenger’s claims. “I didn’t have power or anything. It was customers’ rights, not workers’ rights.” Now, Qurashi has returned to the yellow cab business, but ridership is down. Edwin Montenegro, 46, was born and raised in the East Village of New York and is a Gulf Wwar veteran. He has driven a taxi for 22 years. “It used to be pretty lucrative, for a long time,” said Edwin Montenegro, 46. He is a rarity among taxi drivers: a native New Yorker, he was born and raised in the East Village. After returning from the Gulf war, Montenegro began driving a taxi in 1996. Eight years later, he took out a loan and bought a medallion. “I was making excellent money. I was planning for the medallion to go to $2m, and then sell it, and then probably open up a bar.” He laughed. “That’s what I’d wanted to do.” But then, the rise of ride-hailing apps thwarted his plans. He went back to school to study massage therapy, and is considering leaving the taxi business entirely. “I wish we were more united, and able to fight. There’s no union for us,” he said. Taxi drivers who want to organize can join the New York Taxi Workers’ Alliance (NYTWA), an organization that claims 18,000 members and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. But taxi drivers are independent contractors, and are not protected under the National Labor Relations Act. The NYTWA can coordinate protests and strikes, but has no collective bargaining rights. One driver, who currently works for a fleet, spoke anonymously: “I’m not mad that Uber changed my business,” he said. “I am very happy that the garage owners are losing business. I saw one owner driving a Ferrari. Where does he make the money? From us, the drivers. So bring Uber, I love Uber.” He recalled abusive employers screaming at him, and corrupt dispatchers – some, he claimed, demanded tips from all drivers, lest they be assigned defective cars or fewer shifts. “Do you know who let Uber succeed? Garage owners, because they aggravated the drivers. That’s why all the drivers ran, to work for these apps.” A burned-out taxi in a garage in Long Island City, Queens. Still, some drivers stay with their taxis – like Abdelhalim Elgndy, 62, who has been driving a taxi since 1992. He intends to retire only when his two children have graduated and started their careers: both his daughter and son are currently studying medicine. “I like the system as a cab driver,” he said. “I’m used to it. I like to just pick up a person. Tell me where you’re going, I’ll know where I’m going. It’s easier for me.” But many taxi drivers are not optimistic about their industry. “There is no future for taxis,” said 48-year-old Sayed Moustafa, who has been driving a taxi for over a decade. “My son is 17, and he uses Uber,” Moustafa explained. “My daughter is 15, and soon, she’s going to use Uber, like him. All these young people, when they grow older, they’re still going to use technology. They’ll be used to it. They won’t take taxis.” Abdelhalim Elgndy, 62, originally from Egypt, was formerly a sous chef in a French restaurant and supports two children by driving a cab. He has driven a taxi for 25 years. For now, Moustafa continues to drive: nine hours a day, six days a week. In the passenger seat, he keeps one shift’s worth of water and snacks. He does not take breaks. As for MD Islam, he has a grim view of his own future – that of his two children, aged six and nine. “When I came here, I had big hopes,” he said. “But now, I think, it was the wrong decision. Now we are planning to move back to Bangladesh. This is not a good life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/17/bob-weinstein-sexual-harassment-claim-producer-amanda-segel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T21:20:12Z","webTitle":"Bob Weinstein accused of inappropriate behavior by female TV producer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/17/bob-weinstein-sexual-harassment-claim-producer-amanda-segel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/17/bob-weinstein-sexual-harassment-claim-producer-amanda-segel","fields":{"headline":"Bob Weinstein accused of inappropriate behavior by female TV producer","bodyText":"Bob Weinstein on Tuesday denied an accusation that he made unwanted advances toward a female showrunner working for the Weinstein Company last year. The showrunner, Amanda Segel, is an executive producer on Spike TV’s The Mist. Segel claims that beginning last summer, Weinstein repeatedly asked her to dine alone with him and made romantic overtures despite her multiple refusals, according to Variety. The accusation raises fresh questions about what Weinstein Company executives knew and were willing to tolerate when it came to accusations of sexual misconduct against the company’s founders. The board fired Harvey Weinstein, Bob’s brother, just days after several women accused him of sexual harassment in a New York Times story. But Segel claims the harassment by Bob Weinstein didn’t stop until her attorney warned Weinstein Company executives, including its chief financial officer, that she was prepared to quit the show. Bob Weinstein became head of the Weinstein Company after his brother’s deposal. Segel claims the harassment began after she and Bob Weinstein met for dinner in June 2016 in what she says she considered a professional context. During the meal, she claims, Weinstein asked her age, indicating he didn’t want to be romantically involved with someone younger than his daughter, and asked her what Variety calls “highly intimate questions”. After dinner, according to Segel, he invited her up to his hotel room, and Segel declined. After the dinner, Segel claims, Weinstein attempted several times to see her again, according to Variety, “joking at times that he was her boss and could fire her if she didn’t agree”. He invited her to a party at a rented home in Malibu, but gave her the impression that the evening would involve just the two of them, Segel claimed. “‘No’ should be enough,” Segel said, according to Variety. “After ‘no’, anybody who has asked you out should just move on. Bob kept referring to me that he wanted to have a friendship. He didn’t want a friendship. He wanted more than that. My hope is that ‘no’ is enough from now on.” The Weinstein Company denied to Variety that an attorney for Segel had contacted the chief operating officer. A representative for Bob Weinstein denied to the magazine that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior, and said: “Bob Weinstein had dinner with Ms Segel in LA in June 2016. He denies any claims that he behaved inappropriately at or after the dinner. It is most unfortunate that any such claim has been made.” Bob Fields, a lawyer for Weinstein, said: “Variety’s story about Bob Weinstein is riddled with false and misleading assertions by Ms Segel and we have the emails to prove it, but even if you believe what she says it contains not a hint of any inappropriate touching or even any request for such touching. “There is no way in the world that Bob Weinstein is guilty of sexual harassment, and even if you believed what this person asserts there is no way it would amount to that.” Bob Weinstein has forcefully denounced his brother over accusations that Harvey Weinstein harassed or sexually assaulted dozens of women during his long career in Hollywood. Despite reports to the contrary, the Weinstein Company claims that accusations of rape and sexual assault “come as an utter surprise” to Bob Weinstein and its other board members. Representatives for Bob Weinstein and Amanda Segel did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/19/1922-review-netflix-stephen-king-thomas-jane","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"1922 review – bleak, slow-burn Stephen King adaptation burrows under the skin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/1922-review-netflix-stephen-king-thomas-jane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/19/1922-review-netflix-stephen-king-thomas-jane","fields":{"headline":"1922 review – bleak, slow-burn Stephen King adaptation burrows under the skin","bodyText":"Another week, another Stephen King adaptation. Following on from The Dark Tower, It and the effectively nasty sex-game-gone-wrong thriller Gerald’s Game, Netflix is quietly launching a brooding take on one of his lesser-known works. The collection Full Dark, No Stars has already spawned two middling movies – Big Driver with Maria Bello and A Good Marriage with Joan Allen – and now, a third novella is hitting the screen with far more distinction. Anyone looking for more of It’s annoyingly relentless jump scares will find 1922 a stark disappointment, a slow-burn narrative opting to unsettle rather than thrill. But there’s an unshakable menace that lingers, a tale of guilt and regret that burrows its way under the skin. Wilfred (Thomas Jane) enjoys a simple life with his family on the farm that his wife, Arlette (Molly Parker), inherited. But such a parochial lifestyle isn’t what she had in mind and a plan is concocted to sell the farm and move to the city. Wilfred is firmly opposed and when Arlette announces that she will go anyway, taking their son, Henry (Dylan Schmid), he comes up with a plan of his own: to kill her. There’s a terrifying mundanity to Wilfred’s thinking, his decision to prioritize selfish desires and financial gain over his wife giving the film an instant chill and providing us with an unusual antihero. It’s a challenge for a screenwriter to build a film around a man willing to murder his wife as she sleeps, but the writer-director Zak Hilditch manages to keep us grimly onboard throughout, accompanying Wilfred on his disturbing journey. One of the reasons we’re so compelled to stick with him is a transformative, deeply committed performance from an almost unrecognizable Thomas Jane. He’s astonishingly good here, with depths he’s previously kept hidden (or been denied the chance to showcase), and the film makes for a comfortable bedfellow with the equally bleak chiller The Mist, also starring Jane. It’s all too easy to portray a character like Wilfred as a simplistic hick but Jane offers a careful, studied, serious-minded turn as a man falling over the brink and descending into madness. The horrifyingly staged murder of his wife is just the beginning, the inciting incident of the first act, and the rest of the film hinges on the devastating fallout. What’s interesting about 1922 is that the narrative isn’t dependent on an external threat to Wilfred’s freedom (there’s little to no police involvement) but rather an internal threat to his sanity. His guilt becomes manifest in the form of a pack of squirming, bloodthirsty rats and their scratching is one of the many tools that Hilditch uses to sustain a clammy, uneasy atmosphere as Wilfred’s grasp on reality gradually falls away. The sound design in general is ferociously effective, as brutal as the so-called “conniving man” that lives inside of Wilfred. There are themes that King has explored before, like marital disharmony, mounting madness and toxic masculinity, but the film boasts a cruel strength of its own. It’s remarkably unsentimental for the most part, which makes some final attempts to wring emotion a tad frustrating and entirely unsuccessful. King’s stories often falter near the end and this is no exception. The finale isn’t quite as convoluted and clunky as it was in Netflix’s other recent adaptation, Gerald’s Game, but it’s not nearly as haunting as it could be, Hilditch choosing a more visceral representation over something that would have fallen in line with the subtlety displayed elsewhere. It’s a tonally shifting piece of work that could almost be classified as a drama, if not for some skin-crawling imagery and while, for the most part, this balance is handled with skill, it doesn’t pay off in the final act. 1922 remains effective thanks to Jane’s revelatory work and a bristling sense of dread, proving that the slow, rotting disintegration of one’s psyche is far scarier than any evil clown. 1922 will be released on Netflix on 20 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/17/mark-mccall-test-saracens-2021-lions-toulon","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T21:00:35Z","webTitle":"Mark McCall rules out a Test job and is keen to extend stay with Saracens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/17/mark-mccall-test-saracens-2021-lions-toulon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/17/mark-mccall-test-saracens-2021-lions-toulon","fields":{"headline":"Mark McCall rules out a Test job and is keen to extend stay with Saracens","bodyText":"Mark McCall has in effect ruled himself out of contention to take over as England or Ireland head coach in 2019 and dismissed suggestions he is in the frame to lead the British &amp; Irish Lions on their next tour. McCall’s contract with Saracens runs out in 2019 and he has been linked with replacing Joe Schmidt, who is due to leave his role with Ireland after the World Cup. Having guided Saracens to back-to-back Champions Cups and three Premiership crowns, the Northern Irishman is also sure to be on the Rugby Football Union’s radar with Eddie Jones also set to depart in 2019. Either job would put McCall among the main candidates to lead the Lions to South Africa in 2021 after Warren Gatland said on Monday that this year’s tour of New Zealand was his last. McCall, however, has revealed he wants to extend his stay at Saracens. “My contract runs out in 2019 and I would like to be here for longer than that,” said McCall, who took over as director of rugby during the 2010-11 season. “We have a good thing going on here and sometimes you have to realise when you have a good thing going. Genuinely, and some people don’t believe me, but having done this for a while and being lucky enough to have been at this club at the right time with the squad that we have and the age profile we have got – I want to stay here. Asked about the Lions job, he added: “I’ve never thought about it. I think they’ve always gone for international coaches and I’m not an international coach. I think there are better people qualified than me to do that job.” The Toulon owner, Mourad Boudjellal, meanwhile, has said the Wales scrum-half, Rhys Webb, has signed a contract to join them next season after Gatland had suggested it was only a “pre-agreement”. If Webb does join, he will be unavailable for Wales after the union changed its selection policy on Monday. “I have a contract with Webb,” Boudjellal told L’Équipe. “If Warren Gatland wants to pay the clause to release him, no worry. But if Gatland pays, it will require a certified cheque.” The Bath and South Africa lock Francois Louw has been cited for making contact with the eye area of Treviso’s Marco Fuser.

Boeing attempted to kill Bombardier’s C-Series plane in its infancy by getting US trade authorities to impose stiff import tariffs. Now those heavy-handed legal tactics have produced an outcome that could be damaging in the long-term for Boeing. Arch-rival Airbus has swooped from the wings to grab majority control of the C-Series and proclaim that the 300% tariffs can be side-stepped via the simple remedy of conducting the final assembly of planes destined for US customers in Alabama. If Airbus’s plan works, it’s ingenious. It will get a 50.1% stake in the C-Series without paying a penny and will collect some cheap warrants on Bombardier’s shares. Bombardier wins in the sense that it now has a partner with the financial muscle and supply chains to make a success of the C-Series. True, the Canadian firm has to accept that its stake in the C-Series will be diluted from 62% to 31%, but it can console itself that something is better than nothing, which was the likely alternative. Finally, production jobs on the C-Series programme – including 1,000 at the Bombardier factory in Belfast – should be better protected. Is Airbus’s manoeuvre too clever by half? That was gist of Boeing’s predictable grumble. “This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government,” it said. We’ll ignore the absurdity of Boeing complaining about subsidies and wait to see how its complaint plays out. Until clarity arrives, the GMB union representing workers in Belfast is right to caution that it hopes Airbus’s legal advice is solid. But, on the face of it, it’s hard to see why US trade rules would stop a plane being assembled in the US for the use of US airlines. If, as Airbus and Bombardier hope, the C-Series and some politically-sensitive jobs have been saved, Theresa May may wish to reflect on one moral of the tale. Her personal appeals to a protectionist US president got nowhere. It was Airbus, supposedly a lumbering exercise in pan-European co-operation, that knew how to play the game. Carney seems settled on rate rise It is now odds-on that interest rates will rise on 2 November for the first time since 2007. Inflation, on the CPI measure, stood at 3% in September and Bank of England governor Mark Carney expects it to go higher. Indeed, when giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, Carney sounded like a man whose mind is settled. The inflationary effects of last year’s post-referendum fall in sterling will take three years to work their way through the economy, he argued. That is starting to sound like the majority view. Economists at Barclays reckon there is just one dove left on the nine-strong rate-setting committee – David Ramsden, one of the two new members. There are two ways to view the Bank’s approach to this point. A generous interpretation says Carney &amp; co have skilfully prepared the ground. The market, which only a few months ago was expecting rates to remain at 0.25% until the end of next year, has been given time to adjust to the new thinking. An alternative view says the Bank has boxed itself into a corner unnecessarily. By talking up the prospect of a rate-rise, the Bank has to deliver in a fortnight’s time or lose its credibility and risk another sharp reverse in the value of sterling, which would squeeze real incomes at a bad moment. There was a better way. The August 2016 cut to 0.25% should have been reversed at the start of this year when the post-referendum slump failed to materialise. That would have avoided the current mini-drama over what is, after all, a modest tweak to monetary policy. Rollercoaster for Merlin Entertainments shares Merlin Entertainments used to argue that its theme parks and attractions, such as the London Eye, Legoland and Gardaland in Italy, were so popular that terrorist attacks in the UK and the rest of Europe only had a temporary effect on visitor numbers. It’s telling a different story now. Terrorism “at record levels of intensity in Europe” has produced “difficult” trading conditions. Shares slumped 16%. Yet the market’s reaction looks odd. Merlin didn’t actually move its profit forecasts very far. Top-line profits of £489m for 2017 had been expected but the company says £470m-£480m is now more likely. The slight difference doesn’t obviously justify a double-digit reaction in the share price, especially as securing a licence to open Peppa Pig attractions outside the UK looks a smart piece of business. Parents will probably hate the things, but that’s another story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/18/morning-mail-reese-witherspoon-alleges-sexual-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T19:54:39Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Reese Witherspoon alleges sexual assault","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/morning-mail-reese-witherspoon-alleges-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/18/morning-mail-reese-witherspoon-alleges-sexual-assault","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Reese Witherspoon alleges sexual assault","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 18 October. Top stories The Hollywood actor Reese Witherspoon has revealed that she was sexually assaulted by a director when she was 16 but was told to remain silent by agents and producers. Witherspoon did not name the director responsible but said the incident was the first of many experiences of “harassment and sexual assault” throughout her career. “I have my own experiences that have come back to me very vividly and I find it really hard to sleep, hard to think, hard to communicate a lot of the feelings that I’ve been having about anxiety, the guilt for not speaking up earlier,” she said. Witherspoon said that she was prompted to speak up after hearing other accounts of sexual assault faced by women in the film industry, saying “I actually felt less alone this week than I have ever felt in my entire career.” Also speaking at the Elle event, Jennifer Lawrence shared her own experiences as a young woman in the film industry. The actor revealed that on one early production she was made to take part in a naked lineup with other female actors, an experience she described as “degrading and humiliating”. The actor’s comments come at a time when Hollywood is reckoning with a culture of abuse in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than two dozen women over four decades. The producer has “unequivocally denied” many of the allegations. Australia has very strong anti-discrimination laws but they are still failing women who are the victims of sexual harassment. The sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, says there has been no discernible decrease in sexual harassment, even if there is a heightened awareness of it. “We had a lot of progress in the 60s and 70s in Australia, culminating in strong laws in the 80s in sex discrimination,” Jenkins says. “People assume we are doing really well now [but] in practice we haven’t made all of the progress that we expected.” The UK is facing its most severe terror threat ever, the chief of MI5 has warned, with the head of the intelligence service saying more attacks are inevitable as Britain sees a “dramatic upshift” in Islamist terrorism. Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, said: “That threat is multi-dimensional, evolving rapidly and operating at a scale and pace we’ve not seen before.” He added: “It’s at the highest tempo I have seen in my 34-year career. Today there is more terrorist activity, coming at us more quickly, and it can be harder to detect.” MI5 is under intense pressure to demonstrate its effectiveness after four Islamist terrorist attacks escaped its detection this year and 36 people were killed. Following the recent attacks on the UK MI5 staff numbers have expanded from 4,000 to 5,000 and thwarted 20 plots in the past four years, Parker said. Seven plots had been stopped before jihadists could strike in the last seven months alone, Parker added. “The threat is more diverse than I’ve ever known. Plots developed here in the UK but plots directed from overseas as well. Plots online. Complex scheming and also crude stabbings. Lengthy planning but also spontaneous attacks. Extremists of all ages, gender and backgrounds, united only by the toxic ideology of violent victory that drives them.” Labor has one eye on the next election and another on long-term low wages growth in a ramped up industrial relations pitch to voters. The shadow workplace relations minister, Brendan O’Connor, will use a speech to the National Press Club today to telegraph significant changes to federal industrial law if Labor wins the next federal election. In the ALP’s sights are “sham” enterprise agreements that are not voted on by the majority of the workers they will cover and the gig economy. Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Catalonia to protest against a judge’s decision to detain two prominent pro-independence leaders, as tensions between the Madrid and Barcelona governments continue to rise. Jordi Sánchez, the president of the Catalan National Assembly, and Jordi Cuixart, the president of Òmnium Cultural, are being investigated for alleged sedition in the run-up to the regional independence referendum two weeks ago. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, condemned the men’s detention. “Spain jails Catalonia’s civil society leaders for organising peaceful demonstrations,” he tweeted. “Sadly, we have political prisoners again.” Sport The AFL’s last-minute decision to deny Hannah Mouncey the right to nominate for the 2018 AFLW draft is a significant step backwards for any claim the league has to inclusiveness, writes Kate O’Halloran. The problem is not just the decision but also its timing and the flimsy reasons given, which all conveyed a lack of respect for Mouncey. All of Australia’s new captain’s cricket experiences have been building up to leading her nation in an Ashes series, Tim Wigmore writes. With the opener this Sunday in Brisbane, Rachael Haynes says that she’s “well-prepared as a leader”. Thinking time Australia’s gender pay gap is once again in the spotlight with the sudden departure of Lisa Wilkinson from Channel Nine, reportedly because the network wouldn’t meet her demands for wage parity with her male co-host. Despite decades of government policy, why do women across the country still earn on average 15.3% less than men? In this datablog we look at how discrimination, childcare and industrial segregation are driving the disparity, leaving women with less superannuation, less independence, less security and less power. Decades of dud healthy eating guidance sent the humble egg into nutritional exile. But with new advice about runny yolks suggesting that salmonella in raw eggs is a thing of the past – and the unhealthy cholesterol argument debunked long ago – it may be time to dust off your poaching skills and enjoy ‘‘nature’s multivitamin” again. “Whatever your current status,” writes egg-lover Joanna Blythman. “Starving, peckish, dieting, feasting, economising, working, travelling, convalescing, or just going about your daily business – it’s hard to beat an egg.” The Carmichael coalmine was once pitched as a choice between jobs and the environment. So where are the jobs, asks the Queensland economist John Quiggin. “We are promised an economic bonanza with 10,000 jobs and billions of dollars in royalties and taxes. For hard-pressed cities like Townsville and Rockhampton and for governments with a chronic shortage of funds, this seems too good to turn down ... It’s becoming increasingly evident, however, that the choice is a false one. In all probability, neither the jobs nor the revenue will ever materialise. Rather, the whole project will turn into a sink, into which public money is poured for no return.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has suffered a setback after announcing he will declare the US opioid crisis a national emergency next week. “Rep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar,” Trump tweeted overnight. “Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!” Marino was nominated to lead the National Office of Drug Control Policy, a key role in efforts to tackle the epidemic in opioid addiction and abuse. But on Sunday his suitability for the role of “drug czar” was thrown into doubt after a joint report by the Washington Post and 60 Minutes investigated his role as the sponsor of a bill that critics say undermined federal enforcement efforts against the opioid epidemic. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph splashes with a full-page photograph of Lisa WIlkinson and the rather snippy headline “Lisa, you ain’t Karl – Nine boss hits out at runaway star”. The network chief executive, Hugh Marks, told the Telegraph that Wilkinson demanded $2.3m, and the money could be invested in junior journalists instead. The Australian Financial Review leads with proposed energy reforms with the headline “Strong backing for energy plan”. It claims Labor states with ambitious renewable energy targets will face more costly reliability standards, which could increase their cost of electricity. Distant volcanic eruptions may have triggered revolts by the people of ancient Egypt, the ABC science team reports, with ice cores and historical data indicating many local uprisings occured around volcanic eruptions in the last 260 years of the despised Ptolemaic Dynasty, the last ancient Egyptian empire. Coming up The Victorian state parliament sits with debate continuing on its euthanasia bill. Federal parliament also sits with energy expected to again dominate the agenda. Coalition MPs will also be nervously awaiting any decision by the high court on MPs citizenship, which could be today.

The retailer is restructuring its HR departments, getting rid of 1,400 store-based clerks and another 600 staff based in the back offices that serve the chain as well as Argos and Sainsbury’s bank. “The UK grocery market is changing at a rapid pace and it’s crucial that we transform the way we operate to meet future challenges and continue to provide customers with best in class service,” said a Sainsbury’s spokesman. All the big supermarket chains have announced recent job cuts as they seek to compete with the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Tesco is shedding 2,300 staff as part of a cost-cutting programme that is hitting head office workers as well as staff based at its Cardiff call centre which will close next year. Thousands of Asda workers are also facing redundancy or a dramatic cut in their working hours as Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain looks to cut costs. Sainsbury’s, which employs about 119,000 full-time staff, is moving towards a centralised HR model as it overhauls to save hundreds of millions of pounds. The company will reach the end of a three-year plan to save £500m in March 2018 but Mike Coupe, the chief executive, has said it will then embark on a new programme designed to save the same amount again. Sainsbury’s has been working with McKinsey, the management consultancy, on the headcount reduction plan. The changes to HR mean tasks like processing payroll will no longer be done in store. The 600 head office staff affected by the other change, first reported by the Times, are based in Manchester, Coventry, Edinburgh and London. “Following a comprehensive review, we are proposing some updates to our HR structures and systems, as well as changes to a number of other support roles,” added Sainsbury’s. “This has been a difficult decision and we appreciate that this will be a tough time for those colleagues affected by the changes.” In March, Sainsbury’s said it was cutting 400 jobs in store while another 4,000 workers would face changes to their working hours as it looked to run its supermarkets more cheaply. The changes included scrapping the night shift in 140 supermarkets. Under the leadership of Coupe, Sainsbury’s has sought to broaden its appeal with the £1.4bn purchase of Argos. The deal reduced Sainsbury’s reliance on the highly competitive grocery market and also gave it access to Argos’s fast delivery network. The big four supermarkets –Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – are losing market share to Aldi and Lidl, which added £390m to their sales over the past three months, according to Kantar Worldpanel. That figure was half of thegrocery market’s overall growth in the 12 weeks ending 8 October. Kantar Worldpanel data showed Aldi and Lidl with a combined market share of 12%. However, Moody’s, the debt rating agency, predicts this proportion could rise to 15% over the next three years – a level that would force rival bosses to rethink their business models again. “We believe most of the ongoing revenue gains by the discounters will come at the expense of the ‘big four’,” said David Beadle at Moody’s. “The only uncertainties are the extent to which inflation and population growth soften the blow of this hit to revenue, and how the loss of market share will be spread out.” The price war with the discounters comes at a time when retailers are struggling to pass on rising costs to hard up shoppers. On Tuesday, official data showed inflation had edged up to 3% – its highest level since 2012. “Retailers have done a great job of cushioning shoppers from the rising food chain costs they’re experiencing, exacerbated by the weakening pound, but this can’t last for ever,” said Nielsen analyst Mike Watkins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/22/tim-oreilly-interview-generosity-prosperity-jeff-bezos-elon-musk","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Tim O’Reilly: ‘Generosity is the thing that is at the beginning of prosperity’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/22/tim-oreilly-interview-generosity-prosperity-jeff-bezos-elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/22/tim-oreilly-interview-generosity-prosperity-jeff-bezos-elon-musk","fields":{"headline":"Tim O’Reilly: ‘Generosity is the thing that is at the beginning of prosperity’","bodyText":"Tim O’Reilly believes we need to have a reset. This means more coming from him than it does from most people. The 63-year-old CEO, born in Ireland and raised in San Francisco, is one of the most influential pioneers and thinkers of the internet age. His publishing company, O’Reilly Media, began producing computer manuals in the late 1970s and he has been early to spot many influential tech trends ever since: open-source software, web 2.0, wifi, the maker movement and big data among them. His new book, WTF: What’s the Future and Why It’s Up to Us, looks at work and how jobs will change in a world shaped by technology. It is sometimes hard not to be pessimistic about what’s coming over the hill, but he is convinced that our destiny remains in human hands. How would you describe your new book? It’s very complex. It’s an economic call to action wrapped in a business book wrapped in a memoir. Ha! You studied classics at Harvard and have been involved in the tech revolution since the very beginning… It could have been 10 books. But the start point was a talk at TED University on income inequality by Nick Hanauer in 2012. He made this point that is too often not appreciated, which is that the whole cycle of capitalism depends on people being able to buy things. And with the short-sighted approach to capitalism, in which the rich get richer and it doesn’t trickle down, we’re getting to an endgame of that. That idea played into a set of observations I had been making my whole career. Namely, the rise and fall of technology platforms has lessons for the rise and fall of society. When those platforms create value for the participants, they flourish. When they start taking too much of the value for themselves, they fail. What’s an example of that? At the very beginning of my career, it was the battle between IBM and the tech industry. Then Microsoft and the tech industry. Microsoft was the liberator originally: the PC was part of the first revolution, a democratising force. Then Microsoft recreated the old monopoly of IBM, where they sucked all the air out of the room. And sure enough all of the customers went somewhere else. And that continues to happen? In the book, I write about how Google optimises for relevance and how that works. Facebook is trying to optimise for something slightly different: something that will be clicked on or that people will find engaging and spend more time with. And we’ve seen it with fake news and now ad targeting, how Facebook’s well-intentioned, incredibly idealistic algorithms have become increasingly divisive. How does that connect to the wider economy? I’m ultimately trying to get to this notion that technology is going to eliminate jobs and my response is: only if that’s what we tell it to do. And it is what we’re telling it to do. Because the goal, just like Google has relevance and Facebook has engagement, the massive goal that we tell every company to pursue is shareholder value. Value for shareholders, even if it means shedding employees, gutting communities, doing things that are bad in the long run, because we’ve created all these incentives and there are people who are gaming the system. In the same way, fake news shows that Facebook didn’t get it quite right and had to fix the algorithm; we have to fix the algorithm that we’re using to manage our markets and our economy. You mention the idealistic streak that some of these big tech companies have. Does that make you optimistic that change can happen? Yes, but they need to step up and understand what it means to practise that ideal. For Google to say: “Don’t be evil” and then do some of the things that they do; well, guys, you’ve got to think a little harder about that. It’s funny because the company that I’ve ended up respecting the most in that regard is Amazon. There’s a lot of stuff that’s not great about Amazon, but they keep upping the ante in ways that are interesting and productive. And I’m a great admirer of Elon Musk. I’d say that he and Jeff Bezos are my two favourite entrepreneurs at the moment. You’ve not always praised Amazon. What’s changed? Well, it’s the fact that they are consistently bold in their reinvestment in the future. Again, if you look at Google, they go: “We’ve got all these big bets…” But a lot of them feel like rich people’s toys: “We’re going to work on having people live for ever” or whatever. It’s like, OK, great. But Amazon: think about how many companies exist and are supported by Amazon’s cloud computing platform. They invented this whole new category. And they are always pushing for lower prices, not for higher margins. I just feel that Jeff is committed to the future in a way that a lot of people aren’t. One of the central themes of the book is AI and what impact it will have on the job market. Again, you suggest that Amazon is leading the way here… Recently, Amazon introduced 50,000 robots but also added 200,000 people because they used them to pack more products into the warehouses. They used them to speed up delivery times. This is the narrative of the augmented worker, which again is a pattern from history. A steam shovel could do more than any human worker and, yes, it did mean that we put a lot of human workers out of business. But then we started doing more and that put people back to work. Just in my neighbourhood, the US Post Office, which everyone thought was on its deathbed, is now showing up at 10pm. Crazy stuff! But that’s because Amazon upped the ante. Or Uber: it’s a revolution in urban transportation that, because of the augmentation of mapping and directions, has put millions of untrained people to work. That’s the equivalent of the steam shovel. Looking back at your career, what are you proudest of? I’m really proud of the role I played in reshaping the narrative about open-source software. It was seen as this business-hostile thing: free software. But I saw it as a huge flowering of opportunity that’s open to the world. I guess if you look at my entire career, I’m trying to talk about the value of generosity. And why generosity is not something you paste on at the end – generosity is something that is generative. Generosity is the thing that is at the beginning of prosperity, not at the end. But is that human nature? It’s all human nature, it’s interesting. I’ve just lately been reading a book I highly recommend: How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life by Russ Roberts. And it’s funny because I expected it to be a libertarian account of why free markets are so great. But it’s about Adam Smith’s other great work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and about the desire of people to be good and the desire of people to be seen as good by their peers. And how that’s the root thing in human behaviour. In a lot of ways, I’ve spent my career trying to talk about what is good – maybe that’s my classics training – in the realm of technology. So what’s the role of the entrepreneur within this system? Before steel girders, we couldn’t build skyscrapers. Before steel cables, we couldn’t build suspension bridges. We keep advancing, these new technologies make new things possible, and as a result we become richer. So, technology entrepreneurs, that’s your job! To find the things that were previously impossible. • WTF: What’s the Future and Why It’s Up To Us by Tim O’Reilly is published by Random House (£14.99).

In a statement released on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu’s security cabinet set out a series of conditions which appeared to complicate Egypt-sponsored efforts to end a decade-long split between Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah movement, which rules in the West Bank, and the Islamist group Hamas, which has been in control of Gaza. “Following previous decisions, the Israeli government will not hold political talks with a Palestinian government that is supported by Hamas, a terror organisation calling for the destruction of Israel,” the statement read. Fatah and the rival Hamas this month reached a preliminary reconciliation agreement. The two groups signed a provisional unity agreement in Cairo on Thursday. Israel’s lengthy list of preconditions for any negotiations includes a number of demands: That Hamas recognise Israel and “desist from terrorism”. The group’s disarmament. The return of bodies of Israeli soldiers and Israeli civilians held by Hamas. That Gaza be placed under the full security control of Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, including border crossings to prevent smuggling. The Israeli statement also called on the Palestinian Authority to continue acting against Hamas on the West Bank and to sever its ties with Iran. The issue of the disarmament of Hamas’s 25,000-strong armed wing was already a key issue in the Palestinian reconciliation negotiations. Although it is being pushed by Abbas himself, most observers see it as one of the most difficult sticking points. Unlike Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organisation – which Abbas leads – has recognised Israel. Diplomats had been cautiously optimistic that the Palestinian reconciliation negotiations hosted by Cairo might trigger positive steps for internal Palestinian politics – and ultimately could lead to a renewed effort in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. According to Israeli media reports, the security cabinet also authorised Netanyahu to consider taking punitive steps against the Palestinian Authority in the event of a unity government being formed – including potentially withholding funds. It stopped short, however, of demands from Naftali Bennett, the leader of Israel’s far-right Jewish Home party, to sever all links with the Palestinian Authority. Although peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been frozen since 2014, the Israeli demands would appear to have killed any hopes of movement. Most analysts believe that any renewed peace progress requires both Palestinian internal reconciliation and negotiations with Israel. The statement is in line with previous moves by Netanyahu, who has often sought to impose preconditions on Palestinians for any movement on the peace process. On Tuesday a senior Hamas spokesman denied reports that Hamas had secretly agreed to halt attacks against Israel from the West Bank as part of reconciliation talks. “There are no secret clauses in the reconciliation understanding, and what the occupation published on the resistance halting in the West Bank is not true,” senior Hamas spokesperson Husam Badran told Palestinian news website Quds News Network. “The position to choose resistance is not connected to any person or entity, but rather it is the position of the entire Palestinian people to decide. The natural situation is that when there is an occupation, there will be a resistance to confront it,” said Badran. The Israeli statement came just days after Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, said for the first time that he and other world leaders were wrong to yield to Israeli pressure to impose an immediate boycott of Hamas after the Islamist faction won Palestinian elections in 2006."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/17/more-teething-problems-on-gwrs-brand-new-intercity-express-train","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T18:06:02Z","webTitle":"More teething problems on GWR’s brand new Intercity Express train","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/more-teething-problems-on-gwrs-brand-new-intercity-express-train","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/17/more-teething-problems-on-gwrs-brand-new-intercity-express-train","fields":{"headline":"More teething problems on GWR’s brand new Intercity Express train","bodyText":"Frustrated Great Western Railway passengers say they do not want much. “We simply want trains that we know are going to run on time. But we don’t get that. I reckon I’m delayed 50% of the time. It’s a painful experience, soul-destroying,” said commuter Adrian Beeby, who travels three times a week between Wiltshire and London. Their hope was that things would change this week with the launch of the GWR Intercity Express. But its arrival has been a PR disaster for GWR and the makers of the new train, Hitachi. It was not great for the government either, which heralded the first glimpse of the £5.7bn fleet as a demonstration that it was putting passengers at the heart of its railways policy. With the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, onboard, the first of the Hitachi Class 800 trains left Bristol 25 minutes late and some of those ergonomic seats had to be sectioned off after an air-conditioning unit sprang a leak, exacerbating an overcrowding problem. The train, which operates on both diesel and electric power, then halted for a while in Buckinghamshire, suspiciously close to where the overhead electricity runs out. It arrived in London 41 minutes late. The return trip was better, though passengers reported that some doors would not open at Didcot in Oxfordshire. Craig McCrum, head of sales at a London tech startup, was one of those on the ill-fated train. “There was a lot of laughter onboard but it’s not really funny,” he said. When parking is taken into account, McCrum spends more than £10,000 a year on getting into London every day. “For that you expect a decent service.” Tuesday was not much better after a rock fall between Bristol and Bath caused delays and cancellations. McCrum decided to work from home. “Luckily I have an understanding employer but you see people having a horrible time wondering if they are going to get to work on time.” The Great Western mainline is, when it works, the gem of the network. Its delights include Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s Box Tunnel (the rising sunlight is reputed to shine all the way through it on the great engineer’s birthday), the seaside stretch at Dawlish in Devon and the glorious London to Penzance sleeper train. But plans to electrify the line have been delayed and partially abandoned. At the moment, the electrified section only runs as far as Maidenhead in Berkshire. By next year it should have been extended as far as Cardiff but the section to Bath and Bristol has been deferred until the next funding period, 2019-24, and plans for electrification to extend further into Wales have been scrapped. The so-called bi-mode trains have allowed Grayling to brazen out the controversial decision to axe electrification projects, leaving stretches of tracks unwired. Lianna Etkind of the Campaign for Better Transport accepted that new trains could have teething problems but added: “We’re concerned that the government is ignoring the evidence that electric trains are simply more reliable than diesel trains, as well as the obvious environmental and health benefits of moving away from diesel.” More details of what caused the “teething problems” on Monday have emerged. Hitachi said the maiden journey of the Class 800 left the depot 25 minutes late because of an “IT router issue”. That the unscheduled halt in Buckinghamshire was close to where the electricity stops appears to be coincidental. Hitachi said there was a problem there with an air valve. Overcrowding on the new train – which promised more capacity for passengers – was blamed on the presence of media, including a contingent from Hitachi’s home in Japan, and trainspotters. “What we found was that there was a lot of interest and enthusiasm that made them busier than usual,” a spokesman said. Engineers worked on the affected train and it was back in service on Tuesday along with a second Class 800. Passengers arriving at Chippenham on Tuesday had stories of trauma about GWR journeys – but also some joyful memories. Solicitor Charlotte Teece described how she once spent the best part of five hours travelling just 14 miles. “That was one to forget,” she said. Businessman Kevin Snape said he felt he had to always travel first class to London (£139 at peak time) to be sure of getting a seat. But Jill Green, the wife of retired British Rail employee Paul, said she loved the network. “I remember seeing the steam trains coming through here when I was a little girl. I used to hide behind my mum thinking it was a great monster. My husband’s in south Wales now chasing after that new train. We love travelling by rail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/17/daughter-of-brain-damaged-woman-tells-court-mums-gone","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T17:23:46Z","webTitle":"Daughter of brain-damaged woman tells court 'Mum's gone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/17/daughter-of-brain-damaged-woman-tells-court-mums-gone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/17/daughter-of-brain-damaged-woman-tells-court-mums-gone","fields":{"headline":"Daughter of brain-damaged woman tells court 'Mum's gone'","bodyText":"The daughter of a brain-damaged woman being cared for on a hospital drip wept as she told a court: “My mum’s gone.” She went on: “She’s physically there in the bed, but it’s not my mum. Visiting her is very hard because it’s a sharp reminder of what we’ve all lost and what my mum has lost. The essence of her has gone and I miss her.” Mrs P, 72, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, has spent the past 10 months living in a minimally conscious state in a high-dependency ward. Her two daughters and long-term partner want her taken off the nasogastric tube and allowed to receive palliative care in a hospice. But the woman’s three sisters have sided with an NHS trust in arguing that her current medical regime should continue. The family rift is now at the centre of a legal wrangle in front of a judge at the court of protection. Mr Justice Hayden has already been told of an email written three and a half years ago, in which Mrs P asked her daughter, Ms A, to “have the pillow” ready should she ever suffer an illness similar to the one that claimed her father’s life. On Tuesday Ms A frequently wiped away tears as she recalled her mother being “a force to be reckoned with” before she suffered a fall last November. “She wasn’t frightened to stand up and say what she thought. She wasn’t anything like a little old lady. She wasn’t a ‘sit there in front of the TV sipping tea’ sort of woman. She was a ‘knock on the council offices’ door’ type of person.” Mrs P had been making plans for last Christmas Day at the time of her fall. Afterwards she began to suffer from headaches. Within a month a CT scan revealed an aneurysm and she then lapsed into the minimally conscious state in which she remains. Doctors have given her a life expectancy of about five years. Ms A said she did not think her mother “got anything out of” her visits, and over the months she herself had come to feel “quite intimidated” by staff on the ward. Ms A revealed that her mother had spent three days watching her husband die in 1993. He had taken the decision to have no further medical intervention and she complied with that. “My mum was 100% behind my dad’s decision. She was full of admiration for his courage in doing what he did. She sat with him for three days while he died. With that history, I don’t think we could see more clearly what to do now. “We’ve heard a lot about the patient, but that isn’t my mum. It’s really important that my mum is brought into these proceedings as much as possible.” One of Mrs P’s sisters said she believed the pensioner would have wanted “to have every possible care – high quality care – and choices”. She added: “She would have wanted everything to be done for her at the appropriate time. I don’t understand why it wasn’t. “I believe that being surrounded by talking books or music is essential and I don’t understand why that wasn’t available. When I’ve seen her I feel I’ve communicated. I talked to her about things. We had to work hard to bring her consciousness up. It was shaking her and really speaking to her. On one occasion I said, ‘Come on, kid – don’t give up.’ With her good hand she picked up the corner of the sheet and wiped (a tear from) my eye.” She said of the decision-making process: “Unless you’re going into the realms of emotional entrapment, I don’t think you can answer for anyone else without written documentation.” Professor Derek Wade, the consultant in neurological rehabilitation instructed by Ms A, said he doubted the NHS trust’s ability to find a suitable nursing home for the pensioner. Nursing homes were “commercially orientated” and large, he said, and it was likely that any intended structure was likely to be disrupted by staff having to deal with severe care needs. Mr Justice Hayden is considering an application by an NHS foundation trust, which cannot be identified for legal reasons, for declarations and orders permitting the withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration.

Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to August, down from 2.2% in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier figures, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 2%. When taking account of inflation, the ONS said real wages fell by 0.4% on the previous year, despite the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.3% – the joint lowest level since 1975. The figures ignited a political row in Westminster as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked Theresa May’s stewardship of the economy. Speaking at prime ministers’ questions in parliament on Wednesday, he said: “Figures show that real wages are lower today than they were 10 years ago. Most people in work are worse off.” The prime minister said tax cuts and the national living wage was helping with the cost of living for households, while it was good news that the unemployment rate was at its lowest level for more than 40 years. “That does mean more money being taken in wages to their families,” she said. The figures will perplex the Bank of England as it prepares for the first interest rate hike in a decade from as early as next month. The central bank has been looking for signs of pay growth as it seeks to balance a trade-off between supporting jobs and the economy with low rates and cutting the growth in prices. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the data “fails to provide a decisive case” for the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing from 0.25%. “The squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, with obvious negative implications for personal expenditure,” he said. The latest fall in real pay means that average earnings are no higher than they were in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4% bigger per person than at that time, according to the Resolution Foundation. Stephen Clarke, an economic analyst at the thinktank, said: “Today’s figures confirm the big picture trend that the UK labour market is great at creating jobs, but terrible at raising people’s pay.” There were some positive signs for Threadneedle Street to seize upon should it look to raise rates at the next meeting of its monetary policy committee in two weeks. The number of people in work increased by 94,000 in the three months to August 2017 compared with three months ago, although that was at a slower rate than in the previous three months to July. Of the increase in people entering the workforce, 78,000 were women. The total number of people employed full-time increased by 25,000 to 23.56 million, while the number of workers on part-time contracts rose by 69,000 to 8.55 million. Economists believe the Bank will probably raise rates even with lacklustre readings on the economy – barring any significant reverse – given the strength of its message in September signalling a desire for a rate increase in the “coming months”. Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said: “Many labour market measures continue to strengthen. Employment growth in the latest three-month period was driven mainly by women, with a corresponding drop in inactivity. Vacancies remain robust, at a near-record level.” The sluggish pay growth comes as inflation reached its highest level in half a decade in September, fuelled by the drop in the pound since the Brexit vote a year ago. The consumer price index reached 3% last month, while the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, said on Tuesday he expects prices to rise further still. The Institute of Directors, which represents company bosses, blamed uncertainty over Brexit as well as the higher cost of goods used by firms for making it difficult for them to offer better pay packages. Firms have been avoiding investment due to fears over the lack of progress in talks between ministers and Brussels. Seamus Nevin, head of policy research at the lobby group, said: “This is leaving employers little wiggle room to offer inflation-busting pay increases.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/17/inflation-five-year-high-debts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T17:02:57Z","webTitle":"Inflation is back.

And this time the effects could be much worse","bodyText":"In 1972 my father bought a home on the south coast of England for the shockingly high price of £11,500. His mortgage was £8,000, or a little under three times his salary. Within a few years, galloping inflation had sparked the near collapse of the British economy, a run on sterling, and an IMF bailout. Yet by 1980 the ravages of runaway 1970s price rises had somehow left my father, and many like him, a fair bit better off. Inflation-related pay increases meant that by 1980 his salary was not far short of £8,000. The “monster” of 1970s inflation had kindly wiped out the real burden of the mortgage, slashing it from three times his income to just one times. And the value of the house had risen to more than £20,000. I remember quipping at the time to my dad (and proudly using my Rockwell electronic calculator) that if house prices continued to rise at the pace they were in 1979, his home would be worth £400,000 by the time he retired. “Don’t be an idiot, son,” he said. But as it turned out, it was. Farther along the south coast, for my retired grandfather the inflationary 1970s proved to be an entirely less attractive decade. His pension allowed for rises of up to 5% a year. Yet by 1975 inflation was running at 24%. The 1970s left him and his wife with a miserable, penny-pinching existence in retirement. Inflation is entirely amoral. It plunders the accumulated savings of the hardworking. It slashes the real value of the debts taken on by the profligate. Are we prepared for its return? Official figures today reveal that the consumer price index has risen to 3%, the highest in five years. The retail price index – the one used in the 1970s – is even higher, at 3.6%. These figures remain a fraction of those in the 1970s. But once unleashed inflation has a habit of spiralling upwards. It was 7% in 1972, but went to 9% the year after, then 16% the year after that before reaching the all-time high of 24% in the mid-1970s. It’s a classic case of being careful what you wish for. Every central bank wants a little bit of inflation. The Bank of England likes 2%. Less than that and the governor has to explain to the chancellor why he’s undershooting. But everyone’s terrified of it going much above 4% or 5%. And in truth, the 1970s weren’t that rosy even for the “winners” like my father. The base rate jumped to 15%, mortgage rates even more. It didn’t help one jot that the real value of the mortgage was falling when the monthly cost of servicing it was soaring. My father was lucky to keep his job. Millions of others didn’t, as interest rate rises pushed the economy deep into recession. Of course this time around it will be different … it will be much, much worse. The unprecedented build-up of household debt – from mortgages to car loans and credit card balances – leaves individuals desperately vulnerable to a rate shock. Economists talk of a “new normal” where the Bank of England base rate rises from its current level of 0.25% to as much as 3% to keep inflation at bay. At that level, the wheels (just about) stay on the economy. If forced back to 5% – where they were before the financial crisis – the outlook is grim. Will that happen? It’s unlikely, not least because Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, knows a 5% interest rate is medicine that will kill the patient. In any case, while the latest inflation rate makes for “highest in five years” headlines, it is unlikely to stay there for long. The spike in inflation is largely down to the one-off fall in sterling that has pushed up import prices. We saw a similar inflationary pattern after sterling’s collapse from $2 to $1.40 in 2008-09. Even though Carney believes inflation has not yet peaked, most economists reckon he will “look through” the current spike and avoid anything other than nominal rate hikes, particularly as Brexit uncertainty reigns. Of course, he could be very wrong, and inflation could grip the British economy again. If you’re young, have manageable debts, keep your job, and earn good pay rises, then such a rise would probably leave you laughing. But the rest of us will be crying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/emotional-labor-women-fear-sexual-harassment-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"The emotional burden of living in fear: a call for women's stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/emotional-labor-women-fear-sexual-harassment-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/18/emotional-labor-women-fear-sexual-harassment-assault","fields":{"headline":"The emotional burden of living in fear: a call for women's stories","bodyText":"In the car of my family friend, driving me home; in the tunnel between the train platform and the street; on the bus in the middle of the day; a month ago when I was walking through the market. I wish it wasn’t as banal to say it: me too. “Have you seen this #metoo thing on Facebook? It’s so fucked up,” a male friend exclaimed to me yesterday, alluding to the two words women have been writing on their social media pages in the last couple of days, pronouncing in the simplest of terms what they carry within: that they too have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment and assault. “Yeah, it’s fucked up,” I said. But it’s hardly new, I thought to myself. Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful for the male friends expressing concern, but here’s what I would like them to know too, and here’s what I would like us women to consider. What’s wrong with this picture is not just that we, women, have to face those acts. It’s that we navigate a world in which we know this is happening, that this has happened, and that it could happen at any time. We must be on guard, always. We must carry the emotional burden of it, and regulate our inside worlds to adapt to it. We have to do this so that we continue to be mobile, to grow at work, and to build ourselves up socially and economically. This is where the notion of “emotional labor” comes in. Over the last couple of years, a vigorous debate has re-emerged online around this topic. This once purely academic term was originally used to describe the emotion regulation expected of a largely female, underpaid service industry workforce (think of a waitress forced to smile at a rude customer if she wants a tip). The term has been brought back to life by women pointing out that within private relationships, they are often expected to be the emotional caregivers, supporters and facilitators – in a way that is both exhausting and unequal. But this emotional load does not stop there. Having to fear simply for being female, and cater to a society that wants to function as normal while it enables assault and harassment, constitutes a form of emotional labor too. Where we are prey, we not only have to deal with the actual aggressions, we have to deal with the memories of them, the fear and awareness they could happen again at any time. We must participate in a very deliberate mechanism that means whether we are in the office, on the street or in someone’s home, we must keep a part of our brain uninterruptedly working on ascertaining our levels of safety. It is a constant effort. We cannot afford to turn that part of our brains off. Adding insult to injury, because we do not yet live in a society that will take our side, when sexist incidents just short of full-blown assault happen we must participate in a damaging, wearying process of de-escalation: downplaying incidents to protect our physical safety, downplaying incidents to protect our income, downplaying incidents to simply get through another day. You could call it being stuck between a rock and a hard place. Take this example close to my home: a couple of weeks ago, in my current, beloved city of Detroit, two stories emerged of women who had been abducted and assaulted while riding their bicycles. I ride a bicycle in Detroit, it is healthy, and, more to the point, it is cheap. Instantly, concerned acquaintances started conversations asking women to avoid using bicycles. But what if a bicycle is the only way we have to get to work? There’s hardly any public transportation in Detroit, and bicycles make economic sense for many people. What are our options here? Plough through the fear and maintain our limited independence? Forfeit the bicycle ride and the opportunities it was taking us toward? Suspects are now in custody, but this is not just a conundrum for this situation. It is a pattern we women know all too well, in all cities, suburbs and townships in between. On the back of my writings for the Guardian, where I have started scratching the surface of emotional labor, sexist incident de-escalation, sexual harassment as a side-effect of emotional-labor-heavy tipped work, and a host of other issues related to inequality, I will be spending the next year researching and writing a book that will take a head-on and all-encompassing look at emotional labor. As I do this, I will also be writing for the Guardian, sharing and reporting on the many ways in which emotional labor keeps women “in place”: at work, at home, in the bedroom, in public spaces. The topic reaches and affects so many different people, in different ways – across class, race, sexual orientation, gender identity and geography. I am doing a call-out to you readers to tell me your own stories of emotional labor, and what shouldering emotional labor has been like for you.

Who killed Crimewatch – and why?","bodyText":"Hello, and welcome to this Crimewatch special, in which we investigate the brutal axing, on the morning of Tuesday 17 October 2017, of the BBC series itself. Crimewatch was 33 years old, and leaves a survivor, Crimewatch Roadshow, which will live on in BBC1 daytime. Crimewatch will always be remembered for its catchphrase, “Goodnight, please don’t have nightmares,” coined by presenter Nick Ross to allay concerns about the effect on viewers of the often graphic reconstructions. In this case, please don’t phone, email or tweet us your suspicions. It is already known that the slaying of Crimewatch was carried out by Charlotte Moore, a 49-year-old BBC director of content from the W1A area. Her motive is interesting. Forensic television criticism suggests that the following issues combined to end the life of the veteran franchise. Competition Since Crimewatch UK (as it was then called) launched in 1984, there have been huge changes in coverage of crime. Police and media once had such a terror of “contempt of court” (the potential prejudicing of legal proceedings by publication of evidence) that arrests in major cases would lead to the release of no more information than “a 38-year-old man is helping police with their inquiries”. Similarly, many detectives were initially so wary of Crimewatch that they used it only for seriously stalled inquiries. Police forces now routinely set up phone lines, Twitter hashtags and websites linked to an investigation. And it is common for journalists, TV current-affairs shows and bloggers to investigate significant mysteries, identifying suspects and new evidence. The case of Corrie McKeague, an RAF airman who vanished in Suffolk last September, has received Crimewatch-style treatment from numerous media outlets. And, if the expansion of real-life crime reporting has reduced interest in the show, so has the explosion of crime fiction. When Crimewatch UK started, contemporary British police stories were a relatively small element in the schedules, with ITV’s PD James and Ruth Rendell franchises just getting under way and Inspector Morse not appearing until 1987. Now the genre is so popular that a majority of the 9pm drama slots contain murder investigations. Significantly, the BBC has suggested that the removal of Crimewatch from peak time will free up slots and cash for drama. Format Crimewatch has a problematic structure, in that the reveal or denouement takes place off-screen, if and when the cops make an arrest. Even Crimewatch Update, screened late on the night of main show, could only report on the volume of responses. If a trial ensues, it may be a year or more before the success can be mentioned and, if the accused is acquitted, the investigation becomes unreportable. TV viewing has polarised between self-scheduled watching (catchup, box set, streamed) and appointment viewing, in which the audience is gripped over several weekly episodes (Doctor Foster, Liar). But Crimewatch’s problem was that it fitted neither template. It only really made sense if watched live, and a monthly show with a late-night update is tricky to schedule around. Clear-up rate Crimewatch can be seen as the purest kind of public service TV, bringing more benefits to the police and society than to the broadcasters. But increasing doubts have been raised about its efficiency as an investigative tool. A common exchange on the update programme involved a presenter saying perkily: “Hundreds of calls coming in, DI. You must be thrilled!” and the officer responding: “Yes, well, let’s see what’s in there.” One detective told me privately that the rise of social media has increased the quantity of responses to Crimewatch, but reduced the quality. In earlier years, a caller had to copy down a long phone number and dial from a landline or (in sensitive cases) phone box. The ease of texting or tweeting means that the show is now more at risk of the pet theories of sofa detectives. The survival of Crimewatch Roadshow, in which the detectives engage directly with members of the public, can partly be attributed to this format being less vulnerable to amateur Sherlocks. Some criminal barristers have also raised concerns that crimes featured on the show may face problems when they come to court. If jurors and witnesses have seen a reconstruction using lookalikes, their responses become less pure. Although the show has undoubtedly solved many crimes (helping to apprehend, it claims, 57 murderers, 53 rapists and 18 paedophiles), it may be seen as symbolic that its most high-profile case – the murder of its own presenter, Jill Dando, in 1999 – remains officially unsolved, after the conviction of a man was overturned. The cancellation of long-running shows often prompts outrage from viewers. However, Crimewatch’s content is now so replicated elsewhere that its axe-killer, Moore, seems unlikely to suffer too many nightmares over what she has done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/17/hate-crime-racism-islamophobia-misogyny","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:50:47Z","webTitle":"Hate crime has become the new normal.

This is how we tackle it","bodyText":"Reported hate crime has increased by 29% in the past year, new data released by the Home Office shows. Police forces across England and Wales recorded almost 80,400 hate crimes in 2016-2017. This is the largest recorded rise in the six years since records began. The sobering truth is that many people do not report hate crime to the police for a number of reasons – so the figures could well be even higher. According to today’s findings, the unprecedented surge correlates with the Brexit vote and an increase in terrorist attacks in the UK. The poisonous, racially charged anti-immigrant rhetoric from sections of the leave campaign emboldened people to spew racist views in ways we have not seen in decades. Anyone deemed “other” – from eastern Europeans, black people and minorities to Muslims, refugees, LGBTI and disabled people – has been subjected to unprecedented levels of open bigotry in the past year. It goes without saying that not everyone who voted Brexit is a bigot or a racist, and people have the right to vote how they wish in a democracy. For many Brexiters, however, as soon as the phrase “hate crime” is mentioned, and a correlation is made between spikes in open racism and the EU referendum, the defensiveness kicks in – as does the denial that post-Brexit hate crime has become the new normal for many people. As hate crimes are intrinsically linked to someone’s identity – race, nationality or faith are the main factors – when these identities intersect it makes certain groups even more vulnerable to attacks, such as visibly Muslim women. As an anti-racism and anti-hate crime campaigner, and the founder of the anti-racism digital platform The Everyday Bigotry Project, I’ve spent the past year working with Muslim women to counter gendered Islamophobic hate crime in my home city of Oxford. This work has included launching a campaign to encourage more people to report hate crime in the city. I’ve also spent the past year travelling the country to meet grassroots anti-racism campaigners doing tireless work with dwindling resources who are discovering increasing levels of hate crime. I’ve also been invited into schools to generate discussions around racism and bigotry. It has been an eye-opening experience to discover how isolated many victims of hate crime feel – and how for some people, the fear of it impacts on how they live day to day. One young Muslim woman in London who wears the hijab hadn’t told her family about the racial, Islamophobic abuse she had been subjected to on public transport because she was worried that they might tell her to give up her university education. A group of young women I interviewed in London had stopped going out in the evening because they were scared they might be attacked with acid by racists after a spike in this category of crime. Vulnerable women are being pushed back into their homes because of fears they will subjected to abuse and attack. How can this be happening in 2017? My work across the country and in Oxford has left me in no doubt that racism, Islamophobia and misogyny intersect in dehumanising and violent ways. In order to tackle hate crime the first thing we must do is listen to victims of racialised hate – and then understand their need to be believed. The police need to work much harder at reaching vulnerable groups of people and talking with individuals directly – this only happens through outreach work. I organised a meeting a few months ago in Oxford so that Thames Valley police officers could meet Muslim women who had not reported the hate crime they had been subjected to. It was a safe space for women to talk about their experiences. Reasons for not reporting hate crime varied from not having witnesses present to doubting they would be believed, and not trusting the police. Hate crime has to be tackled on a political level and through the criminal justice system, but it also has to be tackled by society at large. Racism continues to be normalised every day – we cannot let the same thing happen with hate crime. • Shaista Aziz is a journalist, writer, standup comedian and former aid worker"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2017/nov/04/sali-hughes-best-wedding-makeup-for-bride","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-04T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Beauty: the best makeup for brides on their big day | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/04/sali-hughes-best-wedding-makeup-for-bride","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/nov/04/sali-hughes-best-wedding-makeup-for-bride","fields":{"headline":"Beauty: the best makeup for brides on their big day","bodyText":"By the time this is published, I’ll have been married three weeks. During preparations, I was asked frequently which products I planned to use, the implication being that I’d try something new and exotic for the occasion. I understand why: one’s wedding is (ideally) once in a lifetime, the frock isn’t generally something you’d wear to the pub (though, in my case, it was), so I guess it follows that the makeup should be extraordinary. But I’m of the view that something familiar, tried, tested and stress-free is ideal on the big day. I wanted to look like myself, not some mythical “bride”, which is why, on my eyes, I wore a combination of smoky, cool brown shadows from my trusty Nars Narsisst palette (£39), and my Charlotte Tilbury The Classic Powder Pencil in Audrey (£16), a sludgy dark brown – and the very same one I wear to work every day. Likewise, my lipstick was the favourite I’ve worn on thousands of less exciting occasions: Tilbury’s Stoned Rose (£24) lined with her Pillow Talk Pencil (£16), because I know they work and won’t budge easily in a kiss. I was loth to use bronzer, because my new husband has barely ever seen me with a tan, and so makeup artist Mary Greenwell added a very pale brown contour with Kevyn Aucoin’s Sculpting Powder in Light (£36), then perked things up with Laura Mercier Second Skin Blush in Rose Petal (£21.50) and Hourglass’s Ambient Light Palette (£59). Superstition calls for “something new” and this was fulfilled by Ren’s new Perfect Canvas (£50). I was sceptical about this primer (it’s too expensive and has a matte finish, which I’d generally avoid), but the absence of silicone appealed. Silicone is used to smooth, fill lines and grip base makeup – in this instance Chanel’s Sublimage Foundation (£98) and Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage (£27) – but occasionally likes to peel off as fast as you’re applying it, and I felt risk-averse. This somehow mimics silicone’s good points without acquiring its faults, and gives a predictable, easy application and finish. The whole thing was finished off with lashings of Sensai 30 Degree Mascara (£23.43), which was excellent for reaching right down into the roots, lifting and building lashes, and didn’t smudge, run or shed the tiniest speck – even when, after eight hours of almost nonstop dancing, I wore it to bed.

Government intervention is back in vogue. Regulation with a capital R. After years of prolonged regulatory neglect, a new political narrative is being forged out of the overwhelming need to act. Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review has spotted it too. “Increasingly, what is animating federal politics is the need for the government to step in and correct market failures”, she wrote at the end of August. The shift has “crept on us so gradually that it has been barely perceptible,” she said. This widespread market failure is the inevitable result of decades of neoliberal politics. Both deregulation and bad regulation invariably fail and the Australian economy has too much of both. The change may have “crept up on us” but the collapse of the neoliberal orthodoxy has also been spectacular. Just four years ago, the Abbott government tried to remove a legal requirement for bank staff requiring them to act in the best interests of their customers. Earlier this year came the about-face. A new bank tax was levied and a banking executive accountability regime is being introduced. Decades of deregulation and the ensuing greed-fest have resulted in systemic abuses – of consumers, workers, retirees, migrants, students and the economically and socially disadvantaged. Monopolies and oligopolies now rule the roost in industries such as banking, insurance, accounting, supermarkets, energy, mining and telecommunications. The effects of rent-seeking by energy and mining companies have helped waste a decade. In a country with abundant energy sources including solar, gas and wind, Australians pay the highest power bills in the world. The financial services industry is riddled with deliberately opaque contracts and products. Under the guise of “consumer choice”, financialisation offers complex, highly profitable products of questionable value. Combine financialisation of products like superannuation or retirement homes with vulnerable people and carnage inevitably follows. The labour market is a mess. Existing workplace laws are no longer fit for purpose and are easily subverted by business structures that fragment and weaken the workforce. The regulator cannot cope with the unprecedented volume of wage theft cases. The victims are often low-paid students, migrants and unskilled older workers with little or no bargaining power. Nothing less than a complete overhaul of the laws is required. This situation is not altogether new or unique to Australia. In the early 20th century, president Theodore Roosevelt dismantled monopolies in the US through a combination of new laws and strong enforcement by regulators. For Australian politicians, the task of supervising and controlling the great corporations is daunting. Where to start? First, by acknowledging that free markets don’t exist. All businesses operate under some form of regulation. Companies are creatures of statute and the extent of their regulation is always a question of degree. Secondly, government intervention is an art form, not a science. It requires constant experimentation, dynamism and an acknowledgment that mistakes are inevitable. Facebook, Google and Apple all wield excessive market power, are subverting taxation regimes, undermining journalism and ruthlessly mining and trading in personal information. Regulators in Europe are starting to curb their excesses. Australia is years behind. Financial Times journalist, Rana Foroohar, is one of a growing chorus in arguing that “the Silicon Valley monopolies should be broken up, as every other natural monopoly, from railroads to telephones to utilities, was before.” Even Rupert Murdoch has joined the chorus. Lax corporate governance standards in Australia are also a reflection of the weakness of corporate regulators, who suffer from chronic under-funding and capture by the private sector. As corporations have become too large and powerful, regulators have eschewed strong enforcement action for fear of destabilising the market. If it is to succeed, the coming era of robust regulation will require a new breed of agressive, well-resourced watchdogs. The days of regulators issuing press releases approved by the companies that they are investigating and seconding staff from those companies are over. Senator Jacqui Lambie is leading the charge in pursuing new laws and a tough watchdog to regulate the burgeoning lobbying industry. A healthy democracy can’t exist if its political parties are awash with dark money. Australian politicians are yet to fully articulate or grasp the new narrative of regulation, but either they will get on board or it will run right over them.

While progress on Much Ado About Nothing would have been sluggish during the 11 days of the AFL trade period, in one corner of the room it is possible that a monkey may have blown through 600 words on the Bulldogs’ Jake Stringer, two second-round Essendon selections and pick 13 from West Coast. Although if there’s an analogy to be made about monkeys and the trade period it’s likely a scatological one given the amount of shit that gets picked up and tossed around. Each year it seems the raison d’être of the trade period is not player movement, but content. Prior to the 2pm Thursday deadline, hundreds of pages of innuendo, guesswork and repurposed player agent media releases had been exhausted, and 136 hours of AFL Trade Radio had been broadcast, where words wear caps with tiny propellers and transactions are celebrated rather than questioned. But now the dust has settled after a crazy 22 trades on the final day, the poetry of spit balling, speculation and clickbait is replaced with the prose of punditry – namely the winners and losers. Perhaps the most significant player to switch clubs was Carlton’s Bryce Gibbs, who will move to Adelaide following a year of speculation. Twelve months ago, when the prospect of a trade was first raised, the Crows’ list manager Justin Reid said, “it would have been irresponsible to give two first-round draft picks” for Gibbs. On Thursday morning, he succumbed to the moment’s potential, because the response to rejecting an A-Grade midfielder after losing a grand final would have been fundamentally more hostile than it had been the year before. In a complicated deal, Adelaide sent picks 10,16 and 73 across the border to Carlton, as well as swapping second-round picks in next year’s draft. Along with Gibbs, they get pick 77 in this year’s draft. In one of the last deals of the trade period, Adelaide bought their way back into the draft’s first round by agreeing to send Charlie Cameron to Brisbane for pick 12. Both Adelaide and Carlton are likely to benefit from the Gibbs trade. The 2006 No1 draft pick will have an immediate impact as part of a Crows midfield that was arguably the competition’s best, right up until the point where it really mattered. Over the past three years, Gibbs has perhaps come closest to realising his potential. For much of his career at Carlton, there was always a sense of something being held in reserve, but you sense at home in Adelaide that Gibbs’s best football is perhaps yet to be played. In return, Carlton now has three first-round draft picks to continue list manager-slash-saviour Stephen Silvagni’s extensive rebuild. Carlton also filled its midfield’s Gibbs-shaped hole with Giant Matthew Kennedy for pick 28 and Geelong’s Darcy Lang in a deal involving fourth-round picks. In perhaps its only misstep of the trade period, the club failed to understand the concept of a “salary dump” when taking on the contract of Port Adelaide’s back-up ruckman Matthew Lobbe, believed to be two years at about $500,000 a season. Usually a salary dump involves getting something in return for taking on an unfavourable contract. Instead, Carlton were like the weekenders who a buy a $12 punnet of strawberries at the farmgate, knowing neither the value of strawberries nor of $12. In addition to no longer being burdened by Lobbe’s salary, Port Adelaide has been able to bank nearly a million dollars of salary cap space – largely due to the salaries of Paddy Ryder and Angus Monfries being paid for by Essendon – as well as create a little more salary cap room by not affording their players an automatic pay increase in line with the recent AFL collective bargaining agreement. With money to burn, they splurged on Steven Motlop, Tom Rockliff and the oft maligned (or depending on your view, oft misunderstood) Jack Watts. While fools may rush in where wise men fear to tread, radio station SEN’s in-house pundit and self-proclaimed “list manager” went out on the longest of limbs by suggesting that having picked up three players that will be in their best 22, Port Adelaide will… improve. It is difficult to mount an argument to suggest Essendon will not improve, having also added three ready-made, best-22 players to their list without having to give away much in return. The Bombers swung Devon Smith, Adam Saad, and after an 11th-hour backdown from the Bulldogs, former All-Australian Jake Stringer for what was effectively pick 11, picks 25 and 30 and some future second and third-rounders. Then again, regarding Stringer, rarely do you need to pay full-retail for a soiled mattress advertised on someone’s front lawn, regardless of its credentials. Still it is a relatively low-risk, high-reward play for the Bombers, largely dependent on Stringer sorting out his life off the field. Luke Hodge found further opportunities – two years of them – in Brisbane, after what effectively was a good will gesture by Hawthorn. The benefit of having the former Hawks captain at the Gabba extends beyond his ability off a half-back-flank and to providing the young Lions with an ideal mentor as he transitions into a coaching role. News from down the Pacific Motorway was not quite as positive. While the Gold Coast Suns did as well as they could have from the enviable situation of Gary Ablett Junior wanting to return home (trading up from 24 to 19 in this year’s draft and effectively swapping a 2018 fourth-round pick for a second-round one), they lost their mind in a two-and-a-half-minutes to midnight move, giving away pick 2 – pick 2! – for Fremantle’s Lachie Weller. It was a move that outdid all the inanity, absurdity and nonsense of the previous 10 days. It’s hard to imagine any number of monkeys coming up with something so remarkable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/19/labor-states-wont-solve-pms-political-problems-on-energy-weatherill-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T03:38:11Z","webTitle":"Labor states won't solve PM's ‘political problems’ on energy, Weatherill says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/labor-states-wont-solve-pms-political-problems-on-energy-weatherill-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/19/labor-states-wont-solve-pms-political-problems-on-energy-weatherill-says","fields":{"headline":"Labor states won't solve PM's ‘political problems’ on energy, Weatherill says","bodyText":"The South Australian premier says Labor states will not accept a national energy policy that cuts renewable energy targets, removes incentives for low-emissions technologies and promotes coal. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Jay Weatherill said the Labor states had no interest in “solving Malcolm Turnbull’s political problems” – and said the expectation of the premiers was that Bill Shorten would hold firm in opposing the national energy guarantee outlined by the prime minister on Tuesday. Weatherill said he had spoken with all the Labor premiers over the past few days and with his federal Labor colleagues. The Labor opposition in Canberra is maintaining an open mind on the new energy policy. Weatherill said his advice to Shorten had been “just maintain the present position, which is opposition to watering down renewable energy targets, watering down of incentives for renewable projects and reject the promotion of coal over the technologies of the future”. Weatherill said he was confident “Labor’s position will remain as it is” and he issued a warning “the political history is littered with Labor leaders who have backed down on renewable energy”. “Bill has always had a very strong position on this and I’m sure he’ll maintain it,” he said. The national energy guarantee unveiled by the Turnbull government this week imposes new reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers after 2020. The policy model relies on cooperation with state governments. The Energy Security Board’s proposal, adopted by the government, says the new reliability and emissions reduction obligations to be imposed on electricity retailers after 2020 should be implemented through the Council of Australian Governments’ energy council. “Under this option existing national energy market arrangements including the Australian energy market agreement would be amended to introduce a new law, implemented by South Australia and applied in each of the other jurisdictions, similar to the national electricity law,” the advice from the ESB says. Weatherill said that if Turnbull was serious about getting an outcome, he would have included the states in the process, as they were included in the Finkel review of the national electricity market earlier this year. The premier said any prime minister serious about getting an outcome would have presented state leaders with a detailed plan and all the modelling associated with it “rather than boxing them into a corner with some sort of fait accompli”. He said Turnbull had lined up energy regulators who were supposed to work with state governments for a “media stunt, and they all rattle off earnestly how important it is that we have to reach agreement – and he doesn’t speak to the people who he actually expects to legislate it”. “That’s a novel way of approaching an issue.” Weatherill declared Turnbull was “manifestly holding a losing hand”. “The community wants a strong renewable energy target,” the premier said. “The community wants incentives for renewable energy. The community wants the technologies of the future, not a return to coal. “He’s holding all the wrong hand and he wants the Labor states to get him off the hook. “Well, we are not going to cooperate in a scheme that doesn’t continue all those objectives: solid renewable energy targets, incentives for renewable energy and a move away from the technologies of the past.” Federally, some Labor figures are attracted to the national energy guarantee model, believing it to be a regulated carbon price, but the ALP is unlikely to race to a decision. Labor federally will also be influenced by the attitudes of premiers, cognisant of the fact a number of the incumbents, including Weatherill, are facing elections in their states. Shorten told reporters in Canberra on Thursday that Labor was looking at the government proposal but “we are deeply concerned and fearful that Turnbull is giving away the Australian renewable energy industry in return for a possible 50c a week reduction in power bills”. “This is a plan with no detail, it is a headline with no story,” Shorten said. “They have sort of declared mission accomplished but they have no detailed modelling.” At a breakfast briefing for business leaders, Turnbull said the government was looking to the opposition to get behind the plan and achieve peace in the climate wars. Asked what he would do if the premiers refused to cooperate with his plan, Turnbull said: “Let’s focus on getting them to say yes.” Weatherill acknowledged that a level of fatigue had crept into the energy debate. “Everybody is gasping for breath now and saying can we stop fighting and can we just end the uncertainty? “That’s code for we are all fatigued because Tony Abbott has brought us to a standstill and we now have to surrender to him.” But Weatherill said he had no intention of “hauling up the white flag” for Abbott and he said key players in the energy sector would also express concerns about the plan as the dust began to settle. He said while there was a great desire for certainty, the national energy guarantee was a “false certainty” because it would not allow Australia to meet its Paris targets. Weatherill said if the national energy guarantee settled nothing, the investment climate would remain uncertain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/19/australias-unemployment-rate-falls-to-four-year-low-of-55","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T04:35:51Z","webTitle":"Australia’s unemployment rate falls to four-year low of 5.5%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/19/australias-unemployment-rate-falls-to-four-year-low-of-55","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/19/australias-unemployment-rate-falls-to-four-year-low-of-55","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s unemployment rate falls to four-year low of 5.5%","bodyText":"Australia’s unemployment rate has fallen to a four-year low, with the labour market recording 12 straight months of employment gains – its longest stretch since 1994. Figures show the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% in September, its lowest rate since March 2013, as the government’s National Disability Insurance Scheme contributes to a surge in health jobs and Western Australia continues to recover from the downturn in mining construction, adding 48,000 jobs over the last year. Some economists say the Reserve Bank may have to lift rates in early 2018, such is the expectation for jobs growth. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said businesses were reporting a sharp jump in their concerns about being able to find “suitable labour”, which is a sign that the labour market is tightening and wages may finally start facing modest upward pressure over the next 12 months. “With an improving labour market, inflation past its trough and growth expected to pick up, we see a cash rate hike in early 2018,” he said. Bureau of Statistics figures show the unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in September, from 5.6% in August, in seasonally adjusted terms. However, the ABS is putting special emphasis on the “trend” figures this month, because the trend figures smooth the more volatile seasonally adjusted estimates and provide the best measure of the underlying behaviour of the labour market. Trend figures show the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low last month, with full-time positions jumping by 16,000 people and part-time positions rising by 8,000 people. Over the past year, trend employment has increased by 2.8%, which is above the average year-on-year growth over the past 20 years (1.9%). The states with the strongest annual growth in trend employment over the last year are Queensland (4.1%), Tasmania (3.9%), Victoria (3.1%) and Western Australia (2.9%). “The trend unemployment rate had been hovering in the range of 5.6% to 5.8% for almost two years but has now dropped to a four-year low of 5.5%,” Bruce Hockman, the chief economist for the ABS, said on Thursday. “Full-time employment has now increased by around 271,000 persons since September 2016 and makes up the majority of the 335,000-person net increase in employment over the period.” Economists say the seasonally adjusted figures, despite being more volatile than trend figures, also show unemployment has fallen to a new cycle low, with the unemployment rate slipping to 5.5% in September, down from 5.6%. Full-time employment rose by 6,100 last month, in seasonally adjusted terms, while part-time employment grew by 13,700. “We expect to see at least another 250,000 jobs added over the coming year,” CBA senior economist Michael Workman said. “The unemployment rate, now at 5.5%, is forecast to move closer to the 5% level.” The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, welcomed the employment figures, saying they proved the Coalition’s policies were pro-growth. “Since the government came to office in September 2013, 825,500 jobs have been created – an average of over 200,000 new jobs each year”, she said. “While ABS labour force figures can jump around from month to month, this is the 12th consecutive month where there has been an increase in jobs”. But the shadow employment minister, Brendan O’Connor, said the ABS figures also showed there were persistent underlying challenges in the labour market, including underemployment and low wages growth. “While Labor welcomes the overall increase in jobs for the month of September, we note that there are 711,500 unemployed Australians, with 20,300 more people lining the unemployment queue than when the government was elected,” he said. Economists said big services sectors such as health, education, retail, accommodation/tourism and transport had added nearly 400,000 new jobs over the past year. “Given the trends in household and government spending, the health sector is set to continue expanding, towards about 15% of the workforce in the next few years,” Workman said. “The federal government’s NDIS is forecast to add a total of 160,000 full-time equivalent jobs to the workforce over the next few years. We believe that it is already having a significant impact on health sector jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/19/paul-keating-says-assisted-dying-unacceptable-as-victoria-debates-law","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T05:30:45Z","webTitle":"Paul Keating says assisted dying 'unacceptable' as Victoria debates law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/19/paul-keating-says-assisted-dying-unacceptable-as-victoria-debates-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/19/paul-keating-says-assisted-dying-unacceptable-as-victoria-debates-law","fields":{"headline":"Paul Keating says assisted dying 'unacceptable' as Victoria debates law","bodyText":"The parliamentary debate on Victoria’s proposed voluntary assisted dying legislation has run into its third day, with questions raised by MPs about how residents from other jurisdictions will be prevented from travelling to access the law if it passes. The marathon debate continued as the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating made a dramatic intervention, telling Fairfax Media that passing the laws would be a mistake. Voluntary assisted dying would be “an unacceptable departure in our approach to human existence … and what it means to be human”, Keating, a Catholic, said. The debate has divided former Labor prime ministers, with Bob Hawke saying last year it was “absurd” Australia did not have voluntary assisted dying in place. The debate in Victorian parliament on Thursday focused on who would have access to the scheme. Under the proposed law, a person must be an adult and an Australian citizen or permanent resident and must also ordinarily reside in Victoria. The health minister, Jill Hennessy, who is driving the bill, said the bill was only for Victorians and would not encourage so-called “euthanasia tourism”. But the parameters around what “ordinarily reside” means are unclear, including how long someone would need to have been living in Victoria or what documents they would need to produce – for example, proof of electoral enrolment or a Victorian driver’s licence. The Liberal MP Kim Wells pressed Hennessy on the issue, asking, “How do we restrict this legislation to only those living in Victoria and who are Victorians? … So we don’t have a situation where there are numerous people coming in from other states.” Her Liberal colleague Robert Clark expressed a similar concern: “We certainly don’t want Victoria to be the suicide capital of the nation.” Hennessy said it would be up to the two doctors involved in the process to decide if someone was a Victorian resident. She said a voluntary assisted dying review board would be set up and would provide information to doctors regarding patient’s residency. Under the proposed legislation the board would review every case of assisted dying, as well as a series of new criminal offences for anyone – including health practitioners – who did not follow the guidelines and safeguards. If there were any uncertainties around residency, the matter would be referred to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to resolve, Hennessy said. Four people died under the Northern Territory’s short-lived Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which was overturned by the federal government in 1997. The act did not require that patient be a resident of the Territory and two of the patients moved to the Territory in order to die. On Thursday Victoria’s lower house began debating some of the more than 100 proposed amendments to the legislation. Hennessy and the premier, Daniel Andrews, said they would not countenance amendments, though MPs have a conscience vote on the bill and the attorney general, Martin Pakula, told the House there was “no predetermined view” on amendments. The Liberal MP Ryan Smith has proposed replacing every mention of “voluntary assisted dying substance” with the word “poison”. An amendment proposed by Clark would have seen lethal medication removed from any patient whose application to access voluntary assisted dying was challenged in Vcat. It was narrowly defeated 41 to 40. Hennessy told the parliament that Vcat already had powers to order a patient return the medication, which would be required to be kept in a locked box. Clark described the bill as proposing “disgraceful implementation” of the scheme. Cases of people suffering harrowing deaths cited by politicians in support of voluntary assisted dying reflected a failure of palliative care rather than a need for the legislation. The parliament also began going through all 141 clauses of the bill on Thursday. The debate may continue until the early hours of Friday morning. If it passes the lower house, it is expected to go to the upper house in a fortnight, where supporters say it has more support. The debate continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/19/big-pharma-money-lobbying-us-opioid-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"How big pharma's money – and its politicians – feed the US opioid crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/big-pharma-money-lobbying-us-opioid-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/19/big-pharma-money-lobbying-us-opioid-crisis","fields":{"headline":"How big pharma's money – and its politicians – feed the US opioid crisis","bodyText":"Donald Trump was not wrong. Hours before his nominee for “drug czar” withdrew from consideration over his part in a law limiting the Drug Enforcement Administration’s ability to crack down on pharmaceutical distributors feeding the US’s opioid epidemic, the president took a shot at the influence of drug companies over Congress. “They contribute massive amounts of money to political people,” he said, standing next to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. “I don’t know, Mitch, maybe even to you,” he added. Trump was right on both counts. Pharmaceutical companies spend far more than any other industry to influence politicians. Drugmakers have poured close to $2.5bn into lobbying and funding members of Congress over the past decade. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone to McConnell – although he is hardly alone. Nine out of 10 members of the House of Representatives and all but three of the US’s 100 senators have taken campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies seeking to affect legislation on everything from the cost of drugs to how new medicines are approved. Trump’s nominee for drug czar, the US congressman Tom Marino, was forced to withdraw after a report by the Washington Post and CBS’s 60 Minutes highlighted his role in forging legislation that hinders the DEA’s ability to move against drug distributors or pharmacies recklessly dispensing the opioid painkillers at the heart of the epidemic, which claims more than 100 lives a day. Marino’s acceptance of substantial donations from those same companies compromised his nomination to head the federal agency charged with tackling the opioid crisis. But for Congress, the process was nothing unusual. Hundreds of millions of dollars flow to lobbyists and politicians on Capitol Hill each year to shape laws and policies that keep drug company profits growing. The pharmaceutical industry, which has about two lobbyists for every member of Congress, spent $152m on influencing legislation in 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Drug companies also contributed more than $20m directly to political campaigns last year. About 60% went to Republicans. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, was the single largest beneficiary, with donations from the industry totaling $228,670. The impact of so much drug company money coursing through the veins of Congress is often incremental or largely unseen by the American public, such as the industry’s efforts to block competitors in India from making generic versions of HIV/Aids medicines that are more affordable to developing countries. But on occasion it has a hugely visible impact. In his comments alongside McConnell, Trump was vocal in his criticism of what he said were pharmaceutical manufacturers “getting away with murder” by charging much higher prices in the US than other countries. That is the result of a 2003 law, in effect written by the industry, preventing the federal government from seeking bids for the manufacture of drugs and medical devices – a process used in other areas, such as defence spending. Instead, the pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever price they want for drugs bought for the publicly run Medicare and Medicaid programmes – and the federal government has no choice but to pay up. Meanwhile, the drug companies say that to allow foreign imports would endanger the quality and safety of medicines in the US. But that justification has been widely scorned in the face of escalating and sometimes opportunistic pricing, such as the surge in the price of EpiPen antidotes to allergic reactions last year, to $600. Britain’s National Health Service negotiated a price of about $70 for the same product. Scores of attempts by some members of Congress to introduce legislation to bring down the price of prescription medicines or to let people buy them from Canada, where they are often cheaper, have failed to make it out of committee. While lobbying shapes medical policy across the board, it has had a profound impact on the opioid epidemic as deaths quadrupled between 1999 and 2015. The pharmaceutical industry poured resources into attempting to place blame for the crisis on the millions who have became addicted instead of on the mass prescribing of powerful opioids. The relatively small number of members of Congress who led the charge against the epidemic years before it became a significant political issue have struggled to push through legislation. Representatives Hal Rogers and Mary Bono saw repeated efforts to pass laws curbing the mass prescribing of opioid painkillers fail amid concerted campaigns by the drug makers. Rogers and Bono founded the Congressional Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse in 2010 and proposed several pieces of legislation over a number of years. Bono, who was alerted to the opioid crisis after Chesare, her son with the late singer Sonny Bono, became addicted, said there was a false but effective campaign by companies profiting from the epidemic to portray any attempt to rein in the mass prescribing of painkillers as depriving millions of people of legitimate treatment for chronic pain. “We were getting tremendous pushback from the industry. It was a massive, well-organised effort,” she said. “Of course we felt it, maybe indirectly at times. We didn’t have an awful lot of people lining up to help us.” Some of the pressure came through industry-funded groups such as the Pain Care Forum, which spent $740m over a decade lobbying in Washington and state legislatures against limits on opioid prescribing and similar issues, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Among those who received political contributions from the group were Senator Orrin Hatch, who took $360,00. The senator introduced legislation intended to head off one of the bills put forward by Rogers and Bono by proposing a federal study of pain treatment. Hatch, who is running for Senate again in 2018 even though he previously said he would not, is the recipient of the most political donations from the pharmaceutical industry so far this year, at $208,000. Bono said the American Medical Association was instrumental in blocking another law, the Ryan Creedon act, to require doctors to get training on the risks of opioids. The AMA objected to it as a burden on physicians. Drug companies gave more than $200,000 in campaign contributions to Jason Chaffetz (who recently left Congress), acting as the single largest donor to his re-election fights. Chaffetz, as chair of the committee on oversight and government reform, led an effort against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce opioid prescribing by recommending that doctors first seek alternative treatments for chronic pain. Lobbying by the wider healthcare industry also had an important impact on the shape of Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act (ACA), widely known as Obamacare. The chair of the committee drafting the ACA legislation, Senator Max Baucus, was at the time the single largest recipient of health industry political donations, with $1.5m given to his political fund over the previous year. Baucus led votes in the committee against the inclusion in the legislation of public insurance strongly opposed by private insurers who saw a threat to its profits. Baucus was known within the health industry for annual fly-fishing and golfing weekends in his home state of Montana that lobbyists paid handsomely to attend. Other members of the committee received hundreds of thousands of dollars, including Senator Pat Roberts, who at one point tried to hold up the bill by claiming lobbyists needed three days to read it. The drafting of large parts of the ACA was done by a former vice-president of a major health insurer, Wellpoint. In his attack on drug company money in American politics, Trump failed to mention that the companies were among the leading donors to his inauguration alongside tobacco and oil companies. Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, was the largest pharmaceutical donor, giving $1m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/18/military-widow-cry-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T19:40:11Z","webTitle":"Making a military widow cry: that is a classic Trump move | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/military-widow-cry-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/military-widow-cry-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Making a military widow cry: that is a classic Trump move","bodyText":"Just when you thought there was nothing left to destroy – no more rules or taboos to break – Donald Trump proved you wrong. After nine long months of bumping along the bottom, our preening president has taken the presidency to a new all-time low. This week the commander-in-chief has somehow contrived to drive to tears the grieving mother of one of his own special forces. Along the way, he boasted about his own outreach to gold star families, and defamed his predecessors’ record on the same. All the while he shows no sympathy or urgency about millions of his own citizens struggling for several weeks without food, water and power in Puerto Rico. Hugging people doesn’t take much skill or sensibility; just a touch of humanity. A real populist finds this kind of thing quite easy. If you want to be loved by the people, it’s a good idea to show a little love to the people in their hour of need. It worked for Evita Peron, Fidel Castro and even the ice-cold British royal family. George W Bush may have invaded Iraq in America’s worst national security disaster since Vietnam. But he spent many hours visiting with his wounded warriors and grieving families. Barack Obama may have called the same Iraq war stupid and suffered a fractious relationship with the top brass. But he continued the long-standing presidential tradition of investing his time and emotion with the troops and their families. Not so much Donald Trump. According to the mother of Sergeant La David Johnson, one of four US soldiers killed in action in Niger, Trump managed to “disrespect” her son and his widow, forgot his name, and told them he “knew what he signed up for.” This charming conversation took place while the family was traveling to the airport to receive the body of their beloved son and husband, leaving Johnson’s widow Myeshia in tears. Naturally Trump has turned his multiple blunders into a political fistfight. He has blamed a Democratic representative traveling with the Johnsons for fabricating the account, telling reporters: “I had a very nice conversation with the woman, the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.” The sad thing is he probably thought he was being nice. The even sadder thing is that he still can’t be bothered to remember their names. You can’t screw things up this spectacularly by chance or human error. It takes a lifetime of effort and habit to be this incompetent, unfeeling and self-defeating. This is a determined effort to distance himself from his fellow Americans, and it is succeeding rather well. It may just be the most successful thing Trump has ever done, even if the rest of humanity considers it an abject failure. Like all bad habits, it follows a pattern. Trump was remarkably silent about the deaths in Niger, even though he and his fellow Republicans couldn’t stop talking about the US lives lost in the ambush in Benghazi in 2012. When he came under fire for not calling the relatives of the fallen soldiers, Trump said he had written letters which had not yet been mailed. The US Postal Service is obviously not what it used to be. When that bumbling excuse fell flat, he claimed Obama failed to call gold star families, including his own chief of staff, John Kelly, whose son died in Afghanistan. This claim has been forcefully rejected by Obama’s aides, while Kelly’s associates can recall no such thing. This kind of behavior might be normal among middle school students whose hormones interfere with their ability to finish their homework on time. Explaining Trump’s actions is altogether more unsettling. You can’t say there were no warning signs of this kind of weirdness. Trump lashed out at the gold star family of Humayun Khan who died in Iraq in 2004, when they attacked his Muslim travel ban. Naturally Trump went after Khan’s mother for no good reason, claiming she was forbidden from talking. Launching a personal attack on an emotionally vulnerable citizen without any foundation in fact: the signature Trump move. Then again, he recently mocked the Spanish accent of the US citizens in Puerto Rico, threw paper towels into a San Juan crowd like he was shooting hoops, and threatened to pull out his own government support from the US territory. You don’t get much more vulnerable than a population struggling to survive with no power, clean water, cooked food, or economy for several weeks. Most people aspire to the presidency to lead a nation, if not the world. The presidential pedestal puts them in the history books as the head of state of the world’s most powerful nation. Rising above politics as head of state is the best part of the job, and the commander-in-chief role – never mind the comforter-in-chief – is immune from petty politics. Unless you’re Donald Trump. Instead of leading a nation and the world, he seems determined to divide a nation and the world. Instead of standing on a pedestal, he clambers down into the gutter of Twitter where he can indulge in the pettiest form of politics. In the case of the gold star families, a phone call from the president is not just a phone call from a president. It’s a phone call from a whole country. That may be the biggest failure of all for Donald Trump. Senator John McCain, who knows a thing or two about national service, likes to say there is nothing more noble than serving a cause greater than self. Clearly that is a concept that is too big (or too grown-up) for this president, who can think of no cause greater than himself. • This article was amended on 8 November 2017.

The older people shared a can of halva to maintain their level of blood sugar. The flames of the candles flickered with the breeze that came in through a hole created by shell damage to the house, and making out the details on the faces around me was difficult. There wasn’t enough food for everyone owing to the sudden late arrival of some families driven out of their homes by Islamic State because the battles with the Syrian Democratic Forces had drawn closer to their street. In one corner of the room sat a man and his wife and their four small children. They were among the new arrivals. The man refused to eat and said he wasn’t hungry, a response that baffled everyone, for how could a man not be hungry in Raqqa? We insisted that he join us but he refused, although his wife joined us so she could feed their children. Her eyes were swollen from continuous weeping – which was not strange, because the women and children always cried. After dinner we went and sat near him to try to get him to join the conversation, but his responses were always short, and he did not want to talk. His dialect indicated that he was not from Raqqa itself, and one of the families said the family had been displaced from another Syrian city. The conversation moved to the military developments and where the battle lines had reached, and the number of families that had been able to flee. That was when he began to weep. His wife sat next to him and caressed his head, saying: “Whatever God has preordained will happen.” Everyone was silent, looking at him, waiting to hear his story. Then the wife began, explaining that they had been waiting for a chance to get out of Raqqa in order to treat their sick son, who she said might need surgery. Her husband interrupted her and began talking, describing the day before the SDF reached their neighbourhood and how he had planned to get out of this hell to take his son for treatment. Someone asked him why he hadn’t just taken the risk and fled, like many other families, since his son’s life depended on it. He said he could not subject all of his children to danger just to save one of them, and that anyway he was unable to carry all the children and run with them from snipers and shells. He wept profusely as he said these words. People tried to comfort him, but he kept shaking his head as if to say words were hopeless. I sat by him and reminded him gently that he still had his strength – that he could carry two of his children, his wife could carry one, and I could carry the fourth, then we could all run and get out of here. He looked at me in astonishment, asking me if I was joking or serious. That was my last, brief moment to back out of my decision, but the tears in his eyes were enough to convince me. I answered that I wasn’t joking, and that I could help carry his children, and that I knew the streets here well. Until that moment, I had had no intention of leaving Raqqa. The man was very excited, to the point of asking that we leave immediately. I told him we would have to wait: it was night, and impossible to see anything ahead of us. We might get shot once we reached the area controlled by the SDF if we were mistaken for Isis members in the darkness. We had to wait until a little before sunrise, and then we would move. I went to the house where I was living, and destroyed the internet device and my computer, burying them underground. I was worried for the families still remaining, in case Isis raided the house and found the devices and punished them. We took off half an hour before sunrise, walking between destroyed homes and sometimes hiding inside when we heard gunfire. We had to walk roughly 1,500 metres before we reached a safe area. My big fear was of stepping on a landmine that would blow us all up. The child was hugging me, I felt his quickened breath on my neck. I whispered that he should not be afraid, that we would arrive soon, and he smiled and nodded. There were just two streets left between us and the safe zone when Isis snipers began targeting us. We didn’t know where the shots were coming from, so we bent over and began running. We hid for a while in the rubble of a destroyed building. I asked the father to put down his children and walk out slowly to signal to the SDF that we were civilians so they didn’t fire in our direction. The SDF fired in the air to indicate to us that we should hurry. The Isis sniper kept firing towards us but the bullets hit the ground. The child pulled on my hair. I ran faster until we made it to a house that SDF fighters were occupying, and we exited from the back. When we got to the SDF-controlled area, some fighters gave us food and water and asked if anybody was wounded. The father told them his son was sick, and one said a Kurdish Red Crescent doctor would see him. I was told to prepare myself to go to a camp for those displaced from Raqqa. I stayed in the camp for a week. Conditions were bad, but better than life inside the so-called capital of the Isis caliphate. Now I am waiting for my family to join me near Aleppo, and we hope to go to Turkey. The situation remains volatile inside Raqqa, with Kurdish-led fighters still clearing militants and landmines. So I will follow news of the city from afar for now. After vowing that I would stay until the fall of Raqqa, I feel sadness at missing the moment when the black flags were taken down and the hated Isis were driven out. But not when I remember that family I left with, and that struggling child, who at least now has some chance of a better future. • Tim Ramadan is the pseudonym of a Syrian journalist based in Raqqa"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/18/jeff-sessions-russia-senate-shifts-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T18:54:15Z","webTitle":"Jeff Sessions shifts ground on Russia contacts under Senate questioning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/jeff-sessions-russia-senate-shifts-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/jeff-sessions-russia-senate-shifts-ground","fields":{"headline":"Jeff Sessions shifts ground on Russia contacts under Senate questioning","bodyText":"The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has given a new account of his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 election, conceding it was possible that they had discussed Donald Trump’s policy positions. Under intense questioning by the Senate judiciary committee, Sessions departed from his previous blanket denials about contacts with Russian officials, saying he did “not recall” elements of the conversations in three meetings in 2016 with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and conceded for the first time that substantive issues may have been discussed. In a series of testy exchanges with Democratic senators, the attorney general also amended his previous insistence that he had no Russian contacts. This time, he said: “I did not have a continuing exchange of information” with Russians. Sessions said he was not aware of any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Kremlin in efforts to influence the election, the subject of a special counsel investigation and several congressional inquiries. However, he said he had not been informed about a meeting on 9 June 2016, between the president’s son, son-in-law and campaign manager with a Russian lawyer offering damaging material about Hillary Clinton. The attorney general said he had only read about it “in the papers” and not paid much attention. Sessions has formally recused himself from issues related to the Russia investigation, a decision which angered the president, but he was interrogated on Wednesday on how rigorously he had observed his recusal. The attorney general is in a potentially perilous situation as lying to Congress is a felony and his previous testimony could form part of an investigation into obstruction of justice by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Sessions said he had not been interviewed by Mueller but he was tentative and hesitant in his answers on his contacts with Mueller’s team, leaving open the possibility that he had been asked for an interview. Sessions, who had helped run Trump’s campaign, declared at his Senate confirmation hearing in January: “I didn’t have communications with the Russians.” It later emerged that he had met Kislyak at a campaign event at a Washington hotel in April 2016, then at the Republican national convention in July and in his Senate office in September last year. In March this year, after reports of those meetings surfaced, he said he did “not recall” conversations with Kislyak or other Russian officials “regarding the political campaign”. However, in July, the Washington Post reported US intelligence intercepts of Kislyak’s accounts of the conversation to his superiors in Moscow that indicated that they had discussed campaign and policy issues. The Democratic senator Patrick Leahy asked Sessions whether he had talked with Kislyak about policies or positions of the Trump campaign or future presidency. “I’m not sure about that,” the attorney general replied. “I met with the Russian ambassador after I made a speech at the Republican convention … We had an encounter there and he asked for an appointment in my office later. I met with 26 ambassadors in the last year and he was one of them.” “He came into my office with two of my senior defence specialists and met with me for a while,” Sessions went on. “I don’t think there was any discussion about the details of the campaign. It could have been at that meeting in my office or at the convention that some comment was made about what Trump’s positions were. I think that’s possible.” Asked if he had discussions with Russian officials about “emails”, an apparent reference to Democratic party emails hacked by Russia (according to US intelligence) and published by the WikiLeaks group, Sessions replied: “I do not recall any such thing.” Moments earlier, Leahy had asked Sessions: “You’re our nation’s top lawyer. Is there a difference between responding ‘no’ and ‘I do not recall’? Is that legally significant?” Sessions agreed there was a significant difference. “The attorney general got himself into deeper water in his answers to Senator Leahy,” said Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor and co-editor of the Just Security website. “Sessions’ response to Leahy effectively amounts to an admission that he was either not truthful in his written replies during his confirmation hearing when he said emphatically that he did not have certain conversations with the Russians or else he was not truthful in his later testimony when he said he could not recall the content of these conversations.” “Also Sessions now admits he may have discussed candidate Trump’s positions with the Russians during the elections, which directly contradicts what Sessions said in his statement in March,” Goodman added. “Sessions’ testimony appears to be an admission that the Washington Post report got it right, that he had indeed discussed campaign matters with the Russian ambassador.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/18/eric-holder-trump-administration-crime-dangerous-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T18:12:27Z","webTitle":"Eric Holder calls Trump administration's crime policies dangerous and dispiriting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/eric-holder-trump-administration-crime-dangerous-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/eric-holder-trump-administration-crime-dangerous-policies","fields":{"headline":"Eric Holder calls Trump administration's crime policies dangerous and dispiriting","bodyText":"Donald Trump is pursuing “dangerous” policies on crime that ignore a growing bipartisan consensus on criminal justice reform, former attorney general Eric Holder said on Wednesday at a summit in Washington. Holder, the US’s first black attorney general, joined police chiefs, elected officials and other advocates at the National Law Enforcement Summit on Crime in pressing Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on recent actions by the administration that have amounted to a return to the tough-on-crime tactics of the 1990s. “They are not tough on crime, they are not smart on crime,” Holder said. The Trump administration’s decision to reinstate policies such as mandatory minimums for non-violent drug crimes, he added, was “disappointing, dispiriting and ultimately dangerous”. “This administration has revealed their lack of judgment,” Holder said, “[that] will take this nation back to a discredited past.” With Sessions at its helm, the justice department has taken several steps to roll back Obama-era initiatives that were designed to address racial bias in the criminal justice system. In May, the attorney general announced a new directive that encouraged stricter mandatory minimum sentences by ordering federal prosecutors to “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense”. Sessions also rescinded an order from Barack Obama that directed the justice department to reduce the use of private prisons. The Obama administration had sought to phase out private prisons, arguing at the time that the facilities were less safe and more costly. Other reversals under the Trump administration have included lifting Obama-era restrictions on providing police departments with military gear, the use of which drew widespread criticism during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer. Law enforcement officials have also been provided with renewed authority to seize assets from suspects even if they have not been convicted of a crime, marking a return to controversial civil forfeiture policies that have been banned in some states. Holder said such moves were “ideologically motivated”, while framing the moment as a flashpoint in the debate over criminal justice reform and racial profiling. “I believe our country is at a crossroads,” Holder said. “We run the risk of igniting another drug war that will fill our jails.” The former attorney general’s views were echoed by conservatives at the event, such as Mark Holden, the senior vice-president and general counsel of Koch Industries. The billionaire Koch brothers, who remain Republican mega-donors, have been vocal proponents of criminal justice and policing reform. On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have similarly forged rare collaborations on legislation that would lower mandatory minimums for low-level drug crimes, promote community policing and target recidivism by investing in education and re-entry programs for former offenders. While Holden held back from openly criticizing the Trump administration, he reinforced the message that what was being done away with were bipartisan priorities. “We are hopeful the administration will listen,” he said. “It’s a moral case, it’s a constitutional case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/22/unrest-review-bracingly-inventive-and-moving-documentary-me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-jennifer-brea","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Unrest review – bracingly inventive and moving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/unrest-review-bracingly-inventive-and-moving-documentary-me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-jennifer-brea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/22/unrest-review-bracingly-inventive-and-moving-documentary-me-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-jennifer-brea","fields":{"headline":"Unrest review – bracingly inventive and moving","bodyText":"Intended as an activist text, Jennifer Brea’s bracingly inventive and moving documentary chronicles her often debilitating struggle with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome.

The last few weeks in Belfast offer a less hyperbolic indication of what might befall the UK after Brexit. The announcement that Bombardier’s C-Series jets would be subject to a 300% import tax in the US (up from the eye-watering 220% duty already imposed by America’s department of commerce), looked set to collapse a sizeable chunk of the Canadian company’s Belfast operations, costing 1,000 jobs in the city. This put justified pressure on Theresa May to make use of the special relationship she sought to cultivate on her trip to Washington earlier this year, and show off the trade clout that the electorate has been told will result in the UK becoming a global trader outside the European customs union. Last month the government told journalists that it was “quietly confident” the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing would lose its anti-trust case in the US against its Canadian rival, and that the high tariff would be dropped. The rationale was that despite Boeing’s complaints that Bombardier’s jets were unfairly subsidised and dumped in the American market at below cost, imposing such strict import taxes would unfairly strain trade relations between Canada and the US. Instead, Bombardier lost, leaving May hitting out at the US with no impact whatsoever and thousands of workers in Belfast in limbo. The firm is crucial to the city’s economy, employing 4,000 workers, of whom a quarter build the wings of the single-aisle jet – the section of the Belfast operation threatened. A sudden loss of jobs with no similar manufacturer able to take on that number of employees would be a huge blow. So the intervention of Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, appears to be a work of genius. Airbus has negotiated a majority 50.1% stake in Bombardier’s C-series jet programme without having to pay anything for it. In doing so, the 300% import duty can be neatly sidestepped because the final stage of the construction of jets destined for the US market will take place in Alabama, rather than Belfast. In doing so, Airbus will not be importing completed planes but parts, bringing sorely needed jobs to a Republican state – a move that is unlikely to annoy US politicians. If Airbus’s legal advice is firm, and the deal passes muster with the US government, it will have snatched the much-delayed C-Series from the abyss and hopefully secured a thousand jobs. But while the US and Boeing are clearly the Goliaths in this parable, May cannot cast herself as the bold and canny David. For all the Conservatives’ insistence that Britain and Northern Ireland will be “open for business”, it was clear that the prime minister had no clout with Trump and Congress – yielding not a deal but only stern and plaintive public pronouncements on the import tax being a travesty. Instead, Airbus has succeeded in outsmarting the larger Boeing. So as we near the Brexit deadline, a pan-European project has come to the rescue of UK jobs. Boeing’s hardline protectionism means it has stumbled into a trap, with its European rival able to snap up a huge chunk of Bombardier for free, hurting Boeing in the process. The irony of Europeans coming to the rescue after British ineffectiveness will have stung May deeply. But Bombardier’s nightmare may still not be over: it is difficult to predict how exports will fare outside the customs union and single market, and how Europe, Canada and the UK will work together to keep the plant operational and solvent post-Brexit. Leaving the EU could affect Northern Ireland-based companies more harshly than those in any other part of the UK. The most difficult question raised by Brexit in Northern Ireland – that is, what will happen to the Irish border – has still not been answered. The Democratic Unionist party has unequivocally said that it will reject special status for the north, while Sinn Féin opposes any return to the hard border that preceded the Good Friday Agreement. Repeated questions put to the government – will it lead to a semi-militarised border? Will the border end up being the Irish Sea? – haven’t yet been answered. On BBC’s Question Time from Belfast last week, former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers flippantly dismissed the border question, quipping that there had been a border for two decades with no problems, steadfastly ignoring the fact that the entirety of Ireland is within the European Union at present, but won’t be for long. On Tuesday the Home Office permanent secretary told the home affairs select committee he was “unable to rule out” using troops to police the border in the event of a “no deal” Brexit. What has happened with Belfast and Bombardier reveals the dangers facing the UK after Brexit – leaping into the unknown with no safety net. May showed us at the general election that she’s a remarkably weak leader with a knack for making terrible decisions – and that is now more evident than ever. Airbus’s rescue is a Machiavellian work of business genius – hence Boeing’s outrage – but the Conservative government cannot claim credit for the rescue of Bombardier jobs. Instead, we are left with a frightening vision of our bold Brexit future: Theresa May shouting into the wind. • Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/19/vaginal-mesh-implants-if-i-lift-my-leg-my-whole-body-shakes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Vaginal mesh implants: 'If I lift my leg my whole body shakes'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/19/vaginal-mesh-implants-if-i-lift-my-leg-my-whole-body-shakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/19/vaginal-mesh-implants-if-i-lift-my-leg-my-whole-body-shakes","fields":{"headline":"Vaginal mesh implants: 'If I lift my leg my whole body shakes'","bodyText":"Lisa Woodrow, 54, is one of the women who felt compelled to travel to parliament on Wednesday, after suffering serious complications from vaginal mesh surgery that led to her losing her job, partner and home. Woodrow, a former marketing manager from Thetford, Norfolk, was offered a mesh procedure five years ago and believed she’d be a “new woman” after surgery. After experiencing difficult births – she has two adult sons – she had pelvic prolapse and urinary incontinence, meaning she suffered embarrassing leaks and had to wear incontinence pads. But she was also active, enjoyed life and had recently moved in with her partner. “I had a good job, I had a good social life, I was fit and healthy. I did my high kicks and everything,” she said. “If I lift my leg now my whole body shakes.” After surgery, Woodrow suspected something was wrong because she had pain radiating from her groin into her back and down her left leg. Two-and-a-half years after surgery she suddenly experienced excruciating pain. She was taken to hospital in an ambulance, unable to walk, and remained there for six weeks. Doctors seemed reluctant to accept that her pain could be linked to the mesh implant. “They said perhaps you’ve got neurological overload,” she said. “They kept asking if I’ve got a stressful job. They were trying to blame anything but the mesh.” Her GP suggested back pain might be the problem. She returned home in a wheelchair and on morphine, and said her five-year relationship broke down soon after. “I couldn’t go to the toilet, all the drugs I was on, that’s very hard for somebody,” she said. “He couldn’t cope. I can accept it now, but it was very hard at the time.” She couldn’t continue her job as a manager of a business that sold bathroom products to hotels because it required her to drive and regularly travel to London. As a result of the drop in her income, she also lost her house and had to move to a ground floor rented flat. Woodrow had her mesh partially removed a year ago, but requires further surgery to remove the remaining pieces. Her health is better but she is still on pain medication and uses a stick to walk beyond a short distance. Woodrow said she was given no sense that the procedure was designed to be permanent, recalling that her surgeon even suggested that because of her age she might need to have it replaced in the future. Pelvic mesh is not designed to be removed as it becomes embedded in surrounding tissue to act as a support. “I wasn’t told that they couldn’t take it out,” she said. “My understanding was that it was just sitting there.” She believes trial results suggesting that mesh is an effective cure may have overlooked the broader experiences of patients. “They measure it by the success of you not wetting yourself,” she said. “You’re not wetting yourself, but you’ve got pain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T19:12:04Z","webTitle":"Quebec passes law banning facial coverings in public","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public","fields":{"headline":"Quebec passes law banning facial coverings in public","bodyText":"The Canadian province of Quebec has passed a sweeping ban on face coverings – barring public workers from wearing the niqab or burqa and obliging citizens to unveil when riding public transit or receiving government services – ushering in a law believed to be the first of its kind in North America. The legislation was adopted on Wednesday, capping off two years of work by the province’s Liberal government to address the issue of state neutrality. The resulting law has been condemned by critics who say it deliberately targets Muslim women and will fuel the province’s simmering debate on identity, religion and tolerance. Philippe Couillard, the premier of Quebec, was defensive as he addressed the new law. “We are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,” he told reporters. “We are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It’s as simple as that.” The law was originally meant to ban face coverings for those offering or receiving services from government departments and provincially funded institutions, such as universities. In August, the legislation was extended to apply to municipalities, school boards, public health services and transit authorities, raising the possibility that women wearing a niqab or burqa in Quebec would not be able to take the metro or ride the city bus. “As long as the service is being rendered, the face should be uncovered,” Stéphanie Vallée, Quebec’s justice minister, said when asked. The legislation stipulates that exemptions can be made for those who provide spiritual care or religious instruction, as well as those who are forced to cover their faces due to working conditions or occupational hazards. Amid widespread confusion as to how the new law would be applied and who it would affect, Vallée said the province would now work with municipalities, schools and public daycares to establish clear guidelines. The Liberal government has long argued that the legislation – which does not specifically mention the niqab or burqa – addresses public safety, noting that it would also apply to masked protesters. “We are not legislating on clothing,” Vallée said last year. “Public services have to be offered and received with the face uncovered for security, identification and communication purposes.” Others – citing a 2016 survey that suggested that just 3% of Muslim women in Canada wear the niqab – have accused the provincial government of targeting Muslim women in order to curry votes in the run-up to next year’s provincial election. “It seems like a made-up solution to an invented problem,” said Ihsaan Gardee of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. “We don’t have a big issue right now with hordes of Muslim women in niqab trying to work in the public service or accessing public services with difficulty.” The law comes after two attempts by authorities in Quebec to legislate secularism in the public domain in recent years. A 2010 attempt by the Liberals died on the order paper after two years; a bill by the previous separatist government that sought to ban teachers, doctors and other public workers from wearing highly visible religious symbols failed to pass before an election was called. On Wednesday the Liberals flexed their majority in the provincial government to pass the legislation, fending off calls from the province’s two main opposition parties to put in place tougher laws to address the issue of secularism and religious accommodation. “I know people would have liked us to go further,” Vallée told the province’s national assembly. “Others think we are going too far. I think a balance has been found.” Many have voiced concerns that the new law targets a segment of the population that is already marginalised and stigmatised. “We can’t divorce this bill from the larger context in which it falls,” said Gardee. “According to Statistics Canada, hate crimes targeting Canadian Muslims increased from 2012 to 2015 by 253%.” Earlier this year, the province was left reeling after six men – all of them fathers – were shot dead as they prayed at a mosque in Quebec City. During the eulogy for the men killed, Imam Hassan Guillet drew a direct line between their murders and the political climate facing Muslims in Canada. “Unfortunately, day after day, week after week, month after month, certain politicians, and certain reporters and certain media, poisoned our atmosphere,” he said. While Quebec politicians said the ban on receiving services while wearing a face covering would enter into effect immediately, implementation of the law is likely to be hindered by the many questions that remain. “We don’t know how this is going to be applied and how it will be enforced,” said Gardee. “It’s deeply troubling.” The legislation does note that those affected by the law can put in a request for accommodation, but little explanation is given to the criteria or how exactly it would work. The government said it would use the coming months to better outline how these requests should be treated as well as develop guidelines for those working in the public sector. Legal observers said they expect several advocacy groups to challenge the new law in courts, pitting it against the country’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the provincial equivalent. Gardee said it was an option his organisation would likely be considering in the coming days. “We are of that opinion that the state has no business in the wardrobe of the nations,” he said. “The state should not be coercing women to undress or dress in any particular fashion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/22/marshall-review-courtroom-double-act-chadwick-boseman","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Marshall review – courtroom double act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/marshall-review-courtroom-double-act-chadwick-boseman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/22/marshall-review-courtroom-double-act-chadwick-boseman","fields":{"headline":"Marshall review – courtroom double act","bodyText":"This slickly average 1940s courtroom drama is the story of Thurgood Marshall, attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and future first African American supreme court justice.

Mrs P, 72, who a year ago was a keen public speaker, churchgoer and local campaigner, is now minimally conscious and unable to care for herself. Her life changed after the fall last November. In the weeks that followed, Mrs P, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, suffered headaches and was eventually given a CT scan which revealed she had an aneurysm. Further tests revealed an acute haemorrhage and a deterioration of her level of consciousness. Her two daughters and long-term partner want her taken off the nasogastric tube and allowed to receive palliative care in a hospice. But the woman’s three sisters have sided with an NHS trust in arguing that her current medical regime should continue. The family rift is now at the centre of a legal wrangle in front of a judge at the court of protection. Medical staff transferred her to a hyper-acute neurohabilitation ward at Salford royal hospital on 3 February this year. She has remained there since, cared for by specialist staff. Mrs P’s 12-year-old grandson told a judge in the court of protection about her independent spirit. Sitting in the witness box at Preston crown court, he said: “I used to go and see her at least every week. Generally in the week, she would come over to our house once or twice and just like having a chat. “Sometimes we would go shopping together at the weekend when my mum used to go out. “I used to cook tea sometimes. She really liked driving, but she wasn’t very good.” He added: “She liked her independence. She really liked having family to talk to and do what she wanted.” His 14-year-old cousin also gave evidence . The boy recalled his “fun” grandmother coming to visit every four to six weeks. “I loved being with her. She’d sit and watch me play on the Xbox. She was a fun grandmother.” Earlier, Mrs P’s younger daughter said she thought her mother would be horrified if she knew the state she was in. “She would hate it,” she told Mr Justice Hayden. “The indignity of not being able to move, to go to the toilet, to keep herself clean.” The official solicitor, appointed to represent Mrs P’s interests in the court room, revealed on the third and final day of the case that it had changed its previously neutral stance on her future care. Vikram Sachdeva, QC, counsel for the official solicitor, said he now shared the daughters’ view that the tube should be withdrawn and Mrs P given palliative care away from Salford Royal. The judge reserved his judgment until an unspecified day next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/20/nfl-protest-race-policing-colin-kaepernick","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:58:30Z","webTitle":"The NFL protests are being diluted.

Here’s how players can change that","bodyText":"NFL players who have been protesting racism and police violence are under attack. Earlier this month, vice-president Mike Pence made a show of leaving a Colts-49ers game when twenty San Francisco players kneeled during the national anthem. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has threatened to bench any player who does not stand. Some fans have booed or burned jerseys. More important than the risk of being benched or booed, however, is the hijacking of the players’ message. Donald Trump has been the hijacker-in-chief. He has insisted that the protests disrespect the flag, the military, and “everything that we stand for.” Trump called for owners to fire any “son of a bitch” who takes a knee, and asked fans to boycott games. When the NFL declined this week to mandate standing, the president lashed out at the league on Twitter. Too many players and teams have taken the bait and allowed the dilution of their own message. After the president’s inflammatory remarks, hundreds of NFL players kneeled, locked arms, or stayed in the locker room for the anthem. But that wave of activity was framed largely in terms of safe general principles. The Jaguars said they kneeled “to pray for change, progress and equality for everyone who calls the United States their home.” The 49ers tweeted a video of their team with the caption “together.” More than anything, the emphasis has been on unity in the face of a president who has sought to divide players, owners, and fans. The protests are now in danger of being completely neutralized. At best, people may feel like they accomplished something—rebuking the president, perhaps—but nothing about policing or race will change. And then we’ll all move on. Already, protests are getting harder to discern, as when the New England Patriots stood with their hands on their hearts and each other’s backs, and easier for television networks to ignore. Commissioner Roger Goodell claimed Tuesday that only “half a dozen” players are still protesting, and he’d like to “put that at zero.” It’s not too late for players to wrest back control. When Colin Kaepernick started protesting last year, he was crystal clear that his target was the lack of accountability for police violence. “There are bodies in the street, and people getting paid leave, and getting away with murder,” he said. Players like Malcolm Jenkins, Eric Reid, and a high school junior from Florida (“I did it for the police brutality, man. Somebody has got to speak up.”) have also been direct. More players need to say unequivocally and consistently that these protests are about policing, criminal justice, and the value of black lives. Players should also advocate specific reforms in their cities and states. Some have begun talking about bail reform, an urgent cause. Here are two ideas focused on policing – one aimed at preventing injury and death, the other at securing justice – also worth taking up. First, players should push for state laws that require cops to get de-escalation training. Many controversial shootings result not from an officer going rogue, but from the officer doing exactly what he or she was trained to do when perceiving a threat. De-escalation is a set of tactics to slow situations down, create physical space, and give officers options so they don’t get to the point of feeling they have to fire their gun. The results can be dramatic. De-escalation is the difference between officers in San Francisco surrounding Mario Woods and unleashing a barrage of gunfire because he would not drop a knife, and officers in Camden walking alongside a knife-wielding man for several blocks, talking him into dropping the weapon, and then safely subduing him. In Dallas, use of force dropped 18% a year after the police department implemented the training. Police shootings have declined steadily there, and excessive force complaints are down 83% since 2009. De-escalation is not new, but it is underused. According to a 2015 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum, new recruits get a median of 58 hours of training on firearms and another 49 hours on other use-of-force tactics, but only eight hours on de-escalation. Thirty-four states do not require local agencies to provide any de-escalation training. This has to change. Second, players should demand that when officers do kill or seriously injure someone, the criminal investigation be conducted by an independent authority. The Department of Justice has a special unit of prosecutors dedicated to allegations of excessive force. When I was an attorney there, we often brought federal charges in cases that local police had not investigated adequately or that local prosecutors had not taken seriously. We had two key things going for us. We had no conflicts of interest because we did not depend on the very officers we were investigating to help us prosecute other crimes. And we developed expertise by specializing in officer misconduct cases. Due to resource and legal constraints, most cases are not investigated federally. Even so, there are ways to ensure independence. The state attorney general’s office can take the lead, as in shootings of unarmed people in New York. Or the district attorney can set up a dedicated unit of investigators and prosecutors to handle serious excessive force cases. San Francisco district attorney George Gascón did this last year when he created the Independent Investigations Bureau. This month, St Louis District Attorney Kim Gardner told her city council she wanted the same authority, to ensure “a fair and impartial process” that the community could trust. These independent arrangements are rare. They must become the norm. NFL players have the platform to bring these solutions into the mainstream. If they are specific about the problem and potential reforms, they can help improve American policing and make ours a more just country. Of course, doing so effectively means continuing to protest, in spite of the pressure being brought against them. For the sake of the country, let’s hope they do.

Scores of talented scientists have left or passed up university posts for salaries two to five times higher at major technology firms, where besides getting better pay, new recruits can take on real-world problems with computer power and datasets that academia cannot hope to provide. The impact of the hiring frenzy is revealed in a confidential Guardian survey of the UK’s elite Russell Group universities, which found that many top institutions were struggling to keep up with the demand from tech firms that are aggressively expanding their AI research groups. One university executive said AI researchers were courted by industry on a routine basis and that departments regularly missed out on the best talent when companies made better offers. “We need top quality staff to teach and research and the implications of not achieving this don’t need to be spelt out,” the executive told the Guardian. “There are no easy answers, but this is an issue with national implications.” Universities exist, in part, to meet the needs of industry, but the fierce demand for skilled AI researchers is heavily outstripping supply, according to universities who took part in the survey. The picture is supported by data from the global job site Indeed, where the economist Mariano Mamertino said the number of AI jobs in Britain had soared 485% since 2014. It means there are more than two jobs for every qualified jobseeker, the company’s figures show. “This goes beyond the normal exchange of people between academia and industry,” one senior academic told the Guardian. “It already affects university research because of the difficulty of recruitment, and is definitely in danger of creating a ‘missing generation’ with consequences for future teaching and research.” The Guardian’s survey was completed by leading research universities selected for their strength in computing and artificial intelligence, including Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, UCL and Imperial College London. Maja Pantic, professor of affective and behavioural computing at Imperial, was not approached for the survey, but confirmed its findings. “We are losing the next generation of academics,” she said. “A lot of people believe this is a phase that will pass. To me, that’s like being the ostrich that puts its head in the sand. In the end society will suffer.” “The majority of top people who leave academia move to Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple,” Pantic said. “The real problem is these people are not dispersed through society. The intellect and expertise is concentrated in a small number of companies.” AI has become a boom industry on the back of new techniques that use algorithms and data to build statistical models of everything from speech and handwriting to shopping habits and objects such as cats and dogs. The technology underpins great swaths of modern digital services from Google’s language translation and Apple’s Siri voice recognition to Amazon’s product recommendations and the articles that appear in Facebook news feeds. The surge of interest in AI means that leading universities are facing a flood of applications from good students just as staff are leaving or moving to part-time roles. Some universities who responded to the survey said research was being hit not only by the loss of scientists, but the lack of computer power and datasets needed to run experiments on the scale now routine in industry. A number of prominent AI researchers have recently moved to industry. In March, Zoubin Ghahramani, head of machine learning at Cambridge and one of the most respected AI researchers in the country, became chief scientist at Uber, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing firm. Neil Lawrence, professor of machine learning at Sheffield University, has moved his research group to Amazon in Cambridge. Murray Shanahan, professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial, along with Yee Whye Teh and Andrew Zisserman at Oxford, has taken a post at Google’s DeepMind, which now runs AI courses at University College London and Oxford. For many universities the brain drain is most intense among early career researchers. While Indeed found the average salary for a machine learning engineer was £54,366, the Guardian survey found that some of the best younger researchers left academia for industry jobs paying £80,000 to £200,000. Some academics believe the surge in demand will settle down, as happened in the telecoms and dotcom booms. But others want universities, companies and the government to take action. Many of those who responded to the survey said universities must allow more part-time positions and industry secondments, pay higher salaries funded by master’s courses and take on industry-backed research projects. DeepMind, Amazon and Microsoft would not discuss how many AI researchers they had recruited in recent months, but DeepMind has about 200 researchers drawn heavily from Oxford and UCL. Chris Bishop, lab director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, said the company had a long history of a two-way flow of researchers between itself and universities that was beneficial to all. “Attracting students away from their studies prematurely risks undermining the long-term health of our industry,” he said. “We instead aim to preserve and nurture new talent within academia in a way that is sustainable and mutually beneficial.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/27/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-cate-blanchett","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T14:00:31Z","webTitle":"Warfare, wormholes and cosmic biceps – my day on the set of Thor: Ragnarok","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/27/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-cate-blanchett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/27/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-cate-blanchett","fields":{"headline":"Warfare, wormholes and cosmic biceps – my day on the set of Thor: Ragnarok","bodyText":"I am standing on the steps of a grand staircase in Asgard, home of the hammer-wielding superhero Thor, played with deadpan charm and a stately English accent by Chris Hemsworth. This is a bustling intergalactic metropolis, with lustrous buildings reaching toward the heavens and sweeping terraces glistening beneath majestic skylines. Or at least it will be. I’m in a town square, surrounded by retro huts and buildings lined with green vines and red roses, but the place is sparse and unpopulated: just me and a handful of others investigating the scenery. On top of most edifices are large sheets of blue material, which, I am told, are “digital extensions” – empty canvasses that will be adorned in the editing room with CGI skylines. The cutting-edge magic of the movies will transform this unpromising environment into the gleaming world of Thor: Ragnarok. Making this vision even stranger is the presence of a giant rollercoaster looming above us. We are at Village Roadshow Studios in the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, in a part of town that usually attracts movie fans rather than movie-makers. Next door is an amusement park, Warner Bros Movie World, to which the rollercoaster belongs. The director of Thor: Ragnarok is Taika Waititi, the New Zealander beloved in his home country for helming the two biggest homegrown successes in NZ box office history: Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Waititi, dressed in skinny jeans and faded Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, jokes that it’s hard to concentrate during production meetings because of the screams of thrillseekers being slammed up and down the rollercoaster. Ragnarok’s production designer, Dan Hennah, who designed Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies, escorts us to another huge, vacant set. This one has a kooky, jumbled aesthetic, like a giant McDonald’s playground but painted with a washed-out colour palette. On screen it will be an alien planet called Sakaar. Hennah estimates that “maybe a quarter” of the movie takes place here, a “shanty town” populated by “aliens of all different sorts”. You come here, he explains “if you’re flying around in space and you hit one of those wormholes”. Spend a few hours on the set of a Thor movie and such space-fantasy talk soon feels run of the mill. We get none of that when we meet Cate Blanchett. Asked who her favourite superhero is, the eminently sensible two-times Oscar winner responds: “Anyone in the world who’s overcoming adverse conditions is my superhero. Someone who, against all odds, maintains hope.” Does working on a superhero movie makes her feel at all like a superhero herself? “No. It’s no different from being a working mother in any industry.” Blanchett plays Hela – Marvel Studios’ first major female supervillain – and she is virtually unrecognisable in the film: nu-goth get-up, long straightened hair, half a pound of mascara and a soul-piercing glint in her eyes. Her outfit was conceived in a cluttered warehouse crammed full of mannequins, busts and fabrics. The costume designer, Mayes C Rubeo, is a veteran of big-name sci-fi productions including Avatar, John Carter and Warcraft. “We take pride that the armour of the main characters is made in-house – the old-fashioned way,” Rubeo says, as half a dozen colleagues around her busy themselves with sewing machines and fabrics. The costume designer talks excitedly about the “Scrapers”, who she says are people “that live in the wastelands of Sakaar”. Waititi looks calm but very much in charge on set, directing Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston on a large outdoor sound stage. The film’s executive producer, Brad Winderbaum, explains that this “is the mid-finale”. He adds: “We’ve got a giant, epic, Ragnarok-scaled finale in this film. One of the biggest climactic set pieces we’ve done to date as a studio. Thor goes on this grand cosmic adventure, and by the time it all wraps up in the end, you have elements from every single place he’s been, every character he’s interacted with.” Waititi tears himself away from his production team to elaborate. “One of the things this movie will do is incorporate the natural beauty of Queensland,” he tells us. Someone rushes up to him clutching a folder containing a selection of images. After some contemplation, Waititi points: “That one.” Then to us: “See? This directing thing is easy.” In between takes, Hemsworth stands around and performs bicep curls with weights larger than Thor’s hammer. Hiddleston, who plays arch-nemesis Loki, is in high spirits, bobbing up and down on the spot, his long black hair blown by an industrial size fan. Extras walk around in poncho-like robes, a few nursing baby dolls. We meet the two inside a large cafeteria. Inevitably, given the planetary biceps we are confronted with, conversation soon turns to Hemsworth’s diet and fitness regime. “Lots of clean protein, lots of vegetables,” he says. “I’m on a very strict diet, and pretty strict workout programme.” Hiddleston jumps in. “Nobody ever gives him enough credit for this,” he says, turning to his co-star. “Seriously, you’ve been here since what time? He’s been on set working as an actor all day, and then he has to go and train afterwards. There’s not many people who can do that.” After talking of their excitement at working with Waititi the two say goodbye, and we return to the set to watch another couple of hours of filming. As the buzz of activity continues, my mind returns to the unusual stillness of those vacant sets we visited in the morning: the places that post-production whizzbangery will transform into a fully-realised Asgard and Sakaar. Will they still be recognisable on the screen? My thoughts are interrupted by the sound of screams coming from somewhere above. At least this much is certain: the rollercoaster won’t make final cut.

In 1922 and the years following, Winston Churchill’s government forbade Jews from residency in what was then known as Trans-Jordan, now as Jordan. This cut off all land east of the Jordan river from Jewish settlement. Four-fifths of Mandatory Palestine was thus dedicated to the creation of an Arab state. While Palestine and later Israel would both have large Jewish and Arab populations, Trans-Jordan, and later Jordan, became almost exclusively Arab with a majority Palestinian population, minority Bedouin population, and no Jewish population at all. The history of Trans-Jordan and later Jordan is integral to understanding the history of the British mandate in Palestine and the complex fate of Jews, Palestinians and Arabs as a whole and their relationships and interactions. It cannot be excluded from analysis of the Balfour declaration, its context, and consequences. Noam Schimmel Visiting fellow, Kellogg College, Oxford • November brings not only the centenary of the Balfour declaration but also, on the 29th, the 70th anniversary of the UN resolution to partition Palestine, which legitimised the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. In his excellent survey of the Balfour declaration and its consequences, Ian Black rightly recalled that both the US and the USSR voted for partition – but he could have mentioned explicitly that Britain abstained. Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary, saw the proposed partition as unjust to the Palestinians and the British refused to enforce it. As Black indicates, in the later years of the mandate the British did try, however ineffectually but at considerable cost, to mitigate the consequences of the Balfour declaration – notably in the white paper of 1939, which evoked anti-British terrorism by the Zionist extremists. Mrs May will probably not want to refer to this period at her festive dinner. Dr Michael Laird Havant, Hampshire • Anyone reading Ian Black’s long read might be forgiven, whatever their views about the Netanyahu government’s policies, for questioning why there is no mention of the fact that Israel is effectively the only functioning democracy with a free press, an independent judiciary and religious freedom in the region, let alone that the UN resolution which created the state also provided for a state of Palestine and was met with an attack on Israel by its neighbours. Israel certainly needs to do much more to promote the two-state solution, but there is scant evidence that others in the region are committed to that outcome. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • The close relationship between CP Scott, then editor of the Manchester Guardian, and Chaim Weizmann, later to become Israel’s first president, is outlined in Daphna Baram’s book Disenchantment: The Guardian and Israel, published in 2004. Weizmann’s knowledge of chemistry helped the British government’s war effort through the production of cordite. As the book shows, the chain of events set in motion a century ago, with its tragic consequences for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of the land, has seen a shift in the Guardian’s reporting, reflecting a much greater understanding among the wider public in this country of the catastrophic and ongoing impact on Palestinians. It is deeply shaming that our prime minister’s hospitality for Benjamin Netanyahu puts her at odds with so many people in this country – including many Jewish people. The celebratory dinner on 2 November does not reflect the deep concern about a dramatically deteriorating political, humanitarian and illegal situation, which our government has helped to maintain over so many years. We do not believe that this support for the state of Israel and its current extreme rightwing government is either wise or moral. Only a just solution for both peoples will lead to peace. Margaret and Robin Derbyshire Billericay, Essex • Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, writes (Letters, 14 October) that the Palestinians “chose intransigence over independence” in 2014. When the 2014 talks ended, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth interviewed US negotiators to produce “the closest thing to an official American version of what happened”. The Palestinians certainly wanted their state, and made huge concessions to try to get one, including accepting a “border outline so 80% of settlers would continue living in Israeli territory”. Israel would not accept even that and refused to draw its own border line on the map. The talks finally collapsed with the announcement of 700 more settlement houses, and “the Americans understood from their Israeli counterparts that [this] was an intentional act of sabotage”. So it was Israel that was intransigent, and the Palestinians who have no “partner for peace”.

From smoky eyes to bright red or orange lips, it’s a simple way of adding drama and personality. So nude lips are perfect for when I am being myself. The first lipstick I tried was the Mac Cremesheen in Peach Blossom (£16.50). I love Mac lipsticks, and have a lot of them, but this was slightly too pale for me: it made me look a bit lipless. With blond hair, though, I think it could be great. I loved the look of Laura Geller’s Iconic Baked Sculpting lipstick in Tribeca Tan (£16, lookfantastic.com): it has great packaging and is really sleek. The tone was a bit orangey for my taste, but the colour would be perfect if you wanted to look a bit 1960s; it would also be great with red hair. Pür’s Velvet Matte Liquid Lipstick in Oh Bae (£16, hqhair.com) was a revelation. I used to think that matte lipsticks were super drying, but this wasn’t at all – my lips were really moisturised, and the colour is great for everyday use. It also has a lovely, sweet taste, which is definitely important; let’s admit it, we do eat our lipsticks, a bit. My absolute favourite, though, was Too Faced La Crème lipstick in Naked Dolly (£18, toofaced.com). It was moisturising and lasted all morning, plus the gold packaging is really glam. It’s the perfect tone for me, and I will definitely be adding this to my makeup kit. • Next week: All Ages model Dewi Rees tests hair putty This article contains affiliate links to products.

Just another icon, then. Actually, no: there’s logic to the curves, which allow for generous balconies with wide views, but a minimum of overlooking from one to the other. The same ends, to be sure, might have been achieved more plainly, but also with less enjoyment. “Everyone,” says its architect, Farshid Moussavi, “should have the choice of living in buildings that inspire them.” That’s not an outlandish request. But in the current climate in Britain, where politicians, developers and architects are scrabbling to find ways to provide more housing, any housing, never mind the quality, in which supply is palpably and persistently failing to meet demand, it sounds fantastical. The London-based Moussavi, however, with two new apartment buildings in France for the same developer client, has set out to show what she means. Moussavi first made her name at the age of 30, when, as one half of the partnership Foreign Office Architects, she won the competition to design the memorable Yokohama international port terminal. Since the practice broke up in 2011, she has been working in her own name on projects that run from Victoria Beckham’s flagship store to a sleek but brooding office block in the City of London. Despite her achievements, Moussavi knows that an architect can’t shape everything – with developer-led housing, for example, there are only so many ways of arranging the plan of a flat – so she concentrates on what she can. She calls this approach “micropolitics”, which means using the means available to architects to their maximum effect. Although architecture intersects, she observes, with the grand issues of our time – sustainability, economics, even terrorism – architects don’t have much power over them. What they can do is concentrate on their core business, which is the assembly of different elements of building to better or worse effect. “Great architecture has always been aware of the power of its own instruments,” she says. She is also sceptical about the claims, often made by architects of housing, that they are creating a “community”, by providing plazas and terraces or other items of what you might call spatial virtue-signalling. Communities, she is inclined to think, especially in the age of social media, are good at making themselves. She thinks that privacy is important too, so her buildings tend to sit quite simply on the ground, their common areas pleasant but undramatic. The other of the two French apartment blocks, Îlot 19, stands like a photobomber between two architectural celebrities. On one side is the Grande Arche de la Défense, the mightiest of President Mitterrand’s pharaonic bequests to Paris; on the other, the 40,000-capacity U Arena by the Pritzker-winning Christian de Portzamparc, which opened last week with a Rolling Stones concert. Îlot 19 is on the edge of the great axis that runs dead straight through the Arc de Triomphe, down the Champs Élysées to the Louvre, more than eight kilometres away. It backs on to a dignified old cemetery, with clipped and espaliered trees lining the paths between the graves. There is another cemetery on the other side, a little further off. It’s a curious place for a housing block, alongside so much life and death and grandeur, and it makes for a vertiginous gradient from pomp and spectacle to the domestic and the everyday. Nor is its location an occasion for luxury and prestige. It stands inside the jurisdiction of the commune of Nanterre, a communist-run city north-west of Paris which insists not only on a mixture of market, affordable, social and student housing, but also that homes are sold within a maximum price set by the municipal government. The block’s siting is the sort of unexpected juxtaposition that, although (or because) it makes old cities vital, gets rubbed out when the logic of property values takes command. It is Moussavi’s starting point: her main move is to make long, horizontal balconies and loggias run the length of the block, on both flanks, their angles skewed to capture the view down the axis. They also echo the oblique angle at which the Grande Arche is placed. This simple idea is made dynamic and complex by the fact that each level alternates between creating a “loggia” – something partly enclosed by an aluminium screen and a portion of roof – and a “balcony” which has only a glass balustrade. There is further alternation, as the angle switches one way or another every two storeys. Richness and depth come from the layering of the screens, whose vertical slats are fixed in different directions such that they catch the light differently – sometimes bright, sometimes merging with the darker background. Beneath all this is a mostly straightforward rectangular block within which Moussavi’s main decision was to access the flats from a series of staircases and lifts. This avoids corridors and allows each flat to run from one side of the block to the other, giving through breezes and varying views and light. The alternation of balconies and loggias works in such a way that each flat gets one of each, on one side or the other. On the outside, the block is charismatic and intriguing, strong enough to stand up to its powerful neighbours, but also suggestive of life and inhabitation inside. It is animate and a touch moody. More importantly, the wrapping of balconies and loggias lifts the flats out of the run of the mill. They are made distinctive by their layers of inside and out, slightly different in each home, which allow people to inhabit their space in their own ways. Both projects are enriched by small touches, such as, in Nanterre, the unusually fine proportion of the balustrades and dark mirrored partitions between the loggias of different flats, which fold reflections of the view into the residents’ private space. In Montpellier, the gauge of the corrugated aluminium cladding is varied, from wide to narrow to wide, to intensify the effects of the curves. External curtains add a further, nicely shifting layer, their metallic glint matching the aluminium. These qualities don’t happen easily. They required intensive collaboration with a willing cladding contractor, called ATS, with mock-ups and prototypes to make sure they were getting the desired effect. They also needed realism about the budgets with which developers work, on what are not expensive properties. It was because Moussavi showed her seriousness on these matters that her client in Nanterre, Les Nouveaux Constructeurs, commissioned her again in Montpellier. There is no reason, in principle, why housing like this couldn’t happen here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/22/gifted-alone-in-berlin-the-mummy-slack-bay-kingdom-of-us-dvd-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"DVD reviews: Gifted; Alone in Berlin; The Mummy; Slack Bay and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/gifted-alone-in-berlin-the-mummy-slack-bay-kingdom-of-us-dvd-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/22/gifted-alone-in-berlin-the-mummy-slack-bay-kingdom-of-us-dvd-reviews","fields":{"headline":"DVD reviews: Gifted; Alone in Berlin; The Mummy; Slack Bay and more","bodyText":"My esteemed colleague Mark Kermode often talks of Altitude Adjusted Lachrymosity Syndrome (AALS), the tendency we have to vulnerably cry buckets while watching films – often wholly unremarkable ones – on planes. That would handily explain my reaction to Gifted (Fox, 12), a slick, soap-scrubbed and shamelessly tear-engineered child-custody drama, if not for the annoying detail that it caught me very much on terra firma. Perhaps it’s not that unremarkable after all. A sore streak of honest feeling runs through The Amazing Spider-Man director Marc Webb’s weepie; ditto the fresh, true performances from Chris Evans, as the adoring but no-bullshit uncle and guardian of a seven-year-old maths genius, and from McKenna Grace, beguiling but never cutesily camera-trained as the tyke in question. Together, they have an utterly credible, spontaneous connection on screen. The second that inevitable plot complications muscle in on their two-person family, you root fiercely for its protection. Tom Flynn’s script is closer to I Am Sam than Kramer vs Kramer in the complexity of its moral stakes: our sympathies are handed to dreamy, bristle-bearded Captain America himself on a plate. But it’s all about the sincerely anguished execution: I believe how the film feels, if not always how it looks, and that counts for a lot. Performances are a saving grace of mustier material in Alone in Berlin (Altitude, 15), Vincent Perez’s slow, solemn, vintage-filtered tale of individual Nazi resistance, a subject that, at the time of production, the film-makers could hardly have imagined would be depressingly on-trend. See it for Brendan Gleeson, so quietly but plungingly sad as Otto, a compliant, grey-faced Berlin factory worker whose long-passive stance against the Nazi party turns active following his son’s death in battle. Secretly, he initiates a city-wide propaganda campaign of postcards inscribed with anti-Hitler messages. Emma Thompson, as his devastated but less politically decided wife, is also on form; their plaintive thespian duet lends dignity to a potentially starchy Europudding. Dignity is not a virtue anyone gets to take away from the egregiously decayed summer bummer The Mummy (Universal, 15), a honking, murkily effects-buried, tomb-raiding reboot that wastes even Tom Cruise’s most minimal efforts. Knowingly and gleefully undignified, however, is Slack Bay (New Wave, 15), the latest loop-de-loop product of formerly severe French formalist Bruno Dumont’s sudden, surprising new interest in comedy. This one, more structurally contained but perhaps more tonally bananas than 2014’s P’tit Quinquin, spins over an eccentric, upper-crust family’s chaotic seaside vacation, its farcical points ranging from genderqueer identity crisis to cannibal grotesquerie to purest physical slapstick. Many viewers have proved highly allergic. Catch its wavelength, however, and you’ll be giggling over recalled details for days. We’ve written a lot recently about the surge of Syria-themed documentaries; narrative cinema, however, has been slower to catch on. Despite being saddled with one of the year’s worst titles, Insyriated (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) is a mostly commendable exception. A taut, curt chamber thriller, set in an overcrowded Damascus household weathering a day of extreme outside battle, it’s somewhat clunkily scripted but urgently paced and performed. Cannily timed ahead of the release of Kenneth Branagh’s all-star, all-cheddar remake of Murder on the Orient Express, a quartet of glossy entertainments from Hollywood’s Agatha Christie revival of the 1970s and early 1980s have been smartly restored and repackaged. All awash in chintzy art direction and glazed-ham performances, they make for optimum Sunday-afternoon-under-a-blanket viewing as winter encroaches. Sidney Lumet’s Murder on the Orient Express, despite its prestige veneer and smattering of Oscar attention, remains the stiffest of the lot. Death on the Nile, The Mirror Crack’d and Evil Under the Sun (all StudioCanal, PG) are spryer fun, leaning wholeheartedly into their camp potential. Maggie Smith and Diana Rigg bitchingly swapping verses on Cole Porter’s You’re the Top in the last one represents everything these films should aspire to be. Your move, Ken. Finally to Netflix, now moving faster on films than most critics can catch them at festivals. Only days ago, Lucy Cohen’s stirring Kingdom of Us won best documentary at the London film festival. It’s already up to stream, which is perhaps just as well, since this tender, trauma-laced study of seven children – several of them autistic to varying degrees – and their mother, left behind and adrift by a patriarch’s suicide, isn’t most people’s idea of a night out at the cinema. It’s worth braving on a small screen, though, the format of which has no adverse effect on its hard-to-shake intimacy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/biryani-golden-vegetables-lemon-pilaf-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Anna Jones’s recipe for biryani with saffron and golden veg | The modern cook |","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/biryani-golden-vegetables-lemon-pilaf-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/biryani-golden-vegetables-lemon-pilaf-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook","fields":{"headline":"Anna Jones’s recipe for biryani with saffron and golden veg","bodyText":"There seems to be a rice dish to suit every mood and soothe any ill. Rice has a mothering quality, from the stodgy reassurance of a Thai sticky sidekick to a calming bowl of risotto. As starches go, however, rice has always lagged behind bread, potatoes, pasta and even noodles in my kitchen. Recently, though, there has been a rice renaissance in our house thanks to my brother-in-law, Phil. He makes the kind of fluffy basmati rice that has always eluded me: tender within, but with a light bite on the outside; fluffy, but with a toothsome stickiness. I’ve spent the past year or so trying to perfect it and I think I might finally be there. This buttered lemon basmati pilaf is my new comfort food. It’s the kind of rice you can put beside anything – a curry, a winter stew – although sometimes I need nothing more than a small bowl of it on its own. Gentle and simple. The other reason for my rediscovery of rice was my yearning for warming spices as autumn kicks in; rice is quite the vehicle for the likes of cinnamon, saffron and clove. Last week, I cooked this biryani – one of the most stratified dishes I can remember eating. The rice is only partially cooked before it’s layered with vegetables, herbs and fried onions in a pot, then covered and baked in the oven until just the right side of crunchy. A biryani feels celebratory, I always think. These dishes were the yin and yang of my kitchen this week – and both from the same little grain I’ve been all but ignoring. Biryani with saffron and golden veg This may seem like a long ingredient list and a lot of stages, but it actually comes together quickly. The spices are needed to layer the flavours in a subtle yet generous way. The next day, you can saute its leftovers and eat them with a fried egg. I have kept the rose water optional as it splits opinion. Serves 4 8 cardamom pods A small stick of cinnamon 4 cloves A few gratings of nutmeg 1 tsp fennel seeds 3 bay leaves A large pinch of saffron 1-2 tsp rose water (optional) 4 tbsp ghee or butter 3 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced A small thumb of fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 tsp ground turmeric ½ tsp garam masala 500g root vegetables, such as carrots, butternut squash and potato, grated Salt and black pepper 300g basmati rice A small bunch of mint leaves A small bunch of coriander A small handful of flaked almonds 1 Set the oven to 220C/425F/gas 7. Put 4 cardamom pods, the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, fennel seeds and bay into a pan with 500ml water. Bring to the boil, turn off the heat, then cover and allow to infuse. 2 Crush the other cardamom pods, remove the seeds and finely grind, discarding the pods. Mix the powder with 4 tbsp warm water, the saffron and rosewater, if using. 3 Fry the onions in 1 tbsp of ghee until light brown and beginning to crisp. Set aside half. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and fry the rest for 2 minutes. 4 Add the ground spices and grated veg. Fry for 3 minutes and season well with salt and pepper. 5 Heat the remaining ghee in another pan and fry the rice over a high heat for a few minutes, until shiny. Strain half the spice-and-bay liquid into the pan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and cook for about 6 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. 6 Now, assemble your biryani. Put a layer of rice in an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over the remaining strained spice-and-bay liquid and some of the saffron-rosewater liquid. Add a layer of the grated vegetable mix. Sprinkle over some of the fried onions, mint leaves and coriander. Repeat with another layer of rice and pour over the remaining saffron liquid. Dot the almonds on top. Cover the dish tightly with tin foil. Put in the oven for 40 minutes, reducing the heat to 190C/375F/gas 5 after 20 minutes. Fluff and mix with a fork before serving and top with extra fried onions and herbs. Everyday buttered lemon pilaf I use cup ratios here as I find it much easier when cooking rice to measure volume. If you don’t have a cup measure, a standard mug two-thirds full will be about the same. If you have time, soak the rice in cold water first, for up to an hour – this will knock two minutes off the cooking time. You’ll need a clean tea towel. Serves 4-6 2 cups basmati rice 25g butter, ghee or coconut oil 1 tsp salt 1 lemon 1 Put the rice in a sieve, then run it under cold water for 30 seconds to remove some of the starch – until the water coming from the bottom of the sieve to look clear. 2 Fill and boil the kettle. Get a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Put it on a medium heat, add the butter or oil and allow to melt and warm up a little. Add the rice. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring all the time, until it looks shiny. 3 Next, add 2 cups of boiling water from the kettle, the salt and the juice of 1 lemon. Bring to the boil and simmer for 4 minutes with the lid off. 4 For best results, wrap your lid tightly with a tea towel to absorb extra moisture. (Be very careful to tie it tightly over the lid as you don’t want it to fall off and catch fire.) I do this by tying opposite corners in a tight knot around the handle then repeating with the other two. 5 Once the rice has had 4 minutes, put the covered lid on top and leave the rice to cook on the very lowest heat for a further 8 minutes. Then turn it off and leave for at least 5 minutes, avoiding the temptation to peek. When you do take your lid off, you should see little puckered air holes in the rice and should be light and fluffy with no liquid at the bottom. Anna Jones is a chef, writer and author.

That was a suitably pitiful way to decide a dreary contest. At the final whistle, Lukaku spends several moments encouraging the young goalkeeper, who is a compatriot of his and perhaps could still go on to be a team-mate in the senior national team. If he does, he’ll remember Lukaku’s kindness. That’s classy from the big man. 90+3 min: Lukaku bangs his freekick into the wall, laying out Augusto in the process. RED CARD! Luisao cops a second booking for lunging at McTominay after the youngster pounced on a ball that squirted out to him after Luisao had dispossessed Lukaku. So there’s another Champions League debutant who’s made a big impact today. United substitution: McTominay on, Mkhitaryan off. 90 min: There will be four more minutes, at least. It may feel like six years. 89 min: Benfica win another corner, this time after a preposterous shank by Blind. The corner comes to nothing. 88 min: Douglas misjudges a long clearance by United following a corner by Benfica. For a moment it looks like Martial is in. but Luisao tidies up smartly. 87 min: Smalling heads Cervi’s corner away at the near post. Smalling has been good today. Rashford and Matic have also been strong. 84 min: Cervi’s first contribution is to win a corner. United are slack in defending it, so Dias gets a clear shot on from eight yards, in line with the front post. It’s an awkward shot, though, as he was jumping as if preparing to head it and ended up having to essay a sidefooted volley. It goes a couple of yards wide. Benfica substitution: Cervi on, Salvio off 83 min: Augusto tries a shot from 25 yards - which is about the distance that all of Benfica’s shots have come from today. It takes a deflection and balloons high into the air before dropping into the arms of De Gea. 81 min: United are strangling this game now. 78 min: Luisao and Svilar spent several moments in conversation while Rashford was being replaced. Perhaps they were discussing a previous exchange, ie the one that Joseph Shinners says took place before the goal: “Luisao and ther defenders were telling Svilar to come out further before the kick was taken - he’s not fully to blame.” 77 min: Rashford has hobbled off. It’s not clear what the problem is but he definitely picked up an injury of some sort. Mourinho consults with him on the sideline and, if the expression on the managers face is anything to go by, neither man feels the injury is long-term one. On trots Martial in Rashford’s place. 76 min: Benfica don’t look good enough to get back into this. And De Gea certainly isn’t going to offer them the sort of present that United have been given. 75 min: A minor scare in the United box after Zivkovic and Jonas combine. But it was all bit rushed, so much so that Jonas fell over as he tried to shoot. 72 min: In the other match in this group, by the way, Basel area leading 1-0 at CSKA Moscow. Benfica substitution: Jonas on, Goncalves off. Oh dear. That’s a nightmare for the young goalkeeper. In fairness to another youngster, Rashford exploited Svilar’s naivety well: having noticed that the keeper had got lost under the last few corners, the United player floated an in-swinging freekick towards the net ... and Svilar backpedalled so far that he didn’t catch it until it had already crossed the line. That’s a severe lesson for the 18-year-old. 63 min: It’s scrappy. “If Benfica win this (I actually find the game fascinating) will Liverpool get the blame?” wonders Ian Copestake. Well, you have to admit that Henderson, Can and Wijnaldum are really strong... 62 min: Rashford’s in-swinging corner from the left almost swings directly into the net! Svilar punches it over the bar - just about - when he could have got it. 60 min: Excellent cross-field ball by Rashford to Mata. But Mata’s attempt to pick out Lukaku in the middle is sadly inaccurate. Benfica substitution: Zivkovic on, Pizzi off. 57 min: Rashford has been good in this half so far. His smart runs are making midfields’ decisions easy. And when he gets the ball. he makes shrewd use of it. He has just teed up Lukaku at the edge of the box. ut Lukaku let the ball run away from him as he tried to dribble around a defender. His touch has been unusually clunky so far. 55 min: Now it’s Blind’s turn to abort a counter-attack with a brazen foul. He, too, escapes a booking. 54 min: Smalling gets a commanding header to an in-swinging freekick. Good thing, too, because Luisao was poised to nod in from close range. Rashford leads a counter-attack but is chopped down by Goncalvez, who somehow escapes a booking. 52 min: According to reports, Algeria have just appointed Rabah Madjer as their new manager. Now there’s a man who knows how to light up a big night of European competition, as Benfica fans will no doubt be happy to remember ... 51 min: From a throw-in on the left, Rashford rolls his marker and the ball sits up nicely for him, inviting him to have a crack. He does so, from 25 yards. Svilar makes a comfortable save. 50 min: Jimenez slips a pass through to Salvio, who’s got behind Blind down the left. He curls a low pass towards Goncalves at the far post. but Lindelof cuts it out. 48 min: Blind sends one into the channel for Rashford to chase. Rashford gets to it and picks out a mature pass to Mkhitaryan at the edge of the area. The Armenian rolls the ball into the path of Herrera, who hits it on the run from about 25 yards. And it goes wide by about the same. The standard of shoots has been obnoxiously bad so far. 46 min: The “action” resumes. “It’s a bright sunny day here in Philadelphia and my neighbour Dave is having his house painted,” wows Justin Kavanagh. “I’m torn now between watching the second half of this dross or the relative spectacle of going outside and seeing the paint dry on his walls.” You should go outside and help him: that would make Mourinho a kind of Tom Sawyer of our times. The scoreline is a fair reflection of the match so far. Neither side deserve to be in front. Svilar, Benfica’s 18-year-old European debutant of a goalkeeper, has barely been tested. Nether has De Gea. Champions League, you’re having a laugh. 44 min: Augusto has a shot from 35 yards. Oh dear. That should be shot with an ‘i’. 42 min: United spring forward on a counter-attack. Lukaku makes a decoy run. Mkhitaryan carries the ball into the box and the lets fly with a shot from 16 yards ... but he shanks it horribly. 41 min: Herrera clears Grimaldo’s poor freekick. 40 min: Valencia booked for handing off Jimenez, giving Benfica a freekick in a dangerous crossing position on the right. 38 min: Grimaldo blocks a cross by Mkitharyan, conceding a corner. Mata takes it short to Mkhitaryan - but under intense pressing by Benfica, United end up going al the way back to Lindelof in their own half. 36 min: Matic drives into the left-hand side of the box, shrugging off one defender before opening fire with a low shot from a tight angle. Svilar parries it to safety. 35 min: Lukaku galumphs down the left. The he delivers a clever centre towards Rashford. But United are denied by another last-gasp intervention, this time by Luisao. 34 min: United produce their snappiest move of the match, featuring lots of nice passing, orchestrated mainly by Mata. The Spaniardwinds up to take a shot from the edge of the area but is thwarted by a last-ditch tackle by Pizzi. 33 min: Blind makes ground down the left wing and sends over a decent cross. Rashford does well to get to it but can’t control his header, which loops way over the bar. 31 min: Jimenez surges through midfield. HE has options to his left and right ... but goes for the most outlandish choice, attempting to beat De Gea from 30 yards while off-balance. He mis-hits it terribly. That’ll make a nice gift for some fisherman in the Tagus. 29 min: Rashford, having switched to the right wing after getting no joy dow the left, exchanges passes with Mata before curling in a reasonable cross. But Lukaku, the only United player anywhere near the box, can’t reach it. 27 min: A slip by Valencia allows Goncalves to hare down the left. But De Gea cuts out his low cross. 25 min: Svilar scampers out of his area again to make another good clearance. He’s swept up very well so far. “Svilar wasn’t struggling with pain,” shouts Goncalo Teixeira. “He went down so that Ruben Dias could come back to the field - and he was told to do so by the ultra-experienced Julio Cesar, who was screaming from the bench. Not fair-playish, but effective!” Mourinho can only have been impressed. 22 min: Matic, United’s best midfielder so far, makes his first mistake of the game. But after he gives the ball away in midfield, Smalling and Blind bail him out. But the error is a sign of United’s increasing raggedness. Benfica have got the upper hand again and are looking much more lively. 19 min: A few minutes ago young Svilar sat down on the grass and seemed to gesture that he had strained in his leg something, but now he appears to be fine, and has just wellied two mighty punts downfield. “Mourinho has convinced me that United have no chance tonight against the deceptively brilliant Portuguese,” confides Ian Copestake. “So I am tuning in to watch Jose’s nightmare unfold.” Benfica 17 min: Lukaku heads against the crossbar from a corner - but the referee whistles for a foul on the keeper. That’s a lucky break for Svilar, who seemed outjumped fair and square. 15 min: Brilliant by Grimaldo! He shows wonderful trickery to spin and dart past three United players and scurry down the left. Then he plays in a nice low cross. Salvio, running in at speed, lashes a shot wide from 10 yards! Blind’s challenge put him off. 13 min: A replay shows that Dias suffered the injury in collision with one of his team-mates, Augusto, while everyone was jostling for position at Benfica’s last corner. And in another unfortunate development, young Svilar appears to be struggling with some kind of pain in his leg. 12 min: After Smalling takes charge at the back by heading clear a corner, Ruben Dias has to go off for treatment: the back of his head is covered in blood - I’ve no idea what happened to him. He doesn’t appear to be in pain so will likely be back soon, no doubt with a Steve Foster-style headband. 11 min: Mata’s attempted through-ball to Lukaku is intercepted easily, and suddenly Benfica tear forward on the counter-attack. Herrera is forced into an awkward clearance in his box, shanking the ball behind for a corner. 9 min: United have quelled the hosts’ early verve and are now looking the more threatening side. 7 min: A nice build-up by United concludes with Herrera threading a careful pass through to Mata, who’s pulled up for offside. He was actually level so should have been allowed to continue his run to goal. 5 min: Luisao darn near clothes-lines Mkitharyan on half-way and gets a deserved bollocking from the referee - and a yellow card. 4 min: Svilar, the young goalkeeper, gets his first Champions League touch - and it’s a diving header! He sprinted out of his box to clear a long ball before Lukaku got on the end of it. That’s impressively bold decision-making by the teenager, and well executed, to boot. 2 min: It’s a sprightly start by the home side. Theres no sign of a lack of confidence so far, as they’re moving the ball about with speed and attacking intent. 1 min: Kickoff takes place amid a mighty din, thanks mainly to the motivational efforts of a guy with the world’s most powerful megaphone. It’s on! The Stadium of Light is light on people today: it is roughly half-full. Here come the teams. United are all in black but, on close inspection, you can still see that they, like Benfica, are wearing black armbands in honour of the victims of the fires that swept through Portugal last weekend. There will also be a minute’s silence before kickoff. First he bigs up Benfica, then he bigs up United’s problems. On Benfica: “They have experience, they have tradition, they know how to play big matches. they have had difficult start to the season but they have a very good team and are better by far than our previous opponents.” Then he suggests Benfica have decided to play with three central midfielders today because Liverpool had so much success with the fearsome Can, Henderson and Wijnaldum trinity. “Everybody knows that without our strong physical players [in midfield] we lack options. We are short there so we have to try to go another way so we bring Mata in and to to be more supportive for Romelu.” On Lindelof’s return to Benfica he says: “[There is] no pressure on him because he’s not an option, he’s a need beause Jones and Bailly are injured and Rojo is not yet ready. I trust him, he is a good player. He is at home so I just hope the emotion doesn’t influence him.” The TV pundits are suggesting United should go all out to test the mettle of 18-year-old goalkeeper who is making his European debut just a few days after making his senior team debut for Benfica. I’d like to think that what Svilar is doing right now is revving himself up by watching YouTube footage of Nigel Spink’s European debut ... The 18-year-old Belgian Mile Svilar becomes the youngest goalkeeper to start a Champions League match, beating the record previously held by Iker Casillas, currently of Benfica’s arch-rivals, Porto. Meanwhile, United give another European start to Lindelof, who has yet to start a Premier League game. Benfica: Svilar; Douglas, Rúben Dias, Luisão, Grimaldo; Fejsa, Filipe Augusto, Pizzi; Salvio, Diogo Gonçalves; Raúl Subs: Cesar, Lisandro Lopez, Samaris, Jonas, Seferovic, Zivkovic United: De Gea; Valencia, Lindelof, Smalling, Blind; Herrera, Matic; Mata, Mkhitaryan, Rashford; Lukaku Subs: Romero, Darmian, Jones, McTominay, Lingard, Young, Martial Referee: F Zwayer (Germany) Hello. Manchester United have reaped maximum points from their first two group-stage matches so if they win today in Portugal, they will take a large step towards reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time since the glory, glory days of David Moyes. And since Benfica are no Liverpool, Jose Mourinho might actually go for that win. Benfica need to win even more because they were clobbered in their open two matches - including 5-0 by Basel - so they will more than likely need to take at least four points from their two meetings with United if they are to fatten up their scrawny hopes of making this the year that Bela Guttmann’s curse is finally lifted. Mind you, their struggles have little to do with any hex, more with the summer sales of many of their top players, including Victor Lindelof to United."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/30/looking-back-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"Looking back: comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/30/looking-back-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/30/looking-back-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Looking back: comedy","bodyText":"7 March 1873: Political satire at the theatre – political drama is a novelty, but people who care for art may regret its degradation by connection with the strife of parties. 1 September 1923: Clowning on the big screen – film critic CA Lejeune on Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and the art of slapstick comedy. 25 July 1925: Understanding the genius of Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. 9 June 1960: Norman Wisdom talks to his fans in Darwen, Lancashire, during filming of There Was a Crooked Man. 11 July 1963: John Cleese and Bill Oddie stand out in “Cambridge Circus”. 27 February 1972: Stop me if you’ve heard this one before...

The attractive, pocket-sized town at the southern end of Swansea Bay is so often bypassed in the scramble to get to Three Cliffs Bay, Rhossili and the other highlights of the Gower. The vast majority of visitors to the peninsula miss out on both the picturesque seal-strewn coast to the south of what is (whisper it) a suburb of Swansea and cracking little finds such as Langland Cove guesthouse. Over the past four years, Carwyn and Sarah – as friendly and welcoming a couple as you’re likely to meet – have turned this B&amp;B into a place anyone might like to call home. “It was originally built as an inn,” Sarah tells my friend Ana and me, proffering a faded black-and-white postcard showing the building in its Victorian incarnation. It was converted into student accommodation and then into a guesthouse. “Not long after we bought it,” local boy Carwyn adds, “we were approached by [Swansea-based designer] Tamsin Leech-Griffiths, who asked us if we could be her first ever interiors project.” Bravely but wisely, they said yes. Tamsin, a former fashion designer for Toast and Paul Smith, chose chocolate browns, greys and deep blues for the four en suite bedrooms, furnishing them in unfussy contemporary style. Twin anglepoise lamps over the beds are perhaps the only detailing that cries, “Hey, look at me!” The telly is a sideshow rather than a focal point, and the walls are a miniature gallery of local landscape paintings, all for sale. (“We don’t take a commission, so everything goes to the artists,” Carwyn points out.) There are slippers and robes, and a mini-fridge containing milk and real coffee for the cafetière, and a plate of homemade bite-size cakes. Before arriving we’d let rip at LC Swansea, Wales’s largest water park, being patiently coached to something approaching surfing prowess on the wave machine, before tackling the climbing wall. Somewhat broken, we hobbled across to 29-storey Meridian Tower – the tallest building in Wales, apparently – and its top-floor Grape and Olive restaurant. The food was unspectacular but the views of Swansea Bay were peachy – or would have been but for an ill-timed sea fret that enveloped the tower. Breakfast at Langland Cove next day is served at a communal table. We’re a multinational gathering, talking over the troubles of the world and agreeing that there are a mighty bad lot of people in charge right now. “Some mornings I come in and there’s silence,” Carwyn tells us, “but it usually works.” We resist pancakes and maple syrup and start with freshly made strawberry-and-banana smoothies. Ana gives her eggs Benedict the thumbs up while I tuck into granola, toast and raspberry jam – all homemade, as is a chutney whose ingredients were grown on Sarah and Carwyn’s allotment. Afterwards, we stroll around the scenic Gower Coast Path; partake of joyously mindless feats of hand-eye coordination at the slots by Mumbles Pier; poke about medieval Oystermouth Castle; and lunch alfresco at Verdi’s on the seafront. At length, we head back the short distance to Swansea for a tour of 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Dylan Thomas’s birthplace. It’s a fitting finish: Swansea is on the shortlist for UK City of Culture 2021. So best go now, before everyone’s shouting about Mumbles. • Accommodation was provided by Langland Cove (doubles from £85 B&amp;B, 01792 366003, langlandcove.co.uk). The whole house, which sleeps eight, is also available as a self-catering holiday let.

The country is facing a tremendous challenge to support them; there is no specific legal framework or adequate public support after years of austerity. Insufficient funding means there are only 1,130 places in shelters on the mainland while 1,650 children wait in camps, reception centres, safe zones and detention – or are reported to be homeless. In preparation for a seminar we hosted this week to address approaches to meet the needs of unaccompanied children, I visited Greece to meet municipality officials in Athens and NGOs working with the children to assess the situation. After the end of the EU relocation scheme, the failure of the Dubs scheme and the pitfalls of the Dublin regulation, the situation is grave. Many unaccompanied children are under the protective custody of the police, meaning that in the absence of an alternative, they are detained in cells. To address this, the police have been liaising with NGOs working in hotspots [pdf] to create safe zones as an alternative to detention and to integrate all procedures – from asylum to education. Transfers to the mainland were previously done by the police but this was traumatic for the children, so NGOs such as Metadrasi have stepped in. “Some of these children may be in a camp for up to a year until they are transferred, subject to smuggling, drug abuse or violence,” says Lora Pappa, president of Metadrasi. There are more than 600 complex cases in camps, including children in need of drug rehabilitation and those experiencing sexual abuse or violence. The situation is particularly difficult on Samos, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea near Turkey, where there is a strong trafficking network. “An increasing number of children are coming to Athens but NGOs do not have the professional expertise to address psychological and challenging behaviours,” says Pappa. Greece’s National Centre for Social Solidarity (Ekka) is responsible for taking unaccompanied children from the islands to shelters on the mainland, but there are not enough shelters to meet the need. Recently, Unicef agreed to fund an online database that will highlight the situation of children in reception centres and the waiting time for referral. Relevant professionals will also have access to the children’s referral documents containing their social history and vulnerability criteria, such as age, gender, health issues and place of stay – especially if they are in detention. NGOs say the Dubs scheme to bring 60 children to the UK has failed – not one application succeeded. They are particularly critical about the case of a child with cystic fibrosis [pdf] – an illness that is difficult to treat in Greece but easily treated in the UK – who had an uncle and could have been transferred under the reunification principle. But I have also heard positive stories. Under Article 17 of the Dublin agreement, NGOs have reached a deal with the Portuguese government to take a number of unaccompanied children. Some 35 of them have already been placed with foster families, mainly in Athens and Thessaloniki. But this is a small number compared with the thousands still waiting. The numbers of unaccompanied children arriving in Europe have not peaked. In fact, there has been an increase in arrivals on the Greek islands in the past few months. On Samos and Lesbos, the camps are overstretched with more than 200 unaccompanied children, 170 over their average capacity. Without proper frameworks and services, many children disappear when they reach mainland Greece. It is essential that EU governments support Greece in caring for and relocating these vulnerable children.

Bloomberg argued that “it is really hard to understand why a country that was doing so well wanted to ruin it” with the Brexit vote, in a series of outspoken remarks made at a technology conference in Boston a fortnight ago. At that event, Bloomberg, 75, also warned that some workers at the financial media company that bears his name were asking to leave the UK and US because they think the two countries no longer like immigrants and are no longer welcoming. The CEO was in London on Tuesday to open a new European headquarters for Bloomberg in the City, covering 1.3 hectares (3.2 acres). But his earlier remarks, unearthed the same day, suggested he had regrets about making the investment decision because of the Brexit vote. “We are opening a brand new European headquarters in London – two big, expensive buildings. Would I have done it if I knew they were going to drop out? I’ve had some thoughts that maybe I wouldn’t have, but we are there, we are going to be very happy. “My former wife was a Brit, my daughters have British passports, so we love England – it’s the father of our country, I suppose. But what they are doing is not good and there is no easy way to get out of it because if they don’t pay a penalty, everyone else would drop out. So they can’t get as good of a deal as they had before.” He added: “I did say that I thought it was the single stupidest thing any country has ever done but then we Trumped it.” Bloomberg employs 4,000 staff in the UK and 20,000 worldwide, and the New York-based firm has long made the country its headquarters in Europe. But he said some staff were becoming unhappy about London as a key location. “One of the things that is hurting us both in the United States and in the UK is that we have employees, not a lot but some, who are starting to say: ‘I don’t want to work here – can we transfer to some place else? This country doesn’t like immigrants,’” Bloomberg said. “All this talk in Washington – words have consequences. Whether we change the immigration laws or not, there is general feeling around the world that America is no longer an open, welcoming place and a lot of people don’t want to go there, and the same thing is happening in the UK because of Brexit.” Bloomberg first made the comments about Brexit at the little-reported HUBweek conference in Boston less than two weeks ago – and then repeated his quip about Brexit and Trump at an event in France on Monday. “It is really hard to understand why a country that was doing so well wanted to ruin it,” Bloomberg said of Brexit. “It was not a smart thing to do and getting out of it is going to be very difficult and is going to be very painful. It will hurt industries. People are already taking space in other cities over there [Europe], us included.” On his visit to London, Bloomberg was more circumspect. Giving a speech next to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, Bloomberg insisted his company was “strongly committed to London”. He added: “Whatever London and the UK’s relationship to the EU proves to be, London’s language, timezone, talent, infrastructure and culture all position it to grow as a global capital for years to come. We are very optimistic about London’s future and we are really excited to be a part of it.” Bloomberg is worth an estimated $47.5bn (£36.2bn) according to Forbes and was given an honorary knighthood in 2015. He was a Republican mayor of New York between 2002 and 2013 before he reassumed his position as chief executive of Bloomberg. Bloomberg considering standing as a third-party candidate in the 2016 US presidential election but eventually ruled it out, saying that if he stood it could diminish the Democratic vote and lead to the election of Trump. “That is not a risk I can take in good conscience,” Bloomberg said in March 2016 when he confirmed his decision not to stand. His criticism of Brexit included hitting out at the leave campaign and its claims that Britain had problems with immigration and too much EU regulation. Bloomberg described comments from Boris Johnson that the EU rules meant there had to be at least four bananas in a bunch as “fictitious” and said on immigration that Britain “didn’t take anyone from northern Africa or the Middle East”. He added: “They didn’t have an immigration problem and they didn’t need control of their borders. They have the English Channel – that gave them control of their borders.” Bloomberg said London was the centre of Europe but warned that was “not going to be as true any more” due to Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/a-year-on-from-trumps-pussy-grab-nothing-has-changed","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"A year on from Trump’s pussy grab, nothing has changed | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/a-year-on-from-trumps-pussy-grab-nothing-has-changed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/29/a-year-on-from-trumps-pussy-grab-nothing-has-changed","fields":{"headline":"A year on from Trump’s pussy grab, nothing has changed","bodyText":"Our intentions are good but our memories are short. It was exactly a year ago that the recording of Trump boasting about that “pussy grab” led to an online flood of women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault. There were the formative flashings, the inappropriate doctors, there were women who relived the abuse they’d suffered as children, tweeting into space and risking plenty in order to affect change. It was exciting! Do you remember 2016? When hope existed? Before the sky turned orange, and the winds came? That whole campaign felt important, a step forward. It felt as if by shining this honest light on women’s daily harassments and horrific assaults men would understand the gritty texture of our lives and never cross a boundary again. It felt big, like there was no going back. Men responded to that outpouring with shock. They’d known it happened of course, they just hadn’t known. After publishing a column about that thread of assaults I received a load of emails from readers with their own stories – something had been uncorked, and women who’d never talked before about the crap they’d faced at 15 were encouraged now to shout about it. Partly out of solidarity. There was a huge feeling of warmth, of arms being linked, a reminder that you should not feel shame about having been victimised by a shitty man. But mainly these women were choosing to dredge up some of the worst moments of their lives in order to kick at the struts holding up powerful men, and to prevent a similar thing happening to somebody else. And then time happened. It is one year later, and all that’s different is what’s playing on the radio. Post-Weinstein, women have been sharpening their experiences, again of harassment and assault, again into little hashtagged spears. A Twitter campaign is not the perfect solution to inequality, sure. Lumping Weinstein in with every other sexist dick in the world seems often to be very kind on Weinstein. But again shock has been expressed. People had known it happened of course, they just hadn’t known, their memories now the length of half a piece of string. Which has left me standing here like, “Wait…?” Squinting as though watching a Black Mirror Christmas special on a very small screen, a story where every year as winter rolls in women’s memories are harvested, our minds sluiced out with milk ready for spring. Because we literally Just. Did. This. We told these stories, we talked about what it meant, we prepared ourselves for a change that never came. So what was the point? How does the value of solidarity we gain from these campaigns weigh against the price of the pounds of flesh shared, when the abusers of power we’re seeking to topple remain largely untouched? After all, Weinstein’s big crime was to promote his liberalism while quietly assaulting women; Trump made no such mistake. It was Weinstein’s hypocrisy that got him – the women’s voices still don’t appear to be the things driving change from the front seat. From my home on the internet, what initially felt like a tsunami, thousands of women shouting, powerful, now feels more like rain. Just weather, late October. We’re still talking, but women’s confessionals are cheap today, and many (particularly those for whom sharing stories of abuse will have immediate consequences, and those who, upon reading others accounts of rape and assault will be forced to revisit their own carefully compartmentalised memories) feel undersold. Women have been expected to fight every side of this battle, providing evidence, commentary, their bloodied bodies and patience. But at some point, surely, the victims of power should no longer be held responsible for proving it’s damaging. Women have laid out their experiences of abuse end-to-end, again and again, and now it’s time for men to follow it as a path for change. They’ve been shouting for years, they need reassurance that all this has not been for nothing. It’s someone else’s turn now. Ending abuse is not a women’s issue, nor women’s responsibility. And we owe it to every one of the people who took a risk by sharing their story online to make sure our memories don’t fail us, or them, again.

Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. Each week in the Deuce we watch Candy put on her makeup. It has become a recurring motif. Sitting in the sanctuary of her small but comfortable apartment, she applies the second skin she wears to walk the streets, as we look on. As she concentrates we try to work out what she’s thinking. Even in the good moments, our conclusions are rarely heartening. This week we watch Candy painstakingly covering the results of an awful assault. A “client” beat her so badly she had to report herself to a hospital emergency room. But we do not see her convalesce. The next time she is on screen, Candy is covering her cuts and bruises, and we can tell that she has done this before. What we don’t know is why she puts herself through it. She needs the money, yes, but there’s also something else. The pimp Rodney has deduced this point. In his latest attempt to persuade Candy to work for him, Rodney starts with the usual noises – “You and me? Out here I’m talking world famous, baby” – but before long, he zooms in on her wounds. He recalls the other times she has been beaten in lengthy detail and wonders why she puts herself through it. Why is she even on the street in the first place? Something must have driven her there, he says: “Did Daddy pass you round his work buddies?” Candy says nothing in response. Crying, she walks away down 42nd street. In the episode’s penultimate scene, we see Candy again. She is back with the porn director who doesn’t put film in his camera. He says yes, they can work together, and actually he’s found a loophole in state law that might mean they could start doing things a little differently. But the director has seen through the makeup, too. You will need two weeks before you’re camera ready, he says. Candy smiles, but you can tell it hurts. It can be hard to watch the continual degradation of Candy, the freest, wildest spirit on the Deuce. Even if she’s not entirely likable, you root for her. You want her to improve her life and escape the straits she is in. Through her we see how hard life is on the street. But we see things from other perspectives, too. Like that of Rochelle, the girl Darlene brought from North Carolina on a promise of becoming a model. In this episode, the 16-year-old Rochelle is not only dumped in the most dangerous part of a very dangerous city, she is given to a pimp who then sells her to another without her knowledge, never mind her consent. Yet Rochelle seems curiously unperturbed by all of it. The one thing she is sure of, Rochelle tells Darlene, is that she is not going back on the bus. Even when she asks the street girls how bad it can get should a girl fail to pay her pimp, her enquiry is seemingly made less out of fear than a desire to get the facts straight. Is she naive or fatalistic? Expecting the worst in life and how it might affect the way you live is one of the interesting considerations thrown up by the Deuce. Rochelle might be someone who thinks like this, and maybe Darlene, too. Abby, meanwhile, is not. The white, upper-middle-class girl is determined to be part of the seedy world of midtown Manhattan, but only on her terms. So when Darlene turns out to have accepted Abby’s act of largesse, a bus ticket home, and used it to recruit more girls for Larry the pimp, Abby is incandescent. This is not the way she expected to be treated – it was not the right thing to do. Darlene, for her part, looks momentarily shocked when confronted but quickly returns to normal. What did Abby expect? Abby also gets pulled up short by Vince who points out that, actually, she should be wearing a leotard like every other woman who works at the Hi-Hat. Vince is upset because Abby brought her student boyfriend into the bar. He thought that Abby was infatuated with him. Abby, meanwhile, thought similar of Vince, that he was an enamoured benefactor. Both have had their fantasies dispelled. Otherwise, Vince has a quiet week, accepting Richie Pipilo’s invitation to run a “massage parlour” on the mob’s behalf after brother-in-law Bobby nominates himself to manage it. For some reason, I am not sure that irascible union man Bobby is the best person to be gladhanding mobsters and their by-the-hour molls. Call it a gut feeling. Notes and queries We finally get to enter New York’s nascent gay scene this week as we accompany Paul on a drug-fuelled night out. A man who seems somehow to have retained an innocence despite living most of his life in secret, he has a fine time in a room filled with colourful balloons, picks up a handsome young man and brings him home. Paul’s strait-laced lawyer housemate is woken up in the process. No matter, a couple becomes a threesome and everyone is happy. For now at least. Abby’s student mates take a poll on whether to go watch Clint Eastwood in Play Misty for Me or Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs. They choose Clint, and I second that choice. What about you? Officer Chris Ralston is working the hard yards in his attempt to make crusading journalist Sandra fall for him. He’s persuaded the pimp Reggie Love to allow her to interview him (at $40 a pop). He’s also still sceptical about the relation between the city and the mob. As is Sandra to be fair. Maybe they will bond over that. Reggie Love: “The first rule of pimping is to look a man in the eye when you’re talking to him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/oct/25/to-recruit-more-black-students-we-must-demystify-oxbridge-admissions","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T10:33:37Z","webTitle":"To recruit more black students, we must demystify Oxbridge admissions | Raph Mokades","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/25/to-recruit-more-black-students-we-must-demystify-oxbridge-admissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/25/to-recruit-more-black-students-we-must-demystify-oxbridge-admissions","fields":{"headline":"To recruit more black students, we must demystify Oxbridge admissions","bodyText":"Black Britons are prominent in British athletics, among our best writers and musicians, and increasingly visible in our world-beating financial and legal industries. So why aren’t more black faces seen at the UK’s elite academic institutions? Labour MP David Lammy recently pitched a grenade into this debate, accusing Oxford and Cambridge universities of practising “social apartheid”. Lammy drew attention to data confirming the under-representation of black and working-class students with top A-level results at Oxbridge. The statistics were disappointing and the upset understandable. Critics argue that Britain’s two most prominent academic champions have been especially slow to harness diverse talent, with an admissions process that effectively discriminates in favour of white, middle-class students. The universities dispute this, with their defenders arguing that schools do not send enough bright black candidates their way. We have also heard warnings of a lack of “ethnic mixing” in British universities, with young students from ethnic minorities avoiding less diverse parts of the country for fear of being ostracised and excluded. Research suggests they are concentrating themselves in a relatively small number of “super diverse” new universities in London and other big cities. The problem is not Oxbridge’s alone to solve; there is no single issue to be addressed, but rather a complicated ensemble of factors. This starts with the fact that Oxford’s sandstone walls look like impervious bastions of privilege to many young people from low-income or ethnic-minority households. Some fear cultural isolation and institutional bias. Others have financial concerns, in spite of the generous scholarships on offer at some colleges. That’s before one even gets to the application process, which is a minefield for the uninitiated. Most universities accept applications until January, Oxbridge requires them in October. It sets extra exams, which schools must invigilate. College interviews are stomach-wrenching prospects. For almost anyone, it’s a daunting system to navigate, but it’s even harder if you don’t have savvy teachers or academic role models. The reality is that many black pupils simply choose not to apply to Oxbridge. Those who do apply are less likely to get in. This is partly because they achieve lower grades on average and are disproportionately likely to apply for the most competitive courses, such as law and medicine. Black pupils also tend to struggle in interviews, a process naturally more suited to those with what might loosely be termed middle-class traits – the “dinner party” conversational training that forms part of growing up in relatively privileged circumstances. Some say elite universities should limit academic selection to boost social mobility. But is root-and-branch reform really necessary to ensure that access to Oxbridge is fair and merit-based? I would argue not. I run Target Oxbridge, a programme offering African and Caribbean students personalised advice on A-level choices and the university application process. It also involves regular contact with black Oxbridge graduates to provide role models and visits to both universities to demystify their dreaming spires. Sponsored by the universities themselves, the aim is to help bust some of the misconceptions about life there. Our programme has helped 46 black students receive offers, including 16 this year, at a success rate of 36% – well above the national average of around 20%. A photograph of black Cambridge students posing proudly in an ivy-clad quadrangle, which recently went viral in the media, features two Target Oxbridge alumni. It’s important too that Oxford and Cambridge recognise the problem and make strenuous efforts to improve the chances of black 18-year-olds getting into institutions befitting their talents. It’s heartening to see both universities now make extensive use of contextual data to identify potential in students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Oxford also sends outreach officers around the country in a bid to change perceptions and bring some diversity to its quads. As with all measures to address diversity, none of the solutions will change things overnight, but greater awareness of the problem is a start, and building on these first steps will be essential. But elite universities cannot work in isolation and improving diversity requires a coordinated effort between universities, schools and third-sector organisations. Target Oxbridge is just one partner helping to connect the universities to talented students who might otherwise be beyond its reach. And it is certainly working. Commentators are right to rail against the limited numbers of black students at the UK’s top universities. But they are wrong if they think this is a problem that can’t be solved within the current system.

Hollywood’s latest book hits the shelves next Thursday – two days after the final of the first series of Channel 4’s new-look Bake Off is broadcast. “It will be huge, no doubt about it,” said Nigel Newton, chief executive of Bloomsbury. “Cookery books, both from the brilliant Paul Hollywood and other major chefs, have been a major strength of the industry over the last decade.” Channel 4 poached Bake Off from the BBC in a £75m three-year deal. A spin-off show starring Hollywood, also called A Baker’s Life, begins broadcasting in November – perfect timing to promote his new book in the run-up to Christmas. He was offered the four-part show as part of an estimated £1.5m three-year deal to keep him with the Bake Off franchise. Hollywood was the only one of the BBC’s original lineup of fellow judge Mary Berry, and co-hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc to make the move to Channel 4. Newton cited cookery publishing as one of Bloomsbury’s “great strengths” – this year’s hits include Tom Kerridge’s Lose Weight for Good and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River Cottage Much More Veg. Hollywood’s £25-a-pop Bloomsbury book How to Bake has shifted more than 200,000 copies since its publication in 2012, according to Nielsen Book Research. Newer releases by the baker have seen diminishing returns. His most recent one, The Weekend Baker, published by Michael Joseph, has sales of only 11,000. However, Hollywood remains a star baker in the publishing stakes, having sold almost 700,000 books, worth more than £7m, in the last five years, according to Nielsen. Bloomsbury, which also publishes the Harry Potter books, reported strong first-half trading, with revenues climbing 15% to £72m in the six months to the end of August, as JK Rowling’s boy wizard franchise shows no signs of slowing down, 20 years after the first book was published. The franchise saw a 40% sales revenue surge in the first half, driving a 33% surge in revenues in its children’s publishing arm as special editions and spin-offs continue to prove popular. The publisher is also benefiting from George Saunders’s Man Booker prize win for Lincoln in the Bardo, with Newton saying that it has seen a “tremendous boost in sales” since the award last Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/24/jared-o-mara-homophobic-sexist-internet-history","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T11:33:53Z","webTitle":"Jared O’Mara’s comments were vile.

Now he has to show he’s changed","bodyText":"Jared O’Mara has to prove he has been on a journey. Around 15 years ago, the Labour MP for Sheffield Hallam wrote vile homophobic and sexist comments online. If he had written them recently – including “poofters” and “fudgepackers” – he would have to resign as an MP. By explaining why he had these nefarious views and how he came to reject them, he can help set an example in what remains, after all, a society steeped in sexism and homophobia. Given allegations of far more recent sexism, O’Mara’s political future depends on showing he’s a man transformed. Committing to spending a lot of time – not a token meeting or two – being educated by LGBTQ activists, feminists and women’s charities would be a very good start indeed. Labour MP Naz Shah is a model case study here. After deploying antisemitic tropes, she went on a thorough journey, meeting representatives of the Jewish community, and subsequently making a detailed apology explaining her previous ignorance and what she had learned. That he expressed a combination of sexism and homophobia is grim but unsurprising. Homophobia is a byproduct of sexism. It is a means of policing what it means to be a man. Those who don’t conform to an unreconstructed form of masculinity are liable – certainly in their youth – to be subjected to homophobic abuse. “Stop being such a poof”, “are you bent or something?” and countless other derivatives. This teaches LGBTQ people from the earliest age that society regards them as inferior, and inflicts terrible – in some cases irreversible – mental damage on them. It also damages straight men too, incidentally, because they end up believing that talking about their feelings is “unmanly”, which is partly why the biggest killer of British men under 50 is suicide. The struggles of both feminism and LGBTQ activists has transformed social attitudes. British society is a story of millions of individual journeys. In 2003 – around the time of O’Mara’s indefensible comments – 40% of Brits thought sexual relations between two adults of the same sex was always or mostly wrong. Just 37% opted for “not wrong at all”. In last year’s survey – just 13 years later – 64% opted for “not wrong at all”. It represents an astonishing revolution in attitudes, and in such a short space of time – even if there is still so far to go. Of course, I am now open to the charge of hypocrisy. If this was a Tory MP, I would be demanding his immediate resignation – that’s what some of you are thinking. On my phone, I have messages from 2005, sent to me by a Tory who stood for parliament just months ago. If the polls had been right, he would now be an MP. He called me a “leftwing faggot” and described homosexuality as “unnatural and immoral”. If it was clear he had now abandoned this level of bigoted hatred, I would both forgive him and welcome the transformation in his attitudes. Without these journeys, after all, how will anything change? And indeed, the Tories made opposition to LGBTQ rights one of their defining political missions. From section 28 to age of consent to the right to adopt, this party has repeatedly attempted to subjugate and oppress LGBTQ people. Even equal marriage did not command the support of most Tory MPs. The Tory foreign secretary Boris Johnson makes repeated and unapologetic vile and bigoted comments, but receives no outpourings of Tory outrage. O’Mara has rightly resigned from the women and equalities committee; the Conservative Philip Davies – who has dedicated his political career to opposing women’s rights – remains. But unlike previous generations of MPs, younger MPs have a colossal digital footprint. Most MPs have said stupid, even unacceptable, comments in private: but the communications revolution means there is a permanent, public record of terrible things many have said in earlier days. If we don’t want identikit, robotic politicians, then we have to accept MPs who once sprayed their stupidity and bigotry online – as long as they prove they have learned from their mistakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/lamb-with-green-sauce-and-greens-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T11:30:14Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for lamb chops with greens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/lamb-with-green-sauce-and-greens-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/lamb-with-green-sauce-and-greens-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for lamb chops with greens","bodyText":"It seems a nice juxtaposition that, as the leaves change colour and fall into crisp piles or soggy heaps, recalling the remains of stewed tea, leafy vegetables are the most vigorous shades of green. In Rome, as I’ve mentioned before, the abundant favourite is cicoria (chicory), a cousin of dandelion with forest green, saw-edged leaves that are as bitter as a bad loser. There is also dark green chard with fleshy white stems, purple-tinged broccoli, and all shades of cabbage – savoy with its crinkled leaves being particularly handsome. Green too is the new olive oil, chartreuse with a hint of fluorescence, smelling not so much of autumn but spring and freshly cut grass. Those fortunate enough to have olive trees in the family and to be having a good year – olive trees are capricious – are probably still in the process of pressing and bottling now, their land humming with industry, their work repaid by the ephemeral ritual that is smelling and tasting just-pressed oil on bread or toast. The rest of us have to go and buy it from a press or shop. Even when days or weeks old though, new-season olive oil is still a grass-scented delight, the peppery kick at the back of your throat causing a cough. Extra virgin olive oil is the seasonal ingredient I look forward to most. It is our biggest kitchen expense, and the foundation and soul of pretty much everything we cook. First up, a good, useful, very green sauce or salsa verde – the recipe for which is a bit Roman, a bit Fergus Henderson and a bit my own. I have given quantites, but only as guidelines; as you can imagine, the proportions for a recipe including large amounts of herbs and such strong characters as anchovy and caper has to be personal. You can play around, add chopped boiled eggs or lemon zest, a little mashed potato, soft breadcrumbs, or a few chopped cornichons for their pleasing crunch. You can make green sauce in a food processor, but I tend to make it with a knife, because you get a pleasingly uneven rubble, somewhere between a salad and a sauce. And the scent of basil, parsley and mint rising up from the board as you chop is a sort of domestic rescue remedy, which is double strength if you add new-season oil, and triple if you add a medicinal sherry. The quantities below are for a jarful. As well as being good with lamb – its sharp saltiness both cutting through the fat and chaperoning the meat’s inherent sweetness – it is a happy companion for lots of meats and vegetables, and can be thinned into a feisty dressing. In short, a useful thing to have in the fridge. And then, to have with the green sauce: greens. Having been boiled, they are ripassati (re-passed) or strascinati – dragged around a hot pan with plenty of olive oil, crushed garlic and red chilli until each strand of green is glistening with oil and flavour. I have used chicory, but leafy and substantial spinach works, as does cabbage or any green you like really – just adjust cooking times accordingly. Someone once said that my lamb cutlets prepared Roman style (rib-thick and bashed out so they cook quickly) looked rather less than appealing. “Carcass” I think was the term they used. An understandable view, especially if you consider neat and plump lamb chops. I remember clearly the first time I saw cutlets prepared this way at what would become my local butcher here in Testaccio. Seeing the already small cuts given a mighty thwack with the back of a cleaver so the bone splintered and meat thinned took me by surprise. But this is a common way in Rome, for lamb that is to be cooked quickly in a pan alla scottadito (to “burn your fingers”) or impanato (in breadcrumbs) a golden coat in a hot pan, which keeps the meat even more tender. Whether its Roman‑style or slim chops, use the lamb you like best, deciding too if you want crumbs or not. For those of you who don’t eat lamb, grilled fish or cheese will work equally well with these two sorts of green. Lamb with green sauce and greens Serves 4 800g greens, such as chicory, leafy spinach or cabbage, washed 1 garlic clove, peeled, lightly pressed 1 small chilli,chopped or a pinch of red chilli flakes Olive or vegetable oil, for frying 8 small lamb cutlets/chops, 1 rib thick 1 large egg, beaten (optional) Dry breadcrumbs (optional) For the green sauce 30g each of mint/parsley and basil 8 anchovy fillets, drained and chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 tbsp capers, rinsed and chopped 1 tbsp lemon juice/red wine vinegar Extra virgin olive oil 1 Make the green sauce by picking the herbs from their stems, then chopping the leaves finely. Mix everything in a bowl or food processor with the lemon juice or vinegar and enough olive oil to make a spoonable sauce. 2 Add the greens to boiling salted water for 3 minutes, then drain thoroughly. 3 In a large frying or saute pan, warm the peeled clove of garlic (pressed so split but still intact) and the chilli in 5 tbsp olive oil until fragrant. Add the greens and stir until glistening with oil and flavour. 4 You can simply grill/griddle the lambs as is, in which case rub them with oil. Alternatively, dip each chop first in beaten egg then in dry breadcrumbs, shaking excess crumbs back into the dish. 5 Pour enough oil into a frying pan to reach a depth of 6mm. Put on the heat. Once hot, add as many chops as will fit without overcrowding. As soon as a golden crust has formed on one side, turn and cook the other side. Lift the chops from pan, sprinkle with salt and serve with the green sauce and greens.

Roberts, who has won 93 caps, led Wales against Tonga and Samoa in the summer and was praised by the management for his overall contribution to the two wins achieved by a largely reserve team. He was dropped from the starting lineup after the opening Test last season against Australia but his replacement, Scott Williams, has also been overlooked next month. The decision of Gatland, Wales’s head coach, to include the outside-halves Dan Biggar, Rhys Patchell, the recalled Rhys Priestland, who has impressed for Bath in the opening two months of the season, and Owen Williams gives him the option of having a playmaker at inside‑centre, as he did for the British &amp; Irish Lions in the final two Tests in New Zealand in the summer, when he picked Johnny Sexton and Owen Farrell. It is a ploy that Eddie Jones has used since taking over as England’s head coach after the 2015 World Cup. Wales changed their tactics last season, when Gatland was on sabbatical with the Lions but, other than relegating Roberts to the bench, tried to do so with largely the same personnel and they lost three of their matches in the Six Nations. Williams, who has played at 12 for Leicester and his current club Gloucester, has been preferred along with Priestland and Patchell to Sam Davies – Wales’s replacement outside‑half last season – whose slight frame, even with the decommissioning of “Warrenball”, has counted against him because he is not a midfield option. “The game is now about playmaking and offloading,” Gatland said. “It’s not so much the ball-in-play time, it’s the ability to keep possession for long periods. We’ve got players with attacking ability, but our set piece has to be good; scrum and defensively we have got to be strong as well. “What we also have to do is exploit the opportunities we might get in attack. We changed the way we played in New Zealand in 2016. It’s not like you are a club side with time, but we’ve got 13 days before the first game, and we will try and get up to speed. It might take time to change what we are trying to do in midfield.” Rhys Webb is one of two scrum‑halves in the squad. But after a change in the policy governing players who are based outside Wales, he will be ineligible to play for the national side next season because he is joining Toulon. Gatland said: “I was not involved in the process but I was pushed out in front of the media [last week] as if it were my policy. The arrangement we have now is better, but I feel for Rhys and hope that if we had an injury crisis at scrum-half that common sense would prevail and we could call on him. We are, though, at the mercy of others.” The head coach has named five uncapped players in his 36. They include the Scarlets’ New Zealand centre Hadleigh Parkes, who qualifies on residency in the week of the final match against South Africa, and the Ospreys centre Owen Watkin. Alun Wyn Jones retains the captaincy, but Gatland has shaken up his second rows with Luke Charteris and Bradley Davies left out for Cory Hill, Seb Davies and Rory Thornton, who have nine caps between them but all impressed in the summer. It is a relatively inexperienced squad given Wales’s trust over the years in players who have delivered, but two years out from the World Cup in Japan and after a couple of seasons of mixed results, Gatland is looking at players coming through, changing faces as well as style.

Gregor Townsend taking no risks with Scotland Gregor Townsend claims he will be taking no risks next month as he dismissed the possibility of fielding an experimental Scotland lineup during their autumn series. The head coach has named a 36-man squad for Tests against Samoa, New Zealand and Australia – including 10 uncapped players. He insisted they all deserve a place in his side but said: “We pick this team on form. We want players who are working hard and are on form because we need to be at our best when we take on Samoa, the All Blacks and Australia. We’ll be looking to put our best team out in all three games. It’s up to the players to play in all three. “We know we have to play at our best against these teams – but now is not the time to try things out that we’re not sure about. The way the players are playing for their club they should be standing up and saying: ‘I’m ready to play for Scotland.’ These guys are absolutely here because we think they are ready for that.” Townsend’s squad includes the uncapped centres Phil Burleigh and Chris Harris, wing Byron McGuigan and scrum-half Nathan Fowles as well as the front-row trio of Jamie Bhatti, George Turner and Darryl Marfo, lock Scott Cummings and back-row forwards Luke Hamilton and Jamie Ritchie. For the Newcastle centre Harris, Sale’s McGuigan – who is joint top of the Premiership try-scoring charts – the Welsh-born Leicester flanker Hamilton and the Edinburgh pair of Fowles and Marfo, this is their first involvement with the full Scotland set-up. The captain, Greig Laidlaw, misses out with a fractured ankle, while Richie Gray, Mark Bennett, Allan Dell, Alasdair Dickinson, Sean Maitland, Matt Scott, Fraser Brown and Duncan Taylor are also out with injury. The Harlequins wing Tim Visser, though, is a surprise absentee. However, there was good news for Townsend after the stand-in captain John Barclay overcame concussion worries to make himself available. The full-back Stuart Hogg and the wing Tommy Seymour also return to the fold after their involvement with the Lions last summer. “It’s a boost to have John back,” Townsend said. “He has now been training the last couple of games and has had no symptoms from his concussion. There are a few guys who would be in the squad who have the same length of injury, which is about two months. We expect them all to be playing before the Six Nations but Greig might be closer to the Six Nations than the likes of Fraser Brown and Duncan Taylor. It’s a shame he suffered his injury just two weeks out from the November Tests but these things happen and I’m sure he will come back strong.” Press Association Scotland Forwards S Berghan, J Bhatti, J Barclay, S Cummings, C du Preez, Z Fagerson, R Ford, G Gilchrist, J Gray, R Harley, L Hamilton, D Marfo, S McInally, WP Nel, J Ritchie, T Swinson, B Toolis, G Turner, R Wilson, H Watson.

His selection was bitterly criticised in a new book by the former Rugby Football Union director of professional rugby Rob Andrew who said: “Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell have always defended their position on this, but as far as I’m concerned they can say what they like: Burgess was a rogue ingredient in the mix, both before the tournament and during it, and his inclusion had a negative effect.” Burgess, however, who returned to rugby league in Australia swiftly after the World Cup debacle, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Rob wasn’t really around the camp, Rob didn’t see the work I put in, Rob didn’t see how I contributed to the squad. Rob’s sitting from – in my opinion – an outsider’s view. “I do disagree with him and I’m sure there are people out there who do know what happened, who understand what went down, how hard the training was, how hard I worked to get in that squad. “I’m very proud of my performance for England and what I contributed to the team. Unfortunately results didn’t go as we planned at that team but Rob’s entitled to his opinion. He’s trying to sell his book.” In the book, Andrew had stressed that he did not want to single out Burgess but said: “I would not even begin to pin the blame for our embarrassing World Cup misfire on a single player, but the kerfuffle around the introduction of Burgess was undeniably the tipping point. To this day, I simply do not understand the thinking behind the fast-tracking of a player from international rugby league to international rugby union when so many of the things that had made him wildly successful in the 13-man game were of questionable relevance in the 15-man version. It was an almighty risk to select him in a World Cup squad on such extremely limited and highly questionable evidence and it proved to be an almighty blunder.” After returning to rugby league with a contract with South Sydney, Burgess told the Guardian that he had no regrets about his time in union. “I was given a task at my club [Bath] to crack it as a six and we got to a Premiership final. I probably played one of my best games in that final but we lost to Saracens. I then got given the challenge to play 12 [for England]. There were four centres to be selected out of nine. I made the four, which took a lot of dedication. “People might forget I chased some serious goals. Fingers will always be pointed but deep down I wouldn’t change anything. The bottom line is that my heart didn’t lie there [in union] and I didn’t want to spend four more years doing something I didn’t quite love.” The dual-code international is now gearing up for another World Cup, in rugby league, and believes Wayne Bennett’s side can go one better than the semi-final showing of Steve McNamara’s class of 2013. Burgess was in the England team that lost to New Zealand in the semi-finals four years ago and was captain of the side that, despite having home advantage, failed to reach the final of the 2016 Four Nations Series. However, the South Sydney forward says preparations are going well. “We’re four years further down the track. I had a little look through the squad and I see what we’ve got now and, no disrespect to the squad we had then, but we’ve got a little bit more X-factor, a little bit more solidarity within the team. “It’s been together for 18 months and the similar 17, maybe 19 players have been used. The combinations are a bit tighter and the camaraderie is great. “We’ve got a really good chance over the next six weeks. But it’s down to how hard you work when it gets hard on the field. Games can be won in the last few seconds and that’s what it takes at this level, to concentrate right up until the final whistle. “The mood is great. We’ve had a great week and a half over in Perth and now we’re in Melbourne. The boys are relaxed and trained extremely hard. We’ve prepared really well. We’re looking forward to it. It’s going to be a great start to the World Cup on Friday, it’ll be a physical game. We’re more than ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/29/the-eco-guide-to-period-dramas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"The eco guide to sanitary products","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/29/the-eco-guide-to-period-dramas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/29/the-eco-guide-to-period-dramas","fields":{"headline":"The eco guide to sanitary products","bodyText":"This column nearly didn’t happen. When a manufacturer of eco friendly menstrual pads bounded up to me and asked me brightly in public: “Are you a flusher or a binner?” I stared at her in total horror. Menstrual products and their disposal represent one of the last great consumer taboos – odd in a society which cheerfully discusses the vajazzle. It’s a taboo that powers a huge environmental issue. In their 2016 beach clean-up, the Marine Conservation Society found 20 tampons and sanitary items per 100 metres of shoreline. But City to Sea, the campaign group based in Bristol dedicated to ridding the ocean of plastic, has no qualms about going there. Their upbeat and to-the-point videos are social media sensations. Plastic Free Periods! points out that some sanitary pads contain up to four plastic bags worth of plastic. Nobody would flush plastic bags down the loo, so why feminine care products? Martha Silcott noted that binning was often fraught with embarrassment so launched Fablittlebag to prevent tampons being flushed in the first place. The bag is opaque, can be opened with one hand, seals closed and is biodegradable. Compare this brilliantly disruptive product with the backwards move from mass market brands who have recently instigated a switch from using cardboard applicators for tampons to plastic ones in pastel shades. These now litter coastlines everywhere. Quite why femcare brands think they can get away with this is not clear. Why not avoid them altogther and embrace the rise of the reusables? This has been spearhead by Mooncup, a reusable menstrual cup that has gained a serious fanbase. Fortunately they’re happy to shout about it, too. The big picture: back to the polluted past Enraged by President Trump’s rollback of environmental legislation, friends of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have begun releasing its back catalogue of photographs from the 1970s, including this snapshot of an illegal dumping area in New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, in March 1973. The pictures show why the establishment of the EPA in 1970 was so necessary in the first place. Well dressed: from old firehoses to Burberry bags The UK social enterprise Elvis &amp; Kresse was originally created to turn red rubber ex-London fire brigade fire hoses into luxury accessories. After performing that waste miracle, the brand has moved on to crafting accessories from unloved materials. Now in a five-year partnership with Burberry, the Elvis &amp; Kresse Kent workshop is busily transforming 120 tonnes of leather offcuts and scraps from landfill into a new range of bags and belts. The first product (shown here, the Fire &amp; Hide clutch with detachable strap) looks great and is well-priced too. Although £150 is no snip, it is the most cost-effective way of getting a bag from Burberry without the full brand price tag. Half of the profits from the new range will be donated to charitable causes including financing apprenticeships to foster craftspeople of the future.

Downing Street issued a rebuke to the MP Chris Heaton-Harris on Tuesday, telling reporters he had not been acting in his capacity as a government whip when he wrote the letter to university leaders asking for details of professors lecturing on Brexit matters. “Chris Heaton-Harris wrote to universities in his capacity as an MP, not as a representative of the government,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. “I think what the prime minister has always been very clear on is her respect for the freedom and independence of universities and the role they play in creating open and stimulating debate.” Asked if he would take the opportunity to reassure universities, he said: “The letter was sent in a personal capacity. Free speech is one of the foundations on which our universities are built and of course it should be respected.” The Guardian revealed Heaton-Harris, the Conservative MP for Daventry and a staunch Eurosceptic, wrote to vice-chancellors at the start of this month asking for the names of any professors involved in teaching European affairs “with particular reference to Brexit”. The letter gave no explanation for the request, but asked for a copy of each university’s syllabus and any online lectures on Brexit. After Downing Street disowned the letter, Heaton-Harris tweeted: The MP has not responded to requests for an explanation for why the letter was sent. Lord Patten, the chancellor of the University of Oxford, called the letter an “extraordinary example of outrageous and foolish behaviour – offensive and idiotic Leninism”. “I couldn’t believe that it had come from a Conservative MP,” he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, saying he believed most vice-chancellors would dismiss it. “I think he must be an agent of [Labour leader] Mr Corbyn intent on further increasing the number of young people who want to vote Labour.” Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons and a fellow leave supporter, defended Heaton-Harris’s intentions. She said it was a “very courteous and not at all threatening letter”, adding: “Universities are bastions of free speech so to be so horrified at somebody asking a simple question with no caveat or demands either implicit or explicit in it, it seems to me to be a bit odd that they should react in such a negative way.” Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said Heaton-Harris was acting like a “pound shop McCarthy” and said he must explain his motivation. “It would be deeply ironic if, even as the universities minister was unveiling his latest unworkable gimmick in the name of free speech, a senior Tory colleague was busy compiling a register of heretics,” she said. “The last thing universities need is some kind of pound shop McCarthy telling them what they are allowed to teach. “Academics and students are perfectly capable of critical thinking and discussion about policy issues like Brexit. If only we could say the same about Tory ministers.” Layla Moran, The Liberal Democrats’ education spokeswoman, called for Heaton-Harris to be sacked from his role as a whip. The Oxford MP has written to Theresa May asking her to contact universities to make clear they are in no way obliged to provide the information requested. Moran said the MP must explain himself. “This chilling letter could have come straight out of a dystopian novel,” she said. “Conservative Brexiteers know they have lost the intellectual debate and now appear to be engaging in a witch-hunt. Theresa May must condemn this letter and clarify why this information was being sought by a government whip. It is vital that the government makes clear that universities are free to teach whatever they see fit.” The Universities and Colleges Union said it would push for Jo Johnson, the higher education minister, to strongly condemn the “McCarthyite” letter. Sally Hunt, the union’s general secretary, said: “This attempt by Chris Heaton-Harris to compile a hit-list of professors has the acrid whiff of McCarthyism about it and Jo Johnson must disown it in the strongest terms. “Our universities and colleges must lead the way in defending academic freedom, where received wisdom can be challenged and controversial ideas debated.” It is understood that few, if any, universities will respond positively to the MP’s request for details of their teaching on Brexit, with many publicly saying they have no intention of complying. Johnson tweeted that the government was committed to protecting academic freedom, as criticism of Heaton-Harris’s letter mounted. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, has put down two parliamentary questions asking what the purpose of Heaton-Harris’s letter was. “I’ve asked the prime minister whether he was acting on her behalf when he wrote to universities – and why it happened,” she said. “Academic freedom is absolutely essential in a democracy, and the government must now withdraw this letter and guarantee that this kind of veiled threat to universities won’t be repeated in the future.” Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, told the Guardian he had felt a chill down his spine when he read the “sinister” request. “This letter just asking for information appears so innocent but is really so, so dangerous,” he said. “Here is the first step to the thought police, the political censor and newspeak, naturally justified as ‘the will of the British people’, a phrase to be found on Mr Heaton-Harris’s website.” Academics specialising in European affairs said they saw the letter as a major intrusion into their work. Prof Hartmut Mayer, director of the European Studies Centre at Oxford University, said: “It is absolutely absurd for an MP to request this information and to think that academic freedom can be interfered with in this way. “We teach Brexit in many shapes and forms and we try to provide a debating forum. Of course there is a majority view in universities – but we want to encourage an open discussion on Brexit.” Vice-chancellors told the Guardian they had no intention of complying with the MP’s request. Prof Colin Riordan, of Cardiff University, a member of the Russell Group of universities, said: “Our academics are free to teach topics including Brexit as they see fit. If Mr Heaton-Harris wants to understand their work he should attend some of our classes or consult our website or directory of experts.” Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ umbrella group, demanded that Heaton-Harris explain his motives. “This request suggests an alarming attempt to censor or challenge academic freedom,” he said. Prof Paul O’Prey, of Roehampton University, said Brexit would be an increasingly important topic for universities to teach and research. “In the academic arena scrutiny will always be carried out objectively, independently and without fear or favour,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/irish-man-ibrahim-halawa-returns-home-after-four-years-in-egyptian-prison","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T13:09:25Z","webTitle":"Irish man to campaign for prisoners abroad after four years in Egyptian jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/irish-man-ibrahim-halawa-returns-home-after-four-years-in-egyptian-prison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/irish-man-ibrahim-halawa-returns-home-after-four-years-in-egyptian-prison","fields":{"headline":"Irish man to campaign for prisoners abroad after four years in Egyptian jail","bodyText":"An Irish man jailed for four years in Egypt has vowed to work for other people incarcerated overseas after he returned to Dublin on Tuesday. Ibrahim Halawa was 17 when he was arrested while on holiday in Cairo, after becoming caught up in protests over the removal of the then Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi. He was freed late last week, about a month after he was acquitted of all charges relating to the protest. Speaking after an emotional reunion with family, friends and supporters after flying into Dublin airport, Halawa said: “I need to get some medical checks. I’m going to take some time off, my mum is sick, so I’ll be taking some time by her side.” “I have left a lot of cellmates behind. There’s a lot of innocent people behind bars around the world, not just in Egypt.” Halawa added that his experience of incarceration abroad has made him want to work for Irish prisoners overseas. “Even if they are criminals or if they have been convicted I’m going to be asking for them to come back to do their time in Ireland,” he said. “I felt how it is to be away from home.” Halawa’s family, human rights groups, Irish politicians and the Department of Foreign Affairs have spent four years in a protracted legal battle to have him freed. Halawa, the son of prominent Dublin Muslim cleric Sheikh Hussein Halawa, was a student at the time of the mass arrests in the Egyptian capital. His three sisters, Somaia, Fatima and Omaima, were also arrested, but later released on bail and returned to Dublin. They were acquitted following trial in absentia. In a September 2016 article for the Guardian, Halawa described conditions in Egyptian jails. “Each time you are transferred to a new prison, there is something called ‘the party’, he wrote. “They show you who’s boss. In most cases it’s beatings, but in one, we were stripped, told to lie down facing the ground with our arms behind our back, and they started to jump on our backs, from one prisoner to the next. “It’s normal to be cursed, stripped naked, beaten with a bar, or put in solitary confinement or the ‘tank. (a pitch-black 3.5m x 5.5m cell). They might also torture another prisoner in front of you. Of course you never forget. Ever.” Omaima Halawa said her brother would return to new nieces and nephews he had not seen before. “He hasn’t seen my dad for four years, and we haven’t seen him for four years,” she said. “All these questions that you used to know about your brother, you’re going to be learning them again.” Halawa had undertaken a series of hunger strikes in protest against his detention, and at one stage he became so weak that he used a wheelchair, his family has said. Maya Foa, director of the charity Reprieve, which has campaigned for Halawa’s freedom, said he had been through a hellish ordeal. “His release and return home to Ireland is long overdue,” Foa said. “Ibrahim’s ordeal has shone a light on the gross abuses perpetrated by the Egyptian regime – including the use of mass trials, torture and the death penalty for children and non-violent protesters. Ireland and the international community should call on Egypt to end these abuses.” Foa pointed out that Egypt has handed down thousands of death sentences in mass trials since protests in 2013. Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, one of the Irish politicians who worked to secure Halawa’s release, told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that while he was excited about coming home, “there will be difficult days ahead as well when he comes to terms with the fact that he has lost out on those four years”. Halawa said he wanted to get his “life straight” and added that he was looking forward to a plate of fish and chips.

The company told its passengers in September that from 1 November they would have to pay £5 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at their departure gate. Following the flight cancellations fiasco that grounded 400,000 ticket holders, however, and a continuing fight with pilots over pay, Ryanair said it would delay the new bag policy until mid-January. The airline said customers needed more time to get used to the policy, particularly with the busy Christmas period just weeks away. Ryanair’s head of marketing, Kenny Jacobs, said: “We will delay the introduction of our new cabin bag rules until 15 January 2018, to allow our customers more time to familiarise themselves with the policy changes.” The new policy will prevent passengers from bringing a wheelie-size bag into the aircraft unless they have paid for priority boarding. Passengers who have not done so can still go to the departure gate with a wheelie bag and a small secondary bag – such as a handbag – but the larger bag will be taken away and put in the hold. Travellers will then have to wait at their destination airport for the bag to be delivered on carousels. Ryanair is also increasing the maximum weight for checked-in luggage from 15kg to 20kg. The airline said the new bag policy was essential because there was not enough overhead cabin space for the volume of carry-on bags that passengers were bringing on board, which it said was causing boarding and flight delays. Ryanair said in September the move would cost it €50m (£44.6m) in reduced fees for checked baggage, but critics regard it as a ruse to increase the number of people paying for priority boarding. The delay to the bag policy comes as the airline’s battle with its pilots continues. Those at its main base, Stansted airport near London, voted overwhelming on Friday to reject a higher pay offer. It is understood that 90% of the 480 pilots at Stansted voted 62% to 38% to reject the offer of £11,000-£22,000 extra in bonuses and allowances. The rejection, at a time when Ryanair is battling to keep pilots that have been defecting to Norwegian.com and other competitors, came days after pilots at its Madrid base also rejected the offer. Pilots at several other bases have accepted the offer, the airline said. Ryanair’s shares have fallen in value from a peak of €19.39 in July before the cancellation debacle to €15.67 in early trading on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2017/nov/08/what-exactly-do-you-hate-about-teaching-our-work-expert-responds","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"'What exactly do you hate about teaching?' – our work expert responds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/nov/08/what-exactly-do-you-hate-about-teaching-our-work-expert-responds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/nov/08/what-exactly-do-you-hate-about-teaching-our-work-expert-responds","fields":{"headline":"'What exactly do you hate about teaching?' – our work expert responds","bodyText":"Teaching is ruining my life.

Many suffer in silence hoping things will get better. If you have decided that moving on is the best option, the next step will be to define what you are looking for in your future role. A good way to do this is to understand what it is about your current job you don’t enjoy. Is it the long hours, increased pressure, lack of progression opportunities? Or is it that you just don’t enjoy teaching any more? You say you are desperate to get out of teaching but from experience, many teachers love teaching but struggle with the system they are in. If you still have a passion for teaching, you could consider moving into a different role, for example, from teaching children to teaching adults. Once you have identified what you want, it’s time to turn your attention to those fantastic skills you’ve mentioned.

Men spend six hours and nine minutes a day on leisure pursuits, compared with five hours and 29 minutes for women, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has found. The gender gap is greatest in north-west England, where men spent an average 36.2 hours a week engaged in leisure activities, seven hours more than women. The smallest gap was in Northern Ireland where the time spent was identical for men and women. When not in leisure, women were more likely than men to be performing unpaid work, the study showed. Unpaid work for the purposes of the study was anything households perform for themselves such as childcare, adult care, volunteering, cooking, cleaning, DIY, gardening, transporting themselves or others, or ironing and washing clothes. For men, the days with the highest average time spent performing unpaid work were Mondays and Saturdays, where men carried out an average 131 minutes of unpaid work per day. The day women spent the highest amount of time on unpaid work was Monday with 207 minutes per day, the ONS said. Women spent more socialising than men – four hours and 19 minutes, compared with three hours and two minutes per week respectively. The majority of leisure time for both sexes was spent consuming mass media, the ONS said, such as watching TV, reading, or listening to music. Men gave 16 hours and 24 minutes per week on mean average to this activity, while women dedicated 14 hours and 23 minutes. The analysis, for 2015, focused on people aged over eight, drawing on data from the UK harmonised European time use survey. The figures also show that, on average, 16 to 24-year-olds enjoy the same amount of leisure time as people aged 55-64 - six hours per week. For people aged 65 and over, the amount increases to seven hours and 10 minutes a week. The least leisure time was taken by 25 to 34-year-olds – four hours and 46 minutes per week. In terms of regional differences, people in south-east England spent the most time on leisure activities – five hours and two minutes per week. By contrast, people in Northern Ireland spent the least – four hours and 22 minutes per week. Based on a median household income, individuals from lower-income households take less leisure time on weekends, the study revealed. The largest difference between those from higher- and lower-income households was on Saturdays where 33.1% of those from lower income households took less than 40% of the median leisure time, as opposed to 24.3% of those from higher income households. The median leisure time taken on Saturdays was 7 hours and 12 minutes. This could be explained because those from lower- income households are more likely to be working at weekends, the ONS found. People who worked in skilled-trade professions spent the least time on leisure - four hours and 34 minutes per day - compared with people in sales and customer services professions who spent the most at five hours and 21 minutes per day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/24/brexit-outcome-up-to-uk-says-donald-tusk-as-he-urges-eu-unity","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T10:32:51Z","webTitle":"Brexit outcome up to UK, says Donald Tusk, as he urges EU unity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/24/brexit-outcome-up-to-uk-says-donald-tusk-as-he-urges-eu-unity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/24/brexit-outcome-up-to-uk-says-donald-tusk-as-he-urges-eu-unity","fields":{"headline":"Brexit outcome up to UK, says Donald Tusk, as he urges EU unity","bodyText":"The outcome of Brexit is up to the UK, the president of the European council has said in a speech that stressed the importance of EU unity. “It is in fact up to London how this will end, with a good deal, no deal or no Brexit,” Donald Tusk told MEPs as he reported on last week’s EU summit. The next stage of Brexit talks would be “the toughest stress test” yet for the EU, he added. “We have managed to build and maintain unity among the 27 but ahead of us is still the toughest stress test. If we fail it the negotiations will end in our defeat,” Tusk said. “We must keep our unity regardless of the direction of the talks. The EU will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided.” Tusk has previously quoted the lyrics of John Lennon to express his faint hope Brexit could be avoided, although it is clear he does not see this as a likely outcome. The head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, reiterated the message that the EU wanted a deal with the UK, after a spat between Brussels and London over an account of a dinner in a German newspaper, where Theresa May was reported to look despondent, tormented and tired. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was reported in the Times to be furious over the leaks about the dinner. “The commission is not negotiating in a hostile mood,” Juncker said. “Those who don’t want a deal, the no-dealers, they do not have friends in the commission. We want a fair deal and we want a fair deal with Britain. The no-deal is not our working assumption.” His latest intervention chimed with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who told a group of European newspapers that the EU wanted a deal, but could not exclude the no-deal option. In the interview Barnier said he expected the UK would seek a deal with the EU along the lines of the Canada free-trade deal. The comprehensive economic and trade agreement, which was agreed in 2016, was a groundbreaking trade deal between the EU and a foreign country, but would be a big step back for the UK, after decades in the EU single market. “The single market is a set of rules and standards and is a shared jurisdiction,” Barnier said. “Its integrity is non-negotiable, as is the autonomy of decisions of the 27. Either you’re in or you’re out.” This long-standing principle was picked up by Manfred Weber, an ally of Merkel, who leads the centre-right European People’s party. Speaking to fellow MEPs Weber said no country outside the European Union can have the same status as a country inside the European Union. While the British prime minister has long called for “a deep and special partnership” with the EU, European diplomats think she has not made a decision about what that means. Weber said: “The Brexiteers have no common plan for the future of their country and especially the relationship towards the European Union.” The Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable warned that a deal akin to that signed by the EU and Canada would be a disastrous result for the UK. “A Canadian deal would leave our hugely important financial services sector without passporting rights,” he said. “It would also leave manufactured goods that contain components from outside Britain subject to tariffs.” “This would be a very poor substitute for our membership of the single market and customs union. The exodus of firms would accelerate. Nobody voted to be poorer, and this would hit living standards … If this is the best the UK can hope for, we are in trouble.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/25/william-barber-martin-luther-king-jr-civil-rights-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr, a new civil rights leader takes center stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/25/william-barber-martin-luther-king-jr-civil-rights-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/25/william-barber-martin-luther-king-jr-civil-rights-leader","fields":{"headline":"Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr, a new civil rights leader takes center stage","bodyText":"Chicago, Illinois The Rev Dr William Barber stands at the pulpit where Martin Luther King Jr preached 50 years ago, issuing an impassioned call to arms, his deep baritone filling the church. “It’s time for a breakthrough,” he calls, almost howling, sweat dripping from his brow, as an organist punches frantic chords in accompaniment. “We’ve got to break through the silence. We’ve got to break through the hate. A breakthrough until every poor person has a guaranteed income.” “Hallelujah!” the 600-strong congregation cries back. The walls of the Stone Temple Baptist church almost seem to shudder. “A breakthrough until voting rights are secure, until we are truly one nation,” he calls, hurling his notes from the lectern and hauling his 6ft 2in frame across the stage. The oration is infectious, Barber’s typical brand of liberation theology fusing constitutional politics and biblical principles of love and mercy. It makes not just the hairs on your neck stand on end, but your whole body sway. The 54-year-old pastor from North Carolina is not just here to preach – this is the start of what he hopes will be a nationwide movement to complete the work that King could not. It is the first organised campaign of civil disobedience in the Donald Trump era. It’s aim? To bring about a “moral revival across the US”. Chicago is the eighth stop on the pastor’s exhaustive tour of 14 states, laying the foundations for a new Poor People’s Campaign – the last movement of the civil rights era, which effectively ended after King’s death. The 1968 campaign attempted to push Congress into passing an economic bill of rights including a package of guaranteed income, equitable housing and funds for poor communities. But, this time around, with the new campaign still in its infancy, the aim is broader: to unite the disenfranchised groups in the US – across the spectrums of race and sexuality – under a common cause. “We have to remember that the civil rights movement did not just end,” says Barber before the evening service. “It was assassinated by killing the leaders, it was assassinated through division. Throughout our trips, what we’re finding is there is still a need for that coalition that Dr King talked about in ’68 in coming together to address the evils of racism, militarism, systemic poverty and ecological devastation.” We were driving through the streets of Chicago’s West Side as the sun was setting, and Barber’s point was perhaps best made simply by looking out of the window on to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fifty years after King came to Stone Temple Baptist church as part of his campaign against slum housing, some areas here still have a poverty rate of 60%. In a neighbourhood a few miles from the church, the life expectancy is just 69 years. “Some issues are not about left and right, Republican and Democrat – they’re about our deepest moral values,” says Barber. “And we believe that you have to have a campaign, a movement, that seeks to reshape the moral narrative.” The pastor has spent the past four years as the backbone of the Moral Mondays campaign in North Carolina, a civil disobedience movement that ballooned after fighting a series of state voter suppression laws, which disproportionately affected poor people of colour. The movement now covers a broad range of progressive issues. The sustained campaign began commanding national attention when, every Monday, scores of protesters started entering the state capitol building and laying their bodies down for arrest. More than 900 people were arrested throughout the campaign; Barber has lost count of how many times he was placed in handcuffs. The movement scored major victories, culminating in a supreme court decision ruling state voter laws unconstitutional, and the unseating of the Republican governor Pat McCrory in 2016. The Chicago service had begun earlier with gospel songs from the civil rights era and testimony from some of the disenfranchised groups Barber hopes to galvanise: an Afghanistan war veteran suffering from PTSD; an environmental activist fighting pollution of the Calumet river; and 27-year-old Ashley Mesch, a care worker for the elderly who is paid poverty-line wages of $10.10 (£7.66) an hour and who struggles to support her family. Mesch recently joined the local Fight for $15 movement, which was dealt a blow earlier in the year when Bruce Rauner, the Republican governor of Illinois, blocked state legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15. After hearing Barber’s sermon, Mesch says she is ready to put her body on the line and take part in her first direct action next year. “Hearing the reverend was rejuvenating,” she says. “I’m absolutely ready to do anything that needs to be done. I might get arrested, but people need to hear the message.” Barber – who co-chairs the campaign with the Rev Dr Liz Theoharis, a pastor from New York City – hopes to sign up 1,000 people in 25 states and DC for a season of civil disobedience in the spring of next year. Protesters will stage sit-ins at state capitols and in the US Congress under a “moral agenda” encompassing a host of issues, from LGBTQ and voting rights to immigration reform and access to healthcare. The campaign will not say yet how many people have signed up, but it has partnered with dozens of local groups across the country to avoid what Barber describes as “helicopter leadership”. “Liz and I are almost like a travelling course of theology and public activism, and then we turn it over to the anchor groups in each of the states,” he says. It is perhaps the most ambitious civil rights campaign since the 60s, and will be underpinned by Barber’s work in North Carolina, where he served as president of the NAACP state chapter for more than a decade before resigning earlier in the year to take on this national role. Goldsboro, North Carolina A few days after the service in Chicago, Barber is back at the Greenleaf Christian church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he has led the congregation since 1993. Despite the campaign’s rigorous schedule, he tries to come back for Sunday service every weekend, tending to his flock in one of North Carolina’s most racially segregated cities. These days, he is no longer just preaching to the 200 or so congregants in the pews, but tens of thousands of people online as well. In 2016, he gave an electrifying speech at the Democratic national convention, calling for “moral defibrillators of our time” to “shock this nation with the power of love” – it was an address that thrust an already well-known civil rights leader on to the global stage. Before Sunday service begins, Barber, a seeming perfectionist, stands in the aisles talking to the choir about their posture on camera and warning them not to touch the microphones hovering above their heads. “We’ve got 40,000 watching us online,” he says. “It can distort the sound.” That morning, he gives a sermon titled: “How can I love those who are doing things that I cannot like?” This was the day after Trump told the Voter Values Summit, an annual meeting of conservative activists, that he was “stopping cold the attacks on Judeo-Christian values”. The president went on to renew a pledge to “step by step” remove Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation that offers insurance to millions of low-income Americans. Barber is at his magnetic best again, offering a thundering rebuke. “It hurts me to say the so-called Values Summit is not about Judeo-Christian values; it’s not about Christianity, but about the values of the heretical, rhetorical extremism, funded by a whole lot of money,” he says. “Their values are cash and not Christ. Greed and not grace. “But I do not have any deep hatred for the president, because there is so much potential for good. I love him as a human being. But I can’t like, because what the president did was irreligious and irreverent. You can’t go boasting about taking people’s healthcare. That’s not Christian.” The congregation applauds. “You’re right pastor,” they shout. “Amen.” After the sermon draws to a close, Barber invites me back to his study. The pastor is semi-reclined on a stool – he has a form of advanced arthritis that causes him near-constant pain and has left him walking with a cane. Barber views this new movement not just as a challenge to the extremist Republicanism embodied by Trump’s presidency, but also to what he describes as “white evangelicalism and its connection to white nationalism”. This hardline Christianity has arguably been the dominant religious force in US rightwing politics for decades. White evangelicals are the religious group most likely to vote Republican, holding substantial voting blocks in swing states such as Florida, and they voted overwhelmingly for Trump, following a string of high-profile endorsements from denomination leaders who were buoyed by his commitment to rolling back access to abortion and protecting the second amendment. However, Barber, a mainstream Protestant, brands it a “heretical form and presentation of faith to cover up for people’s greed and desire for power”. The Bible, after all, he says, contains little on abortion, which 70% of evangelicals think should be illegal in most or all cases, or homosexuality – the majority of the denomination disapprove of same-sex marriage – but has thousands of passages on how to treat the disenfranchised. Earlier in the year, Barber called out a group of faith leaders who visited the Oval Office and prayed for Trump’s success as the president signed a proclamation to usher in a national day of prayer. The pastor described the event as “theological malpractice bordering on heresy” and drew instant criticism from the evangelical right. But Barber has long suffered much worse. He receives regular death threats, and travels to events with a security detail. He never identifies any of his five children during sermons and is still developing “the discipline of praying for my enemies”. Barber was born in 1963, the year four young girls were killed in a church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in an act of white supremacist terror. He is acutely aware that thinly veiled political rhetoric can quickly lead to violence. Now it is Trump; then it was Alabama’s governor, George Wallace. Among Greenleaf’s largely African American congregation are some who remember those days vividly. Wilbur Barnes, 87, for instance, who has worshipped here all his life, and compares his pastor to the leaders of the civil rights era. “He is special,” says Barnes. “He is committed to good, devoted to his people and to social justice. I can’t go to these events around the country, but I am always with him.” As Barber prepares to head out again on another intense week of campaigning, first to Memphis, then to New York, Boston and finally El Paso, he issues a quick warning to his inner circle of clergy. “We’re heading down to the border where it’s likely I’ll be arrested again.” Everyone smiles and nods their approval. El Paso, Texas As we approach the border fence separating the US from Mexico, its towering, rusted prongs casting long shadows in the dust, Barber tells me his first thought is of the walls of Jericho referenced in the Old Testament. “It’s sinister,” says Barber. “But that wall came tumbling down.” In the Bible, the walls fell after divine intervention, allowing the Israelites to conquer the city inside. Today, Barber says, the border fence also represents sin: “It’s criminal because it’s a symbol of racism and white supremacy and it represents the sin of greed. Forty billion dollars are going into this wall, not into healthcare or living wages.” Barber has spent the past two days meeting with immigrant activists partnered with the Poor People’s Campaign. On Sunday, he trudges out into the Rio Grande – the river that divides the US from Mexico – and watches families broken by deportation briefly reunite. Authorities sometimes turn a blind eye to meetings in the river so long as they take place in the middle and people do not exchange possessions. As Border Patrol agents watch on, María Oralaz, an undocumented 60-year-old living in El Paso hugs her two sons, who now live in Mexico, their ankles covered in muddy water. She has not seen them for 16 years. The emotional reunion leaves Barber stunned. “My mind just seemed like it wasn’t functioning. To see that in the 21st century, in the richest nation on earth …” He trails off. “It left a deep fire in my belly and a deep commitment to do this work, together with the people affected.” Oralaz returns to the banks, leaving her family behind. “I feel more safe to know that there are people supporting us,” she says. “Firstly, I’m undocumented, secondly, I’m poor. This campaign will make us stronger.” The act of civil disobedience the organisers had planned – to try to shut down an entry port in El Paso – is eventually called off, meaning Barber can return to North Carolina without arrest this time. On the drive down to the border fence, our final trip together, I ask if he ever contemplates whether a campaign with such broad goals and steadfast opposition is likely to fail. “I think failure is not having a vision,” he says. “The sin would be not to have an ambitious goal.” At an event earlier in the day, Barber addressed another rally of around 400 people. “Great men and women of the past are no longer here,” he said. “But we are their children. It is our turn now to change the country. The first victory is when we decide to fight together.” He ambles down from the platform and immediately leads the group on a march across the city, a broad smile lighting up his face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/it-used-to-be-about-survival-your-verdict-on-the-new-walking-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"'It used to be about survival': your verdict on the new Walking Dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/it-used-to-be-about-survival-your-verdict-on-the-new-walking-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/24/it-used-to-be-about-survival-your-verdict-on-the-new-walking-dead","fields":{"headline":"'It used to be about survival': your verdict on the new Walking Dead","bodyText":"After recovering from the battle wounds of season seven we’re back with the Alexandrians, the Kingdom and the Hilltop as they begin the final showdown against Negan and the Saviors. With the war just starting, we asked you to review the first episode of season eight. Here’s what you said. ‘I worry a little about red-eyed-Rick-and-the-stained-glass’ 4 out of 5 from Jack, 42, Bucks Same old shit – in a a good way. Grim apocalyptic zombie dread, shot through with thin veins of hope and dark humour. I find the show really rewarding as it usually sticks with me for days afterwards. They are usually thoughtfully structured and well shot. I like the palette too as nothing else works in quite the same colour scheme as the ‘Dead. However the gunfight was stupid. I kept waiting for some genius reason why they shot the windows not the people. I worry a little about red-eyed-Rick-and-the-stained-glass bits though. These seem like a flash forward to something awful having happened, and the Vaseline-lensed shots of the future are just a fantasy. ‘Why didn’t someone just shoot Negan?’ 3 out of 5 from Caitlin, 26, Reading I nearly gave up after the aimlessness of season seven. I feel like this episode was a step back in the right direction, but there are still infuriating moments. After all this planning and bringing Alexandria and the Kingdom together, why didn’t someone just shoot Negan when he showed himself and did his usual speech? Why is Maggie still not looking remotely pregnant even though Judith is clearly older? I appreciated the attempt to show more stories at once and hope it continues. I’m also interested to see what happens with Eugene being part of the Saviors. Maybe that radio he built last season will come in handy? ‘The narrative has become one-dimensional’ 2 out of 5 from Johnny, 43, Spain Now a very dull story concept with a wordy screenplay that depends upon an awkward blend of frontier spirit and American myth-making, with a revival of Christian cultural messianism. This all adds up to a surprisingly one-dimensional narrative of community survivalism in a rudimentary simulation of a settler society that has long worn thin. Certainly, the last season called for a grand finale but more glaring is the essential inutility of the zombies now and, arguably, the apocalypse scenario itself. The series is carried uniquely by a charismatic villain, while fans’ emphasis must surely now have shifted to the spin-off series Fear the Walking Dead. ‘Shane wouldn’t have messed about with Negan if he was still around’ 2 out of 5 from Ryan, 30, Lake District I recently watched the earlier seasons and it’s depressing how different it is these days. It used to be about survival and always looking over your shoulder. These days they live in a better town than I do. Very disappointed with the start to season eight. I’ll power through and keep watching and I’m confident it will pick up, but big changes are needed to get it back to its best. Also, if they actually wanted Negan dead, why didn’t they just shoot him as soon as he walked out of the building, instead of having a casual chat about how they want him dead? Shane wouldn’t be messing about if he was still around, he would have got the job done. ‘A partial return to form in that it featured zombies and some action’ 3 out of 5 from Andy, 49, Manchester After the previous season this was last-chance saloon for me. I’m still not keen on the whole Kingdom/Ezekiel/scrapyard fringe lady/forest women tribal thing but this was a partial return to form in that it featured zombies and some action. I still think Negan is over the top but hey! Jeffrey Dean Morgan is enjoying himself so much you can’t complain. Still infinitely better than Fear The Walking Dead which is no longer spoken of in these parts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/24/jared-omara-mp-has-changed-significantly-since-posting-offensive-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T08:35:19Z","webTitle":"Labour MP who posted offensive comments 'merits second chance'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/24/jared-omara-mp-has-changed-significantly-since-posting-offensive-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/24/jared-omara-mp-has-changed-significantly-since-posting-offensive-comments","fields":{"headline":"Labour MP who posted offensive comments 'merits second chance'","bodyText":"A Labour MP who was forced to resign his committee role on Monday evening is a reminder to young people who post distasteful jokes online that the comments will be there for ever, the party’s shadow education secretary has said. Angela Rayner defended her Labour colleague Jared O’Mara, who apologised for posting derogatory and homophobic comments on a forum 15 years ago, saying she believed he had genuinely changed his views. O’Mara spoke to Labour MPs and peers at a private meeting in parliament on Tuesday night, where he said he would resign from his role on the women and equalities select committee. The posts on internet forums, unearthed by the Guido Fawkes website, include homophobic references to “fudge-packing” and “poofters”, inviting members of Girls Aloud to an orgy and suggesting the Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus had only won the competition because she was fat. Rayner said people should be reminded that derogatory comments posted online could be there for ever, even after the author had changed their views. “I think it’s important to recognise in a social media age that young people do put views and jokes and things that are absolutely distasteful and disgusting online and that they are there for ever,” she told Sky News. Rayner said O’Mara had made “a very passionate, emotional speech” to MPs on Monday night and said he was “absolutely devastated” by the comments he had made. “It was a very difficult speech for him. I suspect it was more difficult than his maiden speech but it was a heartfelt speech,” she said. “He said he was homophobic, he was misogynistic, but those views he had 15 years ago were completely unacceptable and he changed his views from then. I think that’s courageous of him to do that.” On Monday night, the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said O’Mara should also be suspended from the party, but Rayner said that was not what Labour colleagues wanted. “Yes, I am happy to sit alongside him,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I’ve met many people in my life who have had homophobic, misogynistic and even racist views; I’ve knocked on doors where that has been the case. Jared changed his views, that’s what’s important, he recognised they were abhorrent and wrong and he changed. Fifteen years on, he is not the Jared that made those comments.” O’Mara had initially said he wanted to continue to sit on the committee in order to work to confront misogyny. “I understand why they are offensive and sincerely apologise for my use of such unacceptable language,” he said in a statement earlier on Monday, issued through his office. “I made the comments as a young man, at a particularly difficult time in my life, but that is no excuse.” He said his views had changed significantly since. “I have learned about inequalities of power and how violent language perpetuates them,” he said. The Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, who was at the MPs’ meeting in parliament said O’Mara’s apology felt genuine to those present. “The battle for equality is a battle for hearts and minds and that must surely mean that people are allowed to change their views and therefore must also be offered a second chance,” he said. “I hope I don’t end up eating my words and that he demonstrates his commitment to equality as a new MP. I think we owe him that chance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/nov/01/2vcs-on-how-do-we-stop-part-time-numbers-dropping-further","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-01T07:30:11Z","webTitle":"2VCs on ... how do we stop part-time numbers dropping further?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/01/2vcs-on-how-do-we-stop-part-time-numbers-dropping-further","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/01/2vcs-on-how-do-we-stop-part-time-numbers-dropping-further","fields":{"headline":"2VCs on ... how do we stop part-time numbers dropping further?","bodyText":"When the number of full-time 18-year-olds going to university dips by a few percentage points it makes big headlines. But while the public’s attention has been focused elsewhere, the part-time higher education market has been quietly decimated. Numbers of part-time students, who are typically older and often juggling a job or family, or both, have more than halved. They are down 56% since 2010, according to the latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Admissions have been declining for a decade, but fell from 243,355 in 2010-11 to just 107,325 in 2015-16. Experts point the finger at inadequate financial support from the government. Part-time enrolments in England slumped in 2012 when the government raised the cap on fees, doubling or even tripling the cost of many courses. To counter this, tuition fee loans were offered to part-timers for the first time. But research shows about two-thirds of students weren’t eligible. Can we save part-time higher education? In the latest of our 2VCs discussion series, Anna Fazackerley talks to Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, and Prof Janet Beer, vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool and the new president of Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ umbrella group. The OU is synonymous with part-time learning – 40% of the UK’s part-time students choose its flexible distance-learning courses. They are typically older learners, with three-quarters working as well as studying. It is Britain’s biggest university and its students consistently put it near the top of the National Student Satisfaction Survey. But it has been hit hard: student numbers have fallen by 30% between 2010-11 and 2015-16. The University of Liverpool is a research-intensive institution in the elite Russell Group. This group is not generally known for its part-time or adult learning, and only 2% of Liverpool’s undergraduates study part-time. But the university bucks the trend as the largest provider of wholly online postgraduate programmes in Europe, all part-time. Liverpool has 10,000 online students from 160 countries, studying in virtual classrooms that minimise the disruption to their families and working lives. What does the future look like for the OU? The OU is a cherished British institution, but is facing a battle to reinvent itself. I ask Horrocks whether he is angry that his university has been so damaged by an apparent lack of care from politicians. “I’m upset,” he says. “I’m upset for the students. I often come across students who joined us before the 2012 changes and who tell me they wouldn’t have been able to study under today’s conditions. I think: ‘Who is that student who isn’t even approaching us? Who is sitting in a dead-end job and hasn’t got that chance to improve? Or whose job is threatened by new technology?’’’ Horrocks says he wants new “learning and earning” incentives to make sure these lost students have the support they need to turn their lives around. “This government has said it wants to be able to help those who are just about managing, those at different kinds of disadvantage, so we need to see those policies coming through,” he says. “We need to think about the needs of a workforce that might be hungry for a different kind of lifelong learning,” adds Beer. “As people stay at work for longer and change jobs more often, we need to loosen up who comes in and out of universities.” This means focusing more on continuing professional development, including some learning that won’t end in a certificate. Beer is a big advocate of the OU. “The OU is and has always been considered a jewel in the UK’s higher education crown,” she says. But she is a critical friend: “It is a vital part of the higher education landscape, but one that does need to adapt and change.” Horrocks is no stranger to grasping this sort of nettle. During his time as head of global news operations at the BBC, he oversaw massive cuts to the World Service after its budget was slashed by the government. Now, he explains, he is undertaking the biggest restructuring programme the OU has ever gone through – “perhaps the biggest any university has had to address”. “We are talking about many, many hundreds of job losses in the university and we need to make up to £100m of savings, a large part of which will be reinvested in the future,” he says. The university is also changing what it teaches. Horrocks says the OU will cut back on unpopular parts of the curriculum and is developing new courses that respond better to what employers want and students need over the next 15-20 years. “We want to deliver our learning more flexibly to fit the life circumstances of students,” he adds. “We want to have learning communities that work digitally so that people can learn from each other, from employers and from our alumni. We are introducing technologies for our academics to be able to do that.” The writing has been on the wall for part-time students for some time now. Should the OU have changed sooner? “The university is proud of its long tradition,” Horrocks says. “It has got to change, but we need policy support. The fact that student numbers are so much stronger in Scotland and Wales is a good illustration of the fact that the policy environment does make a difference.” Is the government ready to act to help older learners? “Am I optimistic? Not yet,” Horrocks says. But he adds that he was recently in a meeting with a senior Whitehall policymaker who was asking lots of questions about the government’s thinking on higher education funding. I ask him whether he is hinting that lifelong learning will be part of the elusive higher education review promised by the prime minister, Theresa May, in her party conference speech. “There are good indications that that’s the case,” he says. He is under no illusion that the fees review has been triggered by young people, who turned out in record numbers to vote for Labour in the general election. But he says that even before the election, the government had been thinking hard about how to upskill and reskill the workforce, particularly in industries susceptible to automation and especially after Brexit. Beer reprimands me for raising my eyebrows at the news that the government could include part-time learning in the review. “It would be derelict not to,” she says. “The system is broadly working for full-time students of conventional age. But it is not working for part-time students.” How do older, part-time learners feel about fees? Beer says UUK is going to do some research into this. “The problem is we think we know why there’s been a decline. One of the most simple reasons is the change in the funding regime. But we don’t know which employers and sectors have been most affected by the fall in part-time and mature students.” She believes that a public sector dealing with “swingeing cuts” has almost certainly slashed the numbers of employees it sends to university. But there isn’t any proof. UUK wants to find out what has happened to the people who were turned off studying part-time. Are they out of work? Or stuck in the same job at the same level? Horrocks is aggravated by talk of another review. He is at the coalface and feels the time for action is now. “The scale of the problem is evidenced by the numbers,” he says. Although he concedes: “Further analysis could be helpful in terms of targeting help, especially in relation to employment sectors.” What policies should the government bring in for part-timers? At the moment you can’t get a student loan to study a 60-credit module. Horrocks believes these bite-sized courses are exactly what people need when they are updating their skills or learning new ones, so he wants “startup” study loans to make that possible. Horrocks talks excitedly about Singapore, where the government is offering a lifelong learning entitlement to everyone. “It is only 250 Singapore dollars [£139], but it has had a galvanising effect of saying to the whole of their society, including 90-year-olds who want to do a poetry course, that your country wants you to learn throughout your life.” He adds that there is evidence that people’s mental health is improved if they are studying later in life. But Beer is sceptical. “All that is fine in Singapore, where people are used to being biddable,” she retorts. “People in this country are not Singaporeans. There is a different kind of engagement.” She reminds Horrocks about Individual Learning Accounts, a skills entitlement introduced by the Labour government in 2000 and closed hurriedly in 2002 after widespread fraud. “Immediately, the scam merchants started sucking that up,” she says. Horrocks isn’t giving up though. “It’s all about who is providing the learning, and if it’s HE-quality learning with a quality assurance framework, that would be a simple way of sending a message that people can and should want to learn,” he says. “That can be topped up by employers or by the government in relation to industrial sectors that are in decline.” What about ELQ funding? In 2007, the Labour government delivered the first blow to part-timers by cutting ELQ (equivalent level qualification) funding for people wanting to study a second degree at the same level as their first. This government has now reversed the rules for certain science and technology subjects. But the OU wants it to scrap the policy. I ask if this is too costly to be realistic. “It’s not a lot of cash compared to the extra call on the loan book that was done at the stroke of a pen through the PM’s conference speech,” Horrocks says. “Changing the repayment terms for graduates was the right thing to do but far more expensive.” Both he and Beer agree that explaining to students that there are some courses they can get loans for and some they can’t makes everything complicated. “I’ve lost count of the number of employers who say to me that they are screaming out for mid-career people to be able to develop,” Beer adds. The part-time market is less predictable than the full-time one; far more part-timers drop out because their lives are often complicated. Horrocks believes universities should do more to recruit and keep part-time students. “Of course, universities try to add diversity, but there isn’t that much in age and experience. Having that diversity, even if it’s only one or two people in a classroom, especially in relation to learning that is relevant to employment, can bring a huge amount.” “Mature students make life worth living when you are teaching,” Beer adds. Horrocks adds that allowing students to transfer credits – which not all universities do – can matter to older leaners. He says he recently met a student who had dropped out of the University of Oxford and come to the OU partly because she could bring some credits with her. Beer agrees with Horrocks. She says that when she was head of English at Manchester Metropolitan University, the programme lead also taught at the OU and had a passion for mature learners. They reached an agreement with the local OU office that students could go in and out of full-time study at Manchester Metropolitan and part-time study at the OU as their lives dictated. “It wasn’t huge numbers of students, but that flexibility really mattered,” she says. “We are so rigid in our demarcation in higher education.” Janet Beer What was your first degree and where did you study?

Abe’s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito were on course to win 311 seats, keeping its two-thirds “supermajority” in the 465-member lower house, an exit poll by TBS television showed. Some other broadcasters had the ruling bloc slightly below the two-thirds mark. A supermajority would allow Abe to propose changes to the constitution, which currently restricts its military to a defensive role. Most voters, however, oppose reform. After a day that saw millions of voters brave driving rain and powerful winds brought on by Typhoon Lan, Abe’s election gamble appeared to have paid off, after he called the vote more than a year earlier than scheduled. While Abe’s personal popularity remains low, support for his uncompromising stance on North Korea has risen following the regime’s recent launch of two ballistic missiles over the northern island of Hokkaido and its threat to “sink” Japan. Abe said he would accept the result with “humility” after his personal popularity ratings plummeted in the summer amid two cronyism scandals. The official result is expected early on Monday, with some districts reporting delays in delivering ballot boxes due to the typhoon. An initial challenge by the Party of Hope, formed only late last month by the populist governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, petered out as prospective supporters stayed with the the incumbent LDP. The public broadcaster, NHK, said Hope was on course to win between 38 and 59 seats, with another new opposition force, the Constitutional Democratic party (CDP), expected to fare slightly better and become Japan’s main opposition. Hope was expected to win fewer seats than some pundits had predicted at the start of the campaign, but was forecast to end up with enough to signal a shift to the right in the composition of Japan’s powerful lower house. “The situation in the world is not stable in many aspects and I believe the LDP is the only party we can depend on,” Kyoko Ichida, a Tokyo resident, said after casting her vote. Abe, who has emerged as Donald Trump’s key ally in the president’s tough line against Pyongyang, said “all options” – including military force – remained on the table. “At a time when North Korea is threatening us and increasing tensions, we must never waver,” he said in his final campaign speech on Saturday. “We must not yield to the threat of North Korea.”Sunday’s victory will keep alive Abe’s long-held quest to revise Japan’s pacifist constitution to officially recognise the self-defence forces (SDF) as a bona fide military. But aware of the strength of public opposition, Abe said on Sunday that he had dropped his 2020 deadline for the revision. “First, I want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree,” he said in a TV interview. “That should be our priority.” He added that he would “deal firmly” with North Korea. Any weakening of Japan’s pacifist credo is expected to anger China and South Korea, where many still harbour bitter memories of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century. Liberals in Japan, meanwhile, fear that “normalising” the country’s armed forces will lead to their involvement in US-led wars. Changing the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum. The ruling coalition will seek support for constitutional reform from members of the Hope party, which attracted MPs from the Democrats, Japan’s biggest opposition party until, wracked with division, it imploded earlier this month. Conservative members fled to Hope, while more liberal MPs joined forces to form the left-of-centre CDP, led by Yukio Edano, Japan’s top government spokesman at the time of the March 2011 nuclear disaster. Edano’s party wants to protect Japan’s pacifist principles and restore “decency” to public life. “We have only just started,” Edano told NHK. “We want to do something different and reflect the voices of the people rather than just politicians, and to build a grassroots movement.” He added that would do all he could to prevent Japanese troops from engaging in collective self-defence. The LDP is due to hold presidential elections next September, but Sunday’s victory means Abe is virtually assured of retaining the leadership of his party for another three years and going on to become the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history. Analysts said regional tensions centred on North Korea had dissuaded many voters from taking a leap into the political unknown. “Factors such as uncertainty over North Korea are likely to drive voters towards the current government, which is seen as the conservative choice,” said Katsunori Kitakura at SuMi Trust financial consultants. Edano accused Abe of being high-handed in calling an election more than a year early. “What’s at stake now is whether we will have a politics of arrogance or a grassroots politics that lifts society up from the bottom,” he said. After an initial surge in support for her party, Koike – who has long been tipped to become Japan’s first female leader – faced criticism for refusing to resign as governor and run in the election as a potential prime ministerial candidate. The former news anchor, who has promised to “reset” Japan, reportedly spent election day in Paris attending a climate change meeting in her role as Tokyo governor. She told NHK that she was expecting a “very severe result”, adding, “As the person who launched the party, I will take responsibility for it.” Some analysts described the result as not so much a victory for the LDP as a defeat for a divided opposition. “The LDP was victorious simply because the opposition couldn’t form a united front,” Mikitaka Masuyama at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies told AFP. Sunday’s result means Abe is expected to proceed with a controversial rise in the consumption or sales tax in late 2019. He has said the increase, from 8% to 10%, is unavoidable if Japan is to meet rising social security costs and, eventually, pay back its huge public debt, now more than double the size of its economy. As a sop to voters who oppose the tax hike, Abe vowed to spend some of the extra revenue on pre-school education and nursing care for the country’s growing population of over-65s.

The ReachTel poll, commissioned by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, shows a majority of voters in those Liberal-held seats support carbon pricing, and would support more policy ambition in driving renewable energy into the power grid. Federal parliament is due to resume on Monday for a week which could see the high court deliver its much anticipated verdict on the citizenship cases, and also see Queenslanders heading to a state poll. The debate over energy policy will also continue throughout the week. The Turnbull government last week unveiled its national energy guarantee, a policy that will impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers from 2020 if the states agree to an overhaul of the national electricity market rules. The new opinion poll shows 59.4% of voters in the prime minister’s electorate of Wentworth would be more likely to support the national energy guarantee if it drove 50% renewables by 2030. The sample size was 859 residents. The number for Kooyong, the energy minister’s seat, was 60.5% (sample size 911) and Abbott’s seat of Warringah was 55.7% (879 residents). The poll suggests voters are not buying the government’s message that the proposed guarantee will lead to lower power prices. Voters were more inclined to believe prices would go up than decrease. Appearing on the ABC on Sunday, Frydenberg stopped short of guaranteeing prices would come down under his new energy policy, but he said was “absolutely confident” power prices would fall. Last week the government was claiming wholesale prices would likely decline by 20% to 25% a year between 2020 and 2030 and residential bills would go down “in the order of” $100 to $115 per year over the same period as a consequence of the policy change. But the government has also requested more detailed modelling work to put to state governments at a forthcoming meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. The policy has been received positively by business groups and some analysts, including Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which has characterised it as “innovative and elegant” and “a template for policy-makers worldwide”. But the Labor states, particularly South Australia, have reacted angrily to the new policy, and Labor federally has been critical of elements of the scheme, while leaving its options open about whether to support or oppose it. On Sunday, the shadow climate change minister Mark Butler kept up his criticism of the policy, characterising it as a “thought bubble” and an “attack on the renewable energy industry that would cost billions of dollars in investment in Australia and thousands and thousands of jobs”. Butler said if the government’s own figures were to be believed, renewable energy growth would be as low as 0.5% per year in the 2020s. “That would slash, by two-thirds, the number of households that can get access to rooftop solar and it would mean that there is not a single large-scale renewable energy project built in Australia for 10 years,” Butler said. The Greens have opposed the policy, and argue the national energy guarantee will be more detrimental to the renewables sector than if the Coalition did nothing. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said the latest poll demonstrated the community wanted to get on with the transition from coal to renewables. “The key to effective energy and climate policy is as much about the ambition as the design of any scheme and these results show voters back a more ambitious program of emissions reduction,” he said. Oquist said there was concern that the scheme would only deliver a renewable energy penetration of between 28-36%, which is less than what the chief scientist Alan Finkel modelled would happen without any government policy intervention. He said the proposed emissions reduction target for electricity, which is 26% on 2005 levels by 2030, “is inadequate and will shift the burden to other sectors like agriculture”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/22/frydenberg-absolutely-confident-energy-prices-will-fall-but-gives-no-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T00:49:29Z","webTitle":"Frydenberg 'absolutely confident' energy prices will fall but gives no guarantee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/22/frydenberg-absolutely-confident-energy-prices-will-fall-but-gives-no-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/22/frydenberg-absolutely-confident-energy-prices-will-fall-but-gives-no-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Frydenberg 'absolutely confident' energy prices will fall but gives no guarantee","bodyText":"The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has stopped short of guaranteeing prices will come down under the Turnbull government’s new energy policy, but says he’s “absolutely confident” power prices will fall. Frydenberg also indicated the major parties might be able to come to terms on the mechanism, which imposes reliability and emissions reduction obligations on electricity retailers. He said it was possible Labor might agree on the mechanism but propose a more ambitious level of emissions reductions, with that a point of difference between Labor and the Coalition at the next federal election. “It is very important for industry that they have investment certainty,” Frydenberg said. “And that investment certainty comes from having the mechanism in place so that they can prepare their portfolio of assets into the future”. “Now, knowing that they will have to have a certain amount of emissions intensity and knowing that they will have to have a certain amount of reliability is something that they can plan for”. Frydenberg said he was “hopeful”, despite the current negativity from the opposition, that Labor would come on board federally “because the clean energy target, which was Dr Finkel’s recommendation, does not reduce power prices as much as this will”. He said new modelling the government had commissioned would be shared with the opposition and state governments in the lead-up to a Council of Australian Governments meeting in November. Frydenberg said the new investment mechanism would give existing coal assets “a very good chance of continuing through extending its existing life”, but he played down the idea the government would invest in a new high-efficiency coal plant, which is what some rightwingers in the government, including Tony Abbott, want. Frydenberg slapped down Abbott’s campaigning, noting “Tony Abbott isn’t the prime minister, nor the government”. He said the partyroom had strongly supported the national energy guarantee. Frydenberg said the government had “nothing against the new coal-fired power station being built, and I would welcome the extension of existing coal-fired power stations”. “But what is very important about this mechanism is that it allows for technology neutrality, so, renewables, which are becoming very low cost, can compete in that market, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t compromise affordability and reliability”. He suggested any new coal plant would have to be privately funded. With the state on the brink of an election, the Queensland government is also threatening to re-enter the electricity supply industry if power companies don’t cut bills. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is expected to meet electricity retailers in the state this week. “They will be given an ultimatum – pass on savings delivered by my government in full to consumers, or face more competition from a retailer owned by my government,” she told the Sunday Mail. She said the Queensland government could do it because it still owned the power stations, poles and wires. The then premier Peter Beattie sold the retail arms of Ergon and Energex in 2006 following advice that prices would go down because of market competition. Frydenberg declared on Sunday the threat was a “smokescreen” to divert from reports government-owned generators were price-gouging by bidding at uncompetitively high prices. He said CS Energy and Stanwell had raised $1.5bn for the Palaszczuk government while wholesale electricity prices had risen by an average of 30%. “The Queensland government’s got a lot of explaining to do to its own public as to why it’s been happy to put this electricity tax on its own people,” Frydenberg said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/21/leicester-castres-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T18:39:02Z","webTitle":"Leicester top pool as Telusa Veainu scores hat-trick against Castres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/21/leicester-castres-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/21/leicester-castres-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leicester top pool as Telusa Veainu scores hat-trick against Castres","bodyText":"Ellis Genge finds himself behind two Lions in the England pecking order but on this form the Tiger may not be there for long. Leicester romped to a seven-try win – Telusa Veainu scoring a hat-trick and Jonny May two – but for all their fireworks out wide, Genge was the standout performer in a victory that ignites the team’s European campaign. Indeed, after he limped off midway through the second half, Castres rallied with three tries – all by David Smith – to pinch an unlikely bonus point. A knee injury to Matt Toomua, who failed to emerge after half-time, threatened to further tarnish Leicester’s evening but Matt O’Connor was optimistic over his loosehead prop after the Tigers moved top of Pool 4. “[They] will have scans during the week. Fingers crossed it’s not too serious,” said O’Connor. “[Ellis], just an ankle and it didn’t look too serious. We’ll have to have a look at it to see where we stand.” Castres are dreadful travellers. They have not won away against a Premiership team since 2001 and nine changes to their starting lineup suggested they may not be at full tilt. That should not take away from the swashbuckling stuff Leicester produced and, while the French side’s rally did not please O’Connor, it is the highest points tally Castres have conceded in Europe. “The lads were pretty excited to put out a performance they could hang their hat on and make a statement about our intentions,” added O’Connor. “We would have been more than happy to have it stop at 60, though. There was a softness in defence that is nowhere near our standards and we have to make sure that doesn’t continue.” For the first hour George Ford was conducting proceedings, Veainu at his slippery best and Genge a battering ram – he made 48 metres for his nine carries – and after three Ford penalties, the Tigers turned it on. The first try began in Leicester’s half with Genge bullocking into anyone willing to stand in his way. The ball was worked wide to the left and Valentino Mapapalangi’s offload to Sione Kalamafoni was a delight before the No8 kicked ahead. May gathered and scored his eighth Tigers try in as many matches – met with a nod of approval from Eddie Jones on the big screen, perhaps more for Genge’s input that May’s. Genge’s next linebreak set up the second score for Ben Youngs, finished with a dummy by the England scrum-half, and No3 soon followed when Veainu slipped past Smith with ease. Already Castres were done for and it is a measure of how lacklustre they were that Leicester had their first try bonus point of the season before half-time – another smart finish from Veainu. Perhaps this was the Tigers’ all-star backline clicking into top gear for the first time but Castres’ lack of interest in defending was palpable. May streaked under the posts for his second try a couple of minutes into the second half and Veainu had his hat-trick when finishing off a move started with Ford’s dart up the middle and delightful long pass to Kalamafoni. Even with Castres registering their first try – a close-range finish from the No8 Alex Tulou – and a yellow card to Mapapalangi for bringing down a maul, try No7 was soon on the scoreboard with Nick Malouf getting in on the act after more powerful running from Genge. Joe Ford, on for Toomua, took over kicking duties and duly converted. Genge made way to rapturous applause before a quickfire treble from Smith left a sour taste in the mouth for the Tigers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/swansea-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T16:12:51Z","webTitle":"Flying start for Michael Appleton as Leicester edge past Swansea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/swansea-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/swansea-city-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Flying start for Michael Appleton as Leicester edge past Swansea","bodyText":"For the second time this year the Leicester City players responded to the news that their manager had been sacked by picking up three points and producing the sort of performance that suggests not much needs fine-tuning whenever Craig Shakespeare’s successor takes over. Who that will be remains to be seen, with no announcement imminent, but this was certainly a display to give plenty of encouragement to anyone wondering whether to take the plunge. Do not be fooled by the scoreline. Leicester were far superior in every department and but for some outstanding goalkeeping from Lukasz Fabianski, the visitors would have been out of sight by half-time. Bright and positive from the outset, they did not look like a group of players who had arrived at the training ground on Thursday morning feeling, to borrow Michael Appleton’s description, “cheesed off and down in the dumps” about Shakespeare’s sacking. Appleton, the caretaker manager, was entitled to be delighted with the players’ reaction 48 hours later as Leicester registered only their second league win of the season, in front of Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the vice-chairman. It was a day when Shinji Okazaki justified his return to the side with his fifth goal of the season, Vicente Iborra caught the eye in central midfield and Riyad Mahrez, whose form has been so indifferent since Leicester won the title, looked like the player everyone thought he was two seasons ago. Mahrez set up Okazaki’s goal with a lovely cushioned first-time pass and it was the Algerian’s cross that Federico Fernández headed into his own net in the 24th minute. To put into perspective how one-sided the game had been up until that point, Fabianski had already produced four excellent saves. Swansea were all over the place, with and without the ball, and the boos at the final whistle told a story. Even after Alfie Mawson reduced the deficit early in the second half, the hosts never looked equalising and the truth is that it would have been an injustice if Paul Clement’s side had got anything out of the game. They have now lost four of their five home matches this season and everything points to a third successive battle against relegation. Leicester, in contrast, expect to finish in the top half and that objective looks perfectly plausible on the evidence of how they played here. “It’s obviously been a difficult week for everyone at the football club, but the first half, the amount of opportunities we created, and the way we created them, was very, very pleasing,” said Appleton, who will continue to take charge of the team for Tuesday’s Carabao Cup tie at home against Leeds United but seems more hopeful of holding on to his role as No2 rather than throwing his hat into the ring to take over permanently. “One game doesn’t make you a Premier League manager,” he added. Leicester’s chances came thick and fast. Fabianski kept out Okazaki’s glancing header, tipped over efforts from Marc Albrighton and Jamie Vardy, and clawed away Wilfred Ndidi’s header before Fernández’s own goal. Kyle Naughton was more to blame though, with the right-back making a half-hearted attempt to stop the cross that the Argentinian headed past Fabianski. Clement replaced Leon Britton with Ki Sung-yueng at the interval but within four minutes Leicester had a second. Tom Carroll’s poor free-kick was cleared and in the blink of an eye the visitors were breaking away. Albrighton picked out the unmarked Mahrez with a diagonal ball and Okazaki swept home the inviting lay-off. Mawson’s low shot from a Renato Sanches corner beat Kasper Schmeichel seven minutes later but that was as good as it got for Swansea on another bleak afternoon in south Wales. “Last week I was really pleased with what they did. Today I’m not so pleased,” Clement said. “They’re sat in the dressing room for 10 minutes in silence waiting for me – they know that they can do a lot better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T16:15:52Z","webTitle":"Mikel Merino’s late header sees Newcastle United defeat Crystal Palace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Mikel Merino’s late header gives Newcastle victory over Crystal Palace","bodyText":"They say the table does not lie: Newcastle United are sixth in the Premier League and Crystal Palace are bottom of it. But the standings do not tell the whole tale of this wet afternoon on Tyneside. Rafa Benítez grimaced his way through much of the game, while Roy Hodgson grimaced his way through the aftermath. “Can we do better?” Benítez asked after James McArthur’s 86th-minute clearing header cannoned off Mikel Merino’s forehead and flew past Julián Speroni. “Yes,” the Newcastle manager answered. But he also mentioned “determination” and “character” and those were the qualities that put his team across the line, something Palace were unable to achieve for all their first-half possession. Benítez knows his team have convinced more in previous matches but there is always a different kind of satisfaction to be taken from collecting points while not flowing. Had he been offered 14 points after nine games when the transfer window closed, the Spaniard would have accepted gladly. “We are coming from the Championship, we didn’t sign too many players,” he said. “You tell me after 1 September that this is where we will be, I will tell you ‘fine’. Credit to our players, they are doing really well.” A clean sheet pleased Benítez and the Newcastle fans will have been impressed with the manner in which Florian Lejeune strong-armed his way through a tight tussle of a match. Gareth Southgate was also here, taking in Jamaal Lascelles and Jonjo Shelvey from Newcastle and the lively Andros Townsend for Palace. But for all Townsend’s activity, with Wilfried Zaha in tandem, Palace barely forced the Newcastle keeper, Rob Elliot, into a save. There was a 23rd-minute cross-shot that Elliot dived on, which came at a stage when Palace had more possession and carried more threat. But with Benítez trying to change Newcastle’s gears via substitutions in the second half, Palace’s share of the play ebbed. There was one exception, in the 80th minute, when the substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek was granted the ball by a careless first touch from the just-on Aleksandar Mitrovic. Suddenly free in the Newcastle area, Loftus-Cheek had a chance to win all the points only to drag his shot wide. The 21-year-old was a lively presence but that miss means that after nine league games Palace have failed to score in eight. Yet it was understandable that Hodgson should compare this display to last Saturday’s win against Chelsea. Then, Palace played well and won, he said, here they played well and lost. “You don’t always get what you deserve,” Hodgson said. “I would have been more disappointed had the performance not been as good as I wanted it to be. But when you give a good performance, you always hope you are going to get your reward. On this occasion we didn’t.” This was certainly an improvement on the previous away defeats – 4-0 at Manchester United and 5-0 at Manchester City – but it is now seven consecutive away defeats and the last Palace league goal on another ground was from Christian Benteke at Anfield in April. Hodgson hopes to have the striker back soon, part of the reason he was able to restate his belief that the Eagles can stay up. “Why should I not believe that?” he said. “There are 29 games to go. We’ve beaten the champions and we’ve come to St James’ Park against a Newcastle side which is doing really well and we matched them. “In my opinion we were the stronger team through large periods of the game. So why should I not have belief? “I will stop believing when the number of points we are behind doesn’t match the number of games that are left. That is not going to happen in October. That could happen at some point in March, April at the earliest. There is a long way to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T16:08:17Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero equals scoring mark in win against Burnley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero equals scoring mark in win against Burnley","bodyText":"Manchester City remain on top of the Premier League, Sergio Agüero is now their joint-top all-time goalscorer, but this workmanlike victory over a predictably solid Burnley side refuted the theory that Saturday afternoons here are going to be one long carnival of fantasy football. This was just football. Burnley made City work for the points and that was exactly what they did, securing victory only in the final quarter and playing impressively without putting on a show. It was entertaining enough on a wet and windy day, and as most people in the crowd were following the score in Manchester United’s game, absolutely no one was complaining. “If people think they are going to see five-zero scores every week that’s not going to happen,” Pep Guardiola said. “Some matches are more difficult. Burnley have great physicality and a strong work ethic, and coming into such a game after playing in the Champions League makes life complicated.” Burnley were not given much chance here, some bookmakers were quoting the ludicrous odds of 30-1 for an away win, though it was clear from an early stage City were not going to find their opponents quite as accommodating as Stoke in last week’s 7-2 romp. For one thing the scores were still level as the game entered its 30th minute, whereas Stoke had shipped three goals by then. For another, Burnley created the first goalscoring opportunity, when Chris Wood judged the bounce of the ball better than Kyle Walker, went on to beat Nicolás Otamendi and brought a brave save from Ederson, injuring himself in the process. Unfortunately for Burnley, by the end of the 30th minute they had fallen behind. Nick Pope initially made a good save from last week’s hero, Kevin De Bruyne, but he could not keep hold of the ball and showed his inexperience by trying to recover it from Bernardo Silva when the City player was moving away from goal. The goalkeeper just about got a glove to the ball but Silva took the opportunity to go down under the contact, leaving Burnley to reflect on their own naivety as Roger East pointed to the spot. Agüero naturally scored, equalling Eric Brook’s 78-year-old club record of 177 goals. While it was inevitable the Argentina striker would reach the mark sooner or later, it was in keeping with a low-key match that the big moment should arrive with a penalty, and a soft penalty at that. “There was contact and I wouldn’t even say it was a defining moment because we still might have lost,” Sean Dyche said. “It’s still frustrating though, because it was minimal contact, and to get that high off the floor with your arms above your head was impressive. It can’t be just me who thinks there ought to be more honour in the game.” Agüero, in fairness, spent the rest of the first half attempting to add another from open play, only to roll one shot wide and be denied twice by Pope in the Burnley goal. On the second occasion, Bernardo Silva had the chance to follow up, but his venomous shot was blocked when James Tarkowski unflinchingly stuck his face in the way. Burnley initially came out fighting for the second half and managed to put some pressure on the City goal, though they probably realised it was not going to be their afternoon when penalty appeals against Fabian Delph were waved away, the defender having kicked the ball against his own arm in attempting a clearance. That impression was finally confirmed when City scored their second goal from a set piece. After their early flurry of attacking intent Burnley had reverted to keeping every man except Ashley Barnes behind the ball in an attempt to make City’s life more difficult, a plan that was working until Leroy Sané swung over a corner from the left and Otamendi outjumped Ben Mee at the far post to place a firm header downwards. Even then Burnley had a man on the post to deal with such an eventuality, but Steven Defour could not move his feet quickly enough and the ball trickled past him. There was clearly no coming back from that and just to make sure De Bruyne took advantage of the only time Burnley lost their shape by slipping Sané into miles of space for a third goal two minutes later. There could have been more: Sané, David Silva and Gabriel Jesus missed late chances to boost the City goal difference still further, but the scoreline was already emphatic enough. Even on a day when rain continually poured from the greyest of Manchester skies, City never came close to slipping up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/nobody-minds-a-gentle-nudge-except-in-the-wrong-direction","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:36Z","webTitle":"Nobody minds a gentle nudge, except in the wrong direction | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/nobody-minds-a-gentle-nudge-except-in-the-wrong-direction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/nobody-minds-a-gentle-nudge-except-in-the-wrong-direction","fields":{"headline":"Why nudge theory works until a kick in the backside is needed","bodyText":"We live in a time when government seems to have the Sadim touch: everything politicians lay their hands on turns into the opposite of gold. So it is a pleasant surprise when a significant piece of policy affecting the futures of millions of people is working as intended. Many folk park pensions in that segment of the brain where they keep things they know to be important, but find boring. Many folk would prefer to spend any surplus income today rather than save it for tomorrow. As a result, Britain has a serious problem. Its citizens are saving far too little for their retirement. Five years ago, the government did something to try to remedy this. It changed the way in which workers make pension decisions by introducing auto-enrolment. Where previously employees had to take a series of steps to opt into a company pension, now you are automatically signed up unless you actively choose to opt out. This subtle-sounding switch has had a rather dramatic result. More than eight million people have started saving for the first time, which means they also receive a pension contribution from their employers. That still leaves many unwilling or unable to save enough for their older age, but it is a substantial advance that we now have nearly 40 million people, a record number, in workplace pensions. Hurrah. A government policy that is working. This policy success is in part a tribute to the influence of Professor Richard Thaler, the pioneer in behavioural economics, whose work has just been recognised with the Nobel prize. One of his many insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. Human beings are, well, human. This might not be a complete shock to you or me, but it was a challenge to classical economic theories that assumed people were always rational actors. From this observation, he developed an argument that nuanced changes in the “choice architecture” of society can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour. His “nudge theory” was seized on by politicians, especially liberal ones in the west. They were attracted to the idea that their citizens could be induced to make wiser choices without clubbing them over the head with coercive, nannying and opposition-arousing legislation. Barack Obama’s White House got extremely excited about nudge theory. David Cameron set up a behavioural insights team at the Cabinet Office, which was nicknamed the “nudge unit”. The timing was important. Nudge, the bestseller written by Thaler and Cass Sunstein, was published in 2008, the year of the Great Crash. It is almost certainly not a coincidence that the theory became popular with politicians and other decision-makers when their countries were being crunched by recessions and money was tight. This created a big appetite for low-cost solutions to public policy challenges. Nudging appeared to offer easy ways of reforming society without committing to large spending programmes. Nudge units were put to work in countries as diverse as Australia, Germany and Japan. The concept was also embraced by international bodies such as the UN and the World Bank. Nudge became one of the most globally influential ideas among policymakers. Nudge has also gone rampant in the market place. The Fitbit on your wrist is a nudge device. The calorie count on food packaging is there to tilt you to healthier eating options. It was once a novelty to find a notice in a hotel bathroom asking you, “dear guest”, to consider whether you could reuse the towel. It is now unusual if you are not greeted with a winsome plea to think about the planet. The hotel is doing a little bit for the environment and, of course, saving on its laundry bill. You know you are being nudged, you know why and you probably don’t mind. I don’t. I did mind going through Gatwick the other day where the only route from security to the gate was a long and snaking forced march through miles of “duty-free”. Well, it felt like miles. This did not make me want to fill my boots with the ciggies, spirits, choccies and fragrances. It made me want to walk faster. The application of nudge theory in politics has been a similarly mixed blessing. When it works effectively, it does so because it exploits human weaknesses for human benefit. It is a frailty of many of our species to procrastinate. Turning pension contributions into an opt-out rather than an opt-in uses inertia to achieve a desirable end. Another winning example is organ donation. In countries where there is a presumption of consent unless the deceased has declared against donation, organ availability has shot up. No one has been deprived of a freedom. You can still decide that you prefer to take all your bits with you to the grave. But you have been influenced to make a different choice that is more beneficial to society. In truth, nudging was being practised by artful governments long before it was given a name. The pre-eminent example of that is smoking policy. The tobacco habit is highly addictive and deadly, so government could decide to make it illegal. Which would be a terrible idea, because a blanket ban would criminalise millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens and provide a massive opportunity for organised crime to create an underground market. So instead, successive governments have used the nudge. First, TV advertising of cigarettes was prohibited. Then, all advertising was banned. This was followed by a stop on the open display of cigarettes in shops. Now fags have to be wrapped in packaging plastered with pictures of horrible diseases. One of the best and cheapest contributors to the improvement of our nation’s health is the prohibition on smoking in public places, which was introduced by Tony Blair’s government. That decision tore apart his cabinet. Some ministers feared a furious backlash from the millions of voters who would no longer be able to puff away in pubs and restaurants. As it turned out, it was introduced with minimal fuss. Predicted pub riots by fuming smokers never materialised. You are part of a small and eccentric minority – and probably also a member of Ukip – if you still think it was a bad idea to end smoking in restaurants and pubs. You are part of a smaller, and frankly weird, minority if you think smoking should still be allowed on trains and planes, in cinemas and at football stadiums and on the London underground. A big reason for this policy success is that it has gone with the grain of human desires. You’d expect that ban to be attractive to non-smokers. It has worked because it wasn’t opposed by smokers. Most nicotine addicts want to quit. Importantly, it wasn’t a total ban. You can still smoke, so long as you don’t mind going outside. That nudge has worked because it guides, rather than compels, folk to go in the right direction. Nudge doesn’t work when it loses touch with the human factor. A topical example is the trouble the government has got into with the introduction of universal credit. This simplification of the benefits system is founded on the excellent principle that work should always pay: no one should be worse off by deciding to take a job or put in more hours. The implementation is going wrong because it failed to take into account how lives are lived. People on low incomes can be a day’s pay away from not being able to put dinner on the table. So a delay of five weeks or more in paying the credit is an atrocious design fault. Charging up to 55p a minute for calls to the helpline was simply stupid, as ministers have belatedly realised. This illustrates one of the downsides of nudge. It is highly dependent on the nudgers getting it right and we know that politicians and civil servants are also fallible. Just like other human beings, they miscalculate risks, prioritise short-term gratification over long-term achievement and can act irrationally. While technocrats quite often really do know what is good for us, sometimes they don’t, and even the best-intentioned can make bad mistakes. For years, the tax system was used to incentivise drivers to move away from petrol cars and towards diesel vehicles because experts declared diesel to be less harmful to health and the environment. That turned out to be a faulty nudge. “Liberal paternalism”, the posh label for nudge, assumes that there is an elite that knows what is good for the citizenry. This idea – the establishment knows best – is precisely the one that significant numbers of voters have been rebelling against. One of the more powerful critiques of nudge is that it concentrates on the psychological manipulation of voters rather than properly educating them about choices, and the ultimate effect of this is to infantilise the citizenry. Experience has shown that nudge is not the miracle cure for every political challenge. Some problems are just too big to be fixed by adjusting the “choice architecture”. Britain’s housing crisis is not solvable with a few tweaks to the tax system and the planning regime. That won’t be cracked without bolder and stronger measures. Not a gentle hand on the elbow, but a muscular kick up the arse. Nudge has some proved beneficial uses for governing, but it is not the answer to everything. Some things need the push and the shove."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/21/households-in-debt-breathing-space-bailiffs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T20:13:51Z","webTitle":"Theresa May told to keep pledge over debt relief for poor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/21/households-in-debt-breathing-space-bailiffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/21/households-in-debt-breathing-space-bailiffs","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May told to keep pledge over debt relief for poor","bodyText":"Theresa May is under pressure to fulfil her pledge to give people struggling with debts “breathing space” from the bailiffs as figures show that half the British population are financially vulnerable. A cross-party group of peers, including a former Tory minister, is planning to bounce the prime minister into handing those in difficulty a grace period, during which they would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. They would be able to use the time to seek help. A proposal for a six-week “breathing space” was included in the Tory manifesto but has yet to be enacted. With official figures suggesting that almost 8 million people are over-indebted, the government is facing a Lords rebellion over the issue. Lady Altmann, the former Tory pensions minister, has helped draw up an amendment with Labour and the Lib Dems to force the government’s hand. A survey has found that half the UK population are financially vulnerable and that one in six would be unable to cope with a £50 increase in monthly bills. More than 4 million people are already in serious financial difficulty, falling behind with bills and credit card payments, according to a survey of personal finances by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. Those aged between 25 and 34 are the most over-indebted. Charities are also warning that an expected rise in interest rates this week will make the situation even worse. The debt charity StepChange has said that the proportion of its clients falling behind on payments has gone over the 40% mark in the first half of 2017. More than 620,000 families in England and Wales are spending more on overdue bills than on food. The Tory manifesto was clear, stating: “Problem debt can be hard to escape and can compound family breakdown, worklessness, stress and mental health issues. We will adopt a “breathing space” scheme, with the right safeguards to prevent abuse, so that someone in serious problem debt may apply for legal protection from further interest, charges and enforcement action for a period of up to six weeks.” Government insiders said there had been a battle to include the measure in the manifesto, as it was not cost-free to the Treasury. Some of the debt relates to public money such as council and other taxes. However, it was eventually included in the document in an attempt to demonstrate May’s commitment to righting social injustices. Labour has devised an amendment to the financial guidance and claims bill, which is working its way through parliament. Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, who drew up the proposal, said: “It’s surprising that the Conservatives, having – like Labour – committed to a ‘breathing space’ scheme in their election manifesto, are now dithering on its introduction, even though they have a ready-made vehicle for doing so in the financial guidance and claims bill.” While the Lords vote is a headache for the government, charities are pushing for the breathing space rules to be announced by Philip Hammond in next month’s budget. Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “A breathing space for families in problem debt is needed now more than ever. Bailiffs at the door is something that no child should have to experience, but all too many do. It can take just one unexpected cost or life event, like losing your job, to push families into problem debt. “Falling into problem debt places enormous strain on parents and children alike: becoming ill with stress, bullied at school, or forced to cut back to the bone on food and heating. A breathing space would give these families a pause from mounting fees and being pursued by creditors while they get their finances in order and agree a plan to affordably repay what they owe. This [Lords] amendment is an important step towards giving families in debt the help they need to get back on their feet. Families simply cannot afford for there to be any delay in making this debt respite a reality, and we urge the chancellor in his autumn budget to stay true to the government’s election promise and make this happen.” The government has said that it backs the breathing space plan, but that it needs more time to design the policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/hibernian-celtic-scottish-league-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T13:28:26Z","webTitle":"Moussa Dembélé and Mikael Lustig power Celtic past Hibs to cup final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/hibernian-celtic-scottish-league-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/hibernian-celtic-scottish-league-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Moussa Dembélé and Mikael Lustig power Celtic past Hibs to cup final","bodyText":"A semi-final initially notable for Hibernian’s curious approach was later typified by the one that sets Celtic apart from the rest in Scotland. Brendan Rodgers is within one match of his fourth trophy success as the Celtic manager from four attempts. This win may have a wider resonance than extending Celtic’s unbeaten domestic run to a staggering 60 matches. Moussa Dembélé’s star had fallen to the extent where the forward, not so long ago linked with every major club in Europe, had just a single goal to his name since March. Fitness rather than form is the key to that, with Rodgers inevitably going to turn once more towards the powerful Frenchman when condition allowed. Albeit the match was already way beyond Celtic’s reach, but there was a notable improvement in performance on Wednesday night in Munich from the point where Dembélé was introduced from the bench. Hibs had cause to bemoan the same scenario. No sooner had Anthony Stokes halved Celtic’s advantage than Rodgers turned to Dembélé, a player motivated by the injury frustrations of recent months. The 21-year-old duly claimed two goals to douse Hibs hopes. “Moussa is probably the only disappointed player in that dressing room,” said Rodgers, only partly in jest. “He thinks he should have had a hat-trick.” A less likely hero had aspirations of the same. Mikael Lustig, the Celtic full-back, had afforded his side what ultimately proved an insurmountable lead by the interval. With plenty assistance from Hibs, it must be said. The Premiership newcomers were strangely tepid in the first period, thereby failing to ask sufficient questions of a team perhaps feeling the effects of an arduous Champions League outing. Lustig stole in at the back post in splendid isolation to connect with a Stuart Armstrong cross with the Hibs goalkeeper, Ross Laidlaw, wrong-footed when trying to claw away the Swede’s shot. Laidlaw was blatantly culpable for number two, Lustig again at the back post and this time connecting tamely with a Leigh Griffiths corner. “You can’t give a team of this calibre that kind of head start,” was the accurate assessment of the Hibs manager, Neil Lennon. Still, in displaying the attitude that typified Lennon’s own career, Hibs did not meekly concede the tie. A bullish second-half performance brought hope in controversial fashion as Dedryck Boyata was adjudged to have illegally upended the marauding Martin Boyle inside the penalty area. Celtic complained bitterly about the spot-kick award – and continued to do so at full-time – with Stokes taking full advantage of it. At this point, it was legitimate to question what spirit Hibs could have summoned if backed by a sizeable support. There was embarrassment for the club and the Scottish Professional Football League owing to vast swathes of empty seats in the designated Hibs section. Not only could those tickets have been sold to Celtic supporters if Hibs had not demanded such an allocation but the sale of around 4,000 fewer briefs than register as season tickets at Easter Road presents an anomaly. A combination of Celtic’s impressive fortitude and Dembélé provided crucial intervention thereafter. It was almost as if Rodgers had pressed home to his players that onlookers would anticipate a collapse. Dembélé was afforded a tap-in after build-up work from James Forrest and Scott Sinclair to seemingly settle the tie at 3-1. Hibs rallied again, their 19-year-old substitute Oli Shaw producing a fine finish having collected a Steven Whittaker pass. Dembélé was to provide the closing act from a counterattack. “I’d rather lose 4-2 going for it than letting it peter out at 3-2,” Lennon said. He may also take a degree of consolation from the identity of the man who sealed Hibs’ fate. There are signs that Dembélé is back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/let-nation-speak-unto-nation-in-the-arts-and-in-life","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:36Z","webTitle":"Let nation speak unto nation in the arts and in life | Alex Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/let-nation-speak-unto-nation-in-the-arts-and-in-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/let-nation-speak-unto-nation-in-the-arts-and-in-life","fields":{"headline":"Let nation speak unto nation in the arts and in life","bodyText":"What do we talk about now we no longer talk about books? Well, everything else, of course. Since George Saunders won this year’s Man Booker prize last Tuesday evening for his novel Lincoln in the Bardo, virtually every report and a heap of internet chatter besides has led with the fact of Saunders’s Americanness. This, put together with the Americanness of last year’s winner, Paul Beatty, and the Jamaicanness of the previous year’s, Marlon James, seems to spell gloom for the UK. It’s as though Colin Welland’s Oscar acceptance speech – “The British are coming!” – is being rewound at zanily high speed. That we did this to ourselves in 2014 – allowing the Yanks in to take their chances alongside the Brits, the Irish, the Indians, the New Zealanders and more – hovers in the background, as if in reproof to openness. Among the objections to the widening of the rules is the plaintive cry that British writers should be let loose on American literary prizes, which has a certain amount of merit, but is also somewhat beside the point: you might be nice enough to share your toys, but there’s no onus on the friends you invited to tea to share theirs. Hastily leaving my seat at the medieval Guildhall on Tuesday to bolt into a waiting radio car, I found myself taking part in a curious – and somewhat spiky – exchange. Had the Booker become, wondered the Radio 3 presenter, who was admittedly attempting to slot it into to a programme about national identity – a neocolonial enterprise? Was it, indeed, just part of a scene, like the Henley Regatta? If this is an agenda that seeks to root out privilege and elitism, the Booker presents it with a problem. Here are the winners from the last 10 years: Anne Enright, Aravind Adiga, Hilary Mantel, Howard Jacobson, Hilary Mantel again, Eleanor Catton, Richard Flanagan, James, Beatty and Saunders; a spread of nationalities, ethnicities and class backgrounds, with, as far as I am aware, not a single Etonian in sight. And what’s particularly striking in the case of the last three winners is how long they wrote in relative obscurity before receiving anything approaching widespread recognition, praise and, of course, financial security. But the quarrel, of course, is not with the individuals, it is with the system and prizes, especially rich, corporate-sponsored, high-profile, swishy ceremonied ones, are a convenient focus for our cultural dissatisfactions, fury and angst. And there is much to criticise. The Booker, for example, requires the publishers of longlisted authors to make commitments about print runs and stock levels that are a walk in the park for larger publishers, but hugely daunting for the small, independent presses that are playing such a vital role in encouraging talent. If one of those publishers should find themselves with a shortlisted title, they must find £5,000 to help with publicity and hope that they will see a return on their investment. I recently spent an evening at a small literary festival, at which the organisers, not, probably, awash with excess cash themselves, took a group of us out for a jolly pizza and pasta supper at the end of the day’s events. I found myself chatting to a recent Booker shortlistee whose work is published by an aforementioned microscopic publisher. He regaled me with tales of their trip to London to take part in Booker business and the comic cognitive dissonance between getting on your black-tie gladrags, carousing with literary high society and then returning to the backpackers’ hostel afforded by your budget. There was not a shiver of complaint in his account, by the way, just pure delight. But back to the radio car. Did I, asked the presenter, think Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo was a worthy winner? I did, I replied, and if only I had left it there. In fact, I thought it was wonderful. Wonderful. I may have added a third wonderful. In my defence, I had emerged from a pressure cooker of hyperbole. Adjectives were, to tax the metaphor a moment longer, merely steam escaping from the bubbling casserole of literature. He wasn’t having it. Surely, I simply meant it was good. And if I were to call Lincoln in the Bardo wonderful, what would that leave for War and Peace? Readers, this had me stumped: nobody expects the Russian inquisition and, really, I had nothing smart to say about Tolstoy. But I managed a response and we moved on. Luckily, I have now had several days in which to channel my esprit de l’escalier. And in fact, it seems remarkably simple to me. I do think Lincoln in the Bardo is a wonderful book. I thought so when I reviewed it and called it “a brilliant, exhausting, emotionally involving attempt to get up again, to fight for empathy, kindness and self-sacrifice, and to resist”. I thought so even more when I read it a second time and more again when I listened to the audio version that brings to life its 166 voices. I think so when I contemplate the strangeness of its story – a dead child, who happens to be the son of Abraham Lincoln, wandering through a cemetery, waiting to be gathered to the afterlife – and the utterly uncompromising nature of its execution. When I very first picked it up, I thought I would never get to grips with its hypermobility, its shifts of voice and aspect, its ceaseless wrong-footing. And alongside all this, its depiction not only of a father in acute grief, but of a man leading a nation in the crisis of civil war, its fields littered with countless other dead sons. It’s impossible to read Lincoln in the Bardo and not think of America’s current convulsions, of the impossibility of reconciling personal and public duty, of the harrowing, hollowing nature of irreversible loss. So what I might have replied to the Tolstoy question is: “But it is War and Peace.” None of this is to say that you have to like it. It might leave you cold. It might irritate you. You might be reading something else that you’re enjoying more. If you are, that is excellent news. Books, and the prizes that reward them, should not be tests we pass or fail. The publishing and literary worlds have, in recent years, begun to turn the tanker around and address issues of representation, the stories untold and voices unheard. Changes will not happen overnight, but there is one change every reader can make instantly: we can start to talk about what’s inside the books, not everything that’s outside them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/observer-killer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:01:35Z","webTitle":"Observer killer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/observer-killer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/observer-killer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer killer sudoku","bodyText":"Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

Several colleges in both Oxford and Cambridge frequently admit cohorts with no black students in them at all. Roughly 1.5% of total offers are made to black British applicants and more than 80% of offers are made to the children of the top two social classes. With offers made overwhelmingly to those in London and a handful of the home counties, both universities are consistently excluding entire ethnic and regional demographics. They also continue to admit a grotesquely disproportionate number of privately schooled students. In effect, the two ancients are running a generous quota scheme for white students, independent schools and the offspring of affluent south-eastern English parents. There is undoubtedly a great deal that both institutions can and must do to remedy this. Our admissions processes at Cambridge are not sufficiently responsive to the gravity of the situation. Despite periodic panics in response to such media “revelations” or staged political scolding, and notwithstanding the good intentions of many involved in admissions, questions of diversity and inclusion are not taken seriously enough in their own right. The focus on educational achievement, itself defined in purely numerical terms and worsened by internal league tables, means there is little sense of meaningful diversity as an educational and community good in its own right. Despite having contextual indicators that would allow us to diversify our admissions, we balk at non-traditional attainment profiles for fear that the student will not be able to cope once here. For any Oxbridge college to not have a single black student at any given point in time, where they would rightly not tolerate having low numbers of women, is not just about looking institutionally racist but also impoverishes the educational and social environment we provide. The same holds true for regional and class exclusions. When I first came to Cambridge in 2001, having taught at different institutions in the US, I was struck by the relative whiteness and sheer cultural homogeneity of this university. Even the minimal improvements I’ve seen since then in some years – more students from ethnic minority backgrounds, more young women from northern comprehensives – have made a huge difference both to me as a teacher and, more importantly, to what students are able to learn from each other. Not all of them will get first-class marks, but they both gain a lot from and have a great deal to give to the educational environment here, not least by expanding the definition of what counts as achievement. We need more of them. (At Cambridge, in recent years, a quantum of vocal BME students as well as students from northern comprehensives has demanded change, often to good effect. There is some cause for hope.) There is also undoubtedly a culture of denial when it comes to matters of race and racism, which students speak of both in class and privately and which I have experienced when I’ve tried to draw attention to them. And more than one student from northern comprehensives has told me about being discouraged by teachers from applying and feeling amazed to have received an offer only to feel alienated by the stultifying class conformity of the affluent south-east once they get here. It is simply not good enough for Oxford and Cambridge to say that they are welcoming of diversity and in effect blame certain demographics for not applying despite their outreach programmes. It is Oxbridge that must change more substantially to provide a better environment for a diverse student body. The two ancients must be held to account; homogeneity must fall. But should they be the only ones held to account? In having a necessary conversation about elitism and exclusion, are we forgetting – or being encouraged – to not have a larger one about wider deprivation and systemic inequality? It is striking that some quarters only too happy to periodically attack Oxbridge for its failings, from rightwing tabloids to Tory ministers, are rarely interested in the roots of inequality and lack of opportunity of which Oxbridge exclusion is a symptom but is hardly the origin. We should be careful that a headline-friendly focus on these two institutions alone does not become an easy way to avoid even more painful and challenging questions. It seems somewhat selective and inadequate to focus on what David Lammy rightly calls “social apartheid” at Oxbridge without discussing the widespread and worsening economic apartheid in this country. We know that access to university education in general is sharply determined by school achievement that, in turn, is shaped by parental income and education levels. In an economically stratified society, it is inevitable that most young people from economically deprived backgrounds have a substantially lower chance of achieving the kind of marks that enable access to higher education. Hence it is incoherent to have a discussion about access to higher education without having one simultaneously about economic disadvantage, which, in some cases, including British Caribbean and Bangladeshi communities, has an added ethnic minority dimension to it. In a context of worsening economic fault lines, there’s a whiff of something convenient about only attacking the admissions failings of top universities. The other obvious missing dimension to this discussion is the existence and encouragement for independent schools. It’s somewhat contradictory to encourage a market culture where money can buy a deluxe education and then feel shocked when the well-off get their money’s worth by easily meeting the requirements for offers from high-status institutions. It’s worth saying that as long as independent schools, hardly bastions of ethnic diversity, exist, there will remain a fundamental apartheid between two kinds of students. Oxbridge, or even the Russell Group of universities more broadly, can only do so much to mitigate this state of affairs, which lifting the tuition fee cap will only worsen. Lammy notes that more offers are made to Eton than to students on free school meals. But why not also question the very existence of Eton and the lamentable state of an economic order that necessitates free school meals for many? Add to this the parlous condition of state education with its chronic underfunding, inflated classroom sizes, an undermining testing and target culture and difficulties in recruiting and retaining good teachers. The same politicians who rightly point to Oxbridge’s demographic narrowness are rarely willing to grasp the nettle of a two-tier educational structure in which some are destined to do much better than others. Who, for instance, would be willing to call for the abolition of private schooling, subject as such a suggestion would be to shrill denunciations about how individual choice, personal aspiration and the workings of the market are being interfered with? There are other tough discussions that could be had if the aim truly is to address and undo inequalities in university demographics. Would politicians and institutions be willing, for instance, to impose representational quotas for both ethnic minorities and state-educated students that reflect the national pie-chart? Currently, the Office for Fair Access (Offa) makes some toothless demands around “widening participation”, a rather feeble phrase, which are not accompanied by penalties for failure. Lammy, whose suggestion that admissions be centralised has some merit to it, not least towards undoing the unhelpful internal collegiate caste system at Oxbridge, has made also a comparison between Oxbridge’s abysmal intake of black students and Harvard’s healthy numbers. Would the political and intellectual classes be willing to have a discussion about something like “affirmative action” in the US, a process of “positive discrimination” by which underrepresented ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups are given special consideration? We must hope so. For failing a wide-ranging discussion aimed at radical measures, all the huffing and puffing about Oxbridge is destined to remain a yearly ritual, each controversial headline simply making way for the same unsurprising headlines every year.

Reece Hodge was the toast of the crowd, scoring the opening try and then, after taking kicking duties from Bernard Foley, booming two late penalties, the second from inside his own half, to provide the difference between the sides. Even with the Bledisloe Cup decided and facing an All Blacks side with six of their first choice XV unavailable, it had the feeling of a pivotal match. After coming heartbreakingly close in Dunedin two months ago, the Wallabies could not have stomached another creditable defeat and now they can look to facing the All Blacks as rivals rather than whipping boys after snapping the seven-game losing run. The factors you need to beat New Zealand were there. An under-strength All Blacks XV: check. Being gifted a try: check. Scoring on stroke of half-time: check. But the Australian effort was immense and they deserved every bit of luck they were handed. “I felt like we had the fight in us tonight, we really wanted it,” the Wallabies coach, Michael Cheika, said. “I think it’s the only way: to put pressure on these guys.” Although the win marked a remarkable turnaround from the 54-34 humbling by their rivals in the Rugby Championship opener, Cheika did not think it balmed the sting of failing to end their 15-year wait for the Bledisloe Cup. “As enjoyable as it was, the disappointment of not winning the cup still resonates. We know New Zealand are going to only get better and we’ve got to keep improving as well.” Without Hodge taking kicking duties at the end of the game, things might have been different. Had the Wallabies lost, just as in Dunedin Bernard Foley would have shouldered much of the blame as his one from four success followed on from his two from six in the last Bledisloe Cup contest. After squeaking victories against Australia and South Africa – following first-game demolitions over the same opposition – the All Blacks perhaps pushed their luck once too often, with Beauden Barrett (out following a concussion) the absence they could not overcome. The visitors looked set to dominate early but Will Genia’s pressure forced an errant pass from Lima Sopoaga straight into the arms of Hodge who ran 75 metres to score under the posts. Between this try and the cusp of half-time the All Blacks dominated territorially as handling errors shackled the Wallabies, but the visitors could only put one try on the scoreboard when Aaron Smith fed Waisake Naholo on the touchline to dive over. Sapoaga converted from out wide to level the scores and his two penalty kicks gave them the lead. Moments before the interval, Israel Folau took a short pass from Kurtley Beale, showed the ball outside and shrugged off two tackles before diving over the line to reduce the arrears to 13-12. The second half got off to a stilted start following a long stoppage as the Wallabies lock Rob Simmons was stretchered off with a neck injury – not thought to be serious – but after the resumption the Wallabies grabbed the momentum once more. A pivotal moment came in the 55th minute when twice they turned down the opportunity to kick at goal and it paid off as two minutes later Marika Koroibete dived over inside the left touchline after Folau fed him five metres from the line. Characteristically, the All Blacks kept on the attack, but Hodge’s kick increased the lead to seven. With nine minutes on the clock, Sonny Bill Williams drew two tacklers before off-loading, enabling Rieko Ioane to dive over for a try in the corner. But with Sopoaga off, Damian McKenzie took the kick and failed to split the uprights. It seemed like a time-wasting strategy when Hodge took a kick from his own half on a damp pitch and a wet ball with two minutes remaining but the wing’s boot was true and cleared the posts with metres to spare. With a penalty just before the hooter, the All Blacks had a last chance to win from a lineout but their coach, Steve Hansen, conceded that would have been undeserved. “They were the better side,” he said. “They took their opportunities, put us under pressure as well and prevented us taking ours.” Hansen wants his players to reflect on their first defeat of 2017 before looking to reassert their dominance in the northern hemisphere. “We’ll use the hurt to grow,” Hansen said. “A lot of these guys it’s probably their first loss in an All Black jersey. It’s an experience you don’t wash away. You learn your lessons from it and we’ll become a better team for it. The sun will come out tomorrow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/oct/22/azed-crossword-2367","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:01:35Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,367","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/oct/22/azed-crossword-2367","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/oct/22/azed-crossword-2367","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,367","bodyText":"Special Instructions The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.

The rethink, expected within weeks, also follows evidence from the National Housing Federation, which found that 85% of schemes to build new supported and sheltered homes for vulnerable people have been shelved by housing associations because of fears that the new funding system will make them unsustainable. More than 700,000 people in supported housing usually have the accommodation element of their costs met entirely through housing benefit. But under plans announced by the government in 2015, and due to be introduced from next year, these payments would be capped in the same way as for people renting in the private sector. As accommodation costs are higher in supported housing, because of the extra services and communal spaces provided, charities and others critics say the proposed system would leave residents facing big potential shortfalls. This is despite ministers saying that they could get help from special funds run by local authorities. The plans have caused an outcry, with charities warning the system would be bureaucratic, unworkable and would leave people facing uncertainty and worry about whether they could afford to remain. Supported housing provides a secure, safe place for the most vulnerable, the majority of whom are older people or those with long-term disabilities, as well as the mentally ill, people with disabilities, those at risk of homelessness and women fleeing domestic violence. An inquiry by the communities and local government and work and pension committees in parliament, called for an urgent rethink, saying: “In particular, we have been concerned by reports of providers choosing to postpone or cancel investment decisions, as well as increased levels of anxiety among vulnerable tenants who fear they may no longer have the guarantee of a home for life.” The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, told a recent session of the communities and local government committee the report had been “very helpful” and he expected to announce a decision soon that would show ministers had listened. Pressure for a climbdown is mounting before an opposition day debate on supported housing that will take place on Wednesday. On Monday the charity Rethink Mental Illness will publish a report showing people with the highest needs, and the highest costs, are likely to suffer the biggest shortfalls in rent. The charity says this will be most evident in parts of the country where rents are cheapest and therefore housing benefit payments will be lowest. Research has shown the cap will mean housing benefit will only cover about two thirds of accommodation costs in some parts of the country. Gillian Connor, head of policy partnerships at the charity, said: “We are hopeful the government has listened to the consensus of the sector: that a one-size-fits-all approach to supported housing will not work and will leave some of the most vulnerable people in society at risk. It is looking increasingly like the government has heeded these warnings and may be about to take a different approach to reforming this vital support. “We would absolutely welcome a rethink and a chance to shape reforms that ensure everyone is able to get the support they need.” Caroline Abrahams, a director of Age UK, said: “We would be pleased and relieved if the government has decided to rethink its proposed policy. With an ageing population, we need more supported housing for older people in this country, not less, but the proposals threatened a postcode lottery, with many providers having to withdraw services or close schemes altogether. The consequences for older people of pressing ahead would have been disastrous, so it’s very good news if the decision has been taken to adopt a different policy approach.” Labour’s shadow secretary of state, John Healey, said: “These plans remain a sword of Damocles hanging over homeless hostels, women’s refuges and sheltered housing for the frail elderly. The chaos caused by the Conservative plans has already halted 85% of new supported housing. Ministers must use this week’s Labour-led Commons debate to drop their flawed plans for good, and guarantee long-term funding building on the recent cross-party select committee report.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/22/hammond-should-use-an-interest-rate-rise-to-unpick-triple-lock-on-pensions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Hammond should use an interest rate rise to unpick triple lock on pensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/22/hammond-should-use-an-interest-rate-rise-to-unpick-triple-lock-on-pensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/22/hammond-should-use-an-interest-rate-rise-to-unpick-triple-lock-on-pensions","fields":{"headline":"Hammond should use an interest rate rise to unpick triple lock on pensions","bodyText":"As Philip Hammond prepares to defend his £12bn of welfare cuts in his autumn budget, pensioners can consider themselves lucky to be financially insulated. While most people on low and middle incomes are finding their spending power squeezed by rising inflation and cuts to in-work benefits, the triple lock on pensions is safe. This was made clear by the chancellor after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) joined the long queue of thinktanks from left, right and centre, arguing that pensioners need to share the burden of austerity. The triple lock, which guarantees a 2.5% increase in the state pension or a rise linked to inflation or earnings, whichever is the higher, has done much to improve the lot of pensioners. It was a Liberal Democrat promise in 2010 that the Tory leadership of the coalition government adopted. By contrast, Labour’s pension increases in the early part of the century focused on raising the incomes of the poorest with a means-tested pension credit. The OECD said last week in its annual health check on the UK that, since the triple lock was put in place, workers had made the largest contribution to reducing the government deficit, “whereas older individuals have been relatively unaffected”. The September inflation and earnings figures are used as the basis for calculating next April’s pensions increase. Inflation was 3% and earnings 2.2%. No wonder the OECD said that it would be fairer to tie future increases to earnings. The Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank that can claim to be one of the hothouses for developing Thatcherite policies in the 1980s, argues that welfare spending has become dramatically skewed in favour of the retired, pushing up their incomes by 10% in real terms, while benefits are down by around 5% for people of working age. Had state pension rises only sought to protect retirees from inflation since 2010, setting aside the link to earnings and 2.5%, the Treasury would now be £8.6bn a year better off, which might have paid for a two percentage point cut in income tax or increased spending in areas of greater need, it says. The CPS analysis illustrates how a promise that appears to cost little can become a weight, slowing the ship of state. When it was first agreed, George Osborne’s former Treasury adviser, Rupert Harrison, says it was a budget item costing £50m a year. Hammond is sympathetic to the campaign for a breather in pushing up the incomes of the better off. But he has ruled out any change for fear of endangering his already precarious political position. Yet his budget on 22 November could prove to be the perfect moment to stop funnelling ever more funds into pensions, should the Bank of England raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. This is the moment many older savers have been waiting for – when the pendulum swings away from cheap credit to providing a higher return on savings. The increase from 0.25% to 0.5% only restores an emergency cut made by Threadneedle Street in the wake of a Brexit-induced panic last August. In practice, it is unlikely to herald a rush back to even modest interest rate levels of 1% or 2%. However, the signal will be unmistakable, and the banks will begin to price their products accordingly. In fact, they already have. Mortgage lenders have increased their fixed rates for two and three years in anticipation of an increase in the base rate. Higher savings rates will no doubt follow in due course, providing the chancellor with a cheery backdrop – at least from the perspective of those who are retired – of stronger returns on savings. He can use this to pare back future pension benefits and redirect them to the working poor. In the name of fairness, the government cannot keep hammering the young to protect the old. It must shift its position before the generational divide widens further. Goldman plays the Brexit game Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein gave London mayor Sadiq Khan and City minister Stephen Barclay the equivalent of a cold shower last week when he tweeted: “Just left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I’ll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit”. The Treasury and Khan, not to mention the lord mayor of London, Andrew Parmley, are desperate to stop major banks, insurers, accountancy and law firms from decamping to Germany’s financial centre following Brexit. Plans for a soft Brexit – one that provides the banks with most of their demands – appear to have disappeared in a blizzard of claim and counter-claim as the EU and UK’s respective negotiating teams lock horns. A hard Brexit beckons. It means that agreeing the legal framework for trading between the EU and a newly independent Britain is fraught with difficulties arising from the rivalries with financial centres inside the EU and the limited time left to secure a deal. Financial industry lobby group TheCityUK says that most of its members will need to begin putting their contingency plans for a hard Brexit into action by April next year at the latest. It fears the loss of 75,000 jobs, £38bn in revenues and £10bn in tax should Britain exit without a deal. Theresa May’s pleading in Brussels last week could arrest the situation, especially after she appeared to illicit some favourable remarks from Angela Merkel, who said trade talks might begin in December. Yet the City knows the Brexit debate is not confined to May and Merkel or Brexit secretary David Davis and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Tory party has a stake in the outcome, meaning anything could happen, including a hard Brexit. So are financial firms bluffing if they threaten to quit when the Brexit flag goes up? Yes, but only because it takes time to move people with expensive demands from one place to another, set them up in swanky offices and find them homes and schools for their children. In the end, the very real risk is that London’s financial sector and the exchequer will be much diminished. Highly charged warning for power firms Change is coming whether you like it or not, UK energy regulator Ofgem told energy firms last week. While Dermot Nolan’s speech was partly about laying down the law to companies who have grumbled against the price caps he will impose, it was also about making it clear there are other big structural changes afoot, irrespective of these measures. In the future, householders might get their power from electric carmakers or tech firms selling smart gadgets, Nolan said. Or maybe they would get it from their local solar farm, making traditional suppliers less relevant or even redundant. While British Gas is the biggest energy company today, the market leader in a decade’s time could be plausibly be an Amazon or an Alphabet-owned Nest. In the meantime, there’s the small matter of price caps to implement. Nolan’s message to companies who oppose caps was clear: stop moaning, embrace it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/greg-clark-football-association-trust","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T20:21:37Z","webTitle":"How can we trust Greg Clarke and the Football Association on anything?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/greg-clark-football-association-trust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/greg-clark-football-association-trust","fields":{"headline":"How can we trust Greg Clarke and the Football Association on anything?","bodyText":"In ordinary circumstances it might have been a pleasant surprise that someone in a high position has finally found the voice to float the possibility that Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, has spent so long building his ivory tower he has allowed his organisation to be guilty, for far too long, of operating with blurred priorities. There are plenty of us who have wondered the same, bearing in mind the man at the top, already reputedly earning more than any other union boss on the planet, plainly felt he could do a whole lot better for himself a few years back. Taylor’s earnings went up from £1.3m to £3.4m – more, to put it another way, than Joachim Löw was paid for winning the World Cup – and if you want an example of how lopsided it all is, just consider Kick It Out’s financial struggles around that time, operating from a fourth-floor office above a pizza restaurant in Clerkenwell and trying to get by on funding of less than £300,000 a year. The PFA’s contribution, around £95,000, was the equivalent of what Taylor raked in for himself every 10 days or so. There is, however, a time and a place to pick these fights and perhaps somebody could have gently pointed out to Greg Clarke, the chairman of the Football Association, that it might not necessarily be the right moment during the parliamentary bollocking in which he referred, Alan Partridge-style, to the “fluff of institutional racism” and gave the distinct impression that, like lots of self-made men, he was absolutely desperate to share the recipe. A man, you could say, who had allowed all the failures to go to his head. “Let me be frank about my dealing with the PFA,” Clarke began, in one of the more illuminating exchanges with the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. “I’d like to be very frank. I have a fundamental problem with their governance – at the top. Let me tell you why.” Full marks for his persistence, too, when one MP, sensing a diversion tactic, attempted to cut him short. “May I just have 30 seconds, sir?” Clarke requested. “Just 30 seconds.” And off he went, telling his story about meeting one of the footballers who had been sexually abused, recalling how the person in question had “cried like a baby” in his company and then, voice hardening, recounting the shock and revulsion when it became apparent that the PFA had stopped funding this guy’s counselling. “The PFA spend millions of pounds a year on their CEO salary and the CEO pension fund and they’re walking away from alcoholics, they’re walking away from addicted gamblers and they’re walking away from people like him.” It was powerful stuff. He was absolutely determined to get it out and by the time he was done – “I will never respect their governance” – it would not have been a surprise to see him bringing down his fist on the table for added effect. He was close to shouting. And nobody should be too surprised, I suppose, by this level of disdain bearing in mind that almost implausible 14-word email – “I’ve no idea why you are sending me this. Perhaps you could enlighten me?” – when the PFA informed him two of his executives, Dan Ashworth and Rachel Brace, had cooked up a “sham” inquiry to close down Eni Aluko’s complaints about Mark Sampson. It was a pity Clarke didn’t finish this little speech by letting us know what happened next if, as I suspect, the person he was referring to was Andy Woodward and a meeting last November when part of their discussion involved the fact the former player had reached his limit in terms of PFA-funded counselling. Andy was the first to come forward, you might recall, to waive his anonymity and tell his story in the belief there were hundreds, even thousands, of others who had suffered the same kind of childhood horrors. Without him, there might not have been one football person on the Operation Hydrant list, never mind the latest mind-boggling figures of 784 victims, 285 suspects and 2,028 referrals, with 331 professional and amateur clubs named. Andy has saved lives and, hopefully, changed the sport, and people still stop him in the street sometimes to thank him for his courage (heck, Barbara Knox, Rita from Coronation Street, grabbed his arm in Waitrose a while back to say “well done”). He has done more good than he probably knows. But it’s not the life any footballer would have wanted. As a boy, Andy was raped more times than he can possibly remember, but it is in the hundreds. Something like that leaves its mark: anxiety, panic attacks, post‑traumatic stress disorder. It is a struggle sometimes. Of course it is. What didn’t get reported to the select committee was that Taylor, to give him his due, offered to pay for extra counselling out of his own pocket when he found out. Maybe Clarke, assuming he was talking about the same thing, didn’t know that extra detail. Yet it is a dangerous game Clarke is playing if he really wants us to step away from the Sampson debacle, the lingering stench of a cover-up and some of the worst examples of boardroom buffoonery I can recall from any FA regime, to analyse how the various authorities have dealt with the abuse scandal. We could start, perhaps, by pointing out the FA has not offered a penny of funding (barring a donation to an August charity match) to the Offside Trust, the organisation that was set up by, and for, survivors. Clarke has described what has happened as the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport but has never even been in touch with the people running the trust. Not even a good-luck message. Instead Clarke claimed during Wednesday’s cringeworthy performance that he had been “working 22 hours a day” to make football safe and even tried to blame that workload for being so curt and dismissive in that 14-word email to the PFA and, in the words of the committee chairman, Damian Collins, coming across as both “oafish” and “passive aggressive”. But then, Clarke says a lot of things that leave people asking questions. In his interview with the Daily Telegraph on 2 October, he claimed to have spoken to “20 or 30 [abuse victims], usually in small groups” and that has caused quite a bit of surprise among the small number of survivors who have been willing to be identified. Maybe you saw the response, via Twitter, from Ian Ackley, one of the four people who have launched SAVE (Safeguarding and Victim Engagement), that in the past 10 months he had seen Clarke for the sum total of 15 minutes. “As a survivor, I can’t say he’s paid me much attention,” he wrote. Clarke’s press aides tell me their recollection was it was an hour an a half and that many abuse victims have gone directly to him. Unfortunately for Clarke and his colleagues, they might just have to understand why it is so easy to be cynical in the current climate and why, for instance, some of the victims who have identified themselves and are campaigning for change find it slightly suspicious their go-to man at the FA is actually a press officer – someone whose job, for the main part, is to prevent bad publicity. Likewise, it is hardly a surprise that questions are being asked about the FA’s motives when what could easily be described as sweeteners – overnight stops at five-star hotels, a free box for England games and so on – have been offered to the victims who have featured in the newspapers and might have some awkward things to say about the role of the governing body when it comes to all the failings and ignored warnings behind the scenes. More than anything, I wonder how much the FA can be trusted when it comes to the independent inquiry that Clive Sheldon QC expects to be completed next Easter. One of the more revealing parts of the Sampson affair was that Ashworth had identified 16 people whom the barrister Katharine Newton might wish to interview and yet, brilliantly, did not include the player, Drew Spence, to whom the first discriminatory remark was made or any of the six people who were in the same room at the time. Ashworth also nominated himself to give evidence on Sampson’s behalf for the FA’s lamentable and highly suspicious internal review even though he was actually overseeing that inquiry. Yet the FA expertly removed Newton’s criticism of the director of elite development’s conduct when it published an edited summary and that would be my fear again if, as expected, Sheldon’s verdict also reflected badly on the people running the sport. Officially, it is called an independent report but once it comes back to the FA executives it will be their possession and their decision, entirely, what they release and what they keep back. Will they publish it in full (at least, what they can without it affecting any court cases)? Or will, as I suspect, they hold bits back to protect what remains of the FA’s reputation as the so-called guardians of the sport? One of the victims asked that question to Sheldon when he was interviewed for the inquiry in August and the transcript, seen by this correspondent, shows that not even the QC can be sure. “I’m certainly expecting them to publish it,” he says. “But I can’t guarantee they will.” Blazers have company for calamitous gaffes A few closing points about that mortifying session for the Football Association in the Grimond Room at Portcullis House (with a nod to my colleague on the press benches Paul Hayward, for wondering whether it was the Grim Room for short). 1) It is probably safe to assume there is no apology coming from David James for deciding Eni Aluko was to blame for all of this, subjecting her to a wholly uninformed Twitter outburst then surreptitiously pressing the delete button once he had made himself look a bit of a berk. You might remember James’s nickname as an accident-prone goalkeeper used to be Calamity – and wonder why he is so intent on keeping it that way. 2) That was a particularly ghastly moment when the four FA executives were asked about Lucy Ward’s sex‑discrimination case at Leeds, blinked dumbly (“When was that?” Greg Clarke asked) and admitted they had no idea what the MPs were talking about. Ward, to recap, tried for 18 months to persuade the FA to investigate and the governing body was asked seven times before informing her, punily, that there was nothing it could do. Needless to say, we are still waiting for an explanation how they missed a story that has attracted considerable publicity since early 2016. 3) The announcement, two days before the hearing, that Danielle Carter – a black England Women’s footballer – had been appointed to the FA council was, I presume, just another of what Dan Ashworth, the Director of Coincidence, would pass off as one of those strange quirks of timing. 4) Martin Glenn, the chief executive, wanted everyone to know the FA’s media department had been in touch with the Guardian to point out he had got it wrong – “not a pack of lies, but it was an embellishment” – during our 21 September interview for the Observer’s sister paper when he explained, at quite some length, how he had deliberately appointed Katharine Newton, a black woman, to oversee the independent inquiry because of her sex and ethnicity. Glenn blamed this rather peculiar mistake on being tired at the end of a long day and maybe he was feeling jaded again when he said that about his press office. No conversation of that nature ever took place. 5) The FA’s head of women’s football, Baroness Campbell – whose interviews during and after this process have shown why she fits in so neatly to this regime – says the interviews for Mark Sampson’s replacement begin in December and guess who will be trusted to put together the shortlist. That’s right: Dan Ashworth, the man with his fingerprints all over this debacle. And on and on it goes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/21/bristol-city-leeds-united-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T17:05:24Z","webTitle":"Leeds United’s Samuel Sáiz hits swift double to halt Bristol City’s charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/21/bristol-city-leeds-united-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/21/bristol-city-leeds-united-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leeds United’s Samuel Sáiz hits swift double to halt Bristol City’s charge","bodyText":"A wet and windy West Country afternoon could not deter the Bristol City faithful. The 25,000-strong support came in expectation rather than hope as Lee Johnson’s high-flying Robins looked to see off another Championship heavyweight on their dream run towards the automatic promotion places. But Samuel Sáiz rained on their parade and put fresh force into Leeds’s bid to return to the Premier League after 14 years. The former Huesca midfielder has risen from obscurity to play a starring role for Thomas Christensen and here he scored two goals inside the first 15 minutes to end his sides’s three-game losing streak. The result was put beyond doubt when the Hamburg loanee Pierre-Michel Lasogga glanced a header home in the 68th minute. The only sour note for Leeds was a red card for the full-back Gaetano Berardi after he threw his head into Matty Taylor’s, the Bristol forward also given his marching orders. Christensen said: “I’m very happy with the performance of the team and for the three points. It was the same team that had problems before and the team that will bring us back to form, the difference was the intensity. “Being brave is one of the things we had to do and we had to believe in ourselves. Sometimes we think too much about the opponent but today we fought.” It took four minutes, and a mistake from the home defender Aden Flint, for Leeds to stamp their authority at Ashton Gate. Kalvin Phillips got tight to block Flint’s clearance into the path of Lasogga, who backheeled the ball to Sáiz. The Spaniard cut inside and found the net via a deflection off the Bristol captain, Bailey Wright. The Real Madrid youth product showed his killer instinct 10 minutes later to make it 2-0. Frank Fielding rushed from his goal to prevent Eunan O’Kane’s pass reaching Ezgjan Alioski, but the ball spilled out to the 26-year-old, who finished calmly to send the Robins towards their second defeat of the season. They did attempt to mount a comeback as the clock ticked down on the first period, their best chance falling to Bobby Reid, who could not steer his header on target after Andy Lonergan missed his punch. Their resurgence continued after the restart but again they failed to find a cutting edge when Jens Hegeler headed over from a corner. Instead, Sáiz should have clinched the win with his third. Ronaldo Vieira won the ball upfield, burst clear of the defence and teed Sáiz up, but his toe-poke rolled wide of the target. Hegeler had another header saved before Leeds made sure they would be taking all three points back to Yorkshire. Lasogga’s deflected free-kick earned a corner in front of the away support and when Phillips swung the ball in, the German target man rose high at the near post to head home. There was still time for the referee, Oliver Langford, to dish out a pair of red cards when Taylor reacted angrily to a challenge from Berardi. The former Bristol Rovers striker leaped to his feet and was met by a butt from the Italian. Both players were sent for early baths and Leeds coasted to what could prove to be a vital victory in the race for promotion. Johnson said: “I had to meditate for 20 minutes to calm down after the game, Matty Taylor had his nose broken in the clash at the end. “We’ve literally had a punch, or headbutt in the nose, and we’ll have to bounce back from this. We have to look at why we didn’t get going, we got caught believing our own hype.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/21/national-trust-defeats-move-to-ban-trail-hunting-on-its-land","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T20:02:11Z","webTitle":"National Trust defeats move to ban trail hunting on its land","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/21/national-trust-defeats-move-to-ban-trail-hunting-on-its-land","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/21/national-trust-defeats-move-to-ban-trail-hunting-on-its-land","fields":{"headline":"National Trust defeats move to ban trail hunting on its land","bodyText":"The National Trust was accused of succumbing to pressure from the hunting lobby after a motion to ban trail hunting on the organisation’s land was narrowly defeated at its annual conference on Saturday, sparking warnings that some members would cancel their subscriptions in disgust. Members, including the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, had backed the motion as a means of prohibiting trail hunting – in which hounds and riders follow a scent path laid earlier – which has long been regarded by animal rights campaigners and others as a means of circumventing the 2004 hunting ban. While the motion was endorsed by 28,629 member votes, with 27,525 against, it was ultimately defeated after the counting of 3,460 proxy votes, which were authorised to be used at the discretion of other members and the trust’s board of trustees. Before the vote, the charity’s board had recommended that the trail hunting should be allowed to continue following recent improvements in licensing conditions to further safeguard conservation and access on the trust’s land. Some 2,057 proxy votes were cast in favour. Helen Beynon, an NT member who tabled the motion to halt the issuing of licences for trail hunting or the exercise by hunts of their hounds on trust land after witnessing one earlier this year, said: “I believe the only reason our motion has failed is because most National Trust members haven’t seen it with their own eyes. If they’d have seen what I’ve seen, then I have no doubt they would have voted with us. “I was surprised that, despite all the evidence available to the trustees, and the fact that we were given no opportunity to respond to the terms of any new licence, they advised members to vote against our proposal. They have led people to believe that there is no problem. But there is a problem – hunts will now be able to continue their barbaric hobby on land which is meant to be protected for people and animals. It’s disgraceful, and the trust should be ashamed.” The League Against Cruel Sports, which had supported Beynon and other NT members in bringing the motion, described the result as a “massive backward step for justice and a shot in the arm for cruelty”. A fraught debate saw supporters of the motion criticise recent changes introduced by the Trust, including banning the use of animal-based scents, as unworkable and questioned how the organisation would find the resources to monitor trail hunting if it continued. Peter Martin, an NT member and chairman of the Badger Trust who supported the ban, said that badger setts were being routinely filled in during the hunting season, often burying badgers alive. “No organisation can license or permit illegal activities on your land. If you are not prepared to commit resources to monitor illegal activity and to ensure it does not take place on your land, then you must ban it,” he said. Opponents accused those behind the motion of seeking to turn the issue into a political football. Among them was Ann Mallalieu, the Labour peer and president of the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance, who said that it was wrong for the trust to divert resources into such an issue. “Argue your case for a change in the law elsewhere, but do not damage this charity,” she said. Orna Ni Chionna, a member of the trust’s board who outlined its case against the motion, insisted that things would be “substantially different” under the new guidelines introduced this year. Terriermen, traditionally involved in digging out foxes, were being banned from trust land, while the guidelines specified the use of non-animal-based scents to reduce the chances that foxes and other animals would be chased. “This is a polarised subject, one in which we can’t afford to be driven by emotion,” she said, adding that the trust had to respond to the experience of staff, visitors and members. “I have seen the pressure that rural communities are under and the role hunting has played in supporting them, but it is not always pursued responsibly and when things go wrong it is unpleasant, to say the least. All this stretches the tolerance of our members, visitors and staff.” A total of 79 annual licences were granted last year to applicants seeking to engage in trail hunting on trust lands. Licences are granted on the understanding that the hunt simulates a traditional chase, but without foxes being deliberately pursued or killed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/help-advice-on-greens-5-a-day-sales-vegetables-fruit","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:02:35Z","webTitle":"Firms pledge extra veg help for those struggling with five a day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/help-advice-on-greens-5-a-day-sales-vegetables-fruit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/help-advice-on-greens-5-a-day-sales-vegetables-fruit","fields":{"headline":"Firms pledge extra veg help for those struggling with five a day","bodyText":"Eat more vegetables – it is the constant exhortation from doctors, dieticians and public health experts, but falling sales of greens suggests the advice is being ignored. This week 30 retailers, cafe chains and catering companies will pledge to include more vegetables in their products. Schools and councils will also be involved, as well as some leading employers who will commit to making it easier for staff to get their five a day. Greggs, the high street chain known for its pasties and rolls, is among those joining the Pledge for Veg campaign. From January every one of its soups and leaf-based salads will contain enough vegetables to count as at least one of someone’s five a day. From next year, half of all Greggs sandwiches will contain at least half a portion of vegetables and the company plans to sell an extra 15 million portions of vegetables. Malcolm Copland, Greggs’s commercial director, said it was making the changes after strong sales of its “balanced choice” range showed there was demand for healthier options. The accountancy firm PwC is one of 30 public and private organisations that will make the pledge for veg at meetings in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff on Tuesday. In partnership with the contract caterer Baxter Storey, which feeds PwC’s 18,000 staff, it will increase the amount of fruit and vegetables available in its canteens and improve the vegetarian and vegan offerings. “Eating more vegetables has so many benefits. Not only is it healthier for our people and better from an environmental point of view, it’s also on trend for our people who are increasingly interested in vegetarian and vegan options as part of a tasty diet,” said Bridget Jackson, PwC’s head of corporate sustainability. Obesity is rising and diets low in vegetables are a factor in about 20,000 deaths a year in Britain. Evidence from the Global Burden of Disease project shows that poor diet is the biggest risk factor in Britain for death and disability from diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses. While more people are eating fruit since the five-a-day campaign began running in 2003, sales of vegetables have fallen. “Most people desperately need to eat more veg but are struggling. Four in five people in the UK want to be eating more. We desperately need the food system to work harder to help us,” said Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, one of the organisers of the new campaign. “These trailblazing pledges are helping to put more veg in the things we’re already buying and eating, at work and on the go, and helping to tackle the food swamps where there is an over-abundance of junk food, and food deserts, with an absence of affordable fruit and veg, which characterise many parts of our cities,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/26/ribchester-go-ahead-breeders-cup-mile-del-mar","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T18:00:56Z","webTitle":"Ribchester gets the go-ahead to tackle world Approval in Breeders’ Cup Mile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/26/ribchester-go-ahead-breeders-cup-mile-del-mar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/26/ribchester-go-ahead-breeders-cup-mile-del-mar","fields":{"headline":"Ribchester gets the go-ahead to tackle World Approval in Breeders’ Cup Mile","bodyText":"Britain’s challenge for the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar strengthened significantly on Thursday when Ribchester, the leading miler in Europe this season, was given the go-ahead to line up for the Mile in California in nine days’ time by Richard Fahey, his trainer. Ribchester was beaten a length by Persuasive in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot last Saturday, when the soft going did not play to his strengths, but he has recovered swiftly from his exertions there and is sure to enjoy the much quicker ground when the Breeders’ Cup is staged in San Diego for the first time next week. He has taken three Group One races already this season, including a one‑and‑a-quarter length success in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. The start for the Mile is halfway down Del Mar’s short home straight and a good draw will be important if Ribchester and his jockey, William Buick, are not going to be caught wide on the tight bends. With several other European entries for the race, including Roly Poly and Decorated Knight, more likely to opt for alternative engagements at the meeting, however, Ribchester will be the clear leader of the overseas challenge to the best US‑based turf miler, World Approval. “He has kept his coat, he looks a picture and clearly he wants to go,” Fahey, who trains Ribchester for Godolphin, told the operation’s website on Thursday. “He has done everything but tell me himself that he should be on the plane to California. As a trainer, after a run like that [at Ascot] you’re probably looking for a reason not to take him, but I couldn’t find it. He’s in great order and he’s eating well.” Ribchester is the 7-2 second favourite for the Mile behind Mark Casse’s five-year-old World Approval, who spent much of his career running at middle-distance trips until reverting to a mile this season and immediately showing improved form to win two Grade One events. World Approval can be backed at 5-2 to win what the betting suggests might turn into a head-to-head, as there is no other contender with a first‑preference entry in the race available at shorter than 10-1. “I rode out there about 26 years ago,” Fahey said, “and it’s a typical American track. You don’t know [how he will adapt] and it’s hard to replicate it, but there’s no reason why he shouldn’t. “I think the draw will be very important, but then it is wherever you go. You’d like to be maybe not on the fence, but not on the wide outside, that’s not ideal. If I could pick it now, I’d be in four or five. I’ve not seen anything of World Approval, to be honest, but I’ll be looking at the videos over the next few days and he’s a talented horse.” Cheltenham opens its doors for the first time in the jumps season with a seven‑race card on Friday, the first afternoon of the two-day Showcase meeting. Sceau Royal, who finished sixth behind Buveur D’Air in the Champion Hurdle in March, will attempt to maintain an unbeaten record over fences when he lines up for the second race, a two-mile novice chase. Alan King’s five-year-old is top-priced at 25-1 for the Arkle Trophy at next year’s Cheltenham Festival, as is Movewiththetimes, the runner-up in last season’s Betfair Hurdle, who will make his fencing debut in the same contest.

Or a long-term one. One glance at his CV at the time of his appointment was sufficient to raise eyebrows concerning a coach prone to changing job with such regularity it seemed odd that Rangers, a club desperate for stability, would be attracted to him in the first place. At the time of Caixinha’s unveiling anxious board members hung around as if they were not entirely sure that this stab in the dark was actually a wise move. Surprise, surprise as to what happened next. Rangers as a club remain wholly unconvincing, with Caixinha really only symbolic of that rather than responsible for perpetuating the feeling. It seemed poetic that a rare visit to Glasgow by the Rangers chairman, Dave King, accelerated his dismissal. King – a man who dubiously promised the earth to beleaguered yet impressively loyal supporters upon sweeping to power – played no part at all in this manager’s appointment. The hiring of a director of football, Mark Allen, came after Caixinha landed the head coach position. Now is not only the time for Allen to shake off his role as an invisible man but also for Rangers to ensure they do not repeat an utterly baffling recruitment process. Paul Le Guen, Ian Cathro, Ronny Deila – to a lesser extent – and now Caixinha are all coaches from left-field who came into Scottish football and failed before debate cranked up regarding why the national sport was in such a dreadful state in the first place. Too old fashioned, is the cry. Yet their shortcomings are as blatant as they are similar; they all displayed a failure to understand what it takes to win games in Scotland. Brendan Rodgers arrived at Celtic from a far more lofty environment but has succeeded because he was smart enough to instantly comprehend both the intensity attached to the Old Firm and the nuances of football north of the border. Players of specific physical and psychological state are fundamental. For such a notoriously basic, humdrum environment, this country doesn’t half perplex coaches supposedly chosen for their valuable experience gained elsewhere. Caixinha watched Rangers, a well-drilled Rangers, claim a draw at Celtic Park on the day before he met the media for the first time. Within weeks, in a quite staggering display of tactical naivety from the home manager, Rangers were pulled apart by the same opposition, 5-1 at Ibrox. Rodgers doubtless could not believe his luck. Caixinha did not win three matches in a row as the Rangers manager. His side were defensively soft, did not attack with aggression or purpose and too often displayed a lack of discipline mirrored by the manager himself. The sight of Caixinha standing in a bush, gesturing at supporters who were perfectly correct to outline their disgust after a Europa League exit in Luxembourg, rather summed up his lack of control. Even in what represents quite the league table of ignominy, this was the worst European result ever suffered by a Scottish team. Caixinha was swift, too swift, to jettison players he believed did not suit his profile. For all it is a manager’s right to choose his own personnel, Caixinha was completely undermined by the also-rans he signed – at relatively high cost – in the name of improvement. Damningly, too many of those players have performed as individuals rather than as part of a team. Nobody in the stands seriously expected Rangers to properly pursue Celtic for the title this season but they did – quite rightly – want a team which cost far more than Aberdeen, Motherwell and others to separate themselves as the second force. Caixinha leaves Rangers fourth in the Premiership, with 18 points from 10 matches and a record which shows Hibernian, Heart of Midlothian and Kilmarnock have all left Ibrox undefeated. Those within the Rangers squad spoke of almost a split personality with whom they never really knew where they stood. That much was also illustrated in recent days. In the immediate aftermath of a dismal League Cup elimination at the hands of Motherwell – during which Rangers were bullied – Caixinha publicly shouldered full responsibility. Within 24 hours, he publicly lambasted players for “embarrassing” their club. Perhaps Caixinha was simply overburdened by his role in completely the wrong movie and didn’t know how to cope. The assertion that Caixinha’s successor will inherit a poisoned chalice is not at all accurate. Yes, there will be a challenge in removing players clearly unsuited to the Scottish game while enjoying lavish salaries but there is also scope for improvement. It is six years since Rangers won a trophy – a period in which Ross County, Inverness, St Mirren, Kilmarnock and others have done so – meaning the returning of tangible reward is a realistic goal rather than toppling Celtic at the summit. It should not be beyond Rangers, given the resource deployed and available, to collect the odd trophy and enjoy reasonable spells in Europe. In years to come people will glance back at Caixinha’s short, flawed tenure and scratch their heads. The galling thing for Rangers is that precisely the same thing happened for many when the club appointed him. Sometimes football really is predictable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/30/homelessness-housing-andrew-ross-oregon","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T10:00:53Z","webTitle":"My brother was homeless for 25 years.

He just got an apartment. Now what?","bodyText":"A few days after Christmas, my older brother moved into a new apartment in downtown Corvallis, a bucolic college town in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. Even after living there for half a year, Andrew was a little reluctant to have me visit. He was falling behind in a role-playing computer game he commits to for months at a time, he said. He didn’t think he would be able to tidy the place up. I didn’t care, I assured him. The intercom system didn’t work, so I slipped in as someone else left his building and texted him to come get me. In the hallway, he passed the woman who lives in the next apartment over. “How’s it going, neighbor?” he said with a friendly lilt. It’s nice having neighbors, Andrew said. You see them in the hallways. Andrew opened the door and we walked into the first walled domicile my brother has occupied in 25 years. Since he was a teenager, Andrew has been homeless. Mostly he has lived in a tent, in a hidden camp shrouded by blackberry bushes, whether the temperature is zero degrees or 100. He stacked mattresses atop pallets to keep rats from nesting in them and ate at soup kitchens. Sometimes we lived in the same city, a few miles away from each other, me in an apartment and him in the undergrowth. Andrew has at times described his life as a choice, a rejection of a system that’s rigged. But it’s also true that he’s just never been able to manage by himself in the world, thanks largely to manic or depressive bouts that rob him of a good night’s sleep and the focus required to get through college, or to stay on top of an application for disability or housing benefits. He’s never had a girlfriend or a driver’s license, never left the United States. Now he had an apartment. I wondered what might change. We were raised in Berkeley, California, by hippy parents who stumbled into marrying each other and having children. They did their best, but they could be erratic: permissive one day, punitive the next. I always believed my brother threw in the towel at trying to figure out the rules, retreating into a life behind a computer screen. He started smoking pot at 12 and was bullied in high school. Nobody saw him then as disabled or mentally ill. I saw him as just a kid who smoked too much weed and seemed to refuse to get his life together. My parents tried many times to prop Andrew up again, only to see him slump. At 18, he dropped out of Berkeley high school. My dad had a strict rule that Andrew couldn’t live with him unless he was enrolled in school or working. My mom was softer, but ultimately they both refused to put him up indefinitely, or without signs of progress. They let him live in a tent in each of their yards for a few weeks at a time. He slept on friends’ couches, and then in a park up the street from my dad’s house. We were mostly adversaries as kids, except in the rare moments we teamed up against our freewheeling parents. He taught me how to ride a bicycle, and he bought me my first album, Thriller. By the time he dropped out of high school, though, I judged Andrew for the kind of person he had apparently decided to become: lazy, a computer nerd, a stoner. But one summer, Andrew wound up in Anacortes, a rural town jutting into the water north of Seattle, staying in what he described as a “little sort of lean-to build on a hill in some wilderness”. When the rains came, my dad showed up to get Andrew out of there. He found his son passively sitting in the rain, soaking wet. The image of him my dad described, of a person so dejected he wouldn’t seek shelter, has always stuck with me. It was the first time I can remember my judgment of him melting into empathy. People often ask (or I can see that they want to ask) why I wouldn’t let him live with me. I’ve never really had much to offer in the way of space or housing, but if he’d lost a job and needed a couch to crash on for a few weeks while he got back on his feet, I’d have found a way to put him up. The problem is, Andrew expressed no real interest in trying to change his life, or perhaps he couldn’t see how to. Letting my brother live with me would have no end. When I thought about Andrew living outside, what I felt was anxiety. I would often attribute my success as a journalist to a fear of failure, and of winding up in the same situation as Andrew. I worked hard because there was no safety net. If I ran out of money, I might be able to ride some couches for a few weeks, even a few months. But unless I found and held gainful employment, there was no one to bail me out or keep me afloat. After years of trying to keep his reality out of my head, because it scared and saddened me, I finally decided I had to know more, and in 2009 I paid him a visit. On the outskirts of Corvallis, he led me to a camp in a clearing between some railroad tracks and a state highway. There was a small hill of trash next to a roomy tent containing his mattresses and nothing else. Like many homeless people, he didn’t dare leave anything of value at camp, which meant carrying everything he owned on his back. In consequence, he owned very little. As we walked into the city, other homeless people who knew my brother and loved him called out from across the street: “Ace!” He told me he’d become a regular at karaoke, and begged me to go sing with him sometime. He didn’t panhandle, because nothing he needed to survive really required cash. He took me to the Grocery Outlet where he spends his food stamps and to the library where he spent many of the daytime hours, either reading books or surfing the internet. He had lost everything he owned at least a dozen times, I learned that day. Once, another homeless man stole his backpack, and when Andrew confronted him, the man retaliated by burning his entire camp to the ground. We tried to work out what differentiated the two of us, why one brother might “make it” while another winds up homeless. Neither of us came up with a great answer, except that he seems to be less afraid of consequences than I am. I might worry about losing my job because then I couldn’t pay rent. He doesn’t really plan very far ahead at all. After a two-year wait for subsidized housing, Andrew finally received word that he could move into his new apartment, in a renovated hotel in Corvallis. For my mother especially, this was an enormous relief – she no longer has to worry about getting a grim call from the Benton County sheriff. It took my brother four trips on the bus to get all of his possessions from his camp to his new home. He left behind his two six-man tents, one he used for storage and the other for sleeping. After half a lifetime of homelessness, he’s not so quick to relinquish a spot that feels safe. “I’m keeping it,” he says. “For backup.” On the way to Corvallis, I wondered how a person who’d never really had his own apartment would furnish one.It was nearly 100 degrees outside when I arrived, but in the apartment, the temperature was perfect, thanks to a ductless heat pump that hangs just below the living room ceiling. It is a basic, carpeted one-bedroom place with a cramped kitchen, the windows facing the heart of downtown and the Willamette river. In the bedroom, there’s a bare mattress on a frame. There are no sheets on the bed because he prefers his sleeping bag. “I’m just used to sleeping bags, I guess,” he says. He spends most of his time on the couch in the living room, with one of the only other pieces of furniture – a computer desk – pulled up to it, such that the desk sits awkwardly in the center of the living room. The kitchen cabinets are crammed with bags of bulk food he buys with food stamps or from food banks. Most of the dishes came from our mother. The most expensive appliance he owns is a French press, which cost $14 at Goodwill. For me, learning that Andrew’s 25 years of homelessness were coming to such a sudden end felt profound, even surreal. But when I asked Andrew about how his life was different now, his answers at first struck me as glib. The best part of apartment living, he said, was being able to cook. He now prepares his own breakfasts, lunches and dinners; mostly burritos, some pasta with pesto. “Have you seen these fucking tortillas they have at WinCo?” Andrew asked me, holding up a package of the largest package of tortillas I have ever seen. “They’re massive.” “It’s been great to eat ice cream,” he added. “Before, if I got a pint, I couldn’t eat more than half, and then the rest would melt.” Andrew has always found joy in things like this, things I find trivial. That’s partly why I have a hard time relating to him. It didn’t occur to me until weeks afterwards that Andrew is focused on simple pleasures because to him, they aren’t simple. For people who live in homes, having a meal is as easy as going to the refrigerator. For someone like Andrew, not having a refrigerator meant being unable to store anything that might spoil. If he managed to cook something, he had nowhere to keep leftovers. Being able to get clean when you want to, or using a sanitary, private toilet – these are not things Andrew takes for granted. In the long term, I’d love to see Andrew find some kind of a calling. But for now, after so many years on the streets, he won’t be sleeping outside in an Oregon winter, and the things that might seem small are to be savored.

High street stores reported rapidly falling sales – the worst since 2009. Output from Britain’s car factories tumbled, shrinking by 4.1% in September, with demand from UK car buyers plummeting by 14.2%. Meanwhile, official figures revealed the average pay for full-time workers crept up to £550 a week, but in real terms have fallen as they have been outstripped by prices. Even the one mildly positive bit of economic news – that GDP growth was slightly higher than expected – came with a warning that construction activity contracted for the second quarter in a row. In normal times we might expect a chancellor to be finding ways to stimulate the economy, with the Bank of England loosening the purse strings to lift activity. But precisely the opposite is about to happen. We are told there is an 80% certainty that the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, will make the momentous announcement on Thursday that UK interest rates are to rise for the first time in 10 years. In some ways Carney’s posturing over interest rates – in 2013 he intimated that rates may have to rise if unemployment dropped below 7% – has boxed him into a corner. Such is the scale of anticipation in financial markets that if a rate rise doesn’t flash up on screens midday on Thursday, sterling will crash. And what happens when sterling falls steeply? Inflation rises as the cost of imported goods increases – the very thing Carney is trying to avoid by raising rates. We should not have got to this position. Inflation is 3%, its highest since 2012 and a fair bit ahead of the 2% level the Bank is supposed to maintain. But it’s far from catastrophic; inflation peaked at 5.2% in 2011 but it did not prompt a rate rise. Then, it was regarded as largely the result of the decline in sterling, which fell from $2 to $1.40 in 2008-09, a bigger drop than even sterling’s decline after the EU referendum. Back then, the Bank took the view that inflation would subside when sterling settled, which is precisely what happened. Why panic now and raise rates, just when the currency effects are about to fade and when desperate retailers will be discounting massively as they battle to survive? In any case, it’s arguable what impact a 0.25% rise will have on consumer behaviour. Only 43% of households now have mortgages that track or are linked to the Bank base rate. The rest are on fixed rates, which means half the country can justifiably yawn on Thursday and say: “Rate rise? What rate rise?” Even for those who will see their mortgage repayments go up – the average will be around £20 a month, or two lattes a week. Maybe Carney wants us to wake up and smell the coffee after years of bingeing on debt, and believes a rate rise will send a powerful psychological signal that the easy money years are over. But why use interest rates when other tools – such as straightforward regulatory intervention – could work instead. In any case, our overheated housing market is already beginning to cool, one of the few economic benefits to have emerged so far out of Brexit. How should households prepare for rising interest rates? It’s staggering how many buyers are on two-year fixed-rate deals. These will have high “revert to” rates that could prove painful for some buyers if their properties get caught in negative equity and they are unable to remortgage to better deals. My suspicion is that some brokers encourage two-year deals because they earn a “procuration” fee on each one and know they will pick up another in just 24 months’ time. Anyone with a large mortgage not tied to big exit fees should be considering a five-year fixed rate. They start at just 1.69% – a screamingly brilliant rate even if Carney’s rise fails to materialise. You would have queued round the block for such deals five years ago, which shows how blasé we have become about low rates. Grab these deals while they last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"The war against Pope Francis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis","fields":{"headline":"The war against Pope Francis","bodyText":"Pope Francis is one of the most hated men in the world today. Those who hate him most are not atheists, or protestants, or Muslims, but some of his own followers. Outside the church he is hugely popular as a figure of almost ostentatious modesty and humility. From the moment that Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became pope in 2013, his gestures caught the world’s imagination: the new pope drove a Fiat, carried his own bags and settled his own bills in hotels; he asked, of gay people, “Who am I to judge?” and washed the feet of Muslim women refugees. But within the church, Francis has provoked a ferocious backlash from conservatives who fear that this spirit will divide the church, and could even shatter it. This summer, one prominent English priest said to me: “We can’t wait for him to die. It’s unprintable what we say in private. Whenever two priests meet, they talk about how awful Bergoglio is … he’s like Caligula: if he had a horse, he’d make him cardinal.” Of course, after 10 minutes of fluent complaint, he added: “You mustn’t print any of this, or I’ll be sacked.” This mixture of hatred and fear is common among the pope’s adversaries. Francis, the first non-European pope in modern times, and the first ever Jesuit pope, was elected as an outsider to the Vatican establishment, and expected to make enemies. But no one foresaw just how many he would make. From his swift renunciation of the pomp of the Vatican, which served notice to the church’s 3,000-strong civil service that he meant to be its master, to his support for migrants, his attacks on global capitalism and, most of all, his moves to re-examine the church’s teachings about sex, he has scandalised reactionaries and conservatives. To judge by the voting figures at the last worldwide meeting of bishops, almost a quarter of the college of Cardinals – the most senior clergy in the church – believe that the pope is flirting with heresy. The crunch point has come in a fight over his views on divorce. Breaking with centuries, if not millennia, of Catholic theory, Pope Francis has tried to encourage Catholic priests to give communion to some divorced and remarried couples, or to families where unmarried parents are cohabiting. His enemies are trying to force him to abandon and renounce this effort. Since he won’t, and has quietly persevered in the face of mounting discontent, they are now preparing for battle. Last year, one cardinal, backed by a few retired colleagues, raised the possibility of a formal declaration of heresy – the wilful rejection of an established doctrine of the church, a sin punishable by excommunication. Last month, 62 disaffected Catholics, including one retired bishop and a former head of the Vatican bank, published an open letter that accused Francis of seven specific counts of heretical teaching. To accuse a sitting pope of heresy is the nuclear option in Catholic arguments. Doctrine holds that the pope cannot be wrong when he speaks on the central questions of the faith; so if he is wrong, he can’t be pope. On the other hand, if this pope is right, all his predecessors must have been wrong. The question is particularly poisonous because it is almost entirely theoretical. In practice, in most of the world, divorced and remarried couples are routinely offered communion. Pope Francis is not proposing a revolution, but the bureaucratic recognition of a system that already exists, and might even be essential to the survival of the church. If the rules were literally applied, no one whose marriage had failed could ever have sex again. This is not a practical way to ensure there are future generations of Catholics. But Francis’s cautious reforms seem to his opponents to threaten the belief that the church teaches timeless truths. And if the Catholic church does not teach eternal truths, conservatives ask, what is the point of it? The battle over divorce and remarriage has brought to a point two profoundly opposed ideas of what the church is for. The pope’s insignia are two crossed keys. They represent those Jesus is supposed to have given St Peter, which symbolise the powers to bind and to loose: to proclaim what is sin, and what is permitted. But which power is more important, and more urgent now? The present crisis is the most serious since the liberal reforms of the 1960s spurred a splinter group of hardline conservatives to break away from the church. (Their leader, the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, was later excommunicated.) Over the past few years, conservative writers have repeatedly raised the spectre of schism. In 2015, American journalist Ross Douthat, a convert to Catholicism, wrote a piece for the Atlantic magazine headlined Will Pope Francis Break the Church?; a Spectator blogpost by the English traditionalist Damian Thompson threatened that “Pope Francis is now at war with the Vatican. If he wins, the church could fall apart.” The pope’s views on divorce and homosexuality, according to an Archbishop from Kazakhstan, had allowed “the smoke of Satan” to enter the church. The Catholic church has spent much of the past century fighting against the sexual revolution, much as it fought against the democratic revolutions of the 19th century, and in this struggle it has been forced into the defence of an untenable absolutist position, whereby all artificial contraception is banned, along with all sex outside one lifelong marriage. As Francis recognises, that’s not how people actually behave. The clergy know this, but are expected to pretend they don’t. The official teaching may not be questioned, but neither can it be obeyed. Something has to give, and when it does, the resulting explosion could fracture the church. Appropriately enough, the sometimes bitter hatreds within the church – whether over climate change, migration or capitalism – have come to a head in a gigantic struggle over the implications of a single footnote in a document entitled The Joy of Love (or, in its proper, Latin name, Amoris Laetitia). The document, written by Francis, is a summary of the current debate over divorce, and it is in this footnote that he makes an apparently mild assertion that divorced and remarried couples may sometimes receive communion. With more than a billion followers, the Catholic church is the largest global organisation the world has ever seen, and many of its followers are divorced, or unmarried parents. To carry out its work all over the world, it depends on voluntary labour. If the ordinary worshippers stop believing in what they are doing, the whole thing collapses. Francis knows this. If he cannot reconcile theory and practice, the church might be emptied out everywhere. His opponents also believe the church faces a crisis, but their prescription is the opposite. For them, the gap between theory and practice is exactly what gives the church worth and meaning. If all the church offers people is something they can manage without, Francis’s opponents believe, then it will surely collapse. * * * No one foresaw this when Francis was elected in 2013. One reason he was chosen by his fellow cardinals was to sort out the sclerotic bureaucracy of the Vatican. This task was long overdue. Cardinal Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was elected as a relative outsider with the ability to clear out some of the blockage at the centre of the church. But that mission soon collided with an even more acrimonious faultline in the church, which is usually described in terms of a battle between “liberals”, like Francis, and “conservatives”, like his enemies. Yet that is a slippery and misleading classification. The central dispute is between Catholics who believe that the church should set the agenda for the world, and those who think the world must set the agenda for the church. Those are ideal types: in the real world, any Catholic will be a mixture of those orientations, but in most of them, one will predominate. Francis is a very pure example of the “outer-directed” or extrovert Catholic, especially compared with his immediate predecessors. His opponents are the introverts. Many were first attracted to the church by its distance from the concerns of the world. A surprising number of the most prominent introverts are converts from American Protestantism, some driven by the shallowness of the intellectual resources they were brought up with, but much more by a sense that liberal Protestantism was dying precisely because it no longer offered any alternative to the society around it. They want mystery and romance, not sterile common sense or conventional wisdom. No religion could flourish without that impulse. But nor can any global religion set itself against the world entirely. In the early 1960s, a three-year gathering of bishops from every part of the church, known as the Second Vatican Council, or Vatican II, “opened the windows to the world”, in the words of Pope John XXIII, who set it in motion, but died before its work had finished. The council renounced antisemitism, embraced democracy, proclaimed universal human rights and largely abolished the Latin Mass. That last act, in particular, stunned the introverts. The author Evelyn Waugh, for example, never once went to an English Mass after the decision. For men like him, the solemn rituals of a service performed by a priest with his back to the congregation, speaking entirely in Latin, facing God on the altar, were the very heart of the church – a window into eternity enacted at every performance. The ritual had been central to the church in one form or another since its foundation. The symbolic change brought about by the new liturgy – replacing the introverted priest facing God at the altar with the extroverted figure facing his congregation – was immense. Some conservatives still have not reconciled themselves to the reorientation, among them the Guinean cardinal Robert Sarah, who has been touted by introverts as a possible successor to Francis, and the American cardinal Raymond Burke, who has emerged as Francis’ most public opponent. The current crisis, in the words of the English Catholic journalist Margaret Hebblethwaite – a passionate partisan of Francis – is nothing less than “Vatican II coming back again”. “We need to be inclusive and welcoming to all that is human,” Sarah said at a Vatican gathering last year, in a denunciation of Francis’s proposals, “but what comes from the Enemy cannot and must not be assimilated. You can not join Christ and Belial! What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th century, Western homosexual and abortion Ideologies and Islamic Fanaticism are today.” In the years immediately after the council, nuns discarded their habits, priests discovered women (more than 100,000 left the priesthood to marry) and theologians threw off the shackles of introverted orthodoxy. After 150 years of resisting and repelling the outside world, the church found itself engaging with it everywhere, until it seemed to introverts that the whole edifice would collapse to rubble. Church attendance plummeted in the western world, as it did in other denominations. In the US, 55% of Catholics went to mass regularly in 1965; by 2000, only 22% did. In 1965, 1.3m Catholic babies were baptised in the US; in 2016, just 670,000. Whether this was cause or correlation remains fiercely disputed. The introverts blamed it on the abandonment of eternal truths and traditional practices; extraverts felt the church had not changed far or fast enough. In 1966, a papal committee of 69 members, with seven cardinals and 13 doctors among them, on which laypeople and even some women were also represented, voted overwhelmingly to lift the ban on artificial contraception, but Pope Paul VI overruled them in 1968. He could not admit that his predecessors had been wrong, and the Protestants right. For a generation of Catholics, this dispute came to symbolise resistance to change. In the developing world, the Catholic church was largely overtaken by a huge Pentecostal revival, which offered both showmanship and status to the laity, even to women. The introverts had their revenge with the election of Pope (now Pope Saint) John Paul II in 1978. His Polish church had been defined by its opposition to the world and its powers since the Nazis and the Communists divided the country in 1939. John Paul II was a man of tremendous energy, willpower and dramatic gifts. He was also profoundly conservative on matters of sexual morality and had, as a cardinal, provided the intellectual justification for the ban on birth control. From the moment of his election, he set about reshaping the church in his image. If he could not impart to it his own dynamism and will, he could, it seemed, purge it of extroversion and once more set it like a rock against the currents of the secular world. Ross Douthat, the Catholic journalist, was one of the few people in the introvert party who was prepared to talk openly about the current conflict. As a young man, he was one of the converts drawn into the church of Pope John Paul II. He now says: “The church may be a mess, but the important thing is that the centre is sound, and one can always rebuild things from the centre. The point of being Catholic is that you’re guaranteed continuity at the centre, and with that the hope of reconstitution of the Catholic order.” John Paul II was careful never to repudiate the words of Vatican II, but he worked to empty them of the extrovert spirit. He set about imposing a fierce discipline on the clergy and on theologians. He made it as difficult as possible for priests to leave and marry. His ally in this was the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, or CDF, once known as the Holy Office. The CDF is the most institutionally introverted of all Vatican departments (or “dicasteries”, as they have been known since the days of the Roman empires; it’s a detail that suggests the weight of institutional experience and inertia – if the name was good enough for Constantine, why change it?). For the CDF, it is axiomatic that the role of the church is to teach the world, and not to learn from it. It has a long history of punishing theologians who disagree: they have been forbidden to publish, or sacked from Catholic universities. Early in the pontificate of John Paul II, the CDF published Donum Veritatis (The Gift of Truth), a document explaining that all Catholics must practise “submission of the will and intellect” to what the pope teaches, even when it is not infallible; and that theologians, while they may disagree and make their disagreement known to superiors, must never do so in public. This was used as a threat, and occasionally a weapon, against anyone suspected of liberal dissent. Francis, however, has turned these powers against those who had been their most enthusiastic advocates. Catholic priests, bishops and even cardinals all serve at the pleasure of the pope, and can at any moment be sacked. The conservatives were to learn all about this under Francis, who has sacked at least three theologians from the CDF. Jesuits demand discipline. * * * In 2013, shortly after his election, while he was still surfing a wave of almost universal acclaim for the boldness and simplicity of his gestures – he had moved into a couple of sparsely furnished rooms in the Vatican grounds, rather than the sumptuous state apartments used by his predecessors – Francis purged a small religious order devoted to the practice of the Latin Mass. The Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate, a group with about 600 members (men and women), had been placed under investigation by a commission in June 2012, under Pope Benedict. They were accused of combining increasingly extreme rightwing politics with a devotion to the Latin Mass. (This mixture, often seen alongside declarations of hatred of “liberalism”, had also been spreading through online outlets in the US and the UK, such as the Daily Telegraph’s Holy Smoke blog, edited by Damian Thompson.) When the commission reported in July 2013, Francis’s reaction shocked conservatives rigid. He stopped the Friars using the Latin Mass in public, and closed down their seminary. They were still allowed to educate new priests, but not segregated from the rest of the church. What’s more, he did so directly, without going through the Vatican’s internal court system, then run by Cardinal Burke. The next year, Francis sacked Burke from his powerful job in the Vatican’s internal court system. By doing so, he made an implacable enemy. Burke, a bulky American given to lace-embroidered robes and (on formal occasions) a ceremonial scarlet cape so long it needs pageboys to carry its trailing end, was one of the most conspicuous reactionaries in the Vatican. In manner and in doctrine, he represents a long tradition of heavyweight American power brokers of white ethnic Catholicism. The hieratic, patriarchal and embattled church of the Latin Mass is his ideal, to which it seemed that the church under John Paul II and Benedict was slowly returning – until Francis started work. Cardinal Burke’s combination of anti-communism, ethnic pride and hatred of feminism has nurtured a succession of prominent rightwing lay figures in the US, from Pat Buchanan through Bill O’Reilly and Steve Bannon, alongside lesser-known Catholic intellectuals such as Michael Novak, who have shilled untiringly for US wars in the Middle East and the Republican understanding of free markets. It was Cardinal Burke who invited Bannon, then already the animating spirit of Breitbart News, to address a conference in the Vatican, via video link from California, in 2014. Bannon’s speech was apocalyptic, incoherent and historically eccentric. But there was no mistaking the urgency of his summons to a holy war: the second world war, he said, had really been “the Judeo-Christian west versus atheists”, and now civilisation was “at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism … a very brutal and bloody conflict … that will completely eradicate everything that we’ve been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years … if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not … fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that’s starting.” Everything in that speech is anathema to Francis. His first official visit outside Rome, in 2013, was to the island of Lampedusa, which had become the arrival point for tens of thousands of desperate migrants from north Africa. Like both his predecessors, he is firmly opposed to wars in the Middle East, although the Vatican gave reluctant support to the extirpation of the Islamic State caliphate. He opposes the death penalty. He loathes and condemns American capitalism: after marking his support for migrants and gay people, the first big policy statement of his time in office was an encyclical, or teaching document, addressed to the whole church, that fiercely condemned the workings of global markets. “Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting.” Above all, Francis is on the side of the immigrants – or the emigrants, as he sees them – driven from their homes by a boundlessly rapacious and destructive capitalism, which has set catastrophic climate change in motion. This is a racialised, as well as a deeply politicised, question in the US. The evangelicals who voted for Trump and his wall are overwhelmingly white. So is the leadership of the American Catholic church. But the laity is around a third Hispanic, and this proportion is growing. Last month Bannon claimed, in an interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, that American bishops were in favour of mass immigration only because it kept their congregations going – although this goes further than even the most rightwing bishops would publicly say. When Trump first announced that he would build a wall to keep out migrants, Francis came very close to denying that the then candidate could be a Christian. In Francis’s vision of the dangers to the family, transgender lavatories are not the most urgent problem, as some culture warriors claim. What destroys families, he has written, is an economic system that forces millions of poor families apart in their search for work. * * * As well as tackling the old-school practitioners of Latin Mass, Francis started a wide-ranging offensive against the old guard inside the Vatican. Five days after his election in 2013, he summoned the Honduran cardinal Óscar Rodríguez Maradiaga, and told him that he was to be the co-ordinator of a group of nine cardinals from around the world whose mission was to clean the place up. All had been chosen for their energy, and for the fact that they had in the past been at loggerheads with the Vatican. It was a popular move everywhere outside Rome. John Paul II had spent the last decade of his life increasingly crippled by Parkinson’s disease, and such energies as he had left were not spent on bureaucratic struggles. The curia, as the Vatican bureaucracy is known, grew more powerful, stagnant and corrupt. Very little action was taken against bishops who sheltered child-abusing priests. The Vatican bank was infamous for the services it offered to money-launderers. The process of making saints – something John Paul II had done at an unprecedented rate – had become an enormously expensive racket. (The Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi estimated the going rate for a canonisation at €500,000 per halo.) The finances of the Vatican itself were a horrendous mess. Francis himself referred to “a stream of corruption” in the curia. The putrid state of the curia was widely known, but never talked about in public. Within nine months of taking office, Francis told a group of nuns that “in the curia, there are also holy people, really, there are holy people” – the revelation being that he assumed his audience of nuns would be shocked to discover this. The curia, he said “sees and looks after the interests of the Vatican, which are still, for the most part, temporal interests. This Vatican-centric view neglects the world around us. I do not share this view, and I’ll do everything I can to change it.” He said to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica: “Heads of the church have often been narcissists, flattered and thrilled by their courtiers. The court is the leprosy of the papacy.” “The Pope has never said anything nice about priests,” said the priest who can’t wait for him to die. “He’s an anti-clerical Jesuit. I remember that from the 70s. They’d say: ‘Don’t call me Father, call me Gerry’ – that crap – and we, the downtrodden parish clergy, feel the ground has been cut from under our feet.” In December 2015, Francis gave his traditional Christmas address to the curia, and he pulled no punches: He accused them of arrogance, “spiritual Alzheimer’s”, “hypocrisy that is typical of the mediocre and a progressive spiritual emptiness that academic degrees cannot fill”, as well as empty materialism and an addiction to gossip and backbiting – not the sort of thing you want to hear from the boss at the office party. Yet four years into his papacy, the passive resistance of the Vatican seems to have triumphed over Francis’ energy. In February this year, posters appeared overnight in the streets of Rome asking, “Francis, where’s your mercy?”, attacking him for his treatment of Cardinal Burke. These can only have come from disaffected elements in the Vatican, and are outward signs of a stubborn refusal to yield power or privilege to the reformers. * * * This battle, though, has been overshadowed, as have all the others, by the infighting over sexual morality. The struggle over divorce and remarriage centres on two facts. First, that the doctrine of the Catholic church has not changed in nearly two millennia – marriage is for life and indissoluble; that’s absolutely clear. But so is the second fact: Catholics actually get divorced and remarried at about the same rate as the surrounding population, and when they do so, they see nothing unforgivable in their actions. So the churches of the western world are full of divorced and remarried couples who take communion with everyone else, even though they and their priests know perfectly well it is not allowed. The rich and powerful have always exploited loopholes. When they want to shuck off a wife and remarry, a good lawyer will find some way to prove the first marriage was a mistake, not something entered into in the spirit the church demands, and so it can be wiped from the record – in the jargon, annulled. This applies especially to conservatives: Steve Bannon has managed to divorce all three of his wives, but perhaps the most scandalous contemporary example is that of Newt Gingrich, who led the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1990s and has since reinvented himself as a Trump ally. Gingrich broke up with his first wife while she was being treated for cancer, and while married to his second wife had an eight-year affair with Callista Bisek, a devout Catholic, before marrying her in church. She is about to take up the post of Donald Trump’s new ambassador to the Vatican. The teaching on remarriage after divorce is not the only way Catholic sexual teaching denies reality as laypeople experience it, but it is the most damaging. The ban on artificial contraception is ignored by everyone wherever it is legal. The hostility to gay people is undermined by the generally acknowledged fact that a large proportion of the priesthood in the west is gay, and some of them are well-adjusted celibates. The rejection of abortion is not an issue where abortion is legal, and is in any case not particular to the Catholic church. But the refusal to recognise second marriages, unless the couple promise never to have sex, highlights the absurdities of a caste of celibate men regulating women’s lives. In 2015 and 2016, Francis convened two large conferences (or synods) of bishops from all around the world to discuss all this. He knew he could not move without broad agreement. He kept silent himself, and encouraged the bishops to wrangle. But it was soon apparent that he favoured a considerable loosening of the discipline around communion after remarriage. Since this is what goes on in practice anyway, it is difficult for an outsider to understand the passions it arouses. “What I care about is the theory,” said the English priest who confessed his hatred of Francis. “In my parish there are lots of divorced and remarried couples, but many of them, if they heard the first spouse had died, would rush to get a church wedding. I know lots of homosexuals who are doing all sorts of things that are wrong, but they know they should not be. We’re all sinners. But we’ve got to maintain the intellectual integrity of the Catholic faith.” With this mindset, the fact that the world rejects your teaching merely proves how right it is. “The Catholic Church ought to be countercultural in the wake of the sexual revolution,” says Ross Douthat. “The Catholic church is the last remaining place in the western world that says divorce is bad.” * * * For Francis and his supporters, all this is irrelevant. The church, says Francis, should be a hospital, or a first-aid station. People who have been divorced don’t need to be told it’s a bad thing. They need to recover and to piece their lives together again. The church should stand beside them, and show mercy. At the first synod of the bishops in 2015, this was still a minority view. A liberal document was prepared, but rejected by a majority. A year later, the conservatives were in a clear minority, but a very determined one. Francis himself wrote a summary of the deliberations in The Joy of Love. It is a long, reflective and carefully ambiguous document. The dynamite is buried in footnote 351 of chapter eight, and has taken on immense importance in the subsequent convulsions. The footnote appends a passage worth quoting both for what it says and how it says it. What it says is clear: some people living in second marriages (or civil partnerships) “can be living in God’s grace, can love and can also grow in the life of grace and charity, while receiving the Church’s help to this end”. Even the footnote, which says that such couples may receive communion if they have confessed their sins, approaches the matter with circumspection: “In certain cases, this can include the help of the sacraments.” Hence, “I want to remind priests that the confessional must not be a torture chamber, but rather an encounter with the Lord’s mercy.” And: “I would also point out that the Eucharist ‘is not a prize for the perfect, but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak’.” “By thinking that everything is black and white,” Francis adds, “we sometimes close off the way of grace and growth.” It is this tiny passage that has united all the other rebellions against his authority. No one has consulted laypeople to find out what they think about it, and in any case their opinions are of no interest to the introvert party. But among the bishops, between a quarter and a third are passively resisting the change, and a small minority are doing so actively. The leader of that faction is Francis’s great enemy, Cardinal Burke. Sacked first from his position on the Vatican court, and then from the liturgy commission, he ended up on the supervisory board of the Knights of Malta – a charitable body run by the old Catholic aristocracies of Europe. In Autumn 2016, he sacked the head of the order for supposedly allowing nuns to distribute condoms in Burma. This is something that nuns do quite widely in the developing world to protect vulnerable women. The man who had been sacked appealed to the pope. The outcome was that Francis reinstated the man Burke had sacked, and appointed another man to take over most of Burke’s duties. This was punishment for Burke’s quite untrue claim that the pope had been on his side in the original row. Meanwhile, Burke had opened a new front, which came as close as he could to accusing the pope of heresy. Along with three other cardinals, two of whom have since died, Burke produced a list of four questions designed to establish whether or not Amoris Laetitia contravened previous teaching. These were sent as a formal letter to Francis, who ignored it. After he was sacked, Burke made the questions public, and said he was prepared to issue a formal declaration that the pope was a heretic if he would not answer them to Burke’s satisfaction. Of course, Amoris Laetitia does represent a break with previous teaching. It is an example of the church learning from experience. But that is hard for conservatives to assimilate: historically, these bursts of learning have only happened in convulsions, centuries apart. This one has come only 60 years after the last burst of extroversion, with Vatican II, and only 16 years after John Paul II reiterated the old, hard line. “What does it mean for a pope to contradict a previous pope?” asks Douthat. “It is remarkable how close Francis has come to arguing with his immediate predecessors. It was only 30 years ago that John Paul II laid down in Veritatis Splendor the line which it seems that Amoris Laetitia is contradicting.” Pope Francis is deliberately contradicting a man who he himself proclaimed a saint. That will hardly trouble him. But mortality might. The more Francis changes his predecessors’ line, the easier it becomes for a successor to reverse his. Although Catholic teaching does of course change, it relies for its force on the illusion that it doesn’t. The feet may be dancing under the cassock, but the robe itself must never move. However, this also means changes that had taken place can be rolled back without any official movement. That is how John Paul II struck back against Vatican II. To guarantee Francis’ changes will last, the church has to accept them. That is a question that will not be answered in his lifetime. He is 80 now, and only has one lung. His opponents may be praying for his death, but no one can know whether his successor will attempt to contradict him – and on that question, the future of the Catholic church now hangs. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 27 October and 3 November 2017.

Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday she would take up a proposal made by the veteran Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone for a minister to be obliged to issue a response within 12 weeks whenever the government lost an opposition day debate. “Where a motion tabled by an opposition party has been approved by the house, the relevant minister will respond to the resolution of the house by making a statement no more than 12 weeks after the debate,” she said in a written statement to parliament. “This is to allow thoughtful consideration of the points that have been raised, facilitate collective discussion across government, especially on cross-cutting issues, and to outline any actions that have been taken.” But Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the cabinet office, dismissed the concession and accused the government of trying to bypass parliamentary scrutiny. “The government’s contempt for parliament and democracy is disgraceful,” he said. “After failing to win a majority at the general election, the Tories have engaged in one stitch-up after another. They’ve fixed standing committees in their favour, are attempting to grant themselves sweeping powers with the EU withdrawal bill, and now seem to have confirmed they will ignore the decisions of parliament on opposition day debates, in a cynical attempt to push through policies like the botched rollout of universal credit. “Their great stitch-up proves that this is is a weak and divided government, led by a prime minister who is in office but not in power.” Labour has been exploiting May’s fragile majority to raise pressing social issues, including universal credit and university tuition fees. A motion tabled by the party calling for the universal credit rollout to be paused was passed unanimously last week, as almost all Tory MPs abstained – some of them reluctantly. The government has been forced into a series of concessions as May adjusts to governing without a stable majority. David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, announced last week that charges would be abolished for the universal credit helpline, an issue raised by Labour. On Wednesday, as Labour prepared to debate the impact of changes to housing benefit on supported housing, May announced a climbdown at prime minister’s questions. Neither the supported housing motion, nor a separate one on cuts to social care, was forced to a vote by Labour; but it believes it can continue to highlight the unpopularity of key areas of Conservative policy. On universal credit, some potential Tory backbench rebels suggested they had been given private reassurances by the prime minister of further concessions to come. Philip Hammond’s budget, which will be delivered on 22 November, could be another potential flashpoint if he chooses to implement controversial policies in the search for extra revenue. Even before the general election, when May had a comfortable majority, the chancellor was forced to abandon a planned increase to national insurance for the self-employed after a backlash from backbenchers. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, complained there was a lack of consultation over legislation, and accused Leadsom of treating parliament like “House of Games”—a combination of House of Cards and Game of Thrones. “The government should get their house in order and deal with the democracy of why we are here. We are elected as representatives to speak on behalf of our constituents,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/03/losing-our-baby-at-birth","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-03T12:54:20Z","webTitle":"A moment that changed me: losing our baby Joshua at birth | Anonymous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/03/losing-our-baby-at-birth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/03/losing-our-baby-at-birth","fields":{"headline":"A moment that changed me: losing our baby Joshua at birth","bodyText":"My husband left for work at 3am that day because he was working remotely with colleagues in Australia. Heavily pregnant, I awoke as my husband left and read for a couple of hours before falling back to sleep. I woke again at 8am to find my waters had broken. “No. It can’t be,” I thought to myself. I was booked in for a caesarean section in two days’ time. I telephoned the labour ward and they told me to come into hospital. The incredible midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists, foetal cardiologists and neonatologists were prepared for this eventuality. Joshua had been diagnosed with a severe and complex pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) seven weeks earlier at 31 weeks’ gestation. We later found out the PAVM had been caused by hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, a rare and poorly understood genetic condition which affects blood vessels in the body. We had been told there was a chance Joshua could die of heart failure at any moment before, during or after birth. We were terrified. We were due to attend antenatal classes and prepare the nursery, but these activities were quickly swapped for weekly ultrasound scans, seeking additional opinions from medical experts around the world, and frantically researching foetal medicine journals, which turned up only a handful of studies about Joshua’s condition. Worst of all we were faced with the decision of whether to continue with the pregnancy or not. The prognosis was uncertain, but there were legal grounds for a late termination. PAVMs can lead to stroke and severe disability. Termination was not the right choice for us, and so we continued with the pregnancy, hoping and praying Joshua would survive and undergo treatment after birth. There were potential treatment options available such as embolisation, which blocks off abnormal blood vessels, or lobectomy, where a lung or part of a lung is removed. I learned that Pope Francis only has one lung, and so I thought: “If the pope can survive with one lung, so can my son.” Joshua died three hours after he was born. It was Mother’s Day. I heard him cry once after which he was taken to the neonatal unit for injections and resuscitation. The medics worked on him for an hour, trying to save his life, but the PAVM was too powerful. Fresh from surgery and drugged on anaesthetic and morphine, I was wheeled into the neonatal unit on a hospital bed to where Joshua was lying down. My husband, who had been by Joshua’s side from the moment he was born, looked completely heartbroken. I saw tubes coming out of Joshua’s body, he was wearing a pink hat. He was the most beautiful baby I had ever seen. I asked the nurse if there was anything else they could do. They had tried everything. He was not stable enough to undergo assessment and treatment. He could have died from the anaesthetic on the operating table. It was not a risk they were willing to take. After spending two hours with Joshua, we held him in our arms until he took his last breath and his heart stopped beating. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t think about Joshua’s short but precious life. I will always grieve for Joshua and wonder what might have been. I will never hear him cry again, watch him grow up or hear him speak. He is buried next to other babies who died before or shortly after birth. Burying a child at any gestation or age is an experience no parent should have to go through. Well-meaning people say to me, “you will have more children”, or “time will make it better”. I used to keep silent when people said these things to me, but now I speak up to try to help people understand that Joshua is not replaceable and time does not make it better. What helps is remembering Joshua, crying, talking about him and the impact of his life and death, and connecting with other bereaved parents. Grief is a complex process and there is no quick fix – you have to be kind to yourself and allow yourself to grieve. There are no time limits and grief does not happen in stages. It is an emotional rollercoaster. Grief is not something you simply “get over”. It coexists alongside the “new normal” and it re-emerges when it is triggered. The process requires tolerating and working through the most unbearable emotions while finding a resilience you never knew existed. Societal narratives about grief desperately need to change, and the dead deserve to be remembered, not “gotten over”. • The writer is a clinical psychologist.

Dressed in a coat of blood-red velvet, his skin is tinged with green, his lips with a peculiar shade of tangerine. If his brow seems unnaturally wide, the forehead of a phrenologist’s dreams, then his inky moustache is certainly too sinisterly drooping. Above all, there are his eyes: joke-shop globes of black, white and scarlet that stare accusingly at all who stand before him. For a moment, I considered the thatch of his tobacco-brown hair. If I looked hard enough, would I find a pair of tiny horns in its midst? It’s with something of a start that you discover this painting, arresting but just a little ridiculous, depicts none other than the artist himself (Self-Portrait, c1862-4). Cézanne, after all, claimed to be uninterested in human psychology; his portraits, stark and emotionless, are a “record of the thing regarded” (my italics), not an effort to capture the soul of the sitter. This one, however, is all mood, and little else: here is Cézanne’s notoriously combative personality reduced to an elaborate cartoon, a Halloween mask by way of Caravaggio. As such, it makes you wonder all the more about the later portraits (he painted almost 200 in his career). The gap – we might better call it a chasm – between this early intensity, and the sculptural blankness of the faces that followed is undeniably bizarre. Why, you ask yourself again and again, are there no shades in between? The National Portrait Gallery’s major new exhibition, which brings together for the first time more than 50 of Cézanne’s portraits, confirms what I’ve long half-suspected, which is that while his depictions of people are easy to admire, they’re extremely difficult to love. Yes, the development of his technique, from brush to palette knife and back again, is impressive; the level of abstraction involved in the later work remains astonishing for the time. Looking at The Smoker, that famous painting of 1893-6, it’s impossible not to think of Braque and Picasso; Cézanne’s interest lies as much – if not more – in the unlikely geometry of the table on which his subject rests an elbow as in the man himself. But en masse, these paintings are as unyielding as flint. Only two performed that unholy trick of reaching my heart intravenously, without my even noticing a line had been administered. The first was Fortuné Marion (1870-1), in which there is something almost flirtatious – those cow eyes! – in the face of Cézanne’s hirsute, geology-loving friend. The second was The Artist’s Son (1881-2), where the tension between the way Cézanne depicts the young Paul, all gorgeous, mother-of-pearl flesh, and the grey-blue that shrouds the wider canvas, speaks of distance as well as love (he may have doted on his child, but he did not always live with him). Included are several paintings of Cézanne’s wife, Hortense Fiquet (he made 29 in total). They intrigue, I think, simply by dint of the fact they’re so determinedly unintriguing, their subject appearing before us like an Easter Island statue (or, should she be sewing, a domestic servant). In Madame Cézanne in a Red Armchair (c1877), completed nearly a decade before their marriage, Hortense has a semi-regal appearance; her skirt, at least, is sumptuous, even if her face has a flat, mask-like quality. After this, however, Cézanne grows less interested in using dress as modulation. The stoniness takes over. Personally, I can’t go along with the conviction of the exhibition’s curator, John Elderfield, that in later portraits she is more “vulnerable”, unless he sees her impassivity as a shield. Look at the later Woman with a Cafetiere (c1895), moreover, and you’ll find much the same inscrutability. Here, a stranger’s coffee cup has almost as much to tell us as her face. Also gathered together for the first time, along the Strand at the Courtauld Institute, are Chaïm Soutine’s portraits of cooks, waiters and bellboys, painted mostly in Paris in the 1920s and 30s, by which time the Russian-born Soutine (1893-1943) was newly wealthy, and thus able to patronise the establishments where they were employed. I urge you to see them, for they are wildly original, the artist’s interest lying in the contrast between his subject’s personalities, whether sullen or puckish, and their uniforms, garments that seek to reduce them to their mere function. Their ears, in particular, have an antic quality that may be unique to 20th-century art; the lugs of The Pastry Cook of Cagnes (1922-3) are as big as satellite dishes, and about 10 times as monstrous. It is, you suddenly understand, in these twisted jaws and crimson jackets that Francis Bacon found such inspiration (it must be because there are only two works by Soutine in British public collections that I had not grasped this before). Soutine paints his boys – these portraits are mostly, though not exclusively, of men – like dukes, caps and toques where there might otherwise be a coronet, bow ties and aprons in place of ermine and velvet robes. It is moving to see, even if you find, as I do, the artist’s brushwork to be a bit lumbering at times. He doesn’t give them dignity, exactly. They’re as comical as they are stoical. But simply by having brought them out of their kitchens and corridors, they are at last seen: newly crowned kings of his studio, if not of the institutions whose expensive wheels it is their life’s work to oil.

The chilling truth about freezing your eggs","bodyText":"Egg freezing, the process by which eggs are removed and cryogenically stored to prevent age-related decline, has seen a rise in popularity, with a threefold increase since 2014, according to research from the London Women’s Clinic. Meanwhile, recent coverage of “social” egg-freezing advocates, such as Dr Emily Grossman, seems to offer hope to women who want to buy time before meeting the right partner or to delay pregnancy. Ostensibly, egg freezing offers women this breathing space: to preserve their chance of having a baby without compromising on other aspects of their lives. Except the most recent figures tell a different story. A study by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) of women who used their frozen eggs in 2014 found that only 14% of implantation cycles were successful. So how effective is the technology? And should women really be trusting egg freezing as a fertility solution, given the limited evidence in its favour? Dr Kylie Baldwin, a medical sociologist with the Centre for Reproduction Research at De Montfort University, is sceptical: “The technology has been presented as a magic bullet to level the playing field between women and men, reproductively speaking. However, the success rates are still low.” The science is relatively straightforward. As Dr Simon Fishel, head of research and development at Care, a UK fertility clinic, explains, patients are injected with drugs to stimulate the ovaries for around 10 days. The eggs are then removed before being taken away to be frozen and stored in a lab. The freezing process has got more effective in recent years: it used to take more than four hours, but now it is done in a matter of minutes by a technique called vitrification, which Fishel deems “much more efficient”. He believes egg freezing is now “as good as IVF” – although that has a success rate of 26.5%, according to data from HFEA. Dr Zeynep Gurtin, a senior research associate at the London Women’s Clinic, is – like Fishel – optimistic. “Vitrification has significantly increased the survival rates of frozen-thawed eggs, resulting in much better rates of fertilisation.” However, she feels it will be “some time before these potential successes are reflected in national and clinical statistics”. And, even if egg freezing itself is improving, current patients may still face issues – particularly if they are over the optimum fertility age. “It’s all about the egg and the age of the woman from whom the eggs were taken,” says Fishel. Egg freezing may pause the ageing process, but it can’t reverse it. Brigitte Adams, 45, who froze her eggs aged 39, learned this the hard way. “When I froze my eggs, it was empowering; I hadn’t met anyone and I wanted to wait for a partner to have a child with. When I produced 11 eggs, my doctor said, ‘Congratulations,’” – and that was that. When she subsequently went to defrost her eggs, only one survived to the point where it could be implanted – and, although she fell pregnant, she miscarried weeks later. “It had never occurred to me that it wouldn’t work. That was it: my last possibility of having a biological child.” Adams feels she wasn’t given enough information. She wishes she had been advised to do multiple cycles – Fishel recommends at least 20 eggs for the optimum chance of success – repeating the process over two or three cycles, especially for those beyond their mid-30s. She also regrets waiting: “I wish I had gone into it earlier, with more information and a better grasp on reality.” The obvious answer might be to freeze eggs at an earlier age. But in the UK, the HFEA places a 10-year limit on storage. “I don’t think many women younger than 30 will consider freezing their eggs under the current regulations,” says Gurtin. And even without regulation, the huge cost of egg freezing – around £10,000 in the UK – is a considerable barrier for most. Although egg freezing can be covered by insurance on medical grounds (cancer for instance), for “social” purposes it must be done privately. Adams believes all this requires a “clearer conversation” – one that accommodates the substantial possibility of failure and therefore allows women to manage risks – for instance, with multiple cycles. “We read a lot about women freezing their eggs, but that’s only one half of the story: the first half, where there is still hope and optimism.” She also believes that media coverage of company-funded egg freezing (for example by US companies such as Apple and Facebook) “glosses over the fact it is still a cutting-edge medical procedure and it’s not going to work for everyone”. Baldwin argues that responsibility also rests with clinics to report data accurately. “Many studies that give favourable odds of success are drawn from highly specialised clinics working with eggs much younger than the average user of egg freezing. Clinics need to be honest about how likely it is that they will be able to replicate these results in their own labs.” Then again, the simple truth echoed by most experts is that there just isn’t enough evidence on egg freezing to know one way or another. “As the numbers of women undergoing egg freezing are much smaller than the numbers undergoing IVF, it will take some time until any meaningful data can be amassed,” says Baldwin. Ultimately, until scientists establish exactly how effective egg freezing is, the narrative should perhaps shift from one of empowerment to a more cautious approach, taking into account the fallibility of the process and acknowledging that, in Brigitte’s words: “It might be your plan B, but you will need a plan C as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-50-years-of-legal-abortion-lets-finish-the-work","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:53:36Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on 50 years of legal abortion: let’s finish the work | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-50-years-of-legal-abortion-lets-finish-the-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-50-years-of-legal-abortion-lets-finish-the-work","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on 50 years of legal abortion: let’s finish the work","bodyText":"It is 50 years on Friday since David Steel’s abortion act became law. It did not come into force until the following April. In those six months, it is likely that around 70 women died from sepsis or some other cause resulting from illegal abortion: in the previous decade, it claimed at least 150 lives a year, the biggest single cause of maternal mortality. Activists in a campaign that began in the 1930s toasted victory with champagne. But one veteran, who had had an illegal abortion herself, dampened the celebrations. They should be drinking half-glasses, she said, for the job was only half done. Nonetheless, in the past 50 years millions of women have benefited from access to safe abortion. It has transformed the future for many girls and women – young women in particular, for the peak age for abortion is 19; it is also disproportionately in demand in poorer parts of England and Wales. There are now around 200,000 abortions recorded each year, but almost all of them – 92% – take place in the first trimester of pregnancy. No one likes carrying out an abortion, says the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, but the alternative – illegal, unsafe abortion – is worse. Yet reforming the law does remain a job half done. The Abortion Act 1967 did not decriminalise termination; it merely introduced a very narrow set of exemptions from the criminal law, a tiny window where abortion was legal, restricted by the requirement that two doctors agree that carrying a pregnancy to term would be a greater risk than termination, or that the unborn child had such physical or mental abnormalities that it would be seriously handicapped. Over time, these rules have been interpreted much less restrictively. But even if practice has changed, they are still in force, and abortion remains a criminal offence both for the woman and for medical practitioners. Every doctor is aware that they remain open to prosecution. Nor is it only in Northern Ireland that women who buy abortion pills online are open to prosecution. An adult woman still does not have the autonomy to make one of the most fundamental decisions about her body and her life. And for all those involved – women and health practitioners – the climate around abortion remains punitive. Yet despite the strength of argument for reform, this is perilous territory. In the past half century, for every tentative attempt to complete the process of liberalising the law, there have been a score or more efforts to restrict it further. Only one has succeeded, a cut in the maximum term from 28 to 24 weeks – but in an age of culture wars, this is a field aggressively patrolled by anti-abortion activists, many of whom are part of a revivalist right that sanctifies motherhood and sees every liberal advance as a cautionary tale about modernity. And yet, in March this year, Diana Johnson, the Kingston upon Hull MP, successfully won a vote on a backbench bill to decriminalise abortion. Although the general election intervened, MPs believe there is still a pro-change majority in the Commons and in the Lords. Nor is it only campaigners in parliament who think that the time has come for further reform. One reason for the new optimism is that for the first time, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists all now support decriminalisation. The professionals who are most closely involved in reproductive health, trained and qualified people devoted to securing and protecting healthy lives for women and babies, believe that it is necessary to change the law to reflect the way the world has changed since 1967. Changes in practice mean most abortions are now medical rather than surgical; a steady rise in early terminations has accompanied the widespread introduction of drugs that trigger abortion. Experience in Canada and parts of Australia where decriminalisation has been introduced shows it has not led to a surge in abortion. Above all, decriminalisation does not mean deregulation. The Johnson bill would have made no change at all to the existing restrictions on, for example, the 24-week limit or the ban on sex-selection abortion. It continued to recognise that there are deeply held conscientious objections. It could have introduced new criminal sanctions on those who coerce or deceive women into abortion. Abortion has always been polarising. But this is a job half done, and it’s time to complete it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/26/haringey-a-test-case-for-local-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:20:13Z","webTitle":"Haringey a test case for local democracy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/26/haringey-a-test-case-for-local-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/26/haringey-a-test-case-for-local-democracy","fields":{"headline":"Haringey a test case for local democracy","bodyText":"Aditya Chakrabortty (It’s one man against a housing juggernaut, 25 October) is right that the high court case to stop Haringey’s HDV regeneration plans is an important one, with potentially far reaching implications for people in a number of areas facing top-down plans to change housing. Yet the case is about more than that; it is central to the future of local democracy. No one faced with having their home demolished in north Tottenham was asked at the last council election in 2014 if they thought this was a good plan. Subsequently, the council has not balloted tenants either. Apparently ballots simplify matters into a yes or no answer, which can be awkward, particularly if it is the latter. The New Labour grouping on Haringey council want to change Tottenham, but have failed to notice that the operation of the market is doing it anyway. In the last 10 years the area has become home to five breweries, some internationally known, and a nationally renowned cheese-maker. The issue is how that change now proceeds. Will it be in the interests of the ordinary Labour voters of Tottenham, who mostly would prefer their home not to be knocked down, or will it be in the interests of the multinational privateer Lendlease, Haringey’s HDV partner? You’d think a Labour council would easily be able to spot which side it should be on here, but apparently not. Keith Flett London • Only one in five of the new homes forecast to be built on public land and sold off are likely to be classified as affordable, and as little as 6% of new homes are likely to be social rented housing because of a get-out clause. The National Planning Policy Framework says developers’ schemes “should not be subject to such a scale of obligations and policy burdens that their ability to be developed viably is threatened”. Such wording allows developers to appeal against planning obligations if they can prove, using a “financial viability assessment”, that building the required amount of affordable homes would threaten a good profit to the landowner. For redeveloping the Elephant &amp; Castle’s Heygate Estate the level of “acceptable” profit was fixed at 25% – around £300m. In practice this means that developers can be granted planning permission on the understanding that they will deliver the council’s agreed level of affordable housing. But after work begins, the developer submits a viability assessment showing that if they continue as planned, they won’t make a profit unless they lower the number of affordable homes. Councils then face a difficult choice: accept a proposed development that only partially meets local needs, or not have one at all and go through the whole planning process again.

In First Person, would-be novelist Kif finds himself embarking on the ghostwriting job from hell. This is a very different novel to The Narrow Road. Was that always the plan? Plan? I had no plan. First Person is the book I began before the Booker and which I finished after, while at the same time, trying to surf the mudslide that the Booker brings on without falling off and being buried alive. Can you tell us about the back story to First Person? In 1991, while working as a builder’s labourer and trying to write my first novel, I was offered $10,000 by Australia’s greatest conman and corporate criminal, John Friedrich, to ghostwrite his memoirs in six weeks. He had embezzled a billion dollars in today’s terms, set up a sort of a secret army and the whole thing had gone belly up. His bodyguard was a mate, which was how I got the gig. We worked on the book for three weeks and then he shot himself dead. I was left to ghostwrite a ghost. Although the novel is based on your experience with Friedrich, your ghostwriter, Kif, finds truth is arrived at by not cleaving too faithfully to the facts. Maybe that is as it should be: after all, fiction is not a lie, but a truth, a fundamental and necessary truth, that we need as much as we need food or sex. Without fiction, we poison ourselves on the lies of the first person. And perhaps that was the fear I had felt with Friedrich all those years ago – the terror of becoming the first person trapped in someone else’s lies. For if story as lies leads us to a dark place, story as fiction offers the possibility of transcendence and liberation, the recognition of the many things each of us are. Kif discovers the only way to become a writer is by writing. Would that be your advice? I have no advice. People write books in spite of themselves. Which may be why I never understood creative writing degrees. Do you become as possessed by your characters as Kif is by his subject? No. But Kif is a mediocre artist who believes in the grand old lies: experience, empathy and the necessity of identifying with your subject, the first person – those things people say about their writing when they don’t know what to say and are not sure what to write. It leads Kif to a bad pass. As a Tasmanian, Kif finds it hard to be taken seriously as a writer. Was that your experience? It was. When I started out, Tasmania was still a metaphor for everything Australians hated about themselves – their convict past, environmental rapacity, murderous racism and general insignificance. My first novel, Death of a River Guide, was refused a review in Australia’s leading broadsheet on the grounds it fitted no recognisable school of Australian literature. Which is one of the sweetest compliments I have ever had. First Person nods to the rise of autofiction. Do you understand its popularity? I don’t even understand its meaning. It has something to do with the French? I fear it may also have something to do with me. The problem is, as Flaubert exclaimed in exasperation: “Madame Bovary, c’est moi” and novels were always stolen from everywhere and everything, not least the author’s own soul. Labels are best left on jam jars. What can more conventional realist novels offer that autofiction can’t? The larger truth that we are not one but many and that all that we don’t know is everything we need to discover. Are you tempted to write your own memoirs? I’m tempted by everything unwise, but I hope I don’t give in to it. St Augustine prayed to the Lord to grant him sobriety and chastity, but not just yet. To which I would add memoir, but wisely St Augustine didn’t. • First Person by Richard Flanagan is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£18.99).

Fractured stories come naturally to Kneale: his novel English Passengers, winner of the Whitbread book of the year in 2000, juggled 20 narrators. Here, he carefully pieces together an episodic portrait of a population as flexible in conflict as they are in business and matrimony. The past is lingering in the piazzas and forums: medieval towers house gift shops; football fans march past a towering marble obelisk still dedicated to Il Duce.

The percentage rise is small, but the worry for homebuyers with jumbo mortgages is that it could be the start of a number of increases that could make their loans unaffordable. However, for people with savings who have suffered near-invisible returns on their money, is this the light at the end of the tunnel? This week’s GDP figures, showing a slightly better performance by the economy than anticipated, has made the likelihood of an interest rate rise on 2 November almost a slam dunk, according to City experts. About 80% of market watchers are saying an increase is inevitable, although there are voices calling for the Bank to maintain rates at their historic low. Azad Zangana, an economist at Schroders, says: “Despite the ongoing weakness in growth, it is hard to see why the Bank would change its policy bias now and not raise interest rates in November. The Bank argues that inflationary pressures could rise sharply if not checked by higher interest rates, and that the current low unemployment rate could lead to faster wage growth.” So what will be the impact on households of a small, but momentous, change in interest rates? First-time buyers The average mortgage taken out by a first-time buyer is £136,000, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. But the majority have taken out two-, three- or five-year fixed-rate deals, so their payments will remain the same no matter what Bank governor Mark Carney says next Thursday. Even those who have a tracker loan linked to the Bank base rate will see their monthly costs rise by little more than £15-£20 a month – unhelpful but hardly catastrophic. As a guide, the table (below) shows the impact of a 0.25% rise on a 2% tracker mortgage with a term of 30 years. What is more of a worry for new buyers is the withdrawal of existing best-buy deals and their replacement by higher priced ones, as well as a big jump in the “revert to” rate at the end of two-year deals. Already, banks such as NatWest have repriced their deals upwards by as much as 0.9%, and expect more to follow once the rate hike is announced. The price of the average fixed-rate deal has started to step upwards for the first time in many years, although by only a tiny amount so far . The “revert to” rate is the shock that awaits most first-time buyers. For example, HSBC’s two-year fix will revert to 3.69% at the end of the term. But once the base rate rises, that “revert to” rate will go up to 3.94%. So someone with a £136,000 mortgage will see their monthly payments jump from £503 today to £644. They will have to cross their fingers that there are cheaper loans available when they remortgage at the end of the deal. Existing homeowners The average mortgage of a home mover, say, a family trading up from a flat to a house, is £175,000, according to the CML. Many will have taken their loans out before the financial crisis and, if on a tracker deal, will see their monthly bill rise in line with the base rate hike. For example, Nationwide building society has just under 500,000 borrowers on its “base mortgage rate” of 2.25%, which will rise to 2.5%. Assuming the homeowner has a 25-year term, the monthly cost of a typical £175,000 Nationwide mortgage will rise by £22 a month, to £785 (see table). Nationally, 57% of homeowners are on fixed-rate deals, so only 43% are immediately affected by a rate rise. But if the Bank eventually increases rates to what many say will be the new normal of 3%, the average Nationwide £175,000 borrower is likely to be landed with a monthly bill of £1,023 – or £260 more every month than what they are paying now. Should the base rate return to the pre-financial crisis levels of 5%, that borrower will have to find an extra £474 a month, although they are likely to have remortgaged to a better deal by then. And a base rate of 5% would throw the economy deep into recession. Jumbo mortgage holders For many homebuyers in or close to London, average mortgage sizes of £175,000 are meaningless. Many couples with professional jobs have taken on giant mortgages, often around £500,000. One in 14 borrowers have a mortgage in excess of £500,000 and a rise in rates will significantly impact their day-to-day finances. Even a 0.25% rise on a £500,000 mortgage increases the monthly cost by £53, or £643 over a year, says Paul Welch of broker Largemortgageloans.com. Though many will be on fixed-rate deals, those will come to an end and the rate shock will be severe if the base rate continues to rise, as they have in the US, where interest rates have gone from 0.25% to 1.25%. “If you average the interest rate between 1992 and 2006, it hovered around 5.5%,” says Welch. “In contrast, the average interest rate for the past 10 years has been just 1.27%. This has led to unrealistic asset values and a market which is overvalued. We’re now seeing this start to correct itself in the most overvalued areas, namely London, but there still needs to be more correction. “I believe this will happen over the next decade as interest rates normalise and asset bubbles created by the artificially low interest rates correct themselves.” Buy-to-let speculators The impact on buy to let will be more onerous as these loans are almost entirely interest-only rather than the repayment mortgages demanded of conventional homebuyers. A 0.25% increase in a £200,000 interest-only loan results in a £40 extra monthly cost compared with £25 extra on a repayment mortgage. If the base rate eventually goes to 3%, the monthly cost of many buy-to-let mortgages will more than double. The downside is that it could mean rent rises for tenants, although that will depend on local market conditions. Given the tax increases that are coming through on buy to let, plus tighter lending criteria, further rate hikes may provoke amateur landlords to throw in the towel and sell up. Savers When the financial crisis hit in late 2007, the average Isa account paid an interest of 5.5% a year. So someone with £10,000 in a cash Isa was picking up gross interest of £550. By the middle of this year, Isa rates had fallen to record lows, paying 0.82% on average – or £82 gross interest on £10,000 (see chart). Isa rates have already begun to creep up in anticipation of the Bank base rate rise. The average Isa account now pays 1.02%. Should that rise to 1.25%, our holder of a £10,000 Isa will see their income rise to £125 a year. Sadly, the experts say banks and building societies are unlikely to be offering much higher interest even if the base rate is raised. Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts.co.uk says: “Any savers hoping a rate rise will significantly boost their returns would be wise not to jump the gun. While rates have been on the rise, it is largely down to the challenger banks, and there is a more severed link between the base rate and savings rates these days, thanks to the government’s lending initiatives. “Until lenders start to compete for savers’ funds again, we are unlikely to see much improvement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/26/our-concern-and-disappointment-over-article-on-personality-disorders","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Our concern and disappointment over article on personality disorders | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/26/our-concern-and-disappointment-over-article-on-personality-disorders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/26/our-concern-and-disappointment-over-article-on-personality-disorders","fields":{"headline":"Our concern and disappointment over article on personality disorders","bodyText":"We are writing to you in response to your article (Personality disorders at work: how to spot them and what you can do, theguardian.com, 25 October), which we were pleased to see has now been taken down pending review. As a group of mental health professionals and people with lived experience, we were shocked and disappointed with the tone and content of the piece. Personality disorder is a recognised mental health condition and people who have this diagnosis have suffered many years of stigma and discrimination. People with a diagnosis of personality disorder (there are a range of conditions within this cluster) exist within a world of rejection and harm. Most will have experienced abuse or other traumatising factors in childhood. It is wholly inappropriate to make the link with psychopathy in such a flippant way without a clear contextual understanding of the reasons why people develop such difficult feelings and symptoms. Between 60% and 70% of people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder attempt suicide at some point in their life, and about 10% die by suicide. These figures show just how serious this matter is – and that such trite treatment of personality disorders inexcusably masks an incredibly stark and often fatal social inequality. It is unclear what evidence base was used by the author of this article, some of the statements in it are untrue, and we would heavily challenge the links made between this group of conditions and bullying. In fact, this is a vulnerable group and articles like this cause harm, especially for those managing their condition well enough to be able to work. It is true that people living with this diagnosis suffer immeasurable pain and shame, but sadly this piece does not lend itself to an empathic or compassionate understanding of this dynamic. This is a surprising and frankly unbelievably poorly conceived piece in such a respected and admired publication. Something has gone quite wrong here. While this is clearly an opinion piece, we are concerned that you have not followed the Ipso code of practice for editors. There is no doubt this was not scrutinised at the level it should have been, or considered in terms of the impact on people who live with the complexities every day. We want to remind you that you must not develop a complacency when reporting on mental health or mental illness – it is not a matter for grandstanding, and if you are going to publish commentary about specific conditions it would be wise to check with the experts, of which there are many. People with a diagnosis of personality disorder exist within a very difficult set of experiences, and many people wait a long time before they receive a diagnosis and treatment. However, people with this diagnosis live, love, laugh, work, have children and spend their lives trying to make it all work and to do no harm to others.

However, in presenting her bill, Diana Johnson MP said that “decriminalisation will not make it easier to access abortions post-24 weeks”, and indeed that “professional bodies that are best placed to take action can continue to prohibit [gender preference] as a ground for abortion” (before 24 weeks). Thus abortion would not be like any other medical procedure. It would be odd if removing a tumour became illegal if it had been growing for more than a statutorily defined time. Williams and others of like mind don’t wish to admit, far less confront, the moral difficulties that difference presents. Andrew Anderson Edinburgh • The enthusiastic support for unrestricted abortion – eg the full-page article in Wednesday’s Society pages and the G2 article by Zoe Williams – appears increasingly one-sided in a newspaper usually noted for fair and unbiased reporting of current social issues. In joining the lemming-like rush to promote the termination of pregnancy at will, up to birth, the inevitable side-effects that go with the ending of nascent life and the impact on mental and physical health surrounding abortion are wilfully ignored, it seems. And is it not ironic that the NHS, in obedience to the prevailing ideology, is happy to find £900 for each termination while starving other vital services of desperately needed resources? Shame on us all. Shirley Harrington Bury, Greater Manchester • Zoe Williams’ claim that “far from undermining maternal devotion, abortion might well be a signal of it” deserves to rank as a blatant contradiction alongside the remark made by an American officer in Vietnam to the effect that “it became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it”. What Ms Williams fails to mention is the human toll of abortion in Great Britain alone: nearly 200,000 abortions each year, over eight million since 1967. Zoe Williams seems to be disturbed that protesters outside abortion clinics carry pictures of unborn children. She ought to be: these are the modern equivalents of the 18th-century engravings used by opponents of the slave trade of a black man in chains asking “Am I not a man and a brother?” They are graphic reminders of one the great human rights violations of our age: the destruction of children in the womb.

However, there were major divisions in attitudes towards the criminalisation of those engaging in same-sex relationships when broken down across regions, the 2017 Ilga-Riwi global attitudes survey to sexual and gender minorities found. Almost half of respondents (45%) in the 15 African countries surveyed said those who have same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals, a sentiment shared by 36% of respondents in the Middle East. At the other end of the spectrum, 15% of respondents from Australia and New Zealand said they agreed with this sentiment, along with 19% of participants in North America (the US and Canada combined), South America and western Europe. Even within those countries where such criminalisation has long been abolished, there was a significant minority who believed those engaging in such relationships should be charged. In the UK, where homosexuality has been decriminalised for 50 years, one in six people (17%) agreed that “people who engage in romantic or sexual relationships with people of the same sex should be charged as criminals”. In Australia the figure stood at 16%, while 18% of US respondents agreed with the statement. “It is worrying that these attitudes towards criminalisation hover around the 20% mark in many developed countries,” said lead survey researcher and co-author of the report, Aengus Carroll. He added that this was partly due to continued prevalence of a “traditional values matrix” and a cohort of people who mistakenly equate homosexuality to “darker things like paedophilia”. Across all the countries surveyed, 28.5% of respondents to the survey said that people who engage in same-sex relationships should be charged as criminals. In the 25 surveyed countries in which homosexual activity is already criminalised, a majority of respondents – 42% – said people who engage in such relationships should be charged as criminals compared with 36% who disagreed. “The law of the land affects the attitudes of people in the land,” said Carroll. “In repressive states where there are repressive laws, attitudes of the public are affected by the laws and this is very clear in this data.” Elsewhere almost half of those questioned (48%) in the broader survey said they could respect their religion while being accepting of “people who are romantically or sexually attracted to people of the same sex”. This compared with 30% who felt the two were incompatible. However, there were significant differences at a regional level. In Africa, 43% of respondents said they could be accepting of homosexuality while respecting their religion; 42% said the two were incompatible. A similar pattern emerged when people were asked if it was possible to respect their religion while also being accepting of people “who dress, act or identify as a different gender” to that designated at birth. South American respondents were most likely to feel that the two were compatible, with more than two-thirds agreeing with the statement. Conversely, 43% of respondents from the Middle East agreed with this sentiment, while 36% said they disagreed. Carroll emphasised that there were positives to be taken from this part of the survey, given the rhetoric of some religious leaders, who teach that their religion does not accept people of sexual and gender minorities. “This data is really surprising on that level in that it shows us the huge level of people who feel they can have respect for their religion and be accepting.” A persistent theme in the survey, across countries and topics, was the finding that those who know someone who is gay or bisexual or identifies as another gender are much more likely to support their equal rights and protections. When all responses from all countries were taken together, 55% agreed that equal rights and protections should apply to gay and bisexual people, while 59% said the same of those who are transgender or gender-diverse. However, that figure rose to 73% among people who knew someone of either cohort. People who said they did not know someone who was gay or transgender were much less likely to say equal rights should be extended to them, at 44% and 54% respectively. “It is universally clear,” the authors said, “that when respondents know someone belonging to sexual or gender minorities in their cultures their attitudes appear to be significantly more inclusive and inclined towards equal treatment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/05/david-bowie-a-life-by-dylan-jones-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-05T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"David Bowie: A Life by Dylan Jones review – skilful and revelatory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/05/david-bowie-a-life-by-dylan-jones-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/05/david-bowie-a-life-by-dylan-jones-review","fields":{"headline":"David Bowie: A Life by Dylan Jones review – skilful and revelatory","bodyText":"There have been many books about David Bowie, both before and after his death, but GQ editor Dylan Jones’s is among the best, as well as the most revelatory.

For any admirer of the great man, there is a smorgasbord of new information, mixed with well-judged analysis. But even for agnostics, there is no denying Jones’s flair and dedication in giving his hero the most comprehensive of eulogies. The only real criticism to be levelled at this admirable book is the absence of any illustrations, a pity with such a visually resplendent subject. • David Bowie: A Life by Dylan Jones is published by Preface (£20).

Rosa María Hernández was born in Mexico but has lived in the US since she was three months old. She was being taken from the Texas border city of Laredo to Corpus Christi for a gallbladder operation, travelling in an ambulance with a relative who is a US citizen. As they drove through an inland Border Patrol station about 60 miles east of the frontier in the early hours of Tuesday, agents discovered Rosa María’s undocumented status. The agents allowed them to continue but followed them to the hospital, another 80 miles. Her mother, who is undocumented and in Laredo, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that officers waited outside her daughter’s room while she recuperated from the operation on Tuesday. Rosa María left hospital in an ambulance on Wednesday, said her attorney, Leticia Gonzalez. Mohammad Abdollahi, an organiser with DreamActivist, an immigrant rights group, said that Border Patrol agents took her to a shelter for child immigrants in San Antonio that has a contract with the federal government. A spokesman for Henry Cuellar, a Democratic US congressman who represents Laredo and is tracking the case, said that Rosa María would be under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Health and Human Services until a custody determination has been made by an immigration judge. A hearing has not yet been scheduled. It was not immediately clear whether she would be returned to her mother’s care or taken to a government-run shelter for immigrant children. A Border Patrol spokesman said in a statement: “The Laredo Sector Border Patrol is committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation. Travelers that present themselves for immigration inspections at our checkpoints are inspected thoroughly and expeditiously … “Due to the juvenile’s medical condition, Border Patrol agents escorted her and her cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where she could receive appropriate medical care. Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.” It follows another case in May, detailed by NPR, that saw the Border Patrol escort a two-month-old US citizen boy with pyloric stenosis from the Rio Grande Valley to the same hospital for surgery with his undocumented parents, who were tracked wherever they went in the building, detained, fingerprinted and released. “I understand that CBP [Customs and Border Protection] has a tremendous duty to protect our nation but we should be devoting our resources and focus on bigger threats,” Cuellar said in a statement. As the Trump administration continues its crackdown on unauthorised immigration, activists have noted a rise in arrests of people without criminal records and in actions that take place in “sensitive” areas federal agents had previously tended to avoid, such as courthouses and medical facilities. In February, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents returned a Salvadoran woman with a brain tumour from a Texas hospital to a nearby detention centre. She was later released and a court granted a stay of deportation last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/26/jfk-assassination-files-lee-harvey-oswald-national-archives","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T22:11:43Z","webTitle":"Release of JFK files prompts scramble for fresh leads and theories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/26/jfk-assassination-files-lee-harvey-oswald-national-archives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/26/jfk-assassination-files-lee-harvey-oswald-national-archives","fields":{"headline":"Release of JFK files prompts scramble for fresh leads and theories","bodyText":"The US government released 2,800 previously classified JFK assassination files on Thursday, sending historians, researchers and conspiracy theorists scrambling online to scour some of the last remaining documents for fresh revelations. But president Donald Trump delayed the release of other documents, saying he had “no choice” but to consider “national security, law enforcement and foreign affairs concerns” raised mostly by the FBI and CIA. The files comprise almost the final 1% of records held by the federal government and their publication follows a release in July when the record-keepers, the National Archives, posted 3,801 documents online, mostly formerly released documents with previously redacted portions. An administration official told reporters on Thursday that the files that remain secret have information that “remains sensitive depending on its context”. Trump ordered the agencies to review those redactions over the course of six months, the official said, to ensure more documents reach the public. The next deadline for documents is 26 April 2018. One of the first interesting documents to be unearthed as journalists, scholars and the public pored over them, was a memo written by director J Edgar Hoover that said the FBI had warning of a potential death threat to Lee Harvey Oswald. “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead,” Hoover wrote. “Last night we received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald. “We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection. This morning we called the chief of police again warning of the possibility of some effort against Oswald and again he assured us adequate protection would be given. However, this was not done.” Hoover admitted that he did not have “firm” information about the man who shot Oswald dead, Jack Ruby, but nonetheless declared that his real name was Rubenstein, and noted rumors of “underworld activity”. The FBI sent an agent to Oswald’s deathbed in the hopes of a confession, to no success. Ruby denied making any phone call. But then Hoover said that he and Nicholas Katzenbach, the deputy attorney general, already feared the spread of rumors and conspiracy theories. He noted that Oswald had visited Mexico City, called the Cuban embassy there, and sent a letter to the Soviet embassy about a visa. “The thing I am concerned about, and so is Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” Hoover said. According to the National Archives, 88% of records related to Kennedy’s murder were already fully open and another 11% released but partially redacted. In total, that makes for about 5m pages. After interest in conspiracy theories surged following JFK, the 1991 Oliver Stone thriller starring Kevin Costner, Congress passed the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act in 1992 and mandated that all documents must be released to the public within 25 years. That deadline was Thursday. On Thursday, officials told reporters they would not comment on conspiracy theories. “Honestly we’re not going to comment on the content of the files,” one official said. “It’s the practice of the National Archives to leave it up to the researchers.” In the run-up to the release, assassination experts expressed concern that agencies such as the FBI and CIA would ask Trump to block the release of information they consider to be sensitive for national security reasons, such as revealing sources, recent operations or tactics. A small number of documents are thought to have been compiled in the 1990s. Trump tried to turn the assassination to his own political advantage last year when he spuriously claimed that the father of his then rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Ted Cruz, was seen with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before Oswald killed John F Kennedy. “You know, his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald’s being – you know, shot,” Trump told Fox News in May last year. “I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right, prior to his being shot, and nobody brings it up. They don’t even talk about that. That was reported and nobody talks about it. But I think it’s horrible.” He added: “What was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death, before the shooting? It’s horrible.” Fact-checkers have found Trump’s claimed link “implausible at best and ridiculous at worst”. Last Saturday, Trump tweeted: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Releasing the files in the face of internal pressure chimes with a narrative that Trump and his camp have previously advanced: that the president is a champion of transparency who seeks to “drain the swamp” of government agencies with their own secretive agendas who are hostile to his presidency. Roger Stone, a Trump ally and former adviser, tweeted on Monday: “The Deep State boys will undermine the President’s order by redacting and withholding as much information as they can.” Stone co-wrote a 2013 book positing that Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy’s vice-president and the man who succeeded him, was the mastermind behind the murder. Last week, Stone told Alex Jones, the Infowars radio host and conspiracy theorist, that he “had the opportunity to make the case directly to the president of the United States by phone as to why I believe it is essential” that the documents be released, “because I believe they show that Oswald was trained, nurtured and put in place by the Central Intelligence Agency. It sheds very bad light on the Deep State.” But once the thousands of new documents have been fully analysed by researchers, which will take weeks, the collection is expected to provide background information to help build a more complete picture of known events and individuals, rather than offer any stunning twists in the tale – such as a second gunman, long a favourite theory among those who do not believe Oswald shot Kennedy as the presidential motorcade travelled past the Texas School Book Depository in downtown Dallas on the afternoon of 22 November 1963. Oswald, a former US marine who spent more than two years living in Minsk after defecting to the Soviet Union in 1959, travelled to Mexico City about two months before he killed Kennedy. Researchers are hoping the documents shed light on possible interactions with Cuban and Russian officials there. Oswald was fatally shot by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, two days after Kennedy’s death. The Warren commission found in 1964 that Oswald was the lone gunman, but most Americans doubt the official line. A Gallup poll to mark the 50th anniversary of Kennedy’s death, in 2013, found the percentage of Americans who believe that Oswald did not act alone had dipped to its lowest in nearly 50 years – even so, 61% of respondents thought that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. Favourite theories included the involvement of the mafia, the federal government in general, the CIA, and Cuba under Fidel Castro. • We’d like your help.

Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, liberated by impending retirement, launched a powerful dual attack on Tuesday: Mr Flake denounced Mr Trump’s “reckless, outrageous” behaviour, while Mr Corker, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, warned that the president is debasing the US with “constant non-truth-telling”. No president in recent history has been spoken about so scathingly by legislators from his own party. Yet the headlines should not mislead us. Mr Flake and Mr Corker once supported Mr Trump (Mr Corker was even considered a potential vice-president) and have moved from outright opposition to full-throttle attack. They represent a span of opinion: Mr Flake is an arch-conservative, no hero for progressives, while Mr Corker is considered a moderate Republican. Their words have extra resonance following last week’s interventions by George W Bush, who condemned white supremacy, conspiracy theories and lies, and John McCain, who laid into “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems”. But the bigger news is that the vast majority of Republicans remain craven and opportunist, refusing to renounce a disgraceful and dangerous administration; and that the most vociferous internal opposition comes from two departing senators (one of whom knew he would not win next time), a former president and a veteran politician reaching the end of his career and undergoing treatment for brain cancer. It is that the party apparatus is trying to carry on with business while the house is on fire. It is that the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, remain supine despite their evident despair and Mr Trump’s personal attacks on them. The forthrightness of some Republican critics does not transform this narrative; it highlights the cowardice and cheapness of the others. Tellingly, Mr Flake’s speech was addressed not to the president, who appears largely beyond the reach of reason and certainly beyond concerns of decency, but to his peers, accusing them outright of complicity. They cannot deny the accuracy of the charges laid against Mr Trump; in many cases their own scathing opinions are on record. But when it became clear that he would win the nomination, they fell into line, and for the most part they remain there. That they denigrate him behind his back is irrelevant when they stand beside him in public. If the party will reach a turning point, there is no sign that it is there yet – and if Mr Trump’s behaviour and actions to date have not pushed them to their limits, what will? Motives are mixed. Despite his historic levels of unpopularity overall, he continues to enjoy the support of most of those who voted for him and disdain what they see as the old, patrician party elite. Legislators are attempting to hold together a party which – like the Democrats – is increasingly fractured and incoherent; hoping to prevent a challenge to their own seats by unsavoury populists along the lines of Roy Moore in Alabama; and trying to push through their agenda, notably tax cuts, both from ideological zeal and electoral expediency: “There’s a lot of noise out there. Tax reform is what we are about,” was all Mr McConnell had to say this week. The tax package has become all the more critical given the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as promised. Should it run into trouble, Mr Trump may well face stormier weather. But his moral bankruptcy and unfitness for office were evident long before he reached the White House. Each day he has spent in power has amplified his failings – and the party’s abnegation of its duty in refusing to face that head-on. Mr Trump is a catastrophe for his party, for his country and for the world. Republicans should say so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/oct/26/jfk-files-released-assassination-documents-conspiracy-theories","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:32:30Z","webTitle":"Government releases classified JFK assassination documents – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/26/jfk-files-released-assassination-documents-conspiracy-theories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/26/jfk-files-released-assassination-documents-conspiracy-theories","fields":{"headline":"Government releases classified JFK assassination documents – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re wrapping up this live blog now. Read our latest news story here: And our at-a-glance guide to the key revelations so far is here: The FBI were trying to track Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination, according to memos by New Orleans division of the bureau. An agent there wrote that Oswald was of interest according to “Cuban sources”, and that he had forwarded the information to Dallas authorities. The FBI warned Dallas police of a death threat to Lee Harvey Oswald, according to a memo by director J Edgar Hoover, but the police failed to protect him. “Last night we received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald.” Hoover started to fear conspiracy theorizing. “The thing I am concerned about,” Hoover said, “is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” Soviet leaders considered Oswald a “neurotic maniac who was disloyal to his own country and everything else”. They, too, feared a conspiracy had killed Kennedy, perhaps organized by a rightwing coup or Lyndon Johnson. They also feared that a reckless general would launch a missile and start war in the aftermath of Kennedy’s death. Fidel Castro told American lawmakers that Cuba was not involved in the plot, when House investigators visited the island in 1978. In 1963, however, the Cuban ambassador tot the US reacted with “happy delight” to the murder, according to a CIA memo. The documents include a lengthy report on CIA assassination plots and programs, and scores of pages of receipts and bookkeeping, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars in covert programs. Many were directed at Cuba, others in the Dominican Republic, Congo, and north and south Vietnam. President Donald Trump blocked the release of an unknown number of documents, saying he had “no choice” but to bow to national security concerns of the FBI and CIA. He also ordered them to review their still secret documents over the next 180 days, setting a new deadline for releases, on 26 April 2018. We’d like your help too. The JFK files will be published online here. If you’re reading through the documents and you spot an interesting fact or snippet you think we’ve missed, it would be great if you could let us know. We’ve set up a form here for contributions. In 1978, several members of the House committee reinvestigating the assassination traveled to Cuba, talking with officials there about Lee Harvey Oswald’s attempt to get a visa and Jack ruby’s visits to the island in 1959. They also discussed “the alleged pro-Castro involvement in the assassination”. Right before departure, they met Fidel Castro. The Cuban ambassador and his staff reacted to Kennedy’s murder with “happy delight”, according to a CIA memo dated to just days after the assassination. “After further info was received indicating that Oswald had connections with Fair Play for Cuba committee there was some apprehension concerning possible US reaction,” the memo continues. After some indecision and reluctance, the ambassador eventually attended a requiem mass for Kennedy, “as official rep. of his govt.” My colleague Ed Pilkington has found a memo from a CIA division chief regarding Lee Harvey Oswald’s contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, in September 1963. It suggests that conspiratorial ideas were creeping into senior levels of the CIA only a day after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee Oswald was at the Soviet embassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the consul, Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov. This was learned when Oswald called the Soviet embassy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and speaking broken Russian, stating the above and asking the guard who answered the phone whether there was “anytihng new concerning the telegram to Washington.” The guard chekced and told Oswald that a request had been sent, but nothing had as yet been received. The FBI liaison officer, Mr Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to believe that Oswald’s visit was to get Soviet support for a US passport or visa matter. The CIA chief the calls Kostikov “an identified KGB officer” and a member of Department 13, a unit “responsible for sabotage and assassination”. He cites a source, a German national woman who lives in Oklahoma, met with Kostkikov and another Department 13 officer, Oleg Brykin. “Of course it is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to have such overt contact with a Soviet embassy,” the CIA chief continues. The CIA chief goes on to cite a Soviet admiral at length about the precautions and disguises that intelligence officers should use, suggesting that Kostikov’s presence was extremely unusual. He adds, as a brief coda, that that same Soviet admiral says such blatant meetings by intelligence officers could also be simple carelessness. The CIA passed the information along to a FBI liaison. In a memo dated 26 November 1963, the FBI scrambled to collect everything it could about Jack Rubenstein, also known as Sparky Rubenstein, then as Jack Ruby, in the hours after he fatally shot Lee Harvey Oswald. According to an informant, Ruby had a “good in” with the Dallas police, “which would be borne out from his observation that Ruby had a B-girl operation where drinks were pushed heavily with no interference from the police department”. A source described ruby as “an extremely stubborn person and a publicity hound”. Due to his “emotional instability”, the source “did not think it unusual when Ruby was reportedly more upset over the death of the president than the death of his own father”. He said he was surprised Ruby had “actually killed Oswald” rather than simply wounding the captive “in the leg with a .22 caliber weapon in order to get publicity”. The source did not know whether Ruby had any “specific conections” in Chicago or with “organized criminal, hoodlum or subversive element. He did not know Oswald and knew of no connection between the two”. h/t Jacob Richardson for the memo Reader Kieran Morris, in Clapham, London, has found several cryptic remarks by a Soviet naval attache and a colleague in Washington DC in January 1964. The FBI document is extremely difficult to read, and the FBI’s source appears to have only caught portions of the conversation. One said he “considered it virtually impossible to have prevented the assassination, but considered the subsequent slaying of Oswald to be inexcusable”. He commented “we should never have let this happen.” The FBI had warning of a potential death threat to Lee Harvey Oswald, according to a memo by director J Edgar Hoover, which reveals some of the bureaus reactions to the assassination. “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead,” Hoover begins: Last night we received a call in our Dallas office from a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald. We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection. This morning we called the chief of police again warning of the possibility of some effort against Oswald and again he assured us adequate protection would be given. However, this was not done.” Hoover admitted that he does not have “firm” information about the man who shot Oswald dead, Jack Ruby, but nonetheless declared that his real name was Rubenstein, noted rumors of “underworld activity” suggested he had “the reputation of being a homosexual”. The FBI sent an agent to Oswald’s deathbed in the hopes of a confession, to no success. Ruby denied making any phone call. But then Hoover said that he and Nicholas Katzenbach, the deputy attorney general, already feared the spread of rumors and conspiracy theories. He noted that Oswald had visited Mexico City, called the Cuban embassy there, and sent a letter to the Soviet embassy about a visa. “The thing I am concerned about, and so is Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin,” Hoover said. h/t to reader Michael White, in New Jersey, for alerting us to the memo. The FBI also was trying to monitor Oswald before the assassination, according to two memos. The memos, dated from August through October 1963 – before the assassination – an agent with the FBI’s New Orleans division wrote that agents had lost track of Oswald and were looking for him, especially in the Dallas area. h/t to reader Jess O’Neill, in Australia, for the find. In a mirror of his American counterparts, one Soviet leader, in particular, was convinced that the KGB needed to get to the bottom of some kind of wide-ranging plot to destabilize the US. In 1965, a source told the FBI that the KGB had “data purporting to indicate president Johnson was responsible for the assassination” – meaning at least some Soviets were convinced of a conspiracy years after Oswald’s death and the Warren Commission. The FBI pressed a KGB defector, Yuri Nosenko, for more information about what relation Oswald may have had with the with the USSR. Nothing worth anything, Nonsenko told them. In one particularly striking FBI document, from director J Edgar Hoover, the agency details everything it has learned about the Soviet reaction to the JFK’s assassination, and what its agents might have known about Lee Harvey Oswald. The Soviets, like many Americans, were convinced of a conspiracy. They were also frightened that a panicked, reactive military would lash out at the USSR, and desperately wanted to learn more about what kind of person Lyndon Johnson was. Our source further stated that Soviet officials were fearful that without leadership, some irresponsible general in the United States might launch a missile at the Soviet Union. It was the further opinion of the Soviet officials that only maniacs would think that the “left” forces in the United States, as represented by the Communist Party, USA, would assassinate President Kennedy, especially in view of the abuse the Communist Party, USA, has taken from the “ultraleft” as a result of its support for the peaceful coexistence and the disarmament policies of the Kennedy administration. They declared Lee Harvey Oswald a “neurotic maniac who was disloyal to his own country and everything else”. They disclaimed him entirely. A huge swath of the CIA files are receipts and financial accounts for clandenstine projects: tens of thousands of dollars paid out for anti-communist activities, supplies, and weapons, especially to people in Latin America. In a set of documents from the 1960s investigation, FBI staff are grilled by a Senate committee about their failure to stop Lee Harvey Oswald after his six-day trip to Mexico City in September 1963. An FBI agent testified “Oswald wrote me in early 1962 to help expedite an exit visa for his wife. why in the world would he tell a plopper like that?” A senator replies: “In any event, he told what the agent knew was lies, and what I am trying to get at is there was no analysis within the bureau of any of this. He even goes to Mexico City, contacts the Cuban consulate and the Soviet embassy, happens to be in contact – we don’t know if there is anything sinister about it – with an agent who is known to be KGB by the FBI and by the CIA, and suspected of being Department 13, which is their assassination and sabotage squad. “In any event, he then returns to the United States, is never again interviewed by the FBI.” Many of the documents read first and foremost as the 1960s artifacts they are: obsessed with communism, civil rights, and Vietnam. In one, the CIA takes note of an article declaring that Martin Luther King “was right” about the Vietnam war. Another describes a “black power conference” that civil rights activist Adam Clayton Power wanted to hold, but “no one showed up”. A third concerns Stokley Carmichael,’s remarks of solidarity with a Latin American group. There is are multiple transcripts of interrogations of Yuri Nosenko, a KGB defector. In one, Nosenko and his interrogator discuss Stalin, and rumors that the Soviet leader had his wife murdered, and then visited her grave. Returning to the CIA report on plans to overthrow the Castro regime in the 1960s, the agency outlined a proposal to airdrop leaflets encouraging the killings of various communist officials. “Leaflets will be designed to indicate phases. For example, the first leaflets will contain only names of communist leaders; the next leaflets will revise the names by job; i.e. cell leader, informer, party members, etc.; any of the above or subsequent leaflets will announce the amount of the reward, how and where it may be collected. One final leaflet may be deemed advisable and that one announcing a .02c reward for the delivery of Castro.” In a set of 1967 CIA documents, the agency lays out a report on Martin Luther King Jr. In it, the agency considers whether there might be links between the civil rights movement and communism. It notes that a 4 November 1964 Washington Post article “stated that subject [King] was planning a visit to the Soviet Union. He reportedly had been invited to the USSR, but Rev Ralph Abernathy, spokesman for subject, refused to comment on the source of the invitation. Another CIA document about a “black militant situation” in Chicago, says that one of its sources, “A”, believed King “sought at least constructive, positive projects”. In another document from 1975, Bobby Kennedy, JFK’s brother and attorney general, is said to have become “unhappy” about attempts on Castro’s life. Lawrence Houston, one of the men who helped establish the CIA, testified that around 1963, “he felt he was making a very strong drive to try to get after the Mafia. And so his comment was to us that if we were going to get involved with the mafia, in the future at any time, to make sure you see me first.” Many of the documents pertain to anti-Cuban efforts by the US government in the 1960s and 70s, including “Operation Mongoose”. In this 1962 file, the CIA considers “the possibility of producing crop failures by the introduction of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin.” At least one document, a 1975 “summary of facts” details various CIA attempts to assassinate foreign leaders – part of the line of inquiry into whether the JFK assassination was planned by Cuba or the USSR. Fidel Castro is front and center in the file; many historians have documented the various attempts on his life by the agency. The document says the CIA tried considered working with “mafia resources”, among other means. The commission has determined that agents of the CIA were involved in planning in this country with certain citizens and others to seek to assassinate [Cuban] Premier [Fidel] Castro. The commission has also determined that the CIA was involved in shipping arms from this country to persons in the Dominican Republic, who sought to assassinate Generalissimo Trujillo (who himself had been involved in an attempt to assassinate the president of Venezuela.) [sic] The commission has not found evidence of any other attempts to assassinate any other foreign leader which had significant overt activities within the United States. However, the nature of the activity and the degree of secrecy and compartmentation within the agency is such that it is difficult to find evidence of this kind unless specific facts are brought to the attention of an investigating body.” According to the document, the CIA considered killing Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba and Indonesian president Sukarno, as well. The National Archives have released 2,891 previously secret files related to the JFK assassination, which you can download and look through here. We’ll begin searching through them now, and uploading documents with context to the blog. Only a few hours before a 25-year deadline was set to expire, the White House confirmed that it would release nearly 3,000 previously secret documents related to the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy. We’re now waiting on the National Archives to upload the documents online, which was promised shortly after a presidential memo. We’ll start sifting through them as soon as they’re available. In that memo, Donald Trump blocked the release of an unknown number of files, saying he had “no choice” but to accept the concerns of agencies such as the FBI and CIA. For days, he had hyped the release of the documents as a victory for the public that would be “so interesting!” On Thursday, though, he said that he had to bow to “national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns” raised by the agencies. He ordered a 180-day review for the agencies to reconsider their redactions, meaning another deadline for documents: 26 April 2018. Officials said they would not comment on conspiracy theories, including one propagated by Trump, about the father of a sitting senator. “Honestly we’re not going to comment on the content of the files,” the official said. “It’s the practice of the National Archives to leave it up to the researchers.” We’d like your help too.

The White House has released the memo signed by Donald Trump to release some 2,800 documents and keep another several hundred secret. “I have no choice – today – but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation’s security,” the president says.

The American public expects -- and deserves -- its Government to provide as much access as possible to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records (records) so that the people may finally be fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event. Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted. At the same time, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have proposed to me that certain information should continue to be redacted because of national security, law enforcement, and foreign affairs concerns. I have no choice --today -- but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation’s security. To further address these concerns, I am also ordering agencies to re-review each and every one of those redactions over the next 180 days. At the end of that period, I will order the public disclosure of any information that the agencies cannot demonstrate meets the statutory standard for continued postponement of disclosure under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note) (the “Act”). Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President and Commander in Chief by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby certify that all information within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act must be temporarily withheld from full public disclosure until no later than April 26, 2018, to allow sufficient time to determine whether such information warrants continued postponement under the Act. This temporary withholding from full public disclosure is necessary to protect against harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure. I hereby direct all agencies that have proposed postponement of full disclosure to review the information subject to this certification and identify as much as possible that may be publicly disclosed without harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations. Any agency that seeks to request further postponement beyond this temporary certification shall adhere to the findings of the Act, which state, among other things, that “only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.” The need for continued protection can only have grown weaker with the passage of time since the Congress made this finding. Accordingly, each agency head should be extremely circumspect in recommending any further postponement of full disclosure of records. Any agency that seeks further postponement shall, no later than March 12, 2018, report to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) on the specific information within particular records that meets the standard for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act. Thereafter, the Archivist shall recommend to me, no later than March 26, 2018, whether the specific information within particular records identified by agencies warrants continued withholding from public disclosure afterApril 26, 2018. The Archivist is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of 2,800 previously classified documents related to the 1963 assassination of president John F Kennedy, a publication with over half a century of speculation, films, novels and conspiracy theories riding along. A White House official told reporters that the president blocked the release of few hundred records, at least temporarily. Earlier on Thursday president Donald Trump approved requests, mostly by the FBI and CIA, to keep those documents hidden “because of the national security, law enforcement and foreign affairs concerns,” the official said. Trump ordered the agencies to review those redaction over the course of six months, the official said, to ensure more documents reach the public. The official said he had “no choice” but to accept the agencies’ concerns for the time being, but that he wanted “the veil finally be lifted”. The National Archives release was mandated by a 1992 law, which set a deadline of 26 October 2017, 54 years after Kennedy was killed by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. Donald Trump has chosen not to block the release of thousands of documents, unless intelligence agencies “provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise,” the White House said. The president seemed excited about the release on Wednesday evening, tweeting: The documents, numbering around 3,150, are largely a mystery. But researchers do not think they will change the findings of the Warren Commission, tasked in 1963 and 1964 to investigate the assassination. That panel found that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former US marine and then defector to the Soviet Union, was the sole gunman. Oswald was himself murdered while in custody, by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. A House panel, in 1979, cast skepticism on the thoroughness of the first investigation, and considered it “likely” that some kind of conspiracy was at work, perhaps involving a second shooter on “the grassy knoll”. The committee’s findings opened the door for theories about the CIA, Cuban or Soviet agents and the mafia. Officials said on Thursday that they would not comment on conspiracy theories, including one propagated by Trump, about the father of a sitting senator. “Honestly we’re not going to comment on the content of the files,” the official said. “It’s the practice of the National Archives to leave it up to the researchers.” But the panels’ findings have not deterred private sleuths, the president’s preferred tabloid among them. Many citizen investigators point to Oswald’s six-day excursion to Mexico City, to meet with Cuban and Soviet agents before the assassination, or the short “Zapruder film”, a video made by the handheld camera of Abraham Zapruder. The ambiguity within that video other circumstances of Kennedy’s death have led to a film by Oliver Stone, a novel by Don DeLillo, and scores of documentaries and citizen conspiracies. The president espoused one such conspiracy theory during his 2016 campaign, telling Fox News in an interview that the father of a rival, senator Ted Cruz, “was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald’s being, you know, shot.” “The whole thing is ridiculous,” Trump said. “What is this, right, prior to his being shot, and nobody brings it up. They don’t even talk about that. That was reported and nobody talks about it. But I think it’s horrible.” Before and during the campaign, Trump also spread the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born a US citizen, and the internet myths that an American general fought Islamic terrorists by dipping bullets in pig’s blood and that “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001. Conspiracies aside, the newly released documents could provide a trove of new information for historians to pore over, as formerly secret documents related to Kennedy’s presidency have already done in recent years. We’ll be poring through the material here, with expert assistance and reporting from Tom Dart in Dallas. We’d like your help too. The JFK files will be published online here. If you’re reading through the documents and you spot an interesting fact or snippet you think we’ve missed, it would be great if you could let us know. We’ve set up a form here for contributions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/26/black-americans-boycott-american-airlines","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Should black Americans boycott American Airlines? | Steven W Thrasher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/black-americans-boycott-american-airlines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/black-americans-boycott-american-airlines","fields":{"headline":"Should black Americans boycott American Airlines?","bodyText":"After a months-long investigation found “a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African American passengers, specific to American Airlines,” the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a “national advisory alerting travelers – especially African Americans – to exercise caution, in that booking and boarding flights on American Airlines could subject them disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions”. This is a wise move for the venerable civil rights organization, as boycotting or threatening to boycott companies – especially airlines in regards to racism — is the only way to push reforms and seek an end to racial profiling, micro-aggressions, and outright violence. When the NAACP celebrated its centenary during the Obama administration, it had a naive “mission accomplished” feel. However, it has been increasingly assertive over the past few years, pushed to greater relevance by the Black Lives Matter movement and the rise of Trumpism. Just this summer, the NAACP issued its first ever travel advisory for the state of Missouri, warning African Americans, LGBT people and women that “race, gender and color based crimes have a long history in Missouri”. Travel is an arena where African Americans are especially vulnerable. After being brought to the United States against their will in chattel slavery, African Americans’ movement has been policed and curtailed by way of slave patrols, the “Black Codes,” segregated motels, “sundown towns,” the KKK, and the police violence of “driving while black”. The NAACP has shown how African Americans face discrimination on planes, from the “African American man [who] was required to relinquish his purchased seats aboard a flight – merely because he responded to disrespectful and discriminatory comments directed toward him by two unruly white passengers” to how an “African American woman and her infant child were removed from a flight – when the woman (incidentally, a Harvard law school student) asked that her stroller be retrieved from checked baggage before she would disembark”. Earlier this year, the NAACP legal defense fund also denounced the “the unlawful profiling of airline passengers on the basis of race or religion has become disturbingly common” in matters of post 9/11 “flying while Muslim”. Threatening airlines’ bottom line works. When the internet was rightfully enraged by David Dao being dragged off a plane and losing teeth in Chicago, United swiftly updated its policies for bumping people from flights and settled with with Dao. But the challenge with boycotting airlines is that there are really only a few of them in the US, each monopolizes a different part of the country, and they all have racial transgressions worthy of boycotting. For instance, a black woman was violently removed on video off a Delta flight in December, while a white man was allowed to rant about “Hillary bitches” last November on another Delta flight and still fly. (Delta later banned him.) So can we afford to threaten all airlines with withholding our business if they’re all bad? Well, the black women who organized the Montgomery bus boycott couldn’t afford to boycott the only bus line – but they did it for over a year and changed history. “The way to right wrongs is to turn the truth upon them,” NAACP cofounder Ida B Wells once said. The NAACP is confronting American Airlines with some truth. But corporations react out of fear, and American Airlines isn’t yet afraid of the NAACP’s warning. “Our team members – a diverse community of gate agents, pilots, and flight attendants – are proud to serve customers of all backgrounds,” an American spokeswoman said. Writing “diverse” and “customers of all backgrounds” elides the anti-black racism the NAACP wants to address. But the NAACP is right to investigate racism anywhere it is, and to hold companies to account."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/25/world-series-2017-game-2-houston-astros-v-los-angeles-dodgers-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T04:40:09Z","webTitle":"World Series 2017: Astros rally to beat Dodgers in dramatic Game 2 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/25/world-series-2017-game-2-houston-astros-v-los-angeles-dodgers-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/25/world-series-2017-game-2-houston-astros-v-los-angeles-dodgers-live","fields":{"headline":"World Series 2017: Astros rally to beat Dodgers in dramatic Game 2 – as it happened","bodyText":"Final thoughts A great start by Justin Verlander feels like days ago and, well, it was a day ago in some time zones. But the long ball put the Astros down ... and then it brought them back. What a game of swings, both figurative and literal. Game 3 will be Friday night in Houston. See you then. Devenski battled Puig to a 3-2 count and then got him to swing on a pitch low and away. What a game. The eight combined home runs set a World Series record. Astros 7-6 Dodgers, bottom of 11th Well, that felt inevitable. And now Yasiel Puig is up. Astros 7-5 Dodgers, bottom of 11th Devenski gets Turner to line out to third. Two out and now Charlie Culberson come to the plate. Astros 7-5 Dodgers, bottom of 11th Corey Seager lines out to center off of Devenski to open the bottom half of the 11th. Two outs left. Astros 7-5 Dodgers, end of Top 11th McCarthy settles down after the two-run homer and retires three batters in a row, so now we go to the bottom of the 11th. Which players will hit the inevitable home runs that push this game to the 12th? Stay tuned to fined out! George Springer goes opposite field to plate Maybin. There have now been ... approximately 78 home runs hit in this game. Astros 5-5 Dodgers, top of 11th Maybin scores second. Good jump, good throw, but he just gets in. Man on second now with no one out. Astros 5-5 Dodgers, top of 11th Cameron Maybin ropes one into left-center for a single. One one and no out. You may know him from Twitter. But, believe it or not, he also pitches in the major leagues. Astros 5-5 Dodgers, end of the 10th Devenski gets Taylor to pop one to centerfield an we’re on to the 11th. Before throwing a single pitch, Devenski tries to pick off Hernandez at second, but throws the ball of the base umpire. Had it not hit the ump, Hernandez easily could have advanced to third. Still two out. There are undoubtedly some Dodgers fans who left before this inning to beat traffic. They are probably not happy right now. Hernandez comes through again. He laced a single to right and Forsythe just slid home ahead of a strong throw from Reddick. Wow. Astros 5-4 Dodgers, bottom of 10th Giles throws a wild pitch to move Forsythe to second. Tying run now in scoring position with two out. Astros 5-4 Dodgers, bottom of 10th Giles walks Logan Forsythe, bringing up Kike Hernandez, who had a big moment in the NLCS. Astros 5-4 Dodgers, bottom of 10th Giles gets Barnes swinging, as well. Two outs. Astros 5-4 Dodgers, bottom of 10th Giles strikes out Yasmani Grandal to get the first out. Houston now just two outs away from the franchise’s first-ever World Series win. Astros 5-4 Dodgers, bottom of 10th Giles opens the bottom of the 10th by giving up a blast to Puig to left-center. This game has all the home runs. Astros 5-3 Dodgers, end of Top 10th Cingrani makes quick work, ending it with a double play ball. Now the Dodgers will look to make their own comeback from a 2-run deficit. He quickly records the first out of the inning. Astros 5-3 Dodgers, top of 10th And now Gurriel doubles. Fields is already being removed from the game. This is probably not how he envisioned pitching in the World Series when he was little kid. Correa follows Altuve with his own rocket to left center. Josh Fields is having a bad night. As are all the Dodgers fans who are now completely silent. It’s now 4-3 Astros with none out in the Top of the 10th. Altuve had an ugly night at the plate before that. But, yeah, a 10th inning homer in the World Series? That makes up for any earlier batting sins. He is LA’s seventh pitcher of the night. They only have two relievers left. Astros 3-3 Dodgers, end of the 9th Giles struck out Kyle Seager and then got Justin Turner to ground out to short. Cody Bellinger then launched a ball deep to right-center ... but it fell just short of the wall. We now go to extras. Dave Roberts already went deep into his bullpen, so he has some interesting decision to make coming up. Giles is Houston’s closer, but his job right now is to keep this game open to the 10th. Astros 3-3 Dodgers, end of Top 9th Bregman grounds out to short to end the inning, but the Astros extend the game. Roberts gamble to have Jensen pitch 2 innings didn’t pay off. Astros 3-3 Dodgers, top of 9th After Jensen battled back to record two quick outs, George Springer worked the count and then laced a double just inside the third base line. Man on second, two outs. Bregman up. Astros 3-3 Dodgers, top of 9th Marwin Gonzalez just bashed a cutter over the center field wall to tie the game. The air just left Dodger Stadium. Astros 2-3 Dodgers, end of 8th Musgrove does his job. He gets Chase Utley to fly out to left, then Kike Hernandez grounded out and Chris Taylor flew out to left. We are on to the ninth and the Astros have the bottom of their order due up. His job: keep the deficit just one. Astros 2-3 Dodgers, end of Top 8th Gurriel’s rough night continues with a weak pop up into foul territory along the first baseline and then McCann K’s on a full count with Correa running. Three outs left for the Astros. Astros 2-3 Dodgers, top of 8th Altuve recorded the first out, but moved Bregman to third on a bouncer up the middle. Then Correa slapped a single through the infield to score him. Gurriel is now up with Correa on first and one out. Don’t let anyone ever tell you that Yasiel Puig doesn’t care. Dave Roberts goes to the bullpen again and this time it’s to his closer. He needs six outs to put the Dodgers up 2-0. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, top of 8th Bregman opens the inning with a double to right that just clipped off the tip of the glove of a diving Yasiel Puig, before bouncing out of play. The Astros have something cooking. If Game 3 comes down to spitting, the Astros will win in a blowout thanks to Lance McCullers. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, end of 7th Harris finally got Pederson to strike out and then retired Austin Barnes on a swinging strike to end the inning and strand a runner on third. Houston’s 2-3-4 hitters are coming up as we head to the 8th. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, bottom of 7th Just a quick update on the very slow, mostly nothing that has happened so far in this half of the inning. There’s been a lot of batters asking for time ... Bellinger opened the inning by reaching first on an error to Bregman. (Although the error should have gone to the first baseman Gurriel, who simply failed to catch a low throw.) A few pitches later, he advanced to second on a Harris wild pitch. Puig then moved him to third on a grounder to shortstop for the first out. And that’s where we are, with Pederson at the plate. Yes, Evan Gattis was a pinch hitter in the top of the 7th, meaning Verlander’s night is over after six innings and just two hits ... except both of those hits landed over the fence. Now pitching for Houston is right-handed reliever Will Harris. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, end of Top 7th Morrow fared much better than Stripling. He induced Reddick into a double play before yielding an infield single to pinch hitter Evan Gattis. Morrow then ended the inning on a sharp grounder to short by Springer. The Dodgers pen now has 28 consecutive scoreless innings. Four pitches, all balls, and Stripling is pulled. Is Dave Roberts aware he doesn’t have 25 relievers in the World Series? The Dodgers go to their third reliever of the night ... and he promptly walks the first Houston batter on 4 pitches. Seager knew it was gone off the bat. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, end of 6th Well, that turned quickly. Verlander retired Turner to end the inning, but he is now at 79 pitcher through 6 innings, with 37 of them coming in the last two innings. The Astros will now have to scratch together two runs against the Dodger bullpen and, if they don’t, they’ll be down 2-0 in the Series and possibly deflated by not even being able to get a win with Verlander on the mound. Astros 1-3 Dodgers, botttom of 6th After getting Utley to fly out to right and then pinch hitter Andre Ethier to fly out to center, Verlander then walked Chris Taylor before giving up a blast to Corey Seager. Verlander is trailing for the first time this postseason and the Astros are in deep trouble. The sun has now set in Los Angeles and it’s 84F/29C. Oh ... and it’s October 25th. Astros 1-1 Dodgers, end of Top 6th Well, that couldn’t have gone better for the Dodgers. Watson threw one pitch and McCann grounded into a double play. On to the bottom of the 6th. Watson, a lefty, will open against Brian McCann. There is one out with Correa on first. Astros 1-1 Dodgers, top 6th Correa opened the frame by singling to left, ending Maeda’s streak of 18 consecutive outs this postseason. But then Gurriel popped up to the catcher for the first out of the inning. Now Maeda is being pulled for a lefty-lefty matchup. We’re 1.5 games into the 2017 World Series, six runs have been scored and five of them have come via home run. This is officially 2017 baseball. Astros 1-1 Dodgers, end of 5th Barnes ends the inning by flying out to left, but we’re tied up through five on Pederson’s homer. Verlander through his first bad pitch of the night and paid for it. Astros 1-1 Dodgers, bottom of 5th Verlander opened the 5th with a strikeout of Bellinger on a nasty breaking ball and then Yasiel Puig was retired on a grounder to short. But, then, on a 2-1 count, Joc Pederson deposited a breaking bal lover the left-center wall. Tie game. That home was LA’s first hit of the night. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, end of Top 5th Rich Hill wasn’t happy about being taken out of the game, but Maeda kept Houston in check. Springer was retired on a deep fly to center and then Bregman followed with a deep fly out to left. Jose Altuve made the third out, hitting a pop fly foul out to Puig down the right field line. He’s now 0-for-3 on the night with 2 Ks and has seen only 8 pitches. Hill’s night is over after 60 pitches and 42 strikes. He have up 3 hits, 3 walks, 1 R/ER in 4 innings, while striking out 7. He kept his team in the game with Verlander on the mound. That’s all the Dodgers wanted. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, end of 4th Well, so much for that. Corey Seager hit into a fielder’s choice and then Justin Turner grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Mini-threat over. Verlander has still faced the minimum through four innings. Kenta Maeda was warming in LA’s bullpen throughout that half inning. He could be entering here for Rich Hill. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, bottom of 4th Verlander is making his second run through LA’s lineup and has his first hiccup of the night. After getting Chris Taylor down 0-2 to start, he walked him, missing badly on ball four. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, end of Top 4 Gurriel opened the inning by drawing a walk on a full count and then advanced to second on a passed ball. McCann left him there on a shallow fly to right, prompting Yasiel Puig to uncork a laser to third, daring Gurriel to tag up. (He did not.) Gonzalez then made out No. 2, watching an 89mph fastball pass by. Hill then gave Reddick and intentional walk to face Verlander ... who then promptly struck out on three pitches. The inning looked rough for Hill, he’s at 60 pitches and labored a bit, but no damage was done. The soft-tossed has 7 Ks through 4 innings. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, end of 3rd Another very quick inning for Verlander. Barnes flied out to left, Chase Utley ripped a liner a couple feet above Altuve, who leaped and snagged it, and then Rich Hill attempted a bunt single, but was retired with Verlander covering first. He’s perfect through three innings. Update: after further review, the RBI hit didn’t bounce off of Taylor head ... it merely hit the bill of his hat. Taylor has to feel good about that. Astros 1-0 Dodgers, end of Top 3 Hill battles back by striking out Jose Altuve looking. That’s 2 Ks on the night already for Altuve, each on three pitches. And then Hill put down Correa on three pithches, as well. Houston takes the lead, by L.A. has to feel good it’s only 1-0. Josh Reddick opened the inning on a grounder between first and second that Chase Utley should have handled. But it was ruled a hit. Then Justin Verlander sacrificed his teammate to second on a bunt. George Springer made it first and third with one out on a hard liner to left and Bregman followed with a hard single that bounced off the head of a diving Taylor. Luckily for LA, the deflected ball bounced right to Dodgers left fielder Joc Pederson, or Springer likely would have scored, too. As it is now, first and third, one out, Jose Altuve at the plate. Astros 0-0 Dodgers, end of 2nd Verlander is rolling. Cody Bellinger struck out on a big breaking ball for the first out and then jammed Yasiel Puig on a weak pop out for out No. 2. Joc Pederson ended the Dodgers’ frame looking on a strike-three curve. Through 2 innings, Verlander has 4 Ks on just 24 pitches. Hard to do much better than that. Astros 0-0 Dodgers, end of Top 2 Yulieski Gurriel lined out to left-center on the first pitch to open the 2nd, followed by Brian McCann K’ing on five pitches on a high fastball. Marwin Gonzalez then ended this half of the inning with a strikeout on a full count. Hill has been good wild so far at the top of the strike zone, getting the Astros to chase pitches. He has 3 Ks through two innings. We’ve got the early stages of another pitching duel. Here’s the full video of Scully’s first pitch/not first pitch. A great baseball moment. Astros 0-0 Dodgers, end of 1st No opening home run by Chris Taylor tonight, who Verlander sat down with a strikeout on five pitches. Corey Seager was then K’d on four pitches and Justin Turner — last night’s hitting hero — was retired on two pitches, skying a high fly ball to center. No signs of nerves from Verlander. Astros 0-0 Dodgers, end of Top 1 After walking Springer, Hill fell down 3-1 to Bregman, but got him to hit a pop-up foul to the catcher for the first out and then K’d Jose Altuve on three pitches for out No. 2. Carlos Correa got the third out on an 0-2 fly to right field. Nice job by Hill battling back after a rough first batter and a half. The Dodgers get their first hacks of the night against Verlander next. Astros 0-0 Dodgers, top of the 1st Rich Hill opened with a 7-pitch walk to George Springer, missing badly on balls three and four. Alex Bregman in now at-bat with no out. Rich Hill opens with an 89 mph ball to George Springer. Here we go. Scully, feigning a rotator cuff injury, has handed his first pitch duties over to Dodgers legend Fernando Valenzuela. Vin Scully is now throwing out the first pitch. No matter what else happens tonight, this will be the biggest ovation of the night. Tonight’s game will open at 92F/33C. The players might feel a bit cold after last night’s conditions. Country singer Brad Paisley is now singing the national anthem. A country performer would fit a little better in Houston than L.A., but no one ever accused MLB of perfectly nailing marketing. Here is Houston’s dugout scorecard for tonight. Note the names at the bottom-right. Keuchel is obviously not available tonight because he pitches last night, while A.J. Hinch announced today that Lance McCullers will start Game 3 and Charlie Morton Game 4. Despite Game 1 being a quick and entertaining matchup between two huge market teams with more than 100 wins on the season, TV ratings were down. None of the players kneeled for the national anthem and the game was broadcast on FOX. Weird the president hasn’t tweeted about the low ratings. So. Weird. Tonight’s pitching match-up features two guys with very different careers. Verlander is a power pitcher who has been an ace at every stop. Rich Hill is a 36-year older journeyman whose fastball only lands around 90 mph. But Hill’s curve makes him a challenge and it will be interesting to see how some of Houston’s young hitters deal with it. Justin Turner continued his remarkable postseason last night with a 2-run home run that proved to be the big winner. It was a shot that many baseball fans won’t soon forget, just as this is a GIF that many won’t soon forget. Last night was obviously a great evening for the Dodgers. But it could have gone better for their utility man. The Astros are actually favored to win tonight’s game on the road, which is evidence of how good starting pitcher Justin Verlander has been since coming to Houston: 8-0 in 8 games, with a 1.23 ERA and a .171 opponent batting average. But Verlander also has some of the postseason baggage that Kershaw had entering last night. (Baggage Kershaw no longer carries.) He is 0-3 in his career in the World Series. Welcome to The Guardian liveblog for Game 2 of the 2017 World Series! The Dodgers enter tonight’s game with a 1-0 lead in the series after Clayton Keyshaw outdueled Dallas Keuchel in Game 1. Probably even more remarkable than the outstanding pitching we saw: the game ended in just 2 hours, 28 minutes, a postseason baseball miracle. Please feel free to join in tonight’s liveblog by tweeting to me at @DJGalloEtc or via e-mail. Let’s play ball (in approximately 50 minutes)! Here’s a look at tonight’s lineups. No changes for the Astros’ one through eight hitters, while Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has moved Corey Seager back up to the No2 slot and plugged in Joc Pederson and Chase Utley.

Malthe, who has appeared in several films, is the latest woman to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault. Malthe told reporters at a press conference in New York on Wednesday that despite her repeatedly telling Weinstein she was not interested in a sexual relationship, he forced himself on her in a room at the Sanderson hotel after they met at the Baftas in February 2008. Later, he asked her to join in a threesome in a Los Angeles hotel. After the incident in Los Angeles, Malthe said she called Weinstein and told him being in his movies was “not worth what he wanted to exchange”. Describing what happened in the London hotel room, Malthe did not use the word rape but gave a detailed description of non-consensual sex. Asked whether the complaint amounted to an allegation of rape, Malthe’s lawyer Gloria Allred, who appeared alongside Malthe, described it as sexual assault that involved non-consensual penetration. Malthe said she first met Weinstein at a Baftas after-party. She said he asked her which hotel she was staying at and she answered. Asleep in her hotel room hours later, she said, she was woken up by Weinstein pounding on her room door. “His clothes were messy and his face didn’t look normal and I thought: could he possibly be on drugs?” she said. Malthe said he barged into her room and named A-list actors whose careers he had made because they slept with him. Malthe said she denied his advances but he eventually forced himself on her and started having sex with her, though she asked him to stop. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, Malthe said: “It was not consensual. He did not use a condom. However, he did not ejaculate inside me. After having sexual intercourse, he masturbated.” She added: “I believe I dissociated during the time he was having sex with me. I played dead.” The Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Weinstein issued an earlier statement that read: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. With respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.” The allegations follow weeks of claims about Weinstein. Earlier this month, several actors accused him of sexual harassment, prompting a cascade of other actors and assistants to publicly accuse the producer of assault and harassment. In the wake of the allegations, he was forced out of the Weinstein Company, which he co-founded with his brother. He is also being investigated by law enforcement in New York, Los Angeles and London. Malthe said that later she met Weinstein at the Peninsula hotel in Los Angeles to discuss an upcoming film role after he told her there would be no “hanky-panky”. When she arrived, Malthe said she was pressured to have a threesome but she rejected the offer and left. Malthe, who is from Norway, said she left the US after that incident and became depressed and anxious. “I felt that my dreams had been shattered,” Malthe said. Malthe forcefully concluded her statement with an explanation of why she decided to go public with the accusations. “Actresses should not have to demean themselves to be successful,” she said. Malthe explained that she had experienced harassment from many men in Hollywood, but the experiences with Weinstein were “the worst”. On Tuesday, a woman who had worked as a production assistant for Weinstein, Mimi Haleyi, said the producer sexually assaulted her using force at his home in 2006. “I told him no, no, no, but he insisted,” Haleyi said on Tuesday, also speaking alongside Allred in New York City. Allred, a well-known women’s rights attorney, said she had expected to meet with the Weinstein Company’s board that day, but the meeting was cancelled late the night before. She said she turned down an alternative meeting with the company’s attorneys and instead shared the proposal she had planned to present to the board with reporters. Allred said the company should create a trust with funds to provide to his accusers, if an arbitrator found the accuser was deserving of the money. Allred said: “It is time for the Weinstein Company to put their money where their mouths are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/26/state-abandoning-suicidal-children-slashed-nhs-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"When the state abandons suicidal children, something has gone badly wrong | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/state-abandoning-suicidal-children-slashed-nhs-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/26/state-abandoning-suicidal-children-slashed-nhs-funding","fields":{"headline":"When the state abandons suicidal children, something has gone badly wrong","bodyText":"The first time you hear a 13-year-old say they want to die stays with you. I was a volunteer counsellor at Childline for a decade until a few years ago, answering the phones, and later, replying to the online chat service. One thing that struck me around 2014 was the rising number of young people contacting us with suicidal thoughts. Some would call with plans in place. Others would type out distressed thoughts. The counsellors and staff were diligent and caring, and sometimes simply listening was what was needed. But each time I helped a young person contact their local mental health service, I was very aware that – with growing nationwide waiting lists – there was every chance they would find the courage to ask for support, only to be turned away. On Friday the NHS watchdog will release a report into child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in England, warning that children with mental health problems are waiting up to 18 months to be treated. The Care Quality Commission says that, when young people do get help from the NHS, many are referred by their GP or teacher, only to be unable to access support In fact one-fifth of all children referred to local specialist NHS mental health services are now rejected for treatment by overstretched services. The impact of this is as inhumane as any so-called civilised country could imagine. The charity Young Minds says delays for treatment mean children are actually starting to self-harm as they wait for an appointment. Others are falling out of education and watching their life chances shrink. Some parents are breaking up because of the strain, or having to stop working so they can look after their child. Reports of children being forced to spend the night in police cells because of a lack of available NHS beds are now far from uncommon. Increasingly, vulnerable children are being given an inpatient bed miles away from their parents’ home, or treated on adult psychiatric wards. The government likes to talk big on mental health in this country. Theresa May is keen on lamenting the “burning injustice” of insufficient mental health services, while Jeremy Hunt repeatedly criticises the “historic imbalance” between mental and physical health facilities. It’s the definition of hypocrisy that the Conservatives are in fact responsible for slashing funding to mental health provision. More than one in five local authorities has either frozen or cut its CAMHS budgets every year since 2010. That’s £85m gone in six years. Contrary to what May or Hunt suggest, this is far from over. Freedom of information requests from the Labour party last month found that half of local NHS bodies plan to reduce the proportion of their budgets spent on offering mental health support in 2017/18. That this is happening at a time when demand for such services is rocketing makes it all the more reckless. The number of young girls treated as inpatients after self-poisoning has increased by 42% over the past decade. Eating disorder admissions nearly doubled between 2011 and 2014. Childline reported this month that it is now receiving 60 calls a day about suicide, with children as young as 10 experiencing suicidal thoughts. There are particular concerns over the rise in young girls facing mental health problems. NHS data released last month warned that young women are experiencing a “gathering crisis” in their mental health, linked to conflict with friends, fears about their body image and pressures created by social media. While suicidal thoughts is the fifth most common reason for boys to contact Childline, it’s the third most common for girls. Listen to such overwhelming evidence and there is a lurking feeling of having heard it before. These warnings have been emerging repeatedly for several years now – and yet nothing is changing. Back in 2015, the NSPCC was warning of a “timebomb” of children – many of them abused or neglected – left to cope without mental health support. Last year, Prof Dame Sue Bailey, former head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, called the situation a “car crash waiting to happen”. I can’t help but think of the words a Childline spokesperson issued last month: “Without appropriate support for young people, many are shouldering their troubles singlehandedly and turning to Childline only when they reach crisis point.” We are at the point where young people in mental health crisis are turning to charity because there is no one else to help them. When the state is abandoning suicidal children, there is something seriously wrong. • Frances Ryan writes the Guardian’s Hardworking Britain series • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Happens all the time'","bodyText":"About a third of the way into my interview with Melissa Leo, she stops talking; a curious, alarmed expression on her face. We’re in a conference room on the third floor of ABC Studios on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and Leo has spotted something. “What the hell are those guys doing up there?” she says, motioning towards a water tower on the roof of a building close by. I’m struggling to spot exactly what she’s seeing, but there’s a rising sense of panic emanating from her. “They’ve got some kind of uniform, they do,” she says, edging closer to the window. “They’re snipers!” I quickly fumble in my bag to find glasses, squinting to see as two publicists come rushing over. But as quickly as the situation escalates, it dissipates with as much speed. “You know what they are? They’re chimney sweeps,” she says, relieved, before offering up an impression of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. In any other interview, this would seem strange, an incongruous and outlandish interlude within what can often feel like a stale Q&amp;A formula. But not with Leo. The Oscar-winning actor, 57, has built a career on playing a range of eclectic, fascinating, often strange women, and in person there’s a similar eccentricity. In our 40 minutes together, I witness anger, upset, joy, paranoia and, yes, fear of a sniper attack. It’s often exhausting, but as with her work on screen, never dull. We’re here to talk about her role in Novitiate, a drama that premiered earlier this year at Sundance. She plays the strict Reverend Mother of a convent in the 60s, struggling to deal with the Vatican’s loosening of a system she’s devoted her life to. It’s another barnstorming, scene-stealing, at times terrifying performance that, if buzz is to be believed, could see Leo back in the Academy’s good graces, having been nominated for her role in Frozen River in 2009 and then winning for The Fighter in 2011. It’s a character she disappears into, something of a trademark for her at this stage, and her deeply felt work belies a rushed backstory: she was offered the role just two weeks before production. “It happens a lot with me,” she says. “I don’t quite know why that is. But I do know that it’s happened often enough where maybe somebody has dropped out of something last minute and they need someone. So I name myself Last Minute Leo because very often the job comes when they’re shit out of luck.” Whether or not she’s always been the first choice, her post-Oscar career has seen a bounty of great roles, from an Emmy-winning guest slot on Louie, small but memorable cameos in The Big Short, Flight and Broad City, blockbuster work in Oblivion, The Equalizer and Olympus Has Fallen and, most recently, yet more awards-buzzed work in the Jim Carrey-produced TV drama I’m Dying Up Here. She’s a funny presence but can be equally fierce. When I mention her knack for playing intimidating, sometimes psychopathic characters, there’s a sudden and uncomfortable key change. “Which psychopathic characters have I played?” she asks, a palpable tension now in the room. I mention her role in Denis Villeneuve’s thriller Prisoners, where she plays a woman helping her husband to kidnap children as part of a “war on God”. “I think she was a woman caught in circumstances,” she says, seemingly offended by my suggestion. After explaining her take on the character, she offers: “Psychopath? A loving mother. Unusual circumstances? Perhaps.” I ask her if she has to look past certain initial labels when taking on such a character. “I don’t look past!” she exclaims, volume rising. “It’s a judgment about the character, and no, you can’t come into the character judging them as you’re playing them. That’s the film-maker’s job to choose the tone in which the character is seen.” There’s a sense of that nuance to her portrayal of the often abusive but never villainous Reverend Mother in Novitiate. Leo had previously spoken about her character in The Fighter very much being the product of a male writer-director, David O Russell, whose reputation paints him as difficult (Amy Adams said she was “devastated” on the set of American Hustle while his I Heart Huckabees row with Lily Tomlin is the stuff of viral legend). I ask her if working with a female director, as she does in Novitiate (and has done before in Frozen River and Sarah Michelle Gellar drama Veronika Decides to Die), leads to a less intense, more agreeable atmosphere. “That’s not been my experience,” she says vehemently. I prod for clarity. “It’s a difficult thing for a woman to say, because I would really like more working women in all kinds of jobs, being a working woman myself,” she says, before proceeding, passionately, to tell me her theory. She believes that “women are not brought up to deal with things like jealousy, like competition” and that, thanks to sport, men undergo a far different journey. “So very often when I’m working with a woman directing me, I feel like, and I’ve spoken to other female actresses, they don’t say it to you but they say it to me, it’s like she wants the job [of the actor]!” she says. “Well, honey, you want to do this? Then come up and do this! Oh, no, no, no, I don’t want. Well, why does it feel like that so much to me? I’ve never felt that way with a male director. So maybe in this time of truth-telling, it’s time to tell that truth as well.” Leo’s made it clear in previous interviews that she doesn’t consider herself a feminist, originally in a 2012 interview and then again earlier this year. The statements were seen as contentious by some but Leo remains unhappy with any talk of gender. When I bring up the topic of sexual harassment, she stiffens. “In my position, I’ve had all kinds of experiences throughout my career,” she says, an intense stare daring me to look away. “Here you are, you’re talking to me about being a woman. You’re not talking to me about being an actor, right? But that’s what I self-identify as – an actor first. I don’t have to self-identity that I have a [motions down] between my legs.” She finds conversation about her choice of roles as a woman in her 50s to be “passé at this point” and would prefer to talk about her new dog. “Oh my God, he’s so cute” she says, suddenly flipping into cutesy mode. But there’s only so much mileage in talk of pets and we move on to something that I worry will bring more tension: politics. Leo has often spoke about her liberal, “free-spirited” upbringing and I wonder how this has has left her feeling in an America with Donald Trump as president. “You’re saying ‘as a liberal’ and I’m reminding you that I self-identify ‘as an actor’,” she quips, annoyed. “My feelers tell me it’s some really bad times. The specifics? I turn the machine off. I look at the pictures in the paper sometimes. But I don’t read that stuff. I’m too sensitive maybe.” She goes on to talk about the “broken system” that she’s grown up in, getting choked up while talking about JFK’s assassination. After we briefly cover her returning to the Oscar campaign trail that’s led to a self-promoting photo shoot in the past (“This is publicity for Melissa Leo, I’m an actor and the more known I am as an actor, the more opportunities for work I will get,” she tells me about the reasoning for our interview) we return to darker territory. In her last interview with the Guardian in 2011, she spoke about a director who once asked to see her breasts in a meeting. At a time when women in the industry are sharing their stories, is she more open to talking about it further? “I’ve been through all kinds of experiences, and there are names I could name, but I can’t say anything with a notable name like some of the women are talking about, because I have always been the daughter my mother raised and I would definitely call bullshit on you,” she says, anger flaring. She then tells me a chilling tale of a hitchhike when she was younger that resulted in a driver repeatedly asking to fondle her – and then moves on to other forms of abuse in Hollywood. “Things we could call abuse on the set?” she says. “Happens all the time. Sexual and otherwise. What about the abuse of the soul of the actor? You know what I tell directors when I go and work with them? This is a difficult part you’re asking me to go and do. I am asking you to hold my soul while I give that space in me to your character, and the more dangerous the woman is – say in Prisoners – the more you need to know and why I worked on that film is because Denis held my soul while I was her for him.” Like much of the interview, this is delivered with uncomfortable intensity, and like much of the interview, she quickly flips into an entirely different mode directly after, while discussing the reason she hasn’t been sexually harassed in Hollywood. “I’ve always been a small-breasted, red-headed woman with little eyes,” she says, smiling. “It doesn’t happen to me. I don’t even get asked out on dates. I’m a single woman and not by choice. It’s not the first interview I’ve mentioned it in. The dog might help.” Our time is over. I’m somewhat relieved. She apologizes for scaring us all with her sniper fears, before adding: “I think I’m going to not face the window.” Novitiate is in US cinemas on 27 October and in the UK at a later date"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/25/ballydoyle-14-del-mar-breeders-cup-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T18:18:00Z","webTitle":"Ballydoyle likely to send 14 horses to Del Mar for next week’s Breeders’ Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/25/ballydoyle-14-del-mar-breeders-cup-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/25/ballydoyle-14-del-mar-breeders-cup-2017","fields":{"headline":"Ballydoyle likely to send 14 horses to Del Mar for next week’s Breeders’ Cup","bodyText":"Aidan O’Brien will send his biggest ever team of runners to the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar in California next week and target two of the meeting’s major races on dirt at the end of what has already been the finest season of his career. U S Navy Flag, a rare winner of both the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes, could line up for the Juvenile, a race O’Brien won with Johannesburg in 2001, while Churchill, the 2,000 Guineas winner, is likely to contest the final and most valuable race, the Classic. In all, O’Brien’s Ballydoyle stable is expected to send 14 runners to Del Mar, part of a record team of up to 36 runners from European yards at this year’s event. All 13 of the Breeders’ Cup races have Grade One status, and while O’Brien may have already set a new all-time record for top-flight wins in a season when the meeting opens on Friday week, he could have runners in as many as nine different races. Highland Reel, the easy winner of last year’s Breeders’ Cup Turf, will attempt to become only the third horse to win the race twice, while O’Brien’s fillies Happily and September, in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, and Rhododendron and Roly Poly, in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, will also go to post with leading chances. O’Brien’s boldest move could be to run U S Navy Flag against the US’s best dirt two-year-olds in the Juvenile. Victory in any race at the meeting would complete an unprecedented treble for a colt who has already completed his unusual double, but success in the Juvenile would be a memorable flourish at the end of what has already become an unparalleled year for the yard. Mendelssohn, the runner-up behind U S Navy Flag in the Dewhurst Stakes, is also entered for both Cup events for two-year-old colts: the Juvenile and Juvenile Turf. He is bred for dirt on both sides of his pedigree whereas U S Navy Flag, who is by War Front out of a Galileo mare, gets dirt influences only from his sire. While Mendelssohn is officially the yard’s first preference for the Juvenile, however, O’Brien suggested on Wednesday that a switch is under serious consideration. “U S Navy Flag would have the option of either race and he could go on to the dirt,” O’Brien said on Wednesday. “Mendelssohn would not have the experience of him, and he would probably go on the grass, but we’re not sure which way we will go yet.” O’Brien has gone very close to success in the Breeders’ Cup Classic in the past with both Declaration Of War in 2013 and Giant’s Causeway, who lost out in a bruising battle with Tiznow in 2000. Churchill, third home behind Persuasive in Saturday’s Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot, is likely to be joined in the race by the dirt-bred War Decree. “Churchill is very like Giant’s Causeway,” O’Brien said. “He’s big and powerful, like the dirt horses. Ryan [Moore] felt that he never got into top gear [at Ascot], but he went to the line very strong. He’s come out of it very well and we’re looking forward to what’s going to happen next.” Britain’s leading contenders at Del Mar will include James Garfield, who will represent the 29-year-old trainer George Scott in the Juvenile Turf, and Sir Michael Stoute’s Ulysses, who was steered around the Champion Stakes at Ascot to keep him fresh for the Turf, for which he is likely to start favourite at around 2-1. Ribchester, the runner-up in Saturday’s QEII, could also make the final start of his career in the Mile. The most popular British contender, however, will surely be Marsha, whose final race in the colours of the 10,000-strong Elite Racing Club, in the Turf Sprint on 4 November, will tempt Sir Mark Prescott, her trainer, to an American track for the first time. Marsha faces a rematch with the US-trained Lady Aurelia, whom she beat in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York in August in such a tight finish that Frankie Dettori, Lady Aurelia’s jockey, celebrated victory before the result was announced. Lady Aurelia is top-priced at 11-8 to get her revenge on home turf while Marsha is available at 5-1 to confirm the York form. “I’ve been to the sales [in the US] and I’ve sent horses over there,” Prescott said on Wednesday, “but I’ve always managed to avoid going myself, so it will be a completely new experience. “We went to Chelmsford this morning to send her round a left-hand bend. She went OK, but she didn’t go around it like a greyhound. “She has won [around a left-handed bend] at Catterick and Dundalk, but that was when she wasn’t going nearly as fast. Now she goes quicker, I’m not sure how she will go around the turn. “The fast pace and the fast ground, she will love [but] Lady Aurelia will just whizz around those turns in her own backyard.”While Churchill’s presence in the field for the Classic will add extra interest for European fans, the highlight for American racegoers will be a rematch of the Dubai World Cup in March, in which Arrogate, last year’s Classic winner, overcame a slow start and difficult trip to beat Gun Runner by two-and-a-quarter lengths. Arrogate has been beaten in two subsequent starts, however, while Steve Asmussen’s Gun Runner has gone on to win three Grade One events, including the Whitney Stakes and the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga. Gun Runner is the narrow favourite for the Classic with British bookies at a top price of 2-1 while Arrogate, who impressed work-watchers in a gallop at Santa Anita this week, is an 11-4 chance.

Their team had lost for a fourth time in succession to Chelsea and subsequently departed the League Cup at the fourth-round stage, yet the final whistle was not a signal to leave in despair. Rather it was a moment to display pride, and so they stayed where they were, chanted and applauded, and no doubt felt a step had been taken into the light after weeks spent trapped in doom and gloom. Ultimately it was only a small step given the outcome – an eighth defeat in 12 games and a deepening of the fear that their wait for a trophy is going to extend to 24 years at least – yet such was the contrast in the visitors’ showing to the stodgy, hopeless displays they had produced under Ronald Koeman this season, and which led to the Dutchman losing his job as manager, that it would be wrong to deny Evertonians cause to feel optimistic. No one more so than David Unsworth, who in his first match in charge having stepped up from his role overseeing the under-23’s following Koeman’s sacking, got the response he was looking for from a group of players who appeared reinvigorated. They performed with intensity, togetherness and belief, during the second half in particular when they created enough chances to not only cancel out Antonio Rüdiger’s first-half goal, but even take the lead. They did score via Dominic Calvert-Lewin from close range four minutes into added time but only after Willian had struck again for the home side. A consolation was the least Everton deserved. “I’m proud of the players,” Unsworth said. “There’s so much to work with. I’m pleased but not too pleased because we lost the game. But it was a really committed performance. Hopefully we’ll be as committed as that every game that I’m in charge.” Everton may have played with renewed zest regardless of who took charge of them here but their showing was undeniably also down to Unsworth’s choices, in tactics and personnel: 4-3-3 with two wingers in Kevin Mirallas and Aaron Lennon, something Koeman was reluctant to try during his final weeks, and a batch of young players in from the outset, something again which was in stark contrast to the approach taken by the Dutchman. Jonjoe Kenny, 20, continued at right-back while the 19-year-old Tom Davies, such a revelation last season, made only his eighth start of the campaign. But undeniably the most eye-catching selection was that of the 19-year-old Beni Baningime, a Congo-born defensive midfielder who was part of the under-23 squad that won the Premier League 2 title, under Unsworth, last season. Baningime performed admirably and more than left an impression with a robust challenge on fellow teenager Ethan Ampadu, one of nine changes Antonio Conte made to his Chelsea side, for which he was perhaps lucky not to receive a booking. “That’s normal for Beni,” said Unsworth. “Evertonians better get used to it.” There were fully committed displays from a number of others in white, with Davies, Phil Jagielka and James McCarthy among those who did pick up yellow cards for strong challenges. They all came after the interval as Everton went for broke having been subdued and hesitant during a first half in which they fell behind in slapdash circumstances. Chelsea won a corner on the left-hand side which Willian played short to Charly Musonda. He swung a cross to the back post and there was Rüdiger waiting to redirect the ball into the far corner of the net with a looping header, his first goal for the club since arriving from Roma in July. It was an impressive finish by the centre-back but he was completely unmarked when he struck. Everton could have caved in but instead they returned after the interval and pressed Chelsea back, moving the ball quickly and creating opportunities, with Wayne Rooney forcing Willy Caballero into a point-blank save and Ademola Lookman, on as a substitute, clipping the bar with a long-range shot on 80 minutes. To their credit, Chelsea continued to search for a second goal and after Michy Batshuayi had been prevented from scoring by Jagielka’s excellent sliding tackle, Willian struck in added time after linking up with Cesc Fàbregas to ultimately secure their place in the quarter-final draw. “Our performance was very good,” said Conte, before going on to praise the young players he deployed – Musonda, Ampadu and the Brazilian Kenedy. He was not as proud of his youngsters as Unsworth was, however, with the former Goodison Park defender having made clear his desire to be Everton manager on a long-term basis and he will get the chance to state his case to the club’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, in person on Friday. For the 44-year-old it is a case of so far, so good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/25/naacp-warns-black-passengers-american-airlines","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T17:39:52Z","webTitle":"NAACP warns black passengers of flying American Airlines after 'disturbing incidents'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/25/naacp-warns-black-passengers-american-airlines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/25/naacp-warns-black-passengers-american-airlines","fields":{"headline":"NAACP warns black passengers of flying American Airlines after 'disturbing incidents'","bodyText":"The NAACP has issued a warning to black travelers about flying with American Airlines, following what the US’s oldest and most well-known civil rights organization called a series of “disturbing incidents”. The group said it had issued a “national travel advisory” in response to what it described as “disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions” for African Americans traveling on the world’s largest airline. “The NAACP for several months now has been monitoring a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African American passengers, specific to American Airlines,” the organization said in a release. “In light of these confrontations, we have today taken the action of issuing national advisory alerting travelers – especially African Americans – to exercise caution, in that booking and boarding flights on American Airlines could subject them disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions.” The airline, which serves 500,000 passengers daily, said it was “disappointed” to learn of the advisory. “We do not and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,” CEO Doug Parker wrote in a memo to employees. “We have reached out to the NAACP and are eager to meet with them to listen to their issues and concerns.” The first of the four cases cited by the NAACP appears to involve a flight boarded by the Rev Dr William Barber, a civil rights activist and president of the NAACP’s North Carolina branch. The Barber case is already the subject of a pending lawsuit. Barber says he was kicked off an AA flight in 2016 after responding to two verbally abusive white passengers, who were allowed to remain on the flight. “This differential treatment was based on race, as other passengers noted and stated to American Airlines employees,” the lawsuit says. “Reverend Barber was calm, complied with all directives from the flight crew, and did nothing that remotely warranted being ejected from the airplane.” According to the lawsuit, a black airline employee at the gate told Barber that “this tends to happen a lot”. She said she was “sick of American Airlines doing this”. Barber did not respond to a request for comment at time of publication. Two of the other incidents cited by the NAACP occurred earlier this year. Briana Williams, 24, said she was booted off an AA flight in August after she asked for her gate-checked stroller during an extended travel delay as passengers were leaving the plane. “I told a crew member that I was not going to be leaving the aircraft without my stroller,” Williams told the New York Daily News. The pilot was called, and according to Williams he became angry and summoned police to eject her. Similarly, Tamika Mallory, the national co-chair of the Women’s March movement, said that after she contested a seat change with gate attendants, the flight’s pilot, who overheard the discussion, kicked her off a flight last week. “It definitely was white male aggression. I was singled out, I was disrespected, and he was trying to intimidate me,” Mallory told the New York Daily News. “I was discriminated against.” Unlike when the NAACP issued an advisory in June for black Americans traveling in the state of Missouri, Tuesday’s announcement did not include any qualitative data to support a targeting of black Americans. The NAACP did not respond to a Guardian request for any such information. “The growing list of incidents suggesting racial bias reflects an unacceptable corporate culture and involves behavior that cannot be dismissed as normal or random,” said NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson. “We expect an audience with the leadership of American Airlines to air these grievances and to spur corrective action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/25/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T20:01:45Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/25/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/25/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A familiar error was introduced into an article when we described Jodie Whittaker as “the first female Doctor Who”.

Nothing else matters except the two athletes. I don’t see all those people when I’m in the ring.” However, he might be seeing at least a couple of Joshuas at the Principality Stadium if the IBF and WBA champion can refocus after the disappointment of having prepared for the original but now injured mandatory challenger, Kubrat Pulev. Indications are the Briton will not find that a problem. Addressing the task of being a disregarded underdog and makeweight substitute on his first and probably only Sky Sports pay-per-view card, Takam acknowledges that Joshua is the best of the three heavyweight champions, ahead of Joseph Parker (WBO) and the WBC title-holder, Deontay Wilder. “Joshua and Wilder have very different styles,” he said. “It’s hard to say as I haven’t fought either of them yet, but I have the impression that Joshua is the better fighter of the two.” Takam, born in Cameroon and living in Paris, represented the country of his birth at the 2004 Olympics, going out in the first round. He has toiled in the shadows as a professional but is regarded as a hard-jawed, solid-hitting opponent at that level just below elite. He knows a lot about Parker, having lost to him on points in a rugged fight in New Zealand last year, but has only seen the unbeaten Wilder from a distance. “When I lose a fight, I accept that I lost it,” he said. “Against Parker I respect the decision of the judges. I try not to look at it as a defeat. It’s just a way to learn more. I always ask myself what I could have done better in the fight. I ask myself what was missing from my game. Also, I should have arrived earlier in New Zealand to acclimatise. I got tired in that fight.” As for the job at hand, he adds: “It will be just as important to work Joshua’s body as well as the head, and my speed will be important too. If I can do things differently from what other boxers have done against him [in 19 unsuccessful attempts], I’ll have a chance to win by knockout. “A lot of people have asked me if I see any weaknesses in Joshua’s style. All I can say is we will see on fight night. I do know that he has a lot of quality. I have sparred David Haye in the past and it was very competitive sparring, it was very interesting. “I believe that David will correct the mistakes he made in the first fight with [Tony] Bellew and he will win the rematch. You never know, maybe one day David and I will fight in a real match.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/tamal-rays-autumn-fruit-recipes-poached-pear-crumble-and-fig-cake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Tamal Ray’s autumn fruit recipes – poached pear crumble and fig cake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/tamal-rays-autumn-fruit-recipes-poached-pear-crumble-and-fig-cake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/tamal-rays-autumn-fruit-recipes-poached-pear-crumble-and-fig-cake","fields":{"headline":"Tamal Ray’s autumn fruit recipes – poached pear crumble and fig cake","bodyText":"With our mornings now transformed by darkness, grey skies and damp, many of us will fall into a slump, pining for the occasional sunshine of a British summer. But for me, it means one thing: Christmas. The big day might be two months away but for those of us who have cottoned on to the fact that the run-up is the best bit, now is the time to be excited. Christmas cakes are being made, menus debated among family cooks. Our own Christmas dessert list, a work in progress, is already up to nine different items. Some may grumble that all this is premature. Remember though, that after the hangover of New Year’s Day there really will be nothing to look forward to but months of cold, dark gloom. So make the most of this side of the cold season. It’s the spirit of pre-Christmas, along with the abundance of autumn fruit, that has inspired both of these recipes. A good crumble is one of the first things I learned to make. Simple and almost infinitely customisable, it’s the perfect comforting treat on a cold evening. This particular version, with pears poached in sweetened, spiced wine was something I came up with at the end of a date: an impromptu spot of baking and gluttony proving the perfect way to round off the evening and get to know someone. It would work well with some freezing ice cream, cool cream or piping hot custard. Or perhaps all three. Though they’re not native to our shores, black figs are one of my favourite fruits. Fat, dark and juicy, they caramelise perfectly when roasted with a little honey and spooned over natural yoghurt. They also make a versatile addition to cakes and tarts, bringing refreshing colour and flavour to a simple honey and almond loaf cake. Poached pear &amp; raspberry crumble Choose the firmest, most unripe pears that you can find for this crumble. They’ll take longer to poach, which means they’ll absorb plenty of flavour from the wine and spices. (Makes 6-8 portions of crumble) 6 firm conference pears 200ml red wine 200ml apple juice 80g sugar 1 stick cinnamon 2 star anise 4 cloves 150g fresh or frozen raspberries For the crumble 125g unsalted butter (cold) 100g soft brown sugar 100g plain flour ¼ tsp table salt 90g whole rolled oats 50g seeds (pumpkin or sunflower) Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Start by poaching the pears: peel them, remove the tops and tails, and slice in half. Pour the wine, juice, sugar and spices into a saucepan, with the pears. Cover and bring to a gentle simmer over a low/medium heat. Leave for as long as possible, ideally 30-40 minutes. You’ll know they’re done when you’re able to stick in a fork easily but they still have some firmness and don’t fall apart when picked up. While the pears poach, prepare the crumble biscuit. Start by cutting the cold butter into cubes, then rub it into the sugar, flour and salt by hand until it resembles (This is the sort of thing that seemed really fun as a child but that mnow usually gets delegated to the food processor). bread crumbs. Mix in the oats and seeds so that they are evenly distributed. Spread the crumble mixture out evenly over a large baking tray, lined with baking parchment. Pop it into the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up, then into the oven for eight minutes until it has baked to a hazel brown. Set aside to cool and turn the oven down to 160C/320F/gas mark 3. Once the pears are cooked, remove from the liquid and discard the spices. Turn up the heat until the liquid is substantially reduced in volume and has become thick and syrupy. Assemble the crumble by placing the pears into a roasting dish about 20 x 30cm. Scatter over the raspberries and pour over the sauce. Finally, break up the crumble biscuit and scatter over the fruit. Warm for five-10 minutes in the oven and serve with ice-cream or custard. Honey, almond and fig cake We’re at the end of fig season so feel free to use any other fruit you wish. Frozen blackberries, or sharp granny smith apples would work well. (Makes one loaf cake) 220g unsalted butter 2 oranges, zest and juice 150g honey, plus 2tbsp for the glaze 2 large eggs ¼tsp almond extract 100g plain flour 200g ground almonds ¼tsp table salt ¼tsp baking soda 1 fig, finely sliced Preheat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 3. Melt the butter in a saucepan on a medium heat and cook until the water boils off and the fat bubbles up. Remove from the heat and you should see that the butter has turned a hazelnut colour and has a nutty aroma. If it still looks pale yellow, return it to the heat for one or two more minutes. Stir in the juice of one orange, 150g honey and zest of both oranges, followed by the two eggs and almond extract. Sieve together the flour, ground almonds, salt and baking soda. Stir the liquids in to form a smooth batter. Pour it into a loaf tin lined with greaseproof paper. Finally, arrange the thin slices of fig over the surface of the batter. Bake in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes. When ready, it should be a deep golden brown on top and check that a skewer poked into the middle comes out clean. While the cake is baking, add the juice of the remaining orange to a small saucepan with two tablespoons of honey. Simmer for a few minutes until the mixture has reduced in volume and started to thicken. When the cake is ready, remove from the oven. Brush the top with the glaze."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-nhs-funding-smokers-obese-restrictions-rationing-healthcare","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:36Z","webTitle":"Rationing care to smokers and the obese will not solve its financial crisis | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-nhs-funding-smokers-obese-restrictions-rationing-healthcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-nhs-funding-smokers-obese-restrictions-rationing-healthcare","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on NHS funding","bodyText":"Since June last year, Brexit has dominated the government’s agenda, absorbed the bulk of ministers’ energy and been the focus of civil servants in Whitehall. This state of affairs will continue for at least the next few years. Yet from the welfare state, to prisons, to our schools and hospitals, there is mounting evidence that a state that first started to founder seven years ago, is now running aground. Last week, this was most visible in the planned expansion of universal credit. For months, MPs and charities have warned that the minimum six-week delay before claimants can receive their first payment will cause low-income families to fall into debt – leading to evictions, homelessness and destitution. The government is still pushing ahead, despite being so uncertain of quashing a parliamentary motion calling for a pause that it imposed a three-line whip on Conservative MPs, instructing them to abstain. But it’s not just the benefits system: it’s every part of the state that is creaking at the seams. Last week, the BBC released a new NHS tracker that highlights just how much hospitals are struggling to cope with rising demand. Only one NHS trust in the country has managed to consistently meet the national targets for accident and emergency, cancer and routine operation waiting times over the last year. In England, the NHS hit these monthly targets 86% of the time four years ago; over the last year, none at all. This is just the latest in a series of alarm bells that the NHS, currently experiencing the tightest financial settlement in its 69-year history, is stretched to breaking point. The last 12 months have been filled with stories of missed targets, deteriorating care and growing deficits. Given this constant drip of warnings, it’s easy to become immune to the latest signal that something is very amiss. That would be a mistake. The NHS is slowly but surely becoming less national, and less universal. It was founded on the principle of free care at the point of delivery to anyone in need, regardless of circumstance. In truth, its resources have never been infinite, and so the rationing of care and postcode lotteries have always, to some extent, been an everyday reality. But as its funding is becoming more and more stretched, we are seeing a financially driven, under-the-radar scaling back of treatment that increasingly undermines that founding principle that is so cherished. For months, doctors have been warning about increased rationing in the NHS by arbitrary or inappropriate criteria. A year ago, the Royal College of Surgeons found that more than one in three NHS commissioning groups were denying or delaying routine surgery such as hip and knee replacements to the overweight and smokers until they lost weight or stopped smoking. Since then, more have adopted these types of restrictions. Last week, the Health Services Journal revealed that health commissioners in Hertfordshire will deny non-urgent surgery to smokers unless they pass a breathalyser test to show they have not smoked for the last eight weeks. Other areas are inappropriately using pain threshold scales – not designed for this purpose – to limit non-urgent surgery to people experiencing only debilitating pain. In February, health commissioners in West Kent suspended all non-urgent surgery altogether until the start of the new financial year in April. For some patients, particularly the very obese, there may be good clinical reasons to delay surgery until they have lost weight. But these restrictions are not being imposed on clinical grounds, in the best interests of an individual patient. They are often blanket restrictions that contravene the official guidelines of Nice, the health regulator. There is no evidence to suggest that denying surgery to those who smoke or who are obese is an effective way to encourage them to change their lifestyle. On the contrary, it can leave people in greater pain and with greater risks to their long-term health due to immobility. While NHS England has warned commissioners against restricting access to non-urgent procedures based on arbitrary criteria, one of its senior directors, in a leaked letter to commissioners in Rotherham, appeared to back this approach. These sorts of restrictions are not only cruel and inhumane, leaving people in pain sometimes for months before they are operated on, they end up costing the NHS more in the long term. Leaving conditions to get worse before treating them not only can carry health risks, but also means patients need pain medication and physiotherapy for longer. What makes so-called “lifestyle rationing” particularly insidious is there is a pronounced social gradient for both obesity and smoking. The link between poverty and childhood obesity has only got stronger over the last decade; children living in the poorest areas of the country are twice as likely to be obese as those living in the most affluent. The prevalence of smoking is similarly linked to income and social class. Rationing treatment to smokers and the overweight will inevitably mean that it is those who are poorest who have their access most impeded. This is one of the serious consequences of the NHS deficit, which stood at just under £4bn in the last financial year in England, and will be even higher next year. Everywhere you look in the NHS, there are others. This Friday, a report by the Care Quality Commission will warn that children with mental health issues are having to wait up to 18 months for treatment, putting their health at serious risk. Ward staff are becoming increasingly stretched due to a shortage of nurses, compromising the quality of care. The independent health thinktank, the King’s Fund, has warned that health trusts across the country are planning on cutting too many beds from hospitals in their areas, further restricting capacity in a system whose average bed occupancy was 92% between January and March this year – far above the safe level of 85%. The NHS is far from perfect: the terrible quality of care once on offer at Mid Staffs is testament to that. But it has been declared one of the best health systems internationally, despite spending much less per head than many other wealthy countries. That is being jeopardised by the government’s sustained underfunding. There are difficult choices the government should be making in the forthcoming budget to alleviate the pressure on public services from hospitals, to prisons. At the very least, it should abandon all further planned tax cuts, and divert the savings to patching up some of the damage that has already been done. But the risk is that just as Brexit will continue to dominate the political debate in the years to come, so it will frame the economic decisions that will shape the health of our public services over the next decade. Things are bad, but the depressing truth is, the worst could yet be to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-catalonia-crisis-spain-europe-right-wing-elections-britain-role","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:36Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the crisis in Europe | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-catalonia-crisis-spain-europe-right-wing-elections-britain-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/observer-view-catalonia-crisis-spain-europe-right-wing-elections-britain-role","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the crisis in Europe","bodyText":"The unprecedented measures initiated on Saturday by Spain’s government, aimed at thwarting Catalonia’s secession, are but the latest expression of a developing, Europe-wide crisis of identity and political legitimacy. Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, was reluctant to resort to direct rule from Madrid, but faced by the stubborn and, in his view, illegal defiance of the Catalan leadership, he clearly felt he had no choice. Rajoy’s intervention could defuse the situation or, by triggering a formal declaration of independence, render it even more unstable. The drive for a separate Catalan state has causes specific to that region’s history and culture. But it has also been fuelled by the perceived failures of national political leadership. Inconclusive elections in 2015 and 2016 shattered the traditional dominance of the mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties. Rajoy’s conservative Popular party has been damaged by corruption scandals. The Socialists registered their worst ever performance last year amid record low turnout. Yet would-be mould-breakers such as Podemos failed to achieve a breakthrough. This rejection of politics as usual, and the consequent fragmentation of the body politic, finds powerful echoes across Europe. Everywhere, or so it seems, newly minted or reviving political forces, sometimes benign, more frequently not, are attempting to fill the vacuum. This weekend’s elections in the Czech Republic are a case in point. Polls suggest the ruling, pro-EU Social Democrats face defeat by the upstart populist, Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant Action of Dissatisfied Citizens led by a pro-Russia billionaire. In prospect is a coalition with the rightwing Freedom and Direct Democracy party, which wants to quit the EU. Events in Prague recall in turn last week’s Austrian elections, which brought victory for the youthful conservative People’s party leader, Sebastian Kurz, whose cynical tactic was to ape the extremist, xenophobic outlook of the far-right Freedom party. Kurz now looks set to form a governing alliance with a party whose neo-Nazi origins and ideology led the EU to boycott Austria in 2000, when the Freedom party first entered government. It is a measure of how Europe has become more accepting of, or resigned to, far-right activism that no repeat boycott is mooted in Brussels. More than half the Austrian electorate backed parties fiercely opposed to immigration, integration and multiculturalism. Muslim and Jewish citizens are understandably alarmed. Now switch focus to northern Italy and, again, anger over political failings at the centre can be seen combining, negatively and corrosively, with fears about personal and regional identity. This weekend’s referendums on increased autonomy for Lombardy and the Veneto have at their heart distrust of the Rome government and resentment (and there are echoes of Catalonia here) at the way the poorer south is supposedly subsidised by wealthy, industrialised Milan. But in its tribalism, micro-nationalism and sociocultural exclusivity, the biggest regional party, the Northern League, nurtures many of the unsavoury prejudices displayed by similar groups across the continent. It would be easy, but facile, to dismiss these phenomena as little local difficulties without bearing on the bigger picture. So what if fringe minorities in the Basque country, Flanders, Transylvania, Corsica or Bavaria are unhappy with their lot? All situations are different. And Europe, in any case, is ultimately an enriching patchwork of like-minded peoples immutably linked by shared values and beliefs. Or is it? As recent votes in France, Germany and Britain show, the crisis of legitimacy and identity extends deep into the heartlands of Europe’s big powers. Emmanuel Macron’s triumph in this year’s French presidential election was taken, for example, as proof that Europe’s nationalist, populist tide was on the turn. It was nothing of the sort. The Front National performed better than ever before. Marine Le Pen stands poised to strike the killer blow next time around, if Macron fails. Who can save Europe from this fatal fragmentation, this pernicious, creeping dissolution of its ideological, democratic and territorial unity? The threats to solidarity do not come solely from within. Russia plays the stealthy provocateur along the eastern flank. With EU funding for migration controls running out fast, prospective new waves of African and Middle Eastern refugees require an effective, collective response that has been lacking hitherto. The return of Islamic State fighters from Iraq and Syria is another pressing challenge. Authoritarian Turkey is a growing problem. So, too, is Donald Trump. Meanwhile, rightwing leaders in Poland and Hungary are at odds with Brussels over basic principles of law and civic rights. There was a time when all eyes would have turned for leadership and inspiration to Angela Merkel, Germany’s iron chancellor. But last month’s elections left her badly bent out of shape. Her CDU party recorded its worst result ever. The populist Alternative for Germany stormed into the Bundestag. As of today, Merkel is still trying to form a government. Yet this is the weakened, buffeted leader on whom rest Theresa May’s hopes of rescuing Brexit. Forgetful of its historical role as European exemplar, arbiter and guarantor, a diminished, inward-looking, self-obsessed Britain just does not get it. Europe is slipping ever deeper into an existential crisis all of its own. It is us who should be helping them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/21/russia-british-businessman-bill-browder-interpol","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:03:35Z","webTitle":"Russia puts British Putin critic on Interpol wanted list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/21/russia-british-businessman-bill-browder-interpol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/21/russia-british-businessman-bill-browder-interpol","fields":{"headline":"Russia puts British Putin critic on Interpol wanted list","bodyText":"Russia has placed a prominent British businessman on the Interpol wanted list. President Vladimir Putin is understood to have sanctioned the move against Bill Browder, who has led an international campaign against Russia over the killing of the jailed Moscow lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. On Wednesday Canada became the latest country to pass a “Magnitsky Act”, targeting officials “who have committed gross violations” of human rights. The move infuriated Putin, who accused Canada of playing “unconstructive political games” and later name-checked Browder for pursuing what the Russian president described as “illegal activity”. On Saturday it emerged that Russia had placed the US-born British citizen on Interpol’s list, exploiting a loophole that lets countries unilaterally place individuals on its database used to request an arrest. Browder said he was alerted to the move by an email from the US department of homeland security, stating his “global entry status” had been revoked. Further calls confirmed he had been added to Interpol’s list via an arrest demand, known as a “diffusion”. Moscow has a habit of using Interpol against its enemies and has previously used the global police organisation to pursue what many western governments view as a vendetta against Browder. Putin tried three times between 2012 and 2015 to get Interpol to issue arrest orders against Browder, but failed to convince the organisation that it did not have political motives. The Council of Europe last year criticised Russian attempts to seek Browder’s arrest through Interpol, calling the efforts “abuses” of the system. “Putin is so rattled by the spreading Magnitsky sanctions around the world that he’s ready to run roughshod over all rules and western norms,” Browder told the Observer. He has been battling the Russian government for over a decade, alleging that Russian law enforcement stole £174m, which his company had paid in taxes. Magnitsky died in Russian custody in 2009 amid allegations he had been tortured after uncovering a huge fraud that implicated government officials. His death prompted Browder to work with the US Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, which levied targeted sanctions against powerful players in Russia. Based in France and involving 190 countries, Interpol describes its purpose as enabling “police around the world to work together to make the world a safer place’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/mariano-rajoy-observer-profile-risking-it-all-on-catalonia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T19:24:46Z","webTitle":"Mariano Rajoy: Spain’s ‘safe pair of hands’ risking it all on Catalonia | Observer profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/mariano-rajoy-observer-profile-risking-it-all-on-catalonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/mariano-rajoy-observer-profile-risking-it-all-on-catalonia","fields":{"headline":"Mariano Rajoy: Spain’s ‘safe pair of hands’ risking it all on Catalonia","bodyText":"As political credos go, the Spanish phrase “Esperar a que escampe” – “Wait until the weather clears up” – hardly ranks alongside “Yes we can”, “¡No pasarán!” – “They shall not pass” – or even “Strong and stable”. But that cautious, circumspect and rain-soaked philosophy has served its principal exponent remarkably well. At least until now. Yesterday Mariano Rajoy took the dramatic decision of moving to impose direct rule over Catalonia. Rajoy, a 62-year-old political veteran from the equally rain-soaked northwestern region of Galicia, has been Spain’s prime minister for six long and difficult years. In that time, Spain has slowly retreated from the brink of economic catastrophe, witnessed the death of four decades of two-party hegemony, squirmed over a whack-a-mole succession of corruption scandals and spent 10 months deadlocked and government-less. Through it all, Rajoy has remained Rajoy: calm, patient, inscrutable and slightly awkward. His greatest challenge, however, is bearing down on him in the form of the Catalan independence crisis. Spain’s national unity has not faced a threat of this magnitude since it returned to democracy following Franco’s death and what happens over the next few months will determine not only Rajoy’s political future but also his legacy. He has become the first Spanish prime minister to reach for the so-called nuclear option of the country’s 1978 constitution, which permits the central government to take control of an autonomous region if it “does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain”. Fed up with the secessionist manoeuvres of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, and bolstered by Spain’s constitution and the rulings of its constitutional court, Rajoy has taken Spain into dangerous and uncharted territory. Until now, the risk-averse prime minister has relied on the familiar strategy that saw him re-enter the Moncloa Palace last October, after months of serenely watching his opponents squabble and squander opportunities to take power. “Rajoy uses time as a tool and letting time do its job is certainly the approach that he’s applied to the Catalan issue,” says Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. “He probably believes that allowing time to do its work and applying continued pressure to the independence movement [through article 155] will see it implode. That’s worked well for him so far. The question is whether it’s an approach that solves the issue at hand in the long term.” The problem is that the Catalan crisis is, at least in part, one of his own making. Although support for independence has grown over the past few years, as Spain has suffered a painful and protracted economic emergency, many Catalans are still furious at the role Rajoy’s conservative People’s party (PP) played in torpedoing the 2006 Catalan statute of autonomy, which would have afforded the region greater independence. In 2010, the PP successfully urged the constitutional court to annul or reinterpret parts of the statute, ensuring that Catalonia was not recognised as a nation within Spain and that the Catalan language was not given precedence over Castilian. That, and many other, age-old grievances, not to mention the Spanish police’s recent, heavy-handed attempts to shut down the unilateral referendum on 1 October, have led to the standoff. They have also raised questions over the efficacy of Rajoy’s default position. “Those abilities have served him very well in some situations but not in all of them,” says Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University. “By doing nothing, he helped bring the situation in Catalonia to where it is now – to a constitutional crisis. And that’s forced Rajoy out of his comfort zone and into taking drastic decisions.” The prime minister is not a man used to taking such bold action. He lacks the telegenic confidence of the Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez, the revolutionary fervour of Podemos’s Pablo Iglesias and the clean-cut certainty of his centrist ally, Albert Rivera, of Ciudadanos. What he does have though, is decades of political experience as an MP, a minister and the leader of the opposition. “If there’s one thing that everyone can agree on it’s that he’s the definition of a Spanish civil servant,” says Simón. “He’s an administrator, he follows the rules and he’s in no hurry to embark on grand political reforms or changes.” Simón recalls that some of his friends who work in embassies used to say that Rajoy and the former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi never got on because they were such different statesmen. “One is pure politics and pure showmanship; the other is calm and almost like something from the 19th century. But no one should look down on his political talents.” Emilio Sáenz-Francés, a professor of history and international relations at Madrid’s Comillas Pontifical University, says that Rajoy’s quiet manner means he is not naturally suited to the extrovert world of European politics. “Rajoy has a low profile in Europe; he’s not what you’d call someone with irresistible charisma. But he did manage to pull Spain out of an extraordinarily complex economic situation.” Barroso agrees that Rajoy deserves credit for hauling Spain back from the brink of economic ruin, particularly because, as he puts it, “he arrived in the middle of the hurricane”. It could also be argued, cynically perhaps, that he has done a wonderful job of keeping the PP in power despite the proliferation of corruption scandals it has faced and continues to face. The last few years have seen its former treasurer booted out of the party and charged with bribery, tax evasion and other offences, the former PP head of the Balearic Islands government handed a six-year jail sentence for fraud and corruption and several current and former party members arrested in Valencia as part of ongoing anti-corruption investigations. In July, Rajoy attained the dubious distinction of becoming the first serving Spanish premier to testify in a criminal trial, when he was called to give evidence in the Gürtel case, in which 37 business and political figures are accused of involvement in a kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. While he has never been accused of any wrongdoing and has managed to survive the kind of death by a thousand sleazy cuts that might have finished off many other European leaders, Rajoy has done little to persuade the electorate that he is committed to tackling corruption; opinion polls suggest it is now Spaniards’ second biggest concern after unemployment. Simón argues that Rajoy’s biggest failures to date have been his reluctance to send a strong signal on corruption and his refusal to tackle inequality or do more to address the country’s chronic unemployment. Those issues go a long way to explaining the rise of Podemos and Ciudadanos and the decline of the older parties. Given his age – Rajoy is unique among the leaders of the big four parties in being old enough to have voted in the 1977 election two years after Franco’s death – the PP leader appears ineluctably bound up with the old order; the last prime minister of the politics that lasted from the transición to halfway through the second decade of the 21st century. Much is also made of Rajoy’s stereotypically Galician demeanour – reserved, hard to read – but those who know him say his awkwardness belies a certain charm. As one PP MP said shortly before Rajoy entered office in 2011: “He will be a good prime minister. But he is not a good candidate. He is much better close up and we often say that if he could just sit down for coffee with every single Spaniard, then he would win them all over.” Sáenz-Francés argues that while Rajoy is “not a person defined by their charisma”, he has often shown a grim and effective perseverance. “He’s pretty determined when it comes to solving problems even if some people say he solves them by doing nothing until they solve themselves.” But, he adds, “it’s still effective”. The question now is just how effective Rajoy’s Catalan gamble will be and whether its success or failure will eclipse his economic achievements. Speaking after his election six years ago, the new prime minister pleaded for time and patience as he set about his unenviable task of tending Spain’s sick economy. Today, his words seem prophetic, if a little understated. “It is no secret to anyone that we are going to rule in the most delicate circumstances Spain has faced in 30 years,” he said. “There will be no miracles; we haven’t promised any.” THE RAJOY FILE Born Mariano Rajoy Brey, 27 March 1955, in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia.

Now, Indira Varma, last seen facing down her enemies as a vengeful Sand Snake mother in Game of Thrones, is to put the fantasy kingdom of Westeros far behind her to star in a Channel 4 film about the fear of domestic child sexual abuse. Varma walked away from her high-profile role as Ellaria Sand this summer, keen to embrace work set in the real world. Yet in Unspeakable, an unsettling one-off drama, her character is still consumed by the desire to protect a daughter – this time against a potential threat from inside her own household. She will appear alongside Luke Treadaway in a fictional account of an allegation that started out as a documentary project. It was written in response to the growing understanding of how widespread domestic abuse is and how toxic suspicion can be. “The idea behind it, that we don’t really know who to trust any more and that anybody could be an abuser, is really frightening,” Varma told the Observer this weekend. “But what do we do in response to that knowledge? Become neurotic?” At the beginning of Unspeakable, which will be broadcast early next month, Varma’s character Jo, a working single mother, receives an anonymous tip-off that her 11-year-old daughter is no longer safe at home. The unwelcome news, pointing the finger at a new boyfriend, Danny, arrives by text one morning. It is this everyday approach to the topic that may startle viewers in an era in which television drama is dominated by serial killer shows and police shootouts. Described by David Nath, the Bafta-winning writer and director behind the project, as “an antidote” to the extreme domestic antics seen in recent popular television series such as Doctor Foster and Broadchurch, it stays within the realms of reality. Although it has a fictional plot, Nath says it was inspired by dozens of real-life cases. And this is partly why Varma was drawn to her role. “Purely selfishly, I felt I don’t often get the opportunity to play someone who is normal with relatively normal problems. I have done a lot of fantasy television drama, but not so much domestic drama. This story has real momentum, but a subtler emotional palette. I was up for doing something on a smaller scale, about a significant issue.” Varma added that she was reassured that Nath, who also made the acclaimed documentary The Murder Detectives, had a background in serious journalism. “Hopefully, the power of this story is that it could happen to any family on any day,” said Nath. He wanted to create a sense of the overriding paranoia that can overtake a mother. “The things we hear all the time about this subject mean we can’t think about it in a rational way.” Initially, Nath’s team at Story Films looked into a fly-on-the-wall treatment of an abuse accusation. “It is not a story you can tell well through documentary, partly, of course, because the anonymity of the child must be the priority,” he said. “At the beginning, we wondered if we could do it through the eyes of the authorities handling the complaint, the police or the social services. But that would be quite dry and process-driven. It was better to look at it before the introduction of a third party and concentrate on a woman balancing her role as a mother with her new role as girlfriend.” It is the unknown source of an allegation that can give it disruptive power, Nath believes. “It can trigger a whole series of thoughts, but how do you know the veracity of it? And once you are thinking about whether it is true or not, you have already betrayed that partner.” Varma’s new, younger boyfriend is played by Treadaway, star of the film A Street Cat Named Bob. “The longer you leave it to talk about it, the more evidence there is of a failure of trust. Everything in your day is suddenly about looking for clues,” said Nath. Set in the claustrophobic atmosphere of a family home, the drama allows the viewer to judge the accused man from the perspective of his new partner once she has received the text message. “We are inside this woman’s mind for two days and once the poison has been put into her mind, it can’t go away. This is particularly true when the crime is the worst thing that anyone could do under your roof. You are forced to confront the stigma it would bring,” said Nath. Darker still is the thought that Nath says has nagged at him since he finished the drama. “We can all talk about the power of the accusation, the change it makes to a normal day, but I have come to think subsequently that men have somehow lost the trust of women. There is a prevailing anxiety about new relationships.” For Varma, regardless of the truth revealed at the end of this drama, it is the close-up portrayal of human reactions that is most compelling. “It is one little text message that explodes over 48 hours and that makes it so plausible,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/21/india-villagers-child-abuse-trafficking-alcoholism","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Indian village run by teenage girls offers hope for a life free from abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/21/india-villagers-child-abuse-trafficking-alcoholism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/21/india-villagers-child-abuse-trafficking-alcoholism","fields":{"headline":"Indian village run by teenage girls offers hope for a life free from abuse","bodyText":"Each afternoon the men of Thennamadevi leave their village and head for the surrounding fields, many carrying bottles of high-strength home-brewed alcohol. Hours later they stagger back home through the paddy fields of the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. Thennamadevi is racked by alcoholism. Most of its 150 male inhabitants participate in ruinous daily drinking sessions. Around 90 women with families in the village have been widowed. The youngest husband to die was 21. However, over the past six months something remarkable has happened to break the cycle of squalor and despair: the teenage daughters of the drunken men have taken over the running of the place. And it’s working. A self-titled “young girls’ club” has fixed the street lights, completed a health audit of the village and ensured that mobile clinics visit Thennamadevi. A library is being built where well-thumbed books promote the virtues of learning and independence. The phenomenon of teenage female self-help has made aid agencies and politicians across the state sit up and take notice. In the communal building, beneath the glow of a single lightbulb, the girls assembled earlier this month for a debate on further improvements. A petition urging better transport links – no buses pass near the village – has been drafted to be put to the local council. Debate is earnest, each discussion ending in a show of hands. Only when consensus is reached does the committee move to the next issue. “We are trying to transform our village by this process. We are empowered to be leaders,” said Says Sowmya, 16, president of the club. Others are focused on more intimate issues, such as shepherding peers through adolescence. “I teach my friends on life skills such as personal hygiene, self-discipline and menstrual issues,” said Rajendhiran Sridevi, a 16-year-old “trainer”. Sathiya Babu, deputy project director of Scope India, which helps deliver opportunities for the poor, said the gap between the ambitions of the young and the expectations of parents was widening. “The youngsters know that somebody has to do these things for the community. These girls are taking control of running the village. They want change.” There is another incentive for the young women’s intervention. A sense of hopelessness had taken hold among Thennamadevi’s teenagers, prompting a number to flee in search of a better life. Sridevi and Sowmya have frequently discovered that friends have disappeared, heading towards cities such as Chennai and never heard of again. Local records reveal that at least 150 children from the area have attempted to run away. Six kilometres from the village, via a labyrinthine network of tracks, lies the town of Villupuram and one of the most crucial rail stations in southern India. Built under the British, five major lines converge at Villupuram junction, connecting the country’s southern tip with Chennai and the east coast. When Babu began investigating the Thennamadevi runaways, one common thread emerged: every one of them had passed through Villupuram station. He heard reports of other minors wandering platforms alone, their clothing torn and grubby. Some were naked. Scope’s international partner, the charity Railway Children, began encouraging the station’s 40 cleaners to report children travelling alone. Days before the Observer visited, a malnourishd eight-year-girl was found on platform six wearing only a T-shirt. More than 1,000 unaccompanied minors were found at the station in the two years to June 2017. When questioned, most explained they just wanted to see more of the world, although 49 said they were fleeing abuse and another 90 said they were seeking relatives. One such was Magelier Kural, a shy 16-year-old from Thennamadevi. Kural had wanted to visit Pondicherry, 30km away on the coast. When cleaners found him on platform five, he was in tears and calling for his family. “I wanted to have new experiences and see some sights.” Kannan Jeevanantham, 16, was spotted on platform one hoping to catch the train north to Chennai to escape his father’s drinking. “I had no plan, no money. I needed to escape,” said Jeevanantham, who is now studying at a technical institute and is among those delighted that the “young girls’ club” has assumed responsibility of his village. Yet problems endure. Calls to Villupuram’s Childline in the year to this May illustrate the perils facing Thennamadevi’s children. Of almost 4,000 reported incidents, 3,016 involved petty crimes, 552 concerned children forced to beg, and 193 described cases of forced marriage, one documenting a 15-year-old being made to marry a man of 45. A further 39 calls heard claims of sexual abuse and 84 detailed children who had disappeared without trace. Despite the best efforts of Railway Children, minors still vanish, sometimes taken by traffickers who use India’s vast rail network to move their human cargo. Villupuram’s platform cleaners are instructed to keep a particular lookout for groups of children led by one or maybe two adults. Navin Sellaraju, Railway Children’s director for India, said: “These interventions are vital to protecting vulnerable children from trafficking and child labour.” Speaking at the police station in Villupuram, the town’s anti-human trafficking officer, Chinnamariappan Padmashree, sifts through updates on criminals passing through the region. “Lots of children are being kidnapped and going missing,” she said. “We have many cases of sexual crimes, forced labour and kidnapping, crimes against women and children.” All the children rescued belong to a lower caste, a factor that some believe makes children vulnerable to traffickers. Interviews found 70% belonged to the Sadhu caste, a fifth came from the “most backward” caste and 10% from the “backward” caste. Yet the biggest blight remains alcoholism, with entire families fleeing to the station. One such family is the Managattis who lived beside platform 1 for years. It was a fraught existence. Amudha Managatti describes struggling to keep her son and eight daughters safe. Her eldest, then aged 15, was targeted by abusers. “They took advantage of her, many people in the town were involved,” said Babu. A deserted home was renovated for the family and the children given school places. Her eldest daughter is now married with her own family, a journey that proves that narratives can be amended. For the teenagers running Thennamadevi it is the possibility of change that inspires them. Senior club member Gowsalya Radhakrishnan said: “By not accepting our fate we will give others the knowledge they can shape the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/28/country-diary-severn-way-heron-buzzard-powys","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T04:30:49Z","webTitle":"Country diary: on the Severn Way with a heron and buzzard for company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/28/country-diary-severn-way-heron-buzzard-powys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/28/country-diary-severn-way-heron-buzzard-powys","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: on the Severn Way with just a heron and buzzard for company","bodyText":"Long before the Romans built their two forts at Caersws, the ridge to the west of the town was dominated by the ramparts of Cefn Carnedd. In the low afternoon sunshine the defensive banks that still rise above the hillside woodland were picked out by deep shadows. The iron-age fortress stands above a kempt farmed landscape drained by the afon Hafren (river Severn) as it meanders across the valley floor. Only a few miles from where it rises, gathering volume from the tributary streams funnelling in from the many side valleys, it has already changed from a lively moorland torrent to a broad, stately, river in comfortable middle age. The Severn Way, a long-distance trail that tracks the river from source to sea, follows the break of slope between the north side of the flood plain and the steep woods of the valley side. Water filtering down the hill had collected in the muddy sloughs of the path, making progress difficult, but after days of gale force winds, the welcome gentle breeze was just enough to move the seedheads of the rushes bordering the route. On this quiet autumn weekday I was the only traveller on the path, and to judge from the startled reaction of pheasants and rabbits alike it was little frequented in this season. Low over the wet grassland a solitary heron beat purposefully along with slow flaps of its broad wings, while high above a buzzard soared idly, gazing with obvious attention at the ground below – occasionally stooping sharply as it spotted an item of potential interest. The wind began to pick up as the afternoon wore on, lifting dry oak leaves in short-lived vortices and starting to move the larger branches. Long lines of cloud, picked out in evening colours, advanced from the south-west and a new chill came to the shade of the woodland. Looking at the map, I measured my progress against the distance to my destination and realised I had lingered too long. Setting a new pace, I headed off, determined not to be further distracted.

I suppose that’s a good thing – let’s let the truth come out, as horrible as it may be. But for a lot of women, the constant recounting of just how bad it is and can be means reliving a lot of our own worst memories. Even worse, while explicit victim-blaming seems to be a little less en vogue these days, we’re still hearing questions again and again about why women didn’t come forward. Perhaps because nothing is done when we do. Perhaps because the majority of women who do report harassment are retaliated against in some way. Perhaps it’s simply none of our goddamn business.

It’s finished, claims Oscar-winning director who fled to New York","bodyText":"A change of the old order in Hollywood is long overdue, according to Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind the hit films Crash and Million Dollar Baby. The Canadian screenwriter and director said many of the established rules of big-budget showbusiness should be re-examined in the light of falling box-office receipts and the recent scandalous claims and revelations about the enduring influence of the casting couch. “Los Angeles is a town run by a group of powerful corporations, the studios, and they inevitably want to make what they know they can sell. This means they often lag a few years behind creatively,” he said this weekend. A reliance on sci-fi and youth franchise reboots is not enough, he added. “I love comic-book movies, but do we want a diet of only that? It is about money, of course. The studios have to make more than they did last year, so we have Fast and Furious number whatever.” Haggis, who wrote the screenplay for Casino Royale (2006), as well as Clint Eastwood’s Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers, and whose exposé of gritty Los Angeles life in Crash earned him international plaudits in 2005, said a desire to make grown-up films had led him to leave Hollywood. The insular nature of Los Angeles both concealed bad behaviour like Harvey Weinstein’s and inhibited creative risk-taking. “LA is pretty much a one-industry town and conversations become quite circular. In New York I talk instead to neuroscientists, bakers and restaurateurs,” he said. The film-maker hit the headlines seven years ago when he cut ties with the Church of Scientology, a powerful force in Hollywood, and began to speak out against them after 35 years inside the movement. He appeared in the Emmy-winning documentary Going Clear in 2015, revealing the disappointment he felt once he had seen through the mystical hierarchy of the church. Now Haggis, 64, who is working on a documentary about the early days of the Aids epidemic in San Francisco, said he enjoys greater artistic contact with the outside world, including at international film festivals. “I look forward to the cross-pollination and the fact that film-makers in New York and Europe have a completely different approach,” he said. Next weekend he will receive the inaugural Vision Award in recognition of his career at the Evolution Mallorca film festival . “People have been hoping for a new trend of more serious American film-making for a while,” Haggis said. “I remember when I was Oscar-nominated for Crash in 2006, the other contenders were all serious films, Capote, Brokeback Mountain, Good Night, and Good Luck and Munich, so I thought Hollywood had turned a corner. But people told me, rightly, that it was just an anomaly.” It was a hunger for films with greater depth that established the success of Harvey and Bob Weinstein’s Miramax and then The Weinstein Company. “It is really hard for their innocent employees in New York, who worked hard and may well lose their jobs, but a lot of people are compromised by Harvey’s alleged actions,” said Haggis. “Although everyone thinks it is vile behaviour, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him. For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?” Haggis does not think sexual harassment and abuse are endemic in Hollywood, but admitted it is a “fairly sexist” town. “It is not an innocent place and never has been. Most of this behaviour has been aimed at women, but I am sure that former child stars such as Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, who have both made allegations in the past that no one took seriously, are worth considering, too. “Were people covering for paedophiles, too? We have to think that may have happened as well, because no one speaks out about being abused just to benefit their career. I find it particularly terrible that people had their dreams held to ransom in that way.” Hollywood, Haggis believes, always invites newcomers to sell their souls. “People make compromises, but you don’t have to. I did sometimes, of course, especially in my early TV days. But then I made a conscious decision: if it doesn’t sell, it doesn’t sell. “I hawked the screenplay for Crash around the studios for the longest time. They all turned it down. But I felt I couldn’t keep selling little pieces of my soul, and now I have earned the right to the final edit on the films I direct. Sometimes people won’t work with me because of that, but there you are. How many academy awards have they won?” This December, London will host a fundraising event for Haggis’s charity, Artists for Peace and Justice, which since he founded it in 2009 has raised millions of pounds to fund education in Haiti. “We can’t solve poverty there, or anywhere else, but at least we are giving them the right start so that they can come up with their own solutions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/time-to-throw-the-tory-out-with-the-bath-water-tim-loughton","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:04:35Z","webTitle":"Time to throw the Tory out with the bath water? | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/time-to-throw-the-tory-out-with-the-bath-water-tim-loughton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/time-to-throw-the-tory-out-with-the-bath-water-tim-loughton","fields":{"headline":"Time to throw the Tory out with the bath water?","bodyText":"It has been my solemn journalistic duty to imagine Tory MP Tim Loughton in the bath, so that you don’t have to.

Loughton considers showers to be “one of the greatest causes of stress” and starts every day “working” in the bath, reading papers and composing his thoughts.

Under the proposals put forward by the diocesan synod, official Church of England services would be held after a couple has formed a civil partnership or married in a secular ceremony. The plans fall short of calling for same-sex wedding services to take place in church but priests would be allowed to offer a formal blessing to couples. The bishop of Hereford, the Rt Rev Richard Frith, said the motion was a response to requests from same-sex couples to perform the services informally. “Clergy are already encouraged to respond pastorally and sensitively when approached,” he said. “The motion, which is part of a much wider debate, asks for guidance on materials to be used in affirming and praying with same-sex couples.” Under the proposals, individual priests and churches would be allowed to opt out of the blessing services. The progressive OneBodyOneFaith group said it was delighted with the vote. “Support for such a motion in a predominantly rural diocese like Hereford reflects what many of our members and supporters know to be true – that in communities across the country, in all kinds of contexts, there is widespread support for affirming same-sex couples and being alongside them as they experience the joy and blessing of their relationships,” it said in a statement. Some traditionalists have criticised the idea. Suzie Leafe, director of a conservative evangelical group Reform, told the BBC: “Marriage [is] a lifelong relationship between a man and a woman and this has been – and still is – the understanding of the vast majority of the worldwide church for two millennia. To ask for a service of prayer and dedication for a same-sex relationship represents a fundamental departure from this teaching.” A spokesperson for the Church of England said: “The diocesan synod’s decision does not change the teaching or practice of the Church of England, whether in Hereford or anywhere else in the Church. “Clergy of the Church of England are unable to marry couples of the same sex and, under the House of Bishops’ pastoral statement on same sex marriage, ‘services of blessing’ should not be provided for those who enter into civil partnerships or same-sex marriages. “It is recognised, however, that there is real and profound disagreement in the Church of England over questions relating to human sexuality and the House of Bishops has recently embarked on the preparation of a major new teaching document on marriage and sexuality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/23/california-wildfires-santa-rosa-sonoma-rent-spike-homelessness","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"California fires took thousands of homes.

Now rent in hardest-hit areas is soaring","bodyText":"Last week, Jeff Sugarman escaped his burning home in Santa Rosa, California. This week he faced the horrors of the region’s housing market. One of the first inquiries Sugarman made was about a rental house nearby that was listed for $3,700 a month on Zillow. But when he emailed about seeing it, the owner told him the price had soared. “He said insurance companies had been calling him all day and they were willing to pay $4,700 to $5,000 (to house fire victims) so I’d better be prepared to pay more,” Sugarman said, adding that he told the landlord he was “appalled” and “this was wrong”. Sugarman passed the communications to the local newspaper and the US justice department, which he said was investigating price gouging in the wake of the northern California fires that killed at least 42 people and destroyed 8,400 buildings. A spokesman for the California state attorney general’s office said investigators planned to enforce a price gouging provision in the state penal code that prohibits anyone from raising prices more than 10% following the declaration of a state of emergency. But an analysis, conducted for the Guardian by Zillow, of new rental listings since the fire appeared to show that prices last week compared to the previous month have risen more than is typical for rentals in Sonoma and Napa, the two counties hit hardest by the fires. Between September and last week, Zillow data showed a typical asking rent jumped 36% in Sonoma to $3,224 from $2,366, and 23% in Napa to $3,094 from $2,509. Usually, price increases are down in Napa in October and neutral in Sonoma. In Sonoma County, where median rents increased by nearly 44% between 2011 and August 2017, according to Zillow, the housing market is already overheated. But last week’s rental prices per sq ft were still on pace to jump 16 times faster for Sonoma and 22 times faster for Napa in October compared to the average monthly rates in June, July and August. “These data would suggest that rents have increased sharply in Napa and Sonoma counties [since the fires started],” said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist for Zillow. He cautioned, though, that the analysis was based on the small number of units listed in a single week – 26 new listings in Napa and 30 in Sonoma mostly in single family homes. He said the magnitude of the trends could change as more data became available. Noting that Santa Rosa had declared a state of emergency about a year ago over the housing shortage and the homelessness crisis, councilwoman Julie Combs said: “Now we’ve lost 5% of our housing and 15,000 people have lost their homes.” Sonoma County supervisor Susan Gorin, wearing a respirator and boots as she sifted through the ash of her destroyed home last week, said it was her lower-income neighbors who were most likely to be displaced from the area. “We are so successful as a tourism destination,” Gorin said. “We produce a lot of lower-income jobs – in wineries, in restaurants, in hotels. It’s going to hurt our economy if we don’t get temporary housing for the people who lost their homes in the fire, as well as those who were already on the edge of losing their homes and the homeless.” Adrienne Lauby, who runs Homeless Action, an advocacy group in Santa Rosa, said there were at least 3,000 homeless people in the area before the fires and the numbers were going up. “People are already becoming homeless,” Lauby said, adding that she knew of several people who had been kicked out of informal housing arrangements so that the people they were staying with could take in family members displaced by the fire. “There are pop-up encampments all over the city. People are sleeping in the parks, they’re staying in their cars – there are still 425 people in the shelters.” “All of these people,” she said, “are at risk for homelessness and the winter is coming.” Gorin said the board should look at options such as trailers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), recreational vehicles and cargo containers converted into homes. Lucien Bisaccio said he and about 30 other people fled from a homeless encampment in the brush below the now-destroyed Fountaingrove neighborhood, after one of the campers woke up to see the whole sky in flame. “When the sun comes up in the north, you know it’s time to evacuate,” he said. He said the campers lost everything. He didn’t know where they would go next. Omar Medina, of the North Bay Organizing Project, has been struggling to line up help for the many undocumented immigrants who work in the region. He said that under federal law families with children who are US residents may qualify for Fema help even if the parents are undocumented. But many workers are afraid to apply because a clause in the Fema paperwork says the information may be passed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Instead some are leaving town. “We’re seeing people already moving out of the community,” he said, adding that, on Thursday, 170 workers showed up at an event organized by the Mexican consulate in Santa Rosa to aid Mexican citizens affected by the fires. “My biggest fear for my community is losing our diversity.” Even without price rises, he said, people on the lower end of the income spectrum are likely to be pushed out of the competition for housing by those with more resources for housing deposits and more stable incomes. His organization has started the Undocufund, which has raised $200,000 to help undocumented workers with money for things like deposits on rentals and emergencies caused by lost wages. “Our hope is that this disaster will be a wakeup call,” he said. “It’s time now to either step up and provide more housing or we’re screwed.” • This article was amended on 4 December 2017 to remove personal information.

When West Ham United’s co-owner appeared on television before kick-off, he pinpointed a desire to do “what’s right” as the reason for backing Slaven Bilic when speculation over the manager’s future mounted last month. By full-time, however, those noble sentiments had a hollow feel. Chairmen tend not to worry about shows of loyalty when they see their side display the tactical cohesion of a pub team. While the anger raining down from the stands was a form of torture for Bilic – whose job must be hanging by a thread after this defeat – it was music to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion’s ears. They have waited a long time to experience the feeling of winning away in the top flight – 34 years to be precise – and how they cherished putting that statistic to bed at the London Stadium, executing Chris Hughton’s immaculate plan to perfection. On 1 March 1983 Brighton won 2-1 at Swansea City in the old First Division. The scoreline was far more emphatic here and the harsh reality for Bilic is that Brighton, up to 10th after this victory, could have helped themselves to more than three goals. In the end they settled for Glenn Murray opening his account for the season and José Izquierdo scoring for the first time since a £16m move from Club Brugge. “I’ve been around enough to know this is the type of division where you can lose three, four or five games on the spin,” Hughton said. Brighton’s manager was talking about whether his team had altered perceptions of themselves but it was a line that felt pertinent in the context of West Ham’s display. After starting the season with three straight defeats West Ham had responded to adversity by picking up eight points from five matches. Bilic was entitled to think that they were turning the corner. He saw encouraging signs in training during the week. “We thought this was going to be the game to lift us up the table,” he said. That, unfortunately, was not the prelude to Bilic lavishing praise on his players. Instead he was ashen-faced and downbeat as he analysed the shambles he had just witnessed. He accepted the blame. “I don’t want to hide or run away,” he said. “It is my responsibility. Of course I can’t be happy with our performance. With the greatest respect it is one of those games where you are expecting to win.” He quickly clarified that remark. “It is not expecting the win will come if you only show up on the pitch,” Bilic said. “I didn’t see that we didn’t try.” But he did see flaws. He pointed to too much ordinary play in the final third, criticising his forwards for being too passive, while there were gaping holes in West Ham’s defence. The onus was on the hosts to seize the initiative. Instead Brighton took control, pressing high and passing with pleasing crispness and intent, threatening on the right thanks to Bruno’s overlapping runs beyond Anthony Knockaert. Their boldness paid off when Murray, capitalising on lazy marking from Pedro Obiang, glanced Pascal Gross’s free-kick past Joe Hart in the 10th minute. West Ham toiled as they sought to overcome Brighton’s diligence and organisation but they would end the evening without forcing Maty Ryan to make a noteworthy save. Manuel Lanzini struggled to shake off Dale Stephens and Davy Propper, Michail Antonio’s end product was wayward and Javier Hernández was isolated against the excellent Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy. The growing frustration took on an extra dimension when Brighton, satisfied that West Ham had little to offer without the suspended Andy Carroll’s battering ram qualities, attacked shortly before half-time. Moments after Hart made a fine save to deny Murray at the end of a flowing counterattack, Izquierdo gathered possession on the left, stepped past Obiang and aimed for the far corner from 20 yards. Hart got a hand to the Colombian winger’s bending effort, but managed only to push it into the corner of the net. Bilic responded by tweaking his system at half-time, replacing Cheikhou Kouyaté with Andre Ayew, but there was a whiff of desperation about throwing on another forward so early. The change had no effect. West Ham were still a confused mess, bereft of wit or spark, and Brighton remained comfortable and dangerous. The home side’s difficulties were summed up when Marko Arnautovic, their £24m summer signing, was jeered off in the 74th minute. Not that the departure of their record buy led to an improvement. A minute after Arnautovic’s withdrawal, Pablo Zabaleta’s trip on Murray allowed the Brighton striker to complete West Ham’s misery by sending Hart the wrong way from 12 yards. “The board will do what they are going to do,” Bilic said. “It’s their decision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/21/oh-for-phubbs-sake-leave-me-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T23:07:35Z","webTitle":"Oh for phubb’s sake, leave me alone | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/oh-for-phubbs-sake-leave-me-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/21/oh-for-phubbs-sake-leave-me-alone","fields":{"headline":"Oh for phubb’s sake, leave me alone","bodyText":"While “phubbing” (snubbing people in favour of your mobile phone) has been around for a while, it looks set to become even more socially entrenched. Studies report that it’s affecting various aspects of life, from relationships, friendships and work, to people becoming ever more isolated from real-life interaction as they increasingly concentrate on their phones. There are debates about whether people are natural “phubbers” or “phubees” and speculation that being phubbed drives anguished phubees deeper into social media to spread the pain. It also seems that men are more likely to decide that it’s fine to have your mobile phone out during a date, for a cheeky “phub”. Tut, tut, manners, gentleman, please! When women get friends to do the evacuate-the-date, fake “work emergency” call, at least they have the decency to make a big deal of fishing their phones out of their handbags. It seems a bit late to start lamenting the metamorphosis of the human race into screen-fixated zombies whose brains and hearts hunger less for real human connection than a new, cute emoji. Anyone who has ever read Philip K Dick could confidently predict that it can only get worse. Then again, looking at your mobile phone, or pretending to look at it, is quite useful when you wish to avoid being dragged into unwanted interactions. For instance, women travelling alone on public transport could be forgiven for using their phones as a barrier to unwelcome overtures. The phone screen has replaced the book as a way of saying “leave me alone, please”, without being overtly rude. Perhaps not all phubbing means that someone is a rude, desensitised, brainwashed idiot. Maybe, for men and women, sometimes it’s just a way of signalling a wholly human need to be private."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/swansea-city-leicester-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:43:33Z","webTitle":"Swansea City v Leicester City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/swansea-city-leicester-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/swansea-city-leicester-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Swansea City v Leicester City: match preview","bodyText":"With Leicester City winless in six games, 18th in the league and without a manager this is a huge opportunity for Swansea City to capitalise and record their third win of the season.

It’s up to us men to fix this","bodyText":"The past two weeks have reminded us of the extent to which women suffer at the hands of the patriarchy. As women share their stories and many nod along, what about us men? Any man who has read a woman’s account of harassment or assault and thought “that doesn’t apply to me”: what you’re experiencing in that moment is the exact privilege, power and entitlement that women are finding space to battle against. We have subconsciously benefitted since we were born from patriarchal privilege – in many ways it’s invisible to us. I’ve been outspoken in my support for women’s rights, but I’m not afraid to admit that I’ve fallen foul of the patriarchy’s malicious hardwiring. But in confronting it, rather than continuing to abuse my power, I’ve found more inner peace, understanding, love and truth then I ever could have done had I continued as I was. I’ve been fortunate to experience most financial brackets, and I promise you that nothing material brings happiness. No house, watch, car, phone, television, necklace brings peace. Those tangible things just allow you to feel more comfortable. I’m not saying don’t slob in front of the television or don’t go out and take drugs – I won’t condemn anyone who makes those choices. What I’m saying is that we often partake in these activities when we’d rather not confront our emotions. And it’s not OK when the desire for these things comes at the expense of other people’s safety or freedom. The abuse of power is a plaster for sadness and prevents self-compassion. I was raised predominantly by a strong mother, and I’d like to think that I journey into the world with good intent. I want to love, spread joy, help people and inspire. But I’ve still found myself in pockets of self-destruction. Extended periods of time taking cocaine, excessive drinking, excessive working habits, starting numerous projects at once, reading so many books that I feel self-righteous and, most painfully, finding that whenever I entered into intimate relationships I would end up selfishly self-destructing. That self-destruction led to a breakdown of trust in people I cared for and in myself. I had been wounded by the patriarchy in thinking even for one second that this behaviour was acceptable. If you’re one of these guys who takes pride in jumping from girl to girl or brags about breaking hearts, you have no idea what it feels like to truly love and trust yourself. And, knowing how I feel now, I am sad that structural abuse might prevent acceptance and understanding. I’ve recently confronted and processed my own childhood trauma to understand what it was inside me that would unconsciously destroy a desire for trust and intimacy. I’ve come to realise that it’s because I’m more terrified of rejection and having my trust broken than I ever could have previously imagined. I desire trust and intimacy just as much and perhaps even more intensely than those I’ve shared love with. It’s been an incredibly painful realisation. I believe that the false power gifted to me as a man in our society didn’t allow me the space to understand, cry, and work through the pain of my past and duality of my present. This idea that male vulnerability is undesirable – it covers up the pain of so many troubled boys who wanted more hugs from their mum or have missed the company of their dad, or were victims of abuse or loneliness or just generally felt as though they had no time, space, company or even the words to describe how they felt. It’s our responsibility as we become adults to acknowledge this pain and gain compassion for ourselves and acceptance of others. But for men in particular, when the patriarchy says that it’s OK to grab a woman’s ass, or tell her what to do, or watch too much porn or deny her space – and you accept this as a way of treating another human being – you deny yourself the opportunity to understand why you desired that comfort of power in the first place. The ego wants dominance and control. And the male ego is currently everywhere. As far as I can see, this toxic notion of masculinity is being championed by men who are so terrified of confronting any trauma experienced as children that they choose to project that torture on to the lives of others rather than themselves. What’s even more upsetting is that often when men allow themselves to feel this pain, it’s so new to them that they kill themselves. We live in a society where men feel safer killing themselves than acknowledging pain. Accepting the patriarchy from a place of false benefit will prevent you from ever truly loving yourself or understanding others. It’s OK to feel sad. It’s OK to cry. It’s OK to have loved your mum and dad growing up. It’s OK to have missed them or wanted more affection. It’s OK to take a moment when you’re reminded of these truths. When you allow your brain to access these emotions, it knows exactly what to do. So nurture yourself. Talk honestly to the people around you, and welcome the notion of understanding them more than you have ever done before. • Jordan Stephens is a writer/performer best known as one half of British duo Rizzle Kicks"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/22/paddington-producer-seeks-to-cut-ties-on-sequel-with-weinstein-company","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T17:17:17Z","webTitle":"Paddington 2 backers thought to be seeking to cut ties with Weinstein Company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/paddington-producer-seeks-to-cut-ties-on-sequel-with-weinstein-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/22/paddington-producer-seeks-to-cut-ties-on-sequel-with-weinstein-company","fields":{"headline":"Paddington 2 backers thought to be seeking to cut ties with Weinstein Company","bodyText":"The backers of the Paddington films are thought to be seeking to scrap the Weinstein Company’s lucrative deal to distribute the upcoming sequel in the US, in the wake of the sexual harassment and assault allegations against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. A source close to Heyday Films, the co-producer of Paddington with the French company StudioCanal, said the family film should have no association with TWC. “It is deeply frustrating that a film made with such love and care and a character of such positive and generous spirit might, in some way, be tarnished with the brush of these horrific, wholly unacceptable, acts,” said a source close to Heyday, also the producer of Harry Potter and Gravity. The move to terminate TWC’s contract to market and launch Paddington 2, which stars the Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville, would be a setback to efforts to engineer a deal to save the company. The original Paddington made $268m (£203m) globally, the fourth biggest film TWC has been involved with since launching in 2005. It is the eighth biggest film the Weinsteins have distributed in the US, where they take their cut from the success of the Paddington films, making it a lucrative franchise the company can ill afford to lose. Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s brother and TWC co-founder, has publicly cited the box office potential for Paddington 2, which launches in the UK in November and the US in January, to try to portray a picture of business as usual at the embattled company. Paddington 2 is likely to be its biggest hit since Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained in 2012 – which made $425m globally – and failure to keep the contract would send the strongest signal yet that with Harvey Weinstein gone and a name change in the works others in the film industry will not do business with the company. It is understood that StudioCanal and Heyday are trying to wrest control of Paddington 2’s distribution in the US back and give it to a rival to market, promote and distribute. “TWC has had nothing to do with the making of Paddington and Paddington 2. They simply acquired the North American distribution right,” said the source. “When dealing with people’s lives it feels inappropriate to comment on the business of film. Suffice to say our hope is that another distributor will be found.” Paddington 2 is the biggest of seven films TWC is involved with that is scheduled for release in the coming months. Bob Weinstein has said it is business as usual for the release of Polaroid, Paddington 2 and the Robert De Niro comedy War with Grandpa. Benedict Cumberbatch, star of the company’s potentially award-contending period drama The Current War, recently said he was “utterly disgusted” by Weinstein’s actions. The film was due to be released at the end of November, but has now been put back to some point in 2018 to try to avoid the toxic fallout that could kill its awards ambitions. There have been reports that agents have been pushing the company to sell the other finished, or nearly finished films, due for release by March: The Upside, a comedy starring Kevin Hart and Nicole Kidman, and Mary Magdelene starring Rooney Mara. Mark Wahlberg’s Six Billion Dollar Man, a remake of the hit 1970s TV show, is pencilled in for 2019. TWC is in talks with the private equity firm Colony Capital, which has thrown the company an immediate cash lifeline, about a possible sale of some or all of its assets. Assets include a library of almost 100 films, a slate of upcoming releases and projects in development, and a TV division, with credits including Netflix’s Marco Polo, the BBC’s War and Peace and the reality fashion show Project Runway. Last year, Harvey Weinstein valued the business at at least $800m, but after the crisis that has engulfed the company it is likely to be sold for less. Colony Capital is a previous owner of the film studio Miramax, which it bought from Disney for $660m (£497m) in 2010 and sold to the Qatari broadcaster BeIn Media last year. Bob and Harvey Weinstein founded Miramax, the studio behind films such as Pulp Fiction and The English Patient, three decades ago and sold it to Disney in 1993. StudioCanal declined to comment. TWC had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/20/catalan-case-persuasive-ruin-separatists-nationalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T18:33:26Z","webTitle":"The Catalan case is persuasive.

But that way lies ruin","bodyText":"Watching Catalonia and Spain feels like watching a Pedro Almodóvar movie where all the characters start to act freakily. It could be Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (in this case, a country on the verge of a nervous breakdown) or Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (a film about what, in the end, ties us to one another rather than separates us). Don’t get me wrong. Catalonia is a serious matter. But it is also hard not to see the hysteria, the hyperbole, the manipulation. Emotions sweep away reason; radical gestures lead to more radical gestures; passion drenches everything; the picture becomes one great confusing swirl. Can anyone still get a grip? To sum up the current situation: we now have full-on confrontation. Not armed confrontation but political, legal, and cultural. And with large street pressure involved. The Spanish cabinet is due to meet on Saturday after the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, indicated he wanted to trigger article 155 of the constitution, which allows the imposition of direct rule. Catalonia’s regional institutions could be disempowered. In response the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, has threatened to press ahead with a declaration of independence (currently “suspended”, although the region’s parliament hasn’t yet formally voted on it). A pro-independence demonstration will be held on Saturday. This comes just one week after an opposing, pro-Spanish unity demonstration, organised in both Barcelona and Madrid. There will probably be more of this back and forth. The film is not over. Meanwhile, EU leaders met in Brussels for a summit whose official agenda did not list Catalonia at all. But obviously the topic came up in conversations, and (take note, British readers) much more so than Brexit, which in the end ranked as a minor issue, with negotiations hardly moving forward. Nor is there much negotiating going on over Catalonia, which explains why independence activists have become rather frantic. Rajoy’s strategy has full EU support, and he’s apparently aiming to defuse the crisis by triggering new elections in Catalonia. He’s sticking to a stubborn but consistent logic: nothing can happen outside the constitution. In private, most EU officials think he’s mishandled the whole separatist question for years. Sending policemen to push old ladies down staircases and fire rubber bullets at crowds on the day of the referendum was bound to backfire. He played straight into the hands of his Catalan opponents. The same can be said of the recent arrest of two leaders of pro-independence civil society organisations, now accused of “sedition”. That was an inflammatory move. The crowds on Saturday will no doubt brandish slogans about “political prisoners” – an expression even the moderate mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, is using. So now we have martyrs to the cause. However, the 1 October referendum was hardly a model of sound, democratic expression. Only a minority of Catalans took part (turnout was 43%), and its organisation ran counter to Catalonia’s own legislation. The two laws that led to it were voted through without the two-thirds majority the Catalan charter (the Estatut) requires for such a momentous reform process. Nor was the vote overseen by the regional constitutional court. The Council of Europe, Europe’s democracy watchdog, said it did not abide by its fundamental criteria. Reporters without Borders, an organisation that scrutinises freedom of the press, denounced the harassment and intimidation – sometimes physical – of reporters who did not toe the pro-independence line. These points often get drowned out in the romantic wave of commentary that Catalonia and its history can understandably inspire, within and beyond Spain. Catalan radicals have taken to social media to try to raise support across Europe, using English-language videos. They are fronted by a young woman with pleading eyes who describes a small nation that has come under the juggernaut of a quasi-fascist central government. She says “all [Catalan] values are under attack right now”. She says the Catalans on 1 October did “just like the Scottish not long ago”. “Help Catalonia, save Europe,” is the message. Propaganda thrives in a crisis. The script of this film is one that leads to two separate nationalisms heading for a monumental showdown. No matter what colours you may want to drape it in, nationalism can hardly be good for anyone in Europe, especially now. Rajoy is no Franco. Puigdemont is no Mandela. Spain is not an oppressive state but a democracy. The Scots voted in a law-abiding process that had been agreed with London – not in a sequence of events specially designed to produce rupture. Support for Catalan independence may now skyrocket, centred on a narrative of victimhood and in an atmosphere that’s become unhinged. Which brings us, in a way, back to Almodóvar. Born in 1949 in a poor family, he became the best chronicler of Spain’s transformation as it freed itself from the Franco era (with, by the way, Catalonia’s autonomy and economic success as a showcase for the whole country). Almodóvar’s work reflected the festive, frenetic spirit of a nation liberated from the past, from its suffering and its entrenched rigidities. In some of Almodóvar’s wild, dark comedies, the scenario reaches a point where the viewer thinks only folly is left. But then something happens, a realisation, a cathartic moment of understanding and, yes, love. Self-destruction is averted. Feuds end. There is reconciliation.

The speaker was an overseas Oxbridge master’s student, whose only experience of British education and Oxbridge was the 12 months’ studying she was partway through. According to her script we “shouldn’t be worried or confused about colleges, they are just like houses”. It took me, a Russell Group professor, a moment to realise she was alluding to houses in the public school sense. Had she added, “like in Harry Potter” it might have connected better; but for the audience, the world she described was equally one of fantasy. Two years later, and it is only the children of white middle-class parents (like me) who are applying for Oxbridge, wearing, without exception, the Toynbee clothes peg. Their visits have demonstrated the self-evident truth that Oxbridge is largely whites-only (Oxbridge still failing black pupils, 20 October; Going backwards: richer students from the south-east still dominate Oxbridge intake, 20 October). Social media sharing tells them to expect, in interview and beyond, ad hominem attacks on gender and accent, masquerading as being “challenging”. They know their role will be to raise the game of public school dunces, and teach them better to interact with their perceived social inferiors. They know generally that the default culture will be that of the British public school. Their hope, nonetheless, is that they will get the intensive teaching from the world-class faculty that their love of learning has led them to crave; some, too, are cynical about the social advantage they will gain. Even then, a better education in many subjects can be had at other British universities; and our problem is not just what happens to exclude black and working-class students before they get to Oxbridge; but afterwards how Oxbridge graduates then extend that exclusion to the workplace. Name and address supplied • Your report on the lack of outsider students at Oxbridge doesn’t surprise me in the slightest. I was an undergraduate at University College, Oxford, from 1951 to 1954 and nothing much seems to have changed since then. My story may intrigue you. My parents both left school at the age of 14 and worked in a local factory. I was a bookish lad and, much to our amazement, I won a free place at our fee-paying grammar school, where I stayed until I was 18. Then came national service. My best friend in the army was called Tony Moon, a dedicated communist. At his suggestion, we both decided toHe suggested that we apply for places at Oxford. He convinced me that this was the perfect way to subvert the class oligarchy of privilege and power. So we started together an intensive programme of study based on the internal entry examination papers. This stood us in good stead; we then passed the interview stage (I wore my army uniform) and we both won places. This was a minor miracle. Perhaps we had been chosen as token working-class entrants. We soon saw the class system from the inside. It was clear that most of our fellow students were from “public” schools or had been officers in upper-crust regiments or were skilled rowers or athletes or had fathers who had been to Oxbridge or who came from extremely wealthy families or who were peers of the realm or were otherwise members of the establishment. Geniuses were also welcome. Tony and I were fish out of water. Although Oxbridge often claims to have reformed its selection criteria, nothing radical has been done. And nowadays, black applicants are treated in the same way as similar “unsuitable” elements. For these and other reasons, I am ashamed to be a product of this disgusting medieval institution, although I must admit that the education I received at Oxford was unsurpassable. Maurice George Ormskirk, Lancashire PS I’ve often wondered what became of Tony Moon. • A key instance of the eternally recurring circuit of privilege on which admission to the institutions of governance and the leading professions (including the national press and broadcasting) subsequently depends, the racially and socially asymmetrical recruitment practices of Oxford colleges are not unique. In truth, the “social apartheid” David Lammy (again) speaks of as “utterly unrepresentative” of the demographic profile of contemporary society is demonstrably, utterly representative of the real forces and relations shaping “life in modern Britain”. As a cohort, Guardian journalists, for example, fully reflect the preponderance of Oxbridge graduates comprising opinion-forming elites in this country. Reform of the cultural biases affecting recruitment in each of these locations is long overdue. What measures, one wonders, might the Guardian for their part be taking to address the protocols of systemic imbalance it too contributes to routinely reproducing all the way through? David Butler West Tyrone • Oxford and Cambridge universities have done much to take students from poorer backgrounds and state schools, but not nearly enough. Apart from being denied access to world-class education (Cambridge and Oxford are ranked fifth and sixth globally) they will find it harder to reach the top of many professions: 24% of MPs, 54% of print journalists (38% of Guardian journalists in 2011), 82% of barristers, 78% of judges, and nine of the 11 justices of the supreme court went to either Oxford or Cambridge. There should be much greater transparency of the admissions process, including giving feedback to schools on rejected students and having lay advisers present at interviews and panels. Anne Strachan Manchester • In four years as a mentor for the Social Mobility Foundation (a charity which helps bright students from low-income families gain access to good universities), I have observed one major obstacle to entry that David Lammy does not mention – schools’ failure to give decent advice on what A-level subjects to take. In my sample of four, all have had the wrong subjects for the courses applied for. This has placed them at a major disadvantage. Clare Richards London • David Lammy is quite right to raise the question of the restrictive character of Oxbridge recruitment. However, the fuss around this is surely misplaced. The real problem lies in the lack of diversity in the British establishment and the Oxbridge aspiration to be the nursery through which that establishment reproduces itself. Like love and marriage, Oxbridge can’t have the latter without the former. Prof Jan Toporowski Soas, University of London • Your article includes some important findings on the racial, socioeconomic and regional profiles of new Oxbridge students. The findings, however, are deeply flawed. When reporting on “huge regional disparities” the authors refer only to England and Wales. Two nations within the UK – Scotland and Northern Ireland – are totally excluded from the regional analysis and the maps. Why? If the article was based only on data for England and Wales, this should have been made clear; it was not.

This book is a potboiler – or, given its subject, a turkey brick. You can almost hear the publishers – or Nina Stibbe herself – calculating: how about following the success of Love, Nina (her memoir about being a nanny to LRB editor Mary-Kay Wilmers’ sons) and a couple of amusing novels with a festive bestseller? I opened An Almost Perfect Christmas preparing to be underwhelmed, only to find myself chuckling at every other page. By the end – or, actually, not long after the beginning – I was a convert. This book is the seasonal garnish we all need. There is no subject upon which Stibbe could not entertain. Having said that, it’s startling to discover the extent of her resistance to turkey. Christmas chops, her annual rebellion, sound a bleak-midwinter alternative. But you start to sympathise as she reminisces about childhood Christmases and her mother’s frantic efforts, as a non-cook, with the turkey. Can we believe that Nina was asked to point a hairdryer at the turkey’s frozen core to defrost a bird bought at the last minute from Iceland? I think we can. With Stibbe, what she writes is often so outlandish, you suspect it must (with the exception of a Christmas lunch story flagged up as fiction) be true. The book is light – which is not the same as superficial. There is the extraordinary tale of her father, who was once a Fenwick Santa, awarded the job after having built a particularly choice Christmas grotto. Stibbe claims that, after his defection from his family, she used to search for him in department stores in December and sit on more than one alien knee in the hope of a reunion. The “Swimming Pool Santa” is an eye-popping account of one of these Santas turning out to be her mother’s boyfriend – a married man and a researcher into the effect of DH Lawrence’s explorations of sexuality on the psyche of the modern woman. Memoir, short story, advice – this is a mixture of offerings, a spicy pot pourri. About Christmas presents, there are more don’ts than dos. There is a convincing argument against extras designed to beef up/apologise for feeble gifts. These, Stibbe dubs “bulker-uppers”, ending the section with the disarming thought: “It has just occurred to me that the book you’re now reading might well be a bulker‑upper.” There is a diverting account of a Christmas party in which Stibbe compiles the playlist, determined to find the ultimate Silent Night. The trouble is that she gets distracted and fails to single out one track, with the result that every conceivable treatment of Silent Night gets aired at her far-from-silent party. I like the sound of her own Christmas (the chops are, it would seem, now on hold). I find her emphasis on imperfection, human error and botched efforts uplifting. She wisely advises: “Don’t aim for a perfect Xmas, aim for an Xmassy Xmas.” In her case, this includes a homemade angel Gabriel who looks “exactly like Alan Titchmarsh”. I loved her account of buying a small potted Christmas tree from a shop assistant who perversely did not want to sell it – a particular type of opinionated person I have never before seen so brilliantly characterised – or, come to think of it, characterised at all. About Christmas pudding I felt en rapport with Stibbe, but I won’t dish up her views as a spoiler here. I also agree with her wise observation about mince pies: “Roughed-up shop ones look homemade.” She writes extensively on round robins (give us the bird rather than the letter any day). She insists she likes these self-serving circulars. They are “the sitcom you never planned to watch – you’d heard of the characters, but didn’t really want to watch the show”. And I relished her Christmas glossary, from which you get a keen, if scattered, idea of what her Christmas season is like. It ends with “Zest: a vital ingredient in many Christmas dishes”. But the essential zest, I’d say, is Nina Stibbe herself. • An Almost Perfect Christmas by Nina Stibbe is published by Viking (£9.99).

Civil servants serve the Crown, as the memorandum [pdf] by the former head of the civil service Sir Robert Armstrong laid out in 1985 and again in 1996, and for all practical purposes the Crown means departmental ministers. This arid doctrine remains in place. It was inadequate then and is inadequate now, so if you are a hapless official in the Department for Exiting the European Union you would probably want to make it crystal clear for posterity that you were only following orders. The Armstrong doctrine is inadequate because civil servants are also proactive; they make decisions of which their ministers are only dimly aware. And this leaves Whitehall accountability mysterious and opaque. For example, what responsibility does the permanent secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions, Sir Robert Devereux, carry for the fact that claimants have to wait six weeks in penury for money under universal credit, or for the humiliation suffered by those assessed by Atos for personal independence payments? Where’s the line to be drawn between the administration that Devereux and his colleagues carry out, policy, which comes from Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory manifesto or rightwing thinktanks? In January, Devereaux will retire. He has been getting it in the neck from social media and the tabloids for going at the age of 61 with a generous pension two years before his own department pushes the statutory pension age to 66 for both men and women. Of course Devereux isn’t personally responsible for the change; that is a policy decision. But it has been Devereux’s fate to run the DWP during years of austerity, with the David Cameron and Theresa May governments also pursuing deep cuts in spending on working-age benefits. “Policy” – otherwise known as the electoral welfare of the Tory party – has decreed that pensioner benefits have been not just untouched but augmented. You could conduct a forensic examination of Devereux’s tenure and try to pinpoint specifics. Under Margaret Hodge, the Commons public accounts committee tried just that, looking at the department’s Work Programme, outsourcing (especially the Atos contracts), fraud and both under- and overpayments. Devereux didn’t always help himself. On one occasion he airily dismissed the “20-odd years” during which DWP accounts had been qualified by the Comptroller and Auditor General as evidence that invigilation of his department’s spending had not accomplished much. So which decisions bore the permanent secretary’s fingerprints, rather than those of Duncan Smith? Wasn’t Devereux under the supervision of a departmental board? Many might feel he was exonerated when Duncan Smith, aided by then Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, made a cack-handed attempt to get rid of him in 2013 and was rebuffed after cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood went to Cameron. After one PAC appearance, the Institute for Government’s Julian McCrae observed it hadn’t shed much light on accountability. And there lies the problem. Until Devereux moved to the DWP in 2011 he was at transport, another department that hasn’t had a glorious track record in recent years. He was also head of profession for policy – a curious part-time role now held, even more curiously, by the permanent secretary for health, Chris Wormald. It’s not that policy is ill-made – of course it is – but that no one ever says out loud which bits are down to ministers and which come, in any moral or accountability sense, from senior civil servants. On Devereux’s watch that fog has got denser. He may have been a brave and effective permanent secretary at the DWP; he may have been a lickspittle, unwilling to stand up to crass and cruel decisions.

Experts debate the data","bodyText":"David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009 The big news this month was the mea culpa from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that they had got it all wrong for years. They admitted the 16 forecasts they had done since they were set up had under-estimated the impact of austerity on output. In each of the disastrous 16 they predicted that productivity would rise like a rocket when in fact it has remained as flat as a pancake. Despite the fact that growth never happened they continued to forecast each successive time that output per man would follow exactly the same path; so there was no learning. Output per man hour today is essentially unchanged ever since the austerity was imposed by the coalition. This means the OBR’s next forecast which will come in November for the budget will inevitably mean their predictions for growth will have to be slashed by at least half. As a consequence, the public finances are in much worse shape than the chancellor has claimed, given there is likely much less growth. It remains unclear whether the OBR are just incompetent or are the government’s poodle. The public pays for this nonsense. Fears of Brexit continue to have a major negative effect on the economy. The fall in the pound, which picked up recently, has had a major impact on inflation, which hit 3% this month. Inflation will likely fall back in 2018 as these one-off effects drop out of the calculations which means this is no time for a rate rise as the economy slows. While the jump in inflation will damage the spending power of consumers, the September figures will prove a boost to pensioners as they are used to set the increase in pension payments for next year. Workers continue to be hit hard as real wages fall, because prices are rising faster than wages. Both the OBR and MPC have also been much too optimistic on wage growth wrongly expecting 4% with outcomes around 2% for the last six years. Consequently, high street sales also slumped in September, pushing the British retail sector to its lowest growth rate in four years. The economy continues to slow. Oh dear. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank’s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The past month has seen a further surge in inflation, while the data on economic growth has been relatively subdued. The main drag on the UK economy at present is consumer spending, with retail sales volumes recording the slowest growth since 2013. However, anecdotal and survey evidence also supports the view that Brexit is holding back investment activity. With the world economy growing quite healthily, and our key export markets in Europe strengthening, we should expect UK business investment to be powering ahead. Instead, capital spending by UK businesses declined last year and has been pretty flat through the first half of this year. Both of these drags on the UK economy are Brexit-related, with the rise in inflation heavily driven by the decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. The weakness of domestic investment and consumer spending is preventing the UK benefiting from a general upswing in the global economy and an improvement in growth in the rest of the EU. As a result, there is a significant risk that the UK will find itself at the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2017, after being No1 or No2 in the previous four years – 2013 to 2016. The most positive indicators continue to be found in the labour market, with employment continuing to rise and unemployment registering further falls. But there must be a question mark over how long the labour market will continue to be so resilient when economic growth remains relatively weak. The MPC is expected to push through an interest rate rise next month, despite subdued growth, and I believe the committee would be right to do so. A rate rise – and the promise of more to come – should help sterling and take some of the inflationary pressure off consumers. A gradual policy of edging interest rates up would also head off an unwanted surge in borrowing which is at risk of developing on the back of prolonged low interest rates. The MPC has already left it too long to start the process of gradually raising interest rates and should not put it off any longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/24/tell-us-how-food-prices-are-changing-where-you-are","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T11:33:36Z","webTitle":"Tell us how food prices are changing where you are","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/tell-us-how-food-prices-are-changing-where-you-are","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/24/tell-us-how-food-prices-are-changing-where-you-are","fields":{"headline":"Tell us how food prices are changing where you are","bodyText":"Rising food prices are for many the first sign of inflation – a bigger bill at the supermarket is sometimes the most obvious sign family finances are being affected by wider economic issues.

Glyphosate is a weedkiller so pervasive that its residues were recently found in 45% of Europe’s topsoil – and in the urine of three quarters of Germans tested, at five times the legal limit for drinking water. Since 1974, almost enough of the enzyme-blocking herbicide has been sprayed to cover every cultivable acre of the planet. Its residues have been found in biscuits, crackers, crisps, breakfast cereals and in 60% of breads sold in the UK. But environmentalists claim that glyphosate is so non-selective that it can even kill large trees and is destructive to wild and semi-natural habitats, and to biodiversity. The CEO of the Sustainable Food Trust, Patrick Holden, has said that a ban “could be the beginning of the end of herbicide use in agriculture as we know it, leading to a new chapter of innovation and diversity”. But industry officials warn of farmers in open revolt, environmental degradation and crops rotting in the fields if glyphosate is banned. Alarm at glyphosate’s ubiquity has grown since a 2015 study by the World Health Organisation’s IARC cancer agency found that it was “probably carcinogenic to humans”. More than a million people have petitioned Brussels for a moratorium. On Tuesday, MEPs will vote on a ban of the chemical by 2020 in a signal to the EU’s deadlocked expert committee, which is due to vote on a new lease the next day. Anca Paduraru, an EC spokeswoman, said that a decision was needed before 15 December or “for sure the European commission will be taken to court by Monsanto and other industry and agricultural trade representatives for failing to act. We have received letters from Monsanto and others saying this.” France is resisting a new 10-year licence. Spain is in favour. Germany is in coalition talks and likely to abstain. The UK would normally push for a new lease of the licence but is less engaged due to Brexit. There may not be a qualified majority for any outcome. A mooted French phase-out of glyphosate was “not realistic”, Paduraru said, although a shorter authorisation might be possible. Several famers’ associations have threatened lawsuits if the weedkiller is not given a new licence, while the NFU has warned it would entirely “change the way we farm”. Glyphosate is now so widely used in Europe that any ban would have radical consequences. Most herbicides sold in the UK are glyphosate-based and it is integral to the GM industry. The broad spectrum weedkiller makes up a quarter of global herbicide sales. It is mostly used on maize, cotton, soya bean, oilseed and sugar beet crops genetically engineered to resist it. Industry voices say that the no-tillage system encouraged by glyphosate reduces soil emissions and protects against more environmentally damaging alternative herbicides. Its desiccant qualities are highly convenient for farmers. A spokesman for the European Crop Protection Agency said: “The longer a crop remains in the ground to dry, the more chance there is that it is exposed to rain and wind and rots.” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s VP for corporate strategy, forecast “uproar in the agricultural community” and “a whole host of detrimental effects to crops in the fields” if glyphosate were phased out. “You would see increased costs for farming and decreased productivity, increased greenhouse gas emissions, loss of topsoil, loss of moisture,” he said. “There would be some significant reaction by farmers through Europe. They would be very upset that a very effective and safe tool had been taken out of their hands.” Renewal, though, would stoke fears among environmentalists of another decade of increasing toxic chemical use, threatening environmental safety, entrenched regulatory capture and public health. Monsanto insists Roundup is safe to use and points to various studies by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other national agencies that have deemed the product safe. In a Brussels hotel room, Teri McCall, in her new life as a campaigner, has come to lobby against renewal of the licence as she has no doubt that glyphosate causes cancer. After her late-husband, Jack, contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in 2015 she became one of 500 US plaintiffs suing Monsanto, claiming that exposure to its Roundup brand was responsible – a claim Monsanto denies. “Jack was a farmer since 1975,” says McCall. “For 40 years he used Roundup to keep the weeds down around his newly planted trees. He must have sprayed thousands of gallons of it. He believed it was safe.” Jack did not smoke or drink, exercised regularly and had no family history of cancer. After lumps appeared on his neck in July 2015, he was diagnosed with NHL aged 69. “It was an astonishingly swift illness,” McCall says. “I had no idea I was going to lose him. He just kept getting sicker and sicker.” On Christmas day in 2015, the family turned off his life support machine. Jack’s six-year-old dog Duke also died from the same type of cancer, McCall says. “He was a beautiful black labrador, the most gorgeous dog. He followed Jack around when he was spraying and was also exposed to a lot of Roundup.”However, Baskut Tuncak, the OHCHR’s special rapporteur on hazardous substances and wastes, says there are “serious questions” about glyphosate’s carcinogenicity, while its regulation evinces “a conflict of interest between politics and the pesticide industry”. “The chemical industry’s oligopoly has enormous power,” he said. “The pesticide industry has prevented reforms and has blocked the introduction of restrictions on the use of such products in various countries and globally.” While the EPA has judged glyphosate safe for public use, its methodology was challenged by several of its own scientific advisers last December. They noted an increased NHL risk of between 27-50% when epidemiological data that the EPA had disregarded was considered, sparking criticism of the agency. Numerous non-industry studies linking glyphosate exposure to tumour development have been ignored by the EPA and other regulators in favour of secret industry reports, conservationists say. Glyphosate is also tested by regulators in isolation, even though some research indicates that the surfactants it is mixed with in Roundup may increase its toxicity by a factor of up to 100. The copy and pasting of Monsanto studies into official reports by the European food safety authority (Efsa) has only added to campaigners’ concerns over revelations in the Monsanto papers, unsealed documents released in the US NHL lawsuit. On her deathbed, an award-winning EPA scientist, Marion Copley, wrote that the original findings of an EPA glyphosate review in 1983 made it “essentially certain that glyphosate causes cancer”. The question for many farmers is what could take its place. Glyphosate has reduced the need for more toxic alternative herbicides and also for deep tillage – or ploughing – which can be highly damaging to soil fertility. But its use has also been associated with an increase in farm size and monoculture systems. Environmentalists say that glyphosate is congruous with continuous arable cropping and an acceleration of the “pesticide treadmill”. Any benefits from a glyphosate ban would come too late for farmers such as Johnny Bob Barton, another non-smoker diagnosed with NHL after 40 years of manually spraying diluted Roundup, on his family farm. “We were farming a thousand acres of crops and we’d spray using a hose. By the end of the day, you would be saturated down to your pants, boots and socks,” he said. “I never had a choice to say no to this product. There was no warning. Now as a father I have to live with the fact that I exposed my sons to the same thing.” Monsanto, though, fiercely defends the safety of its product and points to the findings of several regulatory agencies, which dispute the IARC findings. “Glyphosate is the safest herbicide that has ever been invented,” Partridge said. “While my heart goes out to those suffering from cancer, there is no medical or scientific evidence whatsoever that links the exposure of glyphosate to cancer.” A report by Pesticide Action Network last week linked the broad spectrum herbicide to dramatic declines in earthworm populations and damaging soil microbial communities. The paper said its use also destroyed food sources for pollinators, and made crops more vulnerable to pathogens and disease. Dispensing with it would require “a significant redesign of our farming systems”, according to the sustainable food trust, which supports such a move. Shallow tilling at soil depths limited to 25cm has been shown to reduce weed density and improve long-term soil quality and biodiversity in some studies. Combined with greater crop diversity and rotation, crop rollers, and the use of green manure to raise nitrogen levels, conservationists say that crop yields, soil fertility and carbon storage could all be kept at levels close to today’s. One firm hoping to benefit from any glyphosate ban is Weedingtech, whose foam and hot water weed treatment is already being used by half of the UK’s water companies and several glyphosate-free councils, including Glastonbury, Hammersmith and Fulham, Southwark and Lewes. Leo de Montaignac, the firm’s CEO, says the estimated £940m cost to British farmers of a glyphosate ban should be weighed against the substantially higher cost of litigation and environmental and public health damage which may result from herbicide use. “Companies like ours are already optimising our technology for use in the agricultural sector and we aim to have a production machine for it available before the end of next year,” De Montaignac says. “There is a huge amount of scaremongering which says that viable alternatives are not available and it is simply not true.” • This article was amended on 24 October 2017.

However hi-tech or interventionist the eventual outcome, this conversation must always come first, and a doctor’s skill resides both in understanding the physical implications of the answers, and in intuiting any mental and emotional troubles that may lie beneath and between them. All life is here, as the long list of doctor-writers, from Avicenna to Chekhov, Bulgakov to Atul Guwande, have always known; Sam Guglani’s specific insight is to locate it in the idea of that first series of questions. Histories is, therefore, a novel, but a novel structured as a series of linked histories, where each chapter is told from the point of view of a different person – porter, nurse, chaplain, junior doctor, consultant oncologist (quite a few of the latter, perhaps because consultant oncologist is Guglani’s day job) – all working to keep the borderline-dysfunctional organism that is a hospital running smoothly. The action occurs over a single week, and after the bravura first chapter, which sets up Guglani’s main concerns in sentences which are economical, emotionally involving, insightful and rather beautiful, what drama there is happens largely off stage. In that first chapter, a couple come to see an oncologist. The man is a friend and colleague; he once met the woman at a party. It’s odd the pair have chosen him, as the encounter is neither impersonal nor neutral, but not that odd: it is common, says the narrator, for doctors to bend rules and let family and friends jump queues. It also instantly has everything at stake – and that is not just because the narrator is being asked to say whether the woman will live or die, nor because of the well-documented troubles of the NHS (which get barely a mention): what matters, here and throughout the book, turns out to be the idea of medicine itself, and the central challenge of how to practise it with compassion and with honour. Guglani is specifically interested in collisions between authority and trust: the trust given by patients in hope of a cure; the necessity of trust, in the professional relationship and in the doctor’s goodwill and intent to heal; the way in which trust – belief, even – is somehow a prerequisite for some kinds of healing to happen at all. And how easily that trust can be abused, not by anyone being actually misleading, although of course that does sometimes happen, but by what Guglani calls “the lie of confidence and certainty”. This is especially a lie because it works in two directions: towards the patient; and inwards, towards doctors themselves. He is fascinated by how quickly it is possible for health professionals to be sucked in by the idea that trust can only be gained by being seen to be sure; that doubt is the same as weakness. “He won’t ask for help,” thinks a junior doctor faced with an elderly patient who can’t sit up and may need intensive care. “He can’t. What would he say? That he can’t manage? How pathetic, how weak.” The junior doctor rallies, and turns out to be one of the more admirable people in the book, but it is at once clear how thin the line is between honesty and the “doctor swagger” so often mistaken for strength by the insecure and the vain. “Weak men like him,” as a female oncologist thinks, watching an older colleague sleep on a train, “everywhere in medicine, men in positions of power, fragile men, desperate for something, something owed.” Histories is, in some ways, an extended meditation on power and humility; and on how central empathy is to achieving the latter, while also understanding how impossible the requirement for empathy can feel in the face of relentless sadness and trouble. “How difficult, already,” as a newly promoted consultant puts it, “difficult just to be kind”. Guglani can sound too sweepingly disenchanted by “medicine’s repeating follies”, so disgusted by “all the melodrama of saving life but never valuing it” that he risks writing sections of the profession off, which strikes me as risking a different and equally suspect form of certainty. He is also too prone to romanticise those lower down the hospital’s food chain, such as the porter who watches the ward rounds and hears the doctors talk: “Did you take a good history? Like it’s something you can take. Passing them sometimes, I catch the things they say to patients and I’m amazed they get any history at all.” There is also the hairdresser who watches their smooth arrogances and thinks she could teach them to pay proper attention. At its best Histories is a luminous argument for truly seeing and listening to others and to ourselves; it is a serious tilt at working out what matters, honed in places where people are tested by such questions every day. • Histories is published by Riverrun.

It will destroy al-Shabaab","bodyText":"At 3.20 on the afternoon of Saturday 14 October, al-Shabaab detonated a massive truck bomb at a busy junction on the road into Mogadishu, known as KM5. The truck, which had been driven in from the outskirts of the city that day, was packed with 400kg of mixed explosives, including military-grade but also the homemade-from-fertiliser type. The truck had been spotted by security forces at a checkpoint but had crashed through the barrier and sped along the road to KM5. The area is always busy, jammed with hotels and shops, but at that time it was genuinely bustling; school had finished and it was just before afternoon prayers. The truck bomb went off beside a fuel tanker and the resultant carnage flattened the area for hundreds of metres around. But you wouldn’t know it now, as the reconstruction effort has moved apace to erase signs of the atrocity. In the attack, 358 men, women and children died and hundreds were injured. An estimated 56 are missing and we will probably never know the exact figures, as some bodies completely disintegrated. About an hour later a car bomb went off in another part of the city. The driver had already been detained by the Somali security forces when that device detonated but he quickly confirmed what everyone knew in their hearts: this was the work of al-Shabaab, and he had been due to rendezvous with the truck bomb elsewhere in Mogadishu, where he would have used the car explosion to blast a way through for the bigger truck attack. Al-Shabaab has been silent, perhaps stunned by their own handiwork. It’s likely that they are worried about how this atrocity will damage them in the few pockets of support they still have in Somalia. Al-Shabaab’s silence has also allowed the Somali rumour mill to churn. For example, some say the bomber sought revenge for a recent incident in Bariire town in Lower Shabelle – a falsehood adding to another falsehood. In that incident, a group of armed men moving at night to attack a rival clan stumbled upon a Somali Special Forces patrol. There is no proven connection between the incidents. It suits al-Shabaab’s purposes to drop in poisonous lies here and there to distract from what everyone knows to be true, that they were behind this atrocity. The people – and the media – must restrain themselves and not spread disinformation. There are other things we should focus on. We have been inspired by the popular response. The president, the prime minister, many ministers and the mayor of Mogadishu donated blood that evening and tweeted a call for others to do the same: so many came that the football stadium had to be used to allow the hospitals to continue to treat the injured. An online civil society coordination effort called #Gurmad252, as well as the free service Aamin Ambulances, and others, made a major difference. The doctors and nurses in the city’s hospitals are heroes, but the city needs a proper emergency service: not just ambulances but also a blood bank. The airport has never been busier. Local airlines waived cargo fees to get vital medical supplies into the city and our international partners have flown doctors and medical supplies in and the critically injured out for specialised treatment. Moral support has been forthcoming too, with the mayors of Paris, Kuala Lumpur and Toronto – cities that also know terrorism all too well – standing beside Mogadishu. It’s common for people to rage on social media that the mainstream media is fickle and west-obsessed: but Mogadishu was on the front pages and the messages of sympathy flooded in. The President of Somalia declared three days of national mourning. Now these have passed, and we are still treating the injured, burying the dead and trying to identify the missing. The focus of the international media has moved on, as is inevitable. Now Somalia must make a choice. Somalis are resilient against violent extremism. But this is different. This is not just “another bomb goes off in Mogadishu”. Even one of the founders of al-Shabaab, Abu Mansur Mukhtar Robow – who rejected the group and is now cooperating with the government – donated blood. He himself split with the group after a similar attack on graduating medical students, sickened by the mendacity of an organisation that claims to defend Somali Muslims, but which slaughters the children of the nation. There was a small protest that day after the attack – a few hundred people. Many were still mourning and security was tightened for fear of a follow-up attack. The protest on Wednesday was much bigger, into the thousands. The fight must go on, in everything we do, from reporting anything suspicious to the security forces to educating our boys and girls so they are not vulnerable to the violent, alien ideology of al-Shabaab. In the past the people of Mogadishu have often been reticent about speaking out, afraid of reprisals from al-Shabaab sympathisers hidden in their communities. It is different this time. It is everyone’s trouble. Everyone in the city has lost someone or knows someone who was injured. We are not asking for more money or more weapons or more advisers or more equipment, even though we will need all of that if we are to rebuild our country. The Somalis need to put aside their many, many differences, and stand as one against al-Shabaab. We are asking for unity. This is not just another bomb going off in Mogadishu. This is the bomb that will destroy al-Shabaab."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/01/talking-to-my-sister-about-racism-people-your-age-seem-so-much-more-aware","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-01T14:20:45Z","webTitle":"Talking to my sister about racism: 'People your age seem so much more aware'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/01/talking-to-my-sister-about-racism-people-your-age-seem-so-much-more-aware","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/01/talking-to-my-sister-about-racism-people-your-age-seem-so-much-more-aware","fields":{"headline":"Talking to my sister about racism: 'People your age seem so much more aware'","bodyText":"When my younger sister Fizzy tells me about her experiences of racism as a student, they’re both familiar and strange. It’s been six years since I graduated from the University of Cambridge, where I tended to explain racism away. It just seemed a part of life at the archaic institution – which was recently criticised for its lack of diversity by MP David Lammy. My sister, who studies at Southampton, a newer university, has also experienced racism. She has encountered people who have openly used racist language, and is often asked to speak for Muslims or people of colour. Fizzy responds to racism differently than I did. She has moved into a house with all non-white housemates in her second year, for example. Meanwhile, I never had a choice to be anything but a minority; I had one black friend at university and he graduated the year after I arrived. Most of my white friends lived in all white houses at university – and we thought little of it. Prejudice at university was something I didn’t start exploring until long after I’d left. When I was at Cambridge, it was students in white tie who’d make the headlines, getting pissed and smashing things up. Today, it’s students of colour, such as Lola Olufemi and Jason Osamede, who have been targeted for protesting against white privilege, or wanting to “decolonise” an overly white and male curriculum in their posts as minority officers. Back then I lacked the political awareness to frame my experiences. But my sister, 21 years old and immersed in a world of ongoing political debate on social media, knows exactly what’s happening to her. I can’t work out which is worse. We speak intimately and at length when I visit, to try to understand what it is about university that can make it such an isolating place for people of colour. Fizzy Noor: So you just pretended racism didn’t exist when you were at uni? Poppy Noor: Hey, don’t be so harsh on me! I knew something was up – I felt upset, isolated. But racism was normalised. I mean, the most common thing was boys saying: “I don’t like brown girls, it’s just a preference.” FN: What gets me is, how can you not know that’s racism? That’s textbook racism. Not liking a whole range of women based on the colour of their skin. PN: It’s confusing – understanding why people who are supposed to like you are saying these horrible things. They’re not flushing your head down the toilet when they say it, they’re doing it while going to parties with you and giving you hugs. FN: Yeah, that’s still how it happens now. No one feels embarrassed to say it. I reckon racism is more a thing at uni than at home. The first time it happened here, we were in a big group and people started calling me “Paki” for a drinking game. I didn’t know what to do – I messaged you straight away. PN: That hurt for me to hear about. But when I was growing up, people called me that all the time. FN: When I was younger people said nasty racist stuff to me but it was so abnormal that people would be stunned. At uni they say, “Oh it’s just a joke, he didn’t mean it in a racist way”. PN: Some people say something so openly and casually and others don’t intervene. You feel like it’s you who’s in the wrong for questioning it – that makes it harder to call out. Why do people want to be racist at university? FN: Edginess… that sounds weird and immature but it’s actually a thing. Fizzy’s friend Masala Isely-Rice (an American student of dual black and white heritage) chips in. Masala: I think it’s tribalism. It’s harder to accept the multiplicities of different people than to say, “This is what black people are like,” right? FN: It’s group mentality. Part of being the powerful majority at uni sort of relies on kicking the minority down. Masala: Well, oppression can seem quite glorified, if you take the oppression part out of it … Succeeding when you’re not supposed to succeed – if you’re at uni and you’re not white you’ve sort of done that. FN: There are layers - wealth privilege, race privilege. But while you can be poor and white, you’ll never be poor because you are white. PN: A lot of people don’t understand what racism is. They don’t see that not seeing someone as an equal is what saying “I don’t like brown girls” means. They think you have to literally hate someone, and be intending to be horrible, to be racist. I understand no-one wants to be told off for what they didn’t mean to do, or told they can’t be part of the conversation. FN: But it’s not that they can’t be part of the conversation. It’s about not centring yourself in the conversation. Just because you’ve read about racism doesn’t make you more qualified to speak about it than me. PN: Did you see the thing about decolonising the curriculum? Uni is this intellectual institution that’s supposed to be making us smarter. So if you only learn from western philosophers, this is subtly telling you that, white culture is intellectual, rational, almost superior. As if people of colour (POC) haven’t been philosophising too. It almost frames it as if whiteness is logical, all else is too emotional. FN: Yes. That thing of, “your personal experience doesn’t trump stats”. You feel like you can’t speak anymore unless you’re on Google pulling the stats out. I have friends who believe Nazis should have freedom of speech… they’ll say, they’re not actually killing you, as if you’re being irrational. The most important thing to them is being able to say what they want, but that’s a luxury to me: If someone wants me dead because of the colour of my skin, I’m not safe - and that’s the most important thing. PN: Yeah, I feel like white supremacy was often intellectualised when I was at uni. I watched Hotel Rwanda with a friend when learning about the genocide. At the end he said, “You’d never find white people running around with machetes in a jungle killing each other like that.” We spoke about the holocaust and of course the fact that people both white and non-white have killed and committed genocide. He said, “That’s different, that was strategic…” It was stupid of him to say, but it goes back to that old, colonial form of racism that views non-white people as hot-headed and biologically different. Like Nazism can be described as something other than violent, other than emotional, but your reaction to it is seen as overly emotional or aggressive. FN: Recently friends spoke about Islam’s so-called colonisation of the UK. One said, did you know that 28% of people born in the UK aren’t even British. PN: How can you be born here and not be British? FN: Well he said “they’re not really British” and when asked if that meant white, he said, “well, yeah”. PN: How does that make you feel? FN: Isolated. People will talk about extremism like all Muslims are bad. But if I mention the injustices of white people, they will say it’s a vocal minority. But Isis is genuinely a vocal minority – they’re terrorists. PN: Are you ever personally targeted? FN: People quiz me like I’m their test subject. I was eating a full English recently and friends said, “You’re Muslim, you’re not supposed to do that!” I’m sure it wasn’t their intention, but I felt singled out. People don’t say stupid things like, “You’re Christian, you’re not supposed to wear mixed cotton!” White people have religions and people don’t assume they subscribe to it so strictly. But as a Muslim you’re asked why you drink or don’t have a beard. They don’t see that I am just a normal 20-year-old student like them. PN: Does living in a non-white house make a difference? FN: Yes. I had to make more of an effort to find a more diverse group of friends. It gets exhausting, hanging around people and they think that because you’re brown you always have to be the ambassador. Yeah I care about race issues, but it’s not my entire being. PN: There was a recent study showing how segregated UK universities are. Everyone was philosophising over what the reason was – is it personal safety? FN: When I was at school, all my non-white friends wanted to go to Leicester. They didn’t want to be outnumbered. I sort of see why now. I feel very aware of my brownness when I hang out with my white friends and that can be a chore. Sometimes you feel like you can’t have a normal conversation anymore. Recently we were discussing TV shows and I said I’ve been watching Dear White People. Straight away people were in my face saying “that show is oppressive to white people”. I felt like I didn’t want to have a discussion about race right now. PN: Is it ever about more than just wanting to relax? FN: Sometimes it is safety. People say things that are emotionally and mentally hard to deal with. There was a joke in the group of saying “fuck the yellows” – by which they meant people of Chinese origin. I know it’s not their intention, but those jokes just remind me that I’m the minority and not to step out of line. PN: I find it so crazy that it’s still OK to say this stuff. I have tried to tell people about how it was for me, but because I went to Cambridge people would say, course it was racist there, it’s not like that elsewhere. Masala: I go to university in Colarado in a supposedly really liberal town. My high school was out-and-out racist but this is sort of worse. People think they’re really open-minded, they’ll say “I don’t see colour” – so you can’t tell them about racism at all. PN: It is everywhere! I visited friends in Manchester and people said “Paki shop”. In Norwich people would say about friends, “She has a big black boyfriend!” and everybody would laugh. FN: Was any of it different at Cambridge? PN: One thing is how I was approached by officials. Being chased through the gates being asked if I went there. I think there’s a thing in this country where we tend to always think of race issues as class issues. At Oxbridge it was partly class: I wore tracksuits and that’s not so common there. But it’s well documented that students of colour are frequently questioned by officials about whether they’re students, when their white counterparts aren’t. FN: Was it the prestige? PN: Sometimes I felt like people wanted me to be grateful – they were saying look, people like you don’t normally get to come to places like this. And I completely bought it, man. I thought, “I must have got in because of the quotas!” FN: Man, that’s hard. PN: Sometimes I wonder whether it’s harder for you though, because people your age seem so much more aware now. FN: Do you not think that uni is a time when you become more political anyway? PN: I think the way young people engage in politics has changed. When I was your age, most people on social media were just stalking each other. If you were interested in politics, you almost had quite a conventional view because you sought it out, from teachers, from newspapers, from philosophers. Now young people are arguing about politics all the time on social media. Cultural appropriation. Class fetishism. Race fetishism. I feel like you know so much more about your own oppression that it must be hard to look it in the face. FN: It can be so frustrating, knowing what’s going on but not being able to say it. It’s a battle to feel heard and people will always call me angry. They’ll say, it’s just because you’re brown that you believe this stuff exists. But it’s hypocritical. If you say “of course you think that, you’re white”, you’re ridiculed. But now that I’m in a group that isn’t majority white, things are quite different. PN: What about people who say, that’s dangerous, you’re in an echo chamber? When I was at uni I just had to learn to deal with it, which is sort of how it is in the real world too. FN: Obviously it’s easier for me now to live in an echo chamber. But people here see where I’m coming from. They can relate because perhaps they’ve been through something similar themselves. PN: So you’re happier now? FN: Yeah, and I don’t even have to pretend racism doesn’t exist like you did. This article has been amended to clarify the meaning of two quotes.

Another winner in the 2017 Whitsundays Tourism awards, held last month at Hamilton Island with Adani as a silver sponsor, threatened to quit the organisation unless it cut ties with the miner. The Guardian understands the north Queensland tourism body, after a board meeting last week, has effectively ruled out future involvement with the proponent of Australia’s largest coalmine. Lindsay Simpson, whose Providence Sailing business won a tour and transport operators’ prize, said it was an “appalling” decision to enlist Adani, whose backing of reef tourism awards was “just laughable”. “We’d been overseas in Europe and we actually had our skipper go and collect the award as our representative, in good faith,” she told the Guardian. “We heard then that Adani was sponsoring it, so we did some serious thinking. We came to the decision that we don’t want their award, if that’s who they’ve got sponsoring it. “We thought, if we don’t say something, it’s going to be accepted that someone who’s singlehandedly destroying everything that we stand for is going to be backing tourism awards, which is just laughable.” Many Whitsundays reef tour operators were outraged by Adani’s now-abandoned plans to dump dredged seabed in reef waters while expanding its Abbot Point coal terminal, just 100km north of Airlie Beach. In 2014 the plans were changed so that the spoil would be dumped in wetlands in the Caley Valley. Margaret Lawson, a public relations expert who acts for resource companies, said the awards debacle was “not a good look” for Adani, and could set a precedent for other community organisations to spurn financial backing from the controversial company. Adani paid a modest $2,000 to be a second tier sponsor at the awards night on 30 September. Simpson said she had great respect for the tourism peak body but Adani was “buying their reputation”. In a letter formally rejecting the award last week, Simpson told the body that “we cannot, in all fairness, accept an award sponsored by a Adani, a company whose modus operandi is completely counter-productive to all that we stand for as tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef”. Another gold medal award-winning operator told Tourism Whitsundays it would quit if Adani was again named as a sponsor. A third award-winning operator, who asked not to be named, said there were “a lot of other people” shocked about Adani’s role when it was read out at as a sponsor towards the end of the event. “There was definitely a bit of a gasp when Adani’s name was said,” she said. “I personally was taken aback and there were definitely a lot of people around us who felt the same thing.” Lawson, a prominent Brisbane public relations firm owner, said Adani would have a “stakeholder engagement plan” from “top tier sponsorships right down to local sporting teams” but evidently suffered from a “reputation problem”. “The rationale of sponsoring something like a tourism awards event is to demonstrate your corporate social responsibility credentials,” Lawson said. “When people don’t even want to take your money for worthy causes, that indicates a PR problem. “And given the protest action that took place that a couple of weekends ago around the country, it will be interesting to see if that non-acceptance of Adani dollars cascades right down to those small local community organisations. “If you see a big event like the tourism awards set a precedent by saying they won’t accept Adani dollars, that could be creating a landslide of organisations that say they won’t accept money from Adani. “That could provide them with a lot of problems in trying to execute their community engagement strategy.” Simpson conceded she might be precisely the wrong person to be given an award at an event with Adani backing. She travelled to India in March with the chairman of Australian Conservation Foundation, Geoff Cousins, in a delegation that delivered a letter of protest to Adani and confronted the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, over her public support for the Carmichael mine. The chief executive of Tourism Whitsundays, Craig Turner, did not return calls. An Adani spokesman did not respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/23/dr-martens-big-in-japan-worldwide-sales-dm","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T11:18:44Z","webTitle":"Dr Martens gets big in Japan (and bigger worldwide to boot)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/23/dr-martens-big-in-japan-worldwide-sales-dm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/23/dr-martens-big-in-japan-worldwide-sales-dm","fields":{"headline":"Dr Martens gets big in Japan (and bigger worldwide to boot)","bodyText":"Demand for Dr Martens boots is booming, helped by a craze in Asia and new, lighter versions of the traditional yellow-stitched boots. The company, which is now owned by private equity firm Permira, opened 18 stores last year, including two in Japan and one at Camden Stables in north London. It plans to open a further 20 to 25 shops this year in Japan, continental Europe, the UK and the US. Dr Martens said revenue rose by a quarter to £291m in the year to 31 March. The firm sells about 6m pairs of shoes a year, most of which are manufactured outside of the UK, although 60,000 are still made at its original factory in Northamptonshire. Last year the company also sold 200,000 pairs of its new DM’s Lite , a range modelled on lighter “athleisure” soles but which resemble the traditional Doc welted black or oxblood boots with yellow stitching. The firm has also introduced new colours and patterns such as floral prints. Jon Mortimore, the chief financial officer, said DM’s Lite appealed to “customers who wore Dr Martens when they were a kid or teenager, but they are also appealing a lot to younger consumers who’ve been brought up on lighter trainers or shoes”. Dr Martens is expanding particularly in Japan and South Korea. He added: “Japan is going very well for us. Tokyo can be seen as a global fashion hub.” Dr Martens eight-hole Airwair boots were launched in 1960 and soon became popular with skinheads, goths and punks. Another early adopter was Pete Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who. The boots had a revival recently, helped by endorsement from celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Ellie Goulding, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams and David Beckham. Mortimore said Permira, which bought the business in 2013, was turning it from a family-run company into a global brand, and moving away from wholesale towards retail – opening more of its own shops and selling online. Dr Martens is looking for a new CEO after Steve Murray stepped down this month after three years in the job. The chairman and former boss of Asda and Matalan, Paul Mason, will run the business in the interim. The company, founded by the Griggs family in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, has been making work boots since 1901. It licensed the Dr Martens boot from Munich-based Dr Klaus Maertens, a young soldier who developed the air-cushioned sole while convalescing from a broken foot. Dr Martens said retail revenues were up 38% to £78.9m while online income jumped 54% to £32.4m. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew 27% to £37.5m. Never out of fashion So, Dr Martens boots, long associated with punk, the working class and an overall sense of outsider rebellion, have become so mainstream that global sales are up 25%. In reality the thick-soled, sturdy leather upper boots have rarely been out of fashion. In 2012, Marc Jacobs put his models in heavy DM-style military boots. In 2015, Alexander McQueen paired his heavy soled boots with military pieces. Calvin Klein and Coach have rolled out similar versions, while Perry Ellis put Helena Christensen in real DMs, paired with a dress, on the catwalk in the 90s. Their popularity is linked to who is wearing them. Just this week, Kourtney Kardashian was in a pair of eight hole boots. The other week, it was Gigi Hadid. And this is part of their appeal. Dr Marten’s are the de facto sartorial passport to subculture – wear them, and you automatically look cooler than you are. They are a universally democratic piece of wardrobe kit. Rich people wear them with skirts just as punks wear them for life. In the past 50 years they have been part of a postie’s uniform, worn by Neo-Nazis and now by Instagram stars. Though the sales figure is impressive, it’s not entirely a result of fashion. Dr Martens are built to last so if you buy one pair, you’re unlikely to buy another. It is the recently launched DM Lites that are the most tangible reason for their current success. Traditional Dr Martens require a lengthy break-in period whereas the soft-leather Lite versions are comfortable the moment they come out of the box. Still, combined with a sudden uptake in Asia and, well, the ongoing, all-powerful Hadid-effect, it’s likely Dr Martens will be in fashion for years to come.

We knew that many women and girls were being targeted for rape and other sexualised violence, but we didn’t know much about what was happening to men and boys. Drawing on a few existing reports, I assumed some boys were being victimised, as well as some men in detention centres, but that sexual violence against males was not common. I worried that few refugees would have heard of any accounts and that they wouldn’t talk to me about such a taboo topic anyway. I couldn’t have been more wrong. In October 2016, I landed in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, where more than 200,000 Syrian refugees had fled. The UNHCR arranged for a translator and discussions with refugees at a nearby camp. I met with the first group, eight Syrian men who had fled the war. I asked them about their lives in the camp, how they were getting by, and what their main concerns were. Once we had established some rapport, I tentatively probed whether they had heard of any reports of sexual violence against men or boys in Syria. They looked at me incredulously, as if they couldn’t believe that I was asking such a basic question, saying: “Yes, of course. It is everywhere. It is happening [from] all sides.” I was surprised at their response and their candour. I was also sceptical: rumours are rampant in war zones. Had they heard any accounts from someone they knew personally? Again, resounding replies of “yes” from the men. As I met with more and more refugees – almost 200 across Iraqi Kurdistan, Jordan and Lebanon – I received similar responses, and was inundated with heartbreaking stories. In Lebanon, a Palestinian man who had lived his entire life in Syria asked to speak with me after the group discussion. He told me how armed men had entered his village and raped him. The experience had left him devastated, and he was too emotionally distraught to work, even though he had to care for his younger sister. In Jordan, one young Syrian man told me about his uncle, who had been randomly detained. While in detention, his captors sexually tortured him. After his release, he stopped eating and became an alcoholic, dying from liver failure soon after. A number of women described how men changed after these experiences – isolating themselves, no longer interested in sex, and at times becoming violent. Some were not able to work because of the physical and mental impact of the violence, putting their families at risk of poverty. I met one man who suffered from painful and debilitating injuries as a result of sexual torture, and a few aid workers said anal injuries were not uncommon for men who had been detained. The accounts were heart-rending and horrific. They were also abundant. At a large refugee camp in Jordan, I met a group of women who were eager to talk about the issue. According to them, men and boys are routinely sexually abused during detention in Syria, a comment echoed by other refugees, and scores of men had been detained by different armed groups. I asked them to guesstimate how many men in the camp had undergone sexual violence while in detention. They said, “Between 30% and 40%. We cannot think of any family who doesn’t have someone [who was detained and sexually abused].” Other refugees told me how armed groups would conduct raids on homes, during which “they raped everyone” – both women and men. I heard that phrase a number of times from refugees across the three countries. People said that after having fled to neighbouring countries, some younger boys were being sexually victimised by older boys and men, who lured them with promises of food or money. A few women said that their sons were too scared to go to school, afraid of being sexually assaulted on the way or at the school by their peers. What surprised me most were accounts of sexual exploitation at work. An 18-year-old Syrian man who was working two jobs was the first person to tell me about it. He described how his boss demanded sexual favours before paying his wages. He felt he couldn’t refuse because he had to care for his mother and two sisters; his despair and shame were palpable. It was a story I would hear from other refugee men and boys, many of whom were working without a legal permit. Faced with grinding poverty, diminishing aid and intense pressures to provide for their families, they felt they had no choice but to submit. I also met with a group of gay and transgender refugees who faced the double stigma of being both refugees and sexual and gender minorities. One gay man told me how, in Syria, he had been detained for four months, during which he and other male detainees were raped anally with sticks and bottles. He still experiences pain when sitting. He had fled to a neighbouring country, but didn’t find safety there. He was again sexually assaulted by a local gang as well as by a security guard. He knew he was still at risk. Other members of the group shared disturbing accounts of sexual assault by taxi drivers, neighbours, landlords and military personnel. They were too afraid to report these to the police, who could assault them again, or even arrest them under laws addressing “public morality” or “unnatural practices”. In Jordan I met a group of psychotherapists who specialised in treating torture survivors, and asked them why sexual torture was being used in this conflict. They said torture was designed to inflict deep psychological pain that disrupts one’s sense of self. In places such as Syria, where same-sex sexual activity is strictly forbidden and traditional gender roles are entrenched, the use of sexualised torture against men and boys is unsurprising. Studies from other wars where sexual violence was documented – such as in Liberia, northern Uganda and the former Yugoslavia – also show that men and boys are targeted for a range of sexualised violence. Wartime sexual violence is a complex issue, but it can also be a very effective way to humiliate, terrorise and subjugate women and men. And though women and girls are the main victims during conflict and displacement – with an estimated one out of five forcibly displaced women having suffered sexual violence, and this is likely to be an underestimate – it doesn’t mean the number of male survivors is small. For example, a 2010 study in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo found that almost one-quarter of men in selected conflict-affected territories had experienced sexual violence: an estimated 760,000 men. LGBTI people are particularly at risk of sexual violence in detention and as refugees. The good news is that some humanitarian organisations are beginning to recognise the issue and are providing basic services for male survivors. But much more is needed to prevent this violence and to provide support and care to the men and boys who have been sexually victimised. This work should complement and, where possible, reinforce, programmes for women and girls, who bear the brunt of sexual violence and who face myriad forms of violence, discrimination, and subjugation. In our report we ask for improved advocacy and staffing, and more data. But we also ask donors to fund desperately needed programmes in this area. Key to preventing and responding to sexual violence against men and boys is raising awareness, sensitising aid personnel, and working with communities to establish targeted programmes. This cannot be achieved without funding. Money for programmes addressing violence against women and girls is already scarce, and additional targeted funding for men, boys, and sexual and gender minorities is needed. The US is one of the few donor governments that has provided funding to address sexual violence against men and boys in humanitarian settings. The Trump administration has proposed steep cuts to the 2018 international affairs budget, which would impact overseas development aid and support for UN agencies. This would be devastating not just for Syrians, but for the 65 million people worldwide grappling with the horrors of war, disaster and displacement – and, in some cases, sexual violence. The cuts would be catastrophic for smaller and often local organisations, which provide life-saving services in dangerous settings where few if any international humanitarian agencies operate. Most of the organisations providing care to male sexual violence survivors in the areas I visited were local women’s, LGBTI and human rights groups, many of which relied on funding from the UN and other international agencies supported by the US government. Stories of the refugees I met remind us that the proposed cuts would affect the life chances of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. These men and boys – like all those surviving war and disaster – deserve and have a right to protection, support and good quality care. • Sarah Chynoweth wrote the UNHCR-commissioned report We Keep It in Our Hearts: Sexual Violence Against Men and Boys in the Syria Crisis"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"music/2017/oct/25/marilyn-manson-bassist-twiggy-ramirez-jessicka-addams-scott-putesky","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T13:14:42Z","webTitle":"Marilyn Manson bassist Twiggy Ramirez splits from band after rape allegation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/25/marilyn-manson-bassist-twiggy-ramirez-jessicka-addams-scott-putesky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/25/marilyn-manson-bassist-twiggy-ramirez-jessicka-addams-scott-putesky","fields":{"headline":"Marilyn Manson bassist Twiggy Ramirez splits from band after rape allegation","bodyText":"Twiggy Ramirez, who has played bass for Marilyn Manson for 25 years, has split with his band after being accused of rape. Jessicka Addams, lead singer of the band Jack Off Jill, made the accusations in a post on Facebook earlier this week. She and Ramirez, whose real name is Jeordie White, dated each other for a period in the 1990s, before the relationship soured and the incident in question is alleged to have taken place. As well as claims of repeated domestic violence, Addams recalls a time where “he forced me on to the floor with his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said NO … I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved.” Manson wrote in a statement: “I have decided to part ways with Jeordie White as a member of Marilyn Manson. He will be replaced for the upcoming tour. I wish him well.” He added on Instagram: “This is a sad day.” In a statement immediately following the allegations, he wrote: “I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka’s obvious distress.” Ramirez did not feature on Manson’s new LP Heaven Upside Down but co-wrote a number of his most successful albums, and was still a touring member of his band. He has not commented on the accusations and his management did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, but he put out a statement on leaving the band, saying: “I wish to spend this time with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety.” Meanwhile, Manson’s former guitarist Scott Putesky, who also played in Jack Off Jill and was known on stage as Daisy Berkowitz, has died from colon cancer after first undergoing treatment for it in 2013. Putseky played on Manson’s first two albums, Portrait of an American Family and Smells Like Children, before, in his words, “being slowly muscled out” ahead of the hit Antichrist Superstar LP in 1996. Manson is currently recovering from injuries sustained after a stage prop fell on him during a live performance in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/xi-jinping-mao-thought-on-socialism-china-constitution","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T09:06:03Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping becomes most powerful leader since Mao with China's change to constitution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/xi-jinping-mao-thought-on-socialism-china-constitution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/xi-jinping-mao-thought-on-socialism-china-constitution","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping becomes most powerful leader since Mao with China's change to constitution","bodyText":"Xi Jinping has been consecrated as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong after a new body of political thought carrying his name was added to the Communist party’s constitution. The symbolic move came on the final day of a week-long political summit in Beijing – the 19th party congress – at which Xi has pledged to lead the world’s second largest economy into a “new era” of international power and influence. At a closing ceremony in the Mao-era Great Hall of the People on Tuesday it was announced that Xi’s Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era had been written into the party charter. “The congress unanimously agrees that Xi Jinping Thought … shall constitute [one of] the guides to action of the party in the party constitution,” a party resolution stated. In a brief address to more than 2,200 delegates, Xi said: “Today we, more than 1.3bn Chinese people, live in jubilation and dignity. Our land ... radiates with enormous dynamism. Our Chinese civilisation shines with lasting splendour and glamour.” “Our party shows strong, firm and vibrant leadership. Our socialist system demonstrates great strength and vitality. The Chinese people and the Chinese nation embrace brilliant prospects,” Xi added. Some see the historic decision to enshrine Xi’s concept as a clear hint that he will seek to remain in power beyond the end of his second - and supposedly last - five-year term, in 2022. An even clearer indication of whether he is set on staying in power should come on Wednesday morning when Xi introduces China’s new top ruling council, the politburo standing committee, during a fiercely choreographed piece of political theatre that signals the start of his second term. If the committee’s line-up - which is almost certain to be made up of seven men - includes no obvious successor, that would represent further proof that Xi plans to rule at least until 2027 and possibly beyond. Since the Communist party of China was founded in 1921, only one leader, Mao himself, has been honoured in such a way while still alive, in his case with a political philosophy called Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China’s economic opening, also boasts a school of eponymous ideology in the party charter, Deng Xiaoping Theory, but that was included only after his death in 1997. Bill Bishop, the publisher of the Sinocism newsletter on Chinese politics, said the birth of Xi Jinping Thought confirmed the rare levels of power and prestige enjoyed by its creator. “It means Xi is effectively unassailable … If you challenge Xi, you are challenging the party – and you never want to be against the party.” Jude Blanchette, an expert in Chinese politics from New York’s Conference Board research group, said: “This is about amassing power and credibility and legitimacy and authority within the system to drive through more effectively what he sees as the right path for China. “If you tower above the party, then it is very difficult for anyone below you to decide they don’t want to implement your commands.” Writing in the Financial Times, Australia’s former prime minister Kevin Rudd said the fanfare around China’s leader suggested Xi, who took power in 2012 and had been expected to step down in 2022, would in fact rule well into the next decade. “Five years ago I said he would be China’s most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping. I was wrong. He is now China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong,” Rudd wrote. However, Susan Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, disputed the portrayal of Xi as an almighty Mao-like figure. “He’s ruling differently, for sure, and people are intimidated by him because of the anti-corruption campaign.” But Shirk said she was reserving judgment on whether Xi was attempting “a real dictatorial play” until the new line-up of China’s top ruling council, the politburo standing committee, was announced on Wednesday. If that committee included at least one of three possible successors – Hu Chunhua, Chen Min’er or Zhang Qingwei – that would signal Xi’s intention to step down in 2022, she said. If no clear successor emerged, however, it would fuel fears that Xi was “going for broke, all-out to be a dictator” and planned to remain in power indefinitely. “I’m prepared to call him a dictator after that. But I am waiting to see,” said Shirk, US deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton. Were Xi to stay in office beyond the anticipated decade, he would be the first leader to do so since Deng Xiaoping. According to unwritten leadership rules introduced in the 1990s to ensure orderly power transitions, the party’s general secretary should serve for no more than 10 years. “The idea that Xi Jinping retires in five years is incredibly unlikely,” said Blanchette. Xi has been the focus of a chorus of songs of praise since the congress began last week. Chen Quanguo, the party chief of Xinjiang, hailed his leader’s teachings as “intellectually incisive, visionary and magnificent”. Jilin province’s party boss, Bayanqolu, went even further. “General Secretary Xi Jinping is … the party’s helmsman,” he gushed, deploying a term famously used to hail Mao. Blanchette said such displays of loyalty were “a striking indication of just how singular the party is under Xi”. He added: “We are not at the point, like in the Cultural Revolution, where mangoes that Mao Zedong touched are worshipped. But we are certainly seeing a movement towards a new type of politics … one that is borrowing heavily from [the Mao era].” Bishop said two factors explained Xi’s emergence as one of the most dominant figures in modern Chinese history. One was the 64-year-old’s own ambition. “Xi is sort of a Chinese Machiavelli”, who grew up in a revolutionary family hearing tales of Mao’s legendary political manoeuvrings. “A lot of that stuff must have sunk in,” Bishop said. But Xi’s rise also reflected a broader consensus within the party that a strongman was needed to help China avoid a Soviet-style collapse. In 2012, on the eve of Xi taking power, Bishop said there had been a sense among China’s political elites that “if Xi didn’t clear things up, then the place was going to implode and the Communist party was done”. Back then, a common refrain was: “Xi is our last hope.” On Tuesday, Xi pitched himself as the leader of a “sacred” mission to restore China to its rightful place in the world. “Living in such a great era, we are all the more confident and proud, and also feel the heavy weight of responsibility upon us,” he said. “We must have the courage and resolve to build on the historic achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communists generation after generation, create new accomplishments befitting this great epoch and stride forward to an ever promising future.” In a triumphalist editorial published shortly after Xi’s closing address, the party’s official news agency, Xinhua, said the advent of Xi Thought underlined how China was now rising “like never before”. “China is set to regain its might and re-ascend to the top of the world,” it boasted. “Those expecting China to fall will be disappointed. Finger pointing and questioning the legitimacy of the Chinese way are of no avail. It is time to understand China’s path, because it appears it will continue to triumph.” Outside the Great Hall of the People, delegates and members of the public gave Xi’s elevation the thumbs up. “It’s very exciting. We really need a new guide for a new era,” said Li Wanjun, a delegate from the north-eastern province of Jilin. Lin Xingyuan, a 35-year-old IT worker who was queuing to enter Tiananmen Square, agreed. “It’s very inspiring,” he said, before being cut off by a green-clad member of the Communist party’s People’s Armed Police force who said interviews were forbidden in the area.

This video and text post was “sponsored” – that is, someone from the prime minister’s office paid to promote the post as an advertisement. A few days later, the activist group GetUp posted a video criticising the new energy policy and also paid money to turn it into an ad. They appear to have targeted their video more broadly, limiting it to people over 18 and living in Australia. Normally it’s very difficult to see when these political ads go out on Facebook. Unless they pop up in your feed, there’s no way to determine that they appeared as an ad. It’s also possible to create “dark posts”, which only show up as ads and not as a post on your Facebook page. This makes it very difficult to see which groups are campaigning for which cause and fact-check what they’re saying in their ads. Targeted Facebook ads were a tactic seen throughout the Trump campaign and was believed to have contributed to his victory in the 2016 election. With the help of readers and in collaboration with the US news organisation ProPublica, we’re now tracking these ads and have published a database of all the material. We’ve already shown how Adani created an ad to respond to revelations its Australian coal operations face growing financial risks and how no campaigners created an ad that told people they could request a new survey form to change their vote. In the database now are even more ads campaigning on the same-sex marriage survey. Some are from pages that appear to not have any identifying information, which may go against a new law that requires authorisation on all advertising around the sam- sex marriage survey. The ads target Australian Facebook users based on their age, location and Facebook interests, with the no campaign targeting people interested in “family”, “prayer” or “Christianity”, while ads from yes campaigners have targeted people who liked their pages. State politics is present too, with a One Nation ad targeting people in Queensland saying: “Queensland, the old parties have lost their way.

If Rosamond Young is to be believed, it’s pretty much like being human. Cows are “besotted” by and “dote on” their newborns, and nurture and counsel them as they grow up. They form “devoted and inseparable” friendships with their peers. They talk to each other, discuss the weather, pass on wisdom, introduce themselves to newcomers, go for walks, kiss, babysit, love to be stroked, play hide-and-seek, have running races, take offence, hold grudges, lose their temper, get stressed, and grieve over the death of a parent or child. They also tease, pressurise, question, retaliate against and “show baffled gratitude” towards their keepers. In short, they are the same as we are, though perhaps morally superior. If someone in a pub told you all this, you’d probably move away sharpish. But Young ought to know what she’s talking about. Her parents began farming in the Cotswolds in 1953, when she was 12 days old, and she and her brother Richard have continued the family tradition, with a large herd of pedigree Ayrshires and some sheep. From the start, she was used to stroking cows, speaking to them by name, and enjoying their individuality. And she soon came to see that they were individuals to each other too, tied by birth or other forms of kinship. For example, the “White Boys”, two white bulls close in age, would walk around shoulder to shoulder and sleep with their heads resting on each other. Her book was first published by a specialist farming press 14 years ago. After the success of James Rebanks’s The Shepherd’s Life in 2015 as well as recent nature writing that invites us to reappraise the inner lives of animals, its reissue for a general readership looks timely. But media interest in the Young family and Kite’s Nest Farm dates back to at least the 1980s. Theirs is a leading example of organic farming, based on the idea that livestock treated with kindness and consideration will have happier lives – and produce better meat. Despite the seeming naivety of her narrative voice, Young is well aware of what she is up to. The anthropomorphism she takes to extremes is there to convert sceptics and provoke behaviourists. No more carping about whether animals feel the same emotions as humans do. And no more herd mentality: every cow must be seen as unique. She writes about them as though they were characters in a novel: “The angry expression that had taken hold of her face relaxed and she turned and walked out”; “She looked after him of course but was visibly relieved when he went off to play with his friends”; “Stephanie and her daughter Olivia enjoyed a normal close relationship”; “Durham was psychologically balanced but rather small”; “Charlotte and Guy got on like a house on fire”. At other times she’s zoomorphic, to comic effect: cows eat “like a horse” and calves “like caterpillars”, while hens are “busy as bees” and bulls “a different kettle of fish”. Her evidence for the qualities she finds in cows (empathy, guile, altruism, happiness, eccentricity) is anecdotal rather than scientific. But some of the stories are certainly compelling. There is the cow that wakes her with its desperate mooing, then leads her to its sick (“blown”) calf; the cow that uses its nose to wriggle a rope over a gatepost in order to get to a trailer full of hay; the cow that consistently removes a woollen hat worn by one of the farmhands (but never anyone else’s); the cows that use their stares to reproach or cajole; the cows that eat willow to recover from illness; the hens that act as bodyguards to their injured sister and mourn her eventual death. In this benign view of nature, the lion lies down with the lamb – or rather the lamb (Audrey) and the pig (Piggy) ignore differences of size and species to become best friends (Piggy being better company than Audrey’s “boring” fellow orphan lamb Sibyl). Two bulls almost come to blows and occasional deaths are noted. But there’s none of the hardship and agony you find in Rebanks’s memoir or Ted Hughes’s Moortown poems. The tone is relentlessly upbeat: “All birds are happy clever creatures” etc. There’s even a soppy poem addressed to one of the author’s favourite cows, Amelia. The narrative would exert less charm but for some calculated omissions. As Alan Bennett notes in his introduction, nothing is said about what goes on between cows and bulls (which may, he suggests, be a respect for their privacy). Nor is there any mention of the slaughterhouse, beyond the fact that the Young family remain “in charge of every stage of production”. The book ends with lists of “20 things you ought to know about” cows, pigs, sheep and hens. One thing you know about cattle farmers is that they are not catering for vegetarians. Will the book do anything to appease those who see cattle farming of any kind as “catastrophic”? Probably not, though it claims that two-thirds of farmland in the UK is grassland, mostly “unsuitable for crop production”, and points out that a switch to arable farming usually means the removal of hedgerows, which are vital for carbon storage and partly offset methane emissions. What the book does highlight, by contrast to its own shining example, is the immorality of intensive farming. It attacks the numerous cruelties that go on, unseen by supermarket shoppers – incarceration, tail-docking, sleep deprivation, force-feeding, early weaning, teeth-cutting, debeaking. And it shows that the degree of freedom allowed to animals on Kite’s Nest Farm is not only more humane but makes sound economic sense. As Boswell said: “The flesh of animals who have fed excursively [has] a higher flavour than that of those who are cooped up.” The cooping up of cows also reduces the size of their brains, Young believes, whereas her cattle, given freedom of movement, are freethinkers. Of course, she knows that what goes on inside their heads isn’t the same as what goes on in ours: “Why should human criteria have any relevance to other species?” But by writing about them as human, she’s calling for greater humanity in the way they are treated.

Chris Heaton-Harris, Conservative MP for Daventry and a staunch Eurosceptic, wrote to vice-chancellors at the start of this month asking for the names of any professors involved in teaching European affairs “with particular reference to Brexit”. Neatly ignoring the long tradition of academic freedom that universities consider crucial to their success, his letter asks for a copy of each university’s syllabus and any online lectures on Brexit. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, felt a chill down his spine when he read the “sinister” request: “This letter just asking for information appears so innocent but is really so, so dangerous,” he says. “Here is the first step to the thought police, the political censor and newspeak, naturally justified as ‘the will of the British people’, a phrase to be found on Mr Heaton-Harris’s website.” Green will be replying to the MP but not be providing the information requested. Prof Kevin Featherstone, head of the European Institute at the LSE, is also outraged: “The letter reflects a past of a McCarthyite nature. It smacks of asking: are you or have you ever been in favour of remain? There is clearly an implied threat that universities will somehow be challenged for their bias.” Featherstone says LSE academics had already feared Brexit censorship after the Electoral Commission made inquiries during last year’s referendum campaign about academics’ debates and research, following a complaint by Bernard Jenkin, another Tory MP. Jenkin filed a complaint when the LSE hosted an event at which the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said there was “no upside for the UK in Brexit”. Jenkin, a board member of the Vote Leave campaign, also accused the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance of producing partisan research designed to convince the public to stay in the EU. The commission, whose job is to ensure fair campaigning, investigated and took no action against the university. A spokesman for the LSE strenuously denies all allegations of political bias. “The freedom for academics to study the major issues facing society, reach their own conclusions, and engage in public debate is essential for the health of our universities and the UK’s world-leading research base,” he says. Featherstone says: “I understand the LSE received calls from the Electoral Commission asking about speakers and the costs of events on an almost daily basis throughout the campaign period.” He argues that both Heaton-Harris’s letter and the Electoral Commission’s investigation pose a threat to the role of universities as free intellectual spaces where academics can explore and question ideas without political interference. He says both developments risk plunging universities into dangerous new political waters. The Electoral Commission says universities have nothing to fear from its inquiries. “We produce guidance to help all non-party campaigners understand the rules on campaigning and we can advise universities in cases where they may be affected. These do not prevent campaigning or engagement in public debate, but provide the public with transparency about who is spending what in order to influence their vote.” More than 80% of academics voted to remain, according to a YouGov survey [pdf] commissioned by the University and College Union in January. And within university departments focusing on European affairs, Brexiters are a rarity. However, university experts on Brexit insist their personal views do not jaundice their teaching, and students are encouraged to question received assumptions and look at issues from all sides. Julie Smith, director of the European Centre in the politics and international studies department at Cambridge University, says she told a lecture full of graduates about Heaton-Harris’s letter last week. “I told the students what my personal views were and emphasised that they were personal views. I voted to remain, but as an academic, my job is to impart knowledge, encourage debate and develop skills of analytical argument, not to impose doctrine.” Smith, who is also a Liberal Democrat peer, adds: “If it is the case that a politician thinks he should interfere in the content of what universities are teaching and look at syllabi in order to see whether the correct line is being delivered, that is profoundly worrying.” Prof Piet Eeckhout, academic director of University College London’s European Institute, says it is unsurprising if most academics working on Europe are in favour of the EU. “I have been teaching EU law for the last 25 years. The fact that I am sufficiently interested to spend all my days working on it obviously means I think EU law is a good thing.” Pro-Brexit academics working in this area are also unhappy with the MP’s behaviour. Lee Jones, reader in international politics at Queen Mary University of London, is one of the few openly pro-Brexit academics in his field. “During the referendum campaign I said what I wanted and no one tried to shut me up, but I know colleagues elsewhere who have been blanked in the corridors because they voted to leave.” Yet Jones, too, is outraged by Heaton-Harris’s investigation. “It is really troubling that an MP thinks it is within his remit to start poking his nose into university teaching,” he says. “Universities are autonomous and politicians have no right to intimidate academics by scrutinising their courses. I have colleagues who are die-hard remainers. But I know what they teach and it is not propaganda.” Chris Bickerton, reader in modern European politics at Cambridge University, and a fellow leave voter agrees. He adds: “In my institution there is strong support for academic freedom. I applied for promotion after the referendum and never did I worry that my views on Brexit would affect the results or my promotional prospects. Nor did I feel any institutional pressure to think one way or the other in the run‑up to the vote itself.” Heaton-Harris did not respond to requests for a comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/23/trans-pioneer-jackie-shane-i-dont-bow-down-i-do-not-get-down-on-my-knees","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Trans pioneer Jackie Shane: 'I don’t bow down.

I do not get down on my knees'","bodyText":"Anyone imagining the life of a black transgender woman in the American south of the 1950s and 60s may expect a world of taunts, misunderstanding and fear. Jackie Shane, who lived that life growing up in Nashville, claims she never experienced any of those things. “I’ve never had a problem, not once,” Shane says. “Even in school, the other kids accepted me. So did their parents. There was something about me that drew them.” Years later, that something made Shane a highly improbable star, based on a deeply soulful singing voice, and a courtly presence, that drew interest from Motown and Atlantic Records, an invitation to appear on Ed Sullivan’s powerful TV variety show and talks with George Clinton about joining Parliament-Funkadelic. Her music from that period is getting a surprising second life through a compilation of blistering studio and live performances from the 60s compiled by the archival company Numero Group for the new set Any Other Way. More than five decades ago Shane headlined clubs in her adopted town of Toronto while sporting full makeup, wigs and sequin tops. Her presentation didn’t stop her from performing on television, or from scoring a No 2 hit on Toronto radio with a cover of a soulful song of acceptance, Any Other Way. The singer – who is now 77 – speaks with a preacher’s belief, filling her conversation with advice and entreaties to “ignore the lies of ignorant people” and to “live and let live”. Shane always knew she was a woman, though others didn’t always identify her as such. “At five years old, I would dress in a dress, hat, purse and high heels and go up and down the block – and enjoy it.” Shane credits some of her confidence to her grandparents and mother. “They were beacons to our lives,” she says. “They understood me.” That wasn’t always easy to do. “Some adults were afraid of me because I was intelligent,” Shane says. “I thought for myself.” She proved it in her early musical experiences. Shane first sang in church, where she was placed in the adult choir. Shane began singing secular music at age 13 after hearing a neighborhood boy play blues piano. Entranced, she hung around for hours, eventually banging out drum parts on a chair. The piano player told her she was a natural drummer and asked her to get a set to play. Joined by a guitarist, they became a trio, enjoying local success. “Once we started, the jobs kept coming,” Shane says. Eventually, racism drove Shane out of the Jim Crow south and Shane moved to Canada, first to Montreal where she met and joined a pumping R&amp;B band led by Frank Motley. They moved to Toronto by 1961, where they began to play the clubs on bustling Yonge Street. Because the bouffant-haired Shane often wore pants on stage “most people thought I was a lesbian”, she says. “One taxi driver said ‘I don’t know why, as pretty as she is, she wears suits.” Shane never played gay clubs. “I’m an R&amp;B singer, not a mimic,” she says. “I sing the blues. I love the blues. I understand the blues.” Shane not only became successful enough to play Canadian clubs, but to dip back into the States to perform. But Shane was just as unimpressed by the powerful labels that courted her. Motown representatives came to see her at a Yonge Street club one night. “They had a whole row of champagne buckets,” she says. “They tried to talk to me. But I had been schooled about Berry Gordy taking the entertainers’ money. I wasn’t going to get involved in that.” Atlantic Records also got the thumbs down. The recordings she did make capture a voice of uncommon soul. Cuts on the new compilation like her covers of Money and Cruel Cruel World reveal a rich and smoky timbre, not unlike Nina Simone’s, as well as a dignified delivery. Though accepted in the clubs, Shane says she was sometimes hassled by the police in Toronto. “Those creatures on the force, they were gay but will never come out,” she says. “They feel they’ve got to hide, so you should too. They would see me in a motor car with these fine boys and, of course, they’re drooling. They would stop us and try to get these boys to say that I was soliciting. The boys would say you’re wrong. We’re with Jackie because we want to be.” Shane faced other challenges from her band mates, who often wanted to have sex with her. “I’ve never had a group that didn’t have one member who wouldn’t leave me alone,” she says. “I don’t want you. I will never be with another entertainer or musician – ever!” A member of one group pulled a knife on her and threatened to cut her face. “I told him to make it smooth,” Shane says. “I walked away from that group.” For a while, the singer based herself in Los Angeles where George Clinton’s band talked about hiring her to be a part of Parliament. (“They had a guy with a diaper on. That’s not my thing,” she says.) Shane toured with Etta James for a while, but by the early 70s, the singer found herself increasingly tired of the touring life so, eventually, she moved back to Nashville to care for her elderly mother. To fans, and even old band mates, she seemed to disappear into thin air. Rumors began to circulate that she had been murdered in Brazil, something she finds amusing. In 2010, CBC Radio created a documentary on Shane which couldn’t confirm that the singer was still alive. Over the last decade, small compilations of Shane’s work came out in Canada but the new set is the first to gain the singer’s approval since 1969. Numero Group A&amp;R man Douglas Mcgowan tracked Shane down through a UK blogger who claimed to be in touch with the singer. Mcgowan spent two years talking to the hyper-reclusive Shane, trying to convince her to finally receive a proper retrospective, complete with liner notes that tell her full story. Only with this release is Shane publicly acknowledging her identity as a transgender woman. In earlier press accounts, her sexuality remained ambiguous. “Jackie’s story rewrites history for people,” Mcgowan says. “It tells young people that some people have been fighting for rights before there were even names for their causes.” Shane is considering performing again, but has no specific plans right now. In the meantime, she takes pride in her retroactive legacy as a gender pioneer. “People have come up to me and said, ‘Jackie thank you. You made it possible for me to have a life.’ That’s why I was there,” she says. “My whole approach is to get you to go up against wrong. I don’t bow down. I do not get down on my knees. The lowest I go is the top of my head. This is Jackie!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/20/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T15:06:18Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United v Crystal Palace: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/20/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/20/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United v Crystal Palace: match preview","bodyText":"Andros Townsend may regard this as an audition for a potential January return to Tyneside as he and his Palace team-mates try to reprise last week’s long-awaited win against Chelsea.

An octopus that armours itself with shells and rocks, fish that use sign language and tools and dazzling cuttlefish that appear to hypnotise their prey are among the new spectacles uncovered by the series, which starts later this week. But, while the vast majority of the filming was done in the wild, some crucial behaviour could only be captured on film in controlled or laboratory conditions. The BBC faced controversy in 2011 when a Frozen Planet programme, also narrated by Sir David Attenborough, combined wild polar bear footage with film of cubs in an ice den taken in a Dutch zoo, a conjunction that only emerged after the show had been broadcast. “We wouldn’t do that now,” said Attenborough. “Because we are being very, very meticulous to be correct and not in anyway misleading.” Blue Planet 2 includes closeup lab footage of corals bleaching, as this could only be filmed with lights and specialised cameras. “To say that we are distorting natural history would be absurd,” said Attenborough. “We make films that are totally true to nature and we’re honest and open about the techniques we use to do that,” said James Honeyborne, the executive producer of Blue Planet 2. “If you’re filming something that’s microscopic, you have to put added light on it – that’s just the the simple laws of physics.” The Blue Planet team also worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool and the burrow of a zebra mantis shrimp to enable closeup filming. The fearsome-looking fangtooth, which has the largest teeth relative to its body size for any fish, was filmed in a special chamber aboard a ship that had retrieved samples from the deep ocean. The source of the footage is not highlighted during the programme. “You can’t just break the spell,” said Honeyborne. “But it’s very important we have a transparent relationship with our audience and that the small proportion of them that do want to know how these things are filmed can find out. We want to tell all aspects of the oceans and we will use all the film craft techniques to do that.” The making of Blue Planet 2, which involved 6,000 hours of underwater filming, required new technology to be developed. This included an ultra-low-light camera which captured the night-time ballet of mobula rays and bioluminescent plankton in the Sea of Cortez, California. Other behaviour seen or filmed for the first time in the series is the armoured octopus discovered near Cape Town in South Africa. “It lives in the kelp and is a very camouflaged animal, living by its wits in a very shark-rich environment, where it would be a tasty morsel,” said Honeyborne. “A naturalist [Craig Foster] who lives there said I’ve seen this extraordinary behaviour when this octopus feels threatened: it picks up stones and shells on the seabed and wraps them around itself, like a protective coat.” On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, a tuskfish was revealed using a specific coral nub to crack open clams, while elsewhere grouper fish were seen using a kind of sign language – the “headstand signal” – to reach across the vertebrate-invertebrate divide and encourage octopuses to help it hunt. The cuttlefish footage was shot off Borneo, said Mark Brownlow, the series producer. “To get ahead in this crowded undersea [coral] city you have to come up with some ingenious ways,” he said. “The amazing thing about cuttlefish is that they have control of their of their skin pattern. In order to catch a crab, these cuttlefish send ripples of colour patterns down its body and, we can’t say for sure whether it’s hypnosis, but it certainly appears to mesmerise the crab to the degree that it momentarily stops, allowing the cuttlefish to make the kill. It is utterly surreal.” Another film first showed fledgling sooty tern chicks being seized in mid-air by giant trevally fish, which erupt from the waters of a remote Indian ocean atoll. “When we first heard of it we just didn’t believe it – it’s fisherman’s tale that proved true,” said Honeyborne. The new series also focuses on the damage being done to wildlife in the oceans by human activity, including plastic pollution in the sea. “We filmed a young mother pilot whale carrying her dead baby, which the scientists there believe was due to toxic shock – plastics are the route by which the contaminants get into the milk,” said Honeyborne. In the Arctic, a walrus mother and her pup are seen struggling to find a patch of sea ice on which to rest – the north pole has lost about 40% of its ice since 1979. “We are not out there to campaign,” said Brownlow. “We are just showing it as it is and it is quite shocking at times. We couldn’t ignore it – it just wouldn’t be a truthful portrayal of the world’s oceans.” Attenborough said: “We would like to think the natural world is better understood and better respected as a consequence of what we do. You can’t respect it unless you understand it.” Blue Planet 2 begins in the UK at 8pm on 29 October on BBC1. This article was amended on 24 October 2017.

Yes, a lot’","bodyText":"The first time we met, in 2014, Tom Watson was essentially operating a one-man child abuse hotline out of his parliamentary office. His reputation as a champion of phone-hacking victims made him one of the few politicians alleged victims would trust with their stories, and Watson found enough of them credible to take claims of a VIP Westminster paedophile ring very seriously. “There is no doubt in my mind,” he told me, “that at least one politician abused kids.” When we met again, in the summer last year, Labour was in dysfunctional disarray, reeling from the aborted coup against Jeremy Corbyn. Watson was barely even on speaking terms with his leader, and looked stricken. He said that entryist “old Trots” were infiltrating Momentum to hijack control of the party, which got him into hot water with Corbynistas. He didn’t seem to mind upsetting them, though, which made me think he assumed they’d soon be finished off by inevitable electoral defeat anyway. When we meet again this week, the Westminster VIP paedophile ring no longer looks to most people like a plausible scandal. Allegations of rape against the late Sir Leon Brittan, which Watson helped publicise, have been investigated and found baseless – and Corbyn has defied his deputy’s predictions to lead Labour to the brink of power. So I expected to find Watson somewhat chastened, eating if not humble pie then at least his words. For that matter, he might be in the mood to eat anything, having gone on “hunger strike” this week in solidarity with two Guantánamo Bay prisoners who are refusing to eat in protest at their incarceration. Horrified to discover that Donald Trump had scrapped America’s longstanding policy of force-feeding captives on hunger strike, Watson undertook a 30-hour fast to draw public attention to their grisly fate. But the figure who greets me in his Westminster office looks almost indecently cheerful. I have never seen Watson this happy. Then again, I’ve never seen him second-in-command of a party he believes to be just inches from power. “Theresa May doesn’t even look as if she wants to lead. You can support a weak leader – but a leader who doesn’t provide any leadership just leaves them in stasis. There’s no leadership at all. They don’t have a plan, they don’t have a narrative, and at any point they could unravel. I’ve never seen anything like it. These are unprecedented times. I was right in the middle of the Blair/Brown years, but this triangle at the core of government – Hammond, May, Johnson – none of them can get on. It’s so unstable now that we have to be ready for them to collapse at any moment.” Labour, on the other hand, are “buoyant”. This week’s PMQs was: “The best I’ve ever been to. Jeremy was fantastic and I could feel our backbenchers solidly behind him. It was great today.” Given the choice, he’d like another election called as early as possible, but suspects May will limp on until Brexit talks are concluded. Then will Labour win? “Look, even in 1997 we knew better than to say that.” It is the first time I’ve heard anyone in Labour draw a parallel between Blair’s first landslide and the party’s prospects today. Watson doesn’t buy the idea that the Brexit talks are failing because the referendum result is impossible to implement. “No, I think it’s achievable. I just think they haven’t got a settled view around the top table on what their plan should be. They’ve still got people who think that crashing out of the EU is a realistic and, some even think, a positive option.” Does he hear anyone in his own party argue for no deal? “No.” Watson shares Amber Rudd’s view – no deal would be “unthinkable”. While in favour of maintaining single-market membership during a period of transition, he wants to make it very clear that contrary to recent press reports, permanent membership is not his preferred model. Only in the unlikely event that the EU revised the free movement of people as a condition of membership would Watson reconsider. He won’t rule out a second referendum, but even if we fail to agree a deal and face crashing out of the EU, he thinks another vote is still “highly unlikely”. Watson talks about Brexit with studied caution; he is a remainer whose West Bromwich East constituency voted by 70% to leave. He would still vote to remain again, though, and says Corbyn would, too. The pair now talk “every day”, so I ask him what changed – Corybn’s leadership, or Watson’s mind? “If you’re asking, are we getting on better, yes we are. A lot better.” I ask about relations with Momentum. Having praised the movement in his party conference speech, does he owe its supporters an apology? He sighs. “Listen, what I said last year was that the vast majority of Momentum members are very bright young people who want a more fair and equal society. Everyone forgets that. But I also think it’s slightly ironic that since then Momentum has had to expel some of those Trotskyists from its own organisation. So I’m allowed a wry smile on that.” Was he worried about verbal abuse from Momentum members at the conference last month? “No, not at all. But I was a little worried about grief from Len McCluskey.” The Labour deputy and Unite leader used to be close friends, once even flatmates, until Watson’s public criticism of Corbyn last year unleashed a Shakespearean feud. The two haven’t spoken a word to each other since, and when invited to the same event pointedly ignore one another. Watson built his political career in part at least on his reputation as something of a bruiser, and any mention of his name within Labour circles usually elicits knowing smiles reserved for the kind of men you wouldn’t want to mess with, but like to have on your side. Watson always pretends to be mystified by his reputation. In my experience, however, such reputations seldom appear out of thin air, so it is a surprise when he tells me he finds the feud with his old friend nerve-racking. “He’s a very powerful man, you know, who’s not very keen on me. It’s slightly disconcerting and, on a personal level, it’s quite sad and a bit frightening,” he says. Frightening? “Well, you know. A bit intimidating. You listen to radio interviews with the general secretary of Unite calling me a back-stabbing neoliberal – it’s not pleasant, is it? But you get on with it.” Has Watson ever considered picking up the phone to offer a truce and make peace? “No. Because it’s a personal relationship that is irreconcilable. On a political level we’ll manage the relationship fine, and that’s that.” The mind boggles to think of the secrets the two must have on each other, but the nuclear arms principle of mutually assured destruction will probably ensure we never know. According to Watson, however, McCluskey is busy doing his best to make him lose his job. The party is considering an idea to appoint a female second deputy leader, but when I ask Watson what he thinks, he replies: “Well, obviously some of it is personally targeted, so it’s a bit uncomfortable.” The gender-equality argument is nothing but a spurious disguise, he says, for a vendetta against him. Watson does think the next Labour leader must be a woman, and can conceive of no circumstances in which he would support a male candidate running against a woman. “That is a long way off,” he adds hastily, taking care to make clear for the third time in an hour that Corbyn’s leadership is now unassailable. If politics is, as people say, showbusiness for ugly people, it strikes me that the power dynamics in Hollywood that allowed Harvey Weinstein to get away with decades of abuse must also apply to Westminster. The Houses of Parliament are full of young women whose political ambitions must be easy to exploit by older, powerful politicians, so I’m curious to know if Watson hears the same sort of rumours that used to circulate about Weinstein. “I don’t know of any.” Really? “No, no.” I’m amazed, but Watson is adamant. “Well,” he adds, “abuse of power I’ve obviously raised with the child abuse stuff.” If Watson has the slightest concern that he may have been overly credulous about allegations of establishment abuse, it doesn’t show. No, he says calmly, he doesn’t think he was too hasty, nor made any claims he would now retract. “I think I did the job of a backbench MP. I shook the tree. I know people think I said too many things publicly, but there is a lot more privately that Alexis Jay will have to look at with her team.” Does he expect Jay’s inquiry to vindicate his suspicions? “Only time will tell.” Its inquiries into historical abuse in Lambeth, he adds, “could be quite significant, and cast more light on the goings-on around Westminster as well”. As a well-known and powerful politician himself, single since he separated from his wife a few years ago, I wonder whether he feels he must always be careful to keep his professional status out of his private life. “Look, I’ve got enough on my plate. If there are any 50-year-old divorcees out there who want to put up with a political obsessive, they can send me an email. But I’m not particularly interested. Being deputy leader of the Labour party has many complications, but when it comes to my private life, I try not to play the power card. “I actually don’t consider myself that powerful. I know some people might perceive me as that, and that’s the point you’re making. But at the end of the day, I’m a working-class kid from Kidderminster who happens to be deputy leader of the Labour party. Who knows for how long. I suppose that’s down to Len McCluskey.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/20/head-ashtrays-and-pin-up-body-parts-alina-szapocznikow-human-landscapes-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T16:30:24Z","webTitle":"Head ashtrays and pin-up body parts  – Alina Szapocznikow: Human Landscapes review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/head-ashtrays-and-pin-up-body-parts-alina-szapocznikow-human-landscapes-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/head-ashtrays-and-pin-up-body-parts-alina-szapocznikow-human-landscapes-review","fields":{"headline":"Head ashtrays and pin-up body parts  – Alina Szapocznikow: Human Landscapes review","bodyText":"Julie Christie’s pink mouth blooms in a glowing orb atop an elegant curving stem. These Illuminated Lips, a 1966 series of lamp sculptures by the Polish artist Alina Szapocznikow, repeat in coloured polyester resin, varying from flesh tones to ice white against black. There are also lit-up nipples and rumpled amber-hued planes that resemble art nouveau glass light shades, petals and skin. When Szapocznikow was making these forays into pliable industrial materials in her adopted city Paris, her work was frequently dismissed as simply sexy and narcissistic. She was more likely to use her own physique, though her collaboration with the movie star hints at her place in a switched-on circle that took in the artist Annette Messager and the cult film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky. After the artist’s death from breast cancer in 1972, the art historian Urszula Czartoryska wrote how, after seeing an early sculpture of her shapely leg, “we thought of the perfection of the anatomy, of flirtatiousness”. Another work from this time, Illuminated Woman, a skinny, near life-size plaster figure sporting a kind of strapless bikini of radiant, hot red resin, has a cartoonish, beach babe appeal. With her pin-up’s body parts fragmented into interior design, Szapocznikow was clearly setting her sights on sex and commodity, an update of the surrealist fetish object for the postwar consumer age. Seen today however, in the context of the Hepworth Wakefield’s revelatory survey of her long-overlooked, searching, experimental output, even the artist’s most pop creations take on a darker tone. The sex always goes hand-in-hand with death; the present is freighted with the trauma of the past. Rewind to the mid-1950s and things look completely different. Emerging from the sanctioned style of Soviet socialist realism, she started making huge semi-abstract bronzes like Maria Magdalena, a hulking amorphous thing, which seems to take shape, before our eyes, from primordial mud. Like other postwar artists, she has an acute awareness of the vulnerability of bodies, depicting them in fragments, half-formed and beset by change. As a teenager, she survived the Ghetto, Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, as well as TB thanks to an experimental antibiotic treatment. While she never spoke of these experiences, it’s hard, once you know the history, not to see them in her art. Even the sassy lamps start to conjure Nazi horror stories, like the ashtrays made from Jewish skin. In fact, in 1972 she cast the lower half of her head to create a Janus-faced ashtray, filled with fag butt sludge. Szapocznikow would later recall how people struggled to square her earlier abstract sculpture, “so big, so ugly”, with their maker, who in photographs looks chic, petite and playful. Of course, she wanted to address how we feel, rather than how we look. When she moved to Paris she reached a decisive creative turning point, however, developing a kind of oblique self-portraiture, casting herself in polyester resin and using carcinogenic polyurethane. The results are consistently arresting conflations of the elegant and grotesque. Full of lumps sprouting lips and nipples, her sculpture can recall the polymorphous perversity of Louise Bourgeois. The malleable resin suggests Eva Hesse’s eroding sculpture or Lynda Benglis’s pours. She didn’t know their art. Yet like them, she was searching for a new voice. “How can we express today?” she asked. For Szapocznikow, polyester resin was the perfect up-to-the-minute material. Almost literally so: it demands fast treatment before it hardens. Like a photograph it registers the moment – the shape of a belly, a mouth – at a given point in time. And, as with the body, it’s destined to fade, a physical testament to passing years. It allowed her to both embrace the future and memorialise, a compelling tension that gains a horrible intensity after her 1969 diagnosis of breast cancer. While Szapocznikow’s work had dealt in beauty and abjection, the exhibition’s final, far more personal room, stages a battle with body horror. The bulging wall sculpture Alina’s Funeral (1970) suggests some kind of monster egg-sac or cancer cells. Up close it’s more like a burial mound: just discernible beneath browning, gelatinous resin are photos, pages from her art catalogues and her pyjamas. Recalling the broken statuary of fallen civilisations, Tumours Personified (1971) is the artist’s attempt to own the illness, with a scattering of head-size lumps, bearing her own face. Such works become a kind of 20th-century take on vanitas painting, with their urgent reminders of the closeness of death and what we leave behind. The most poignant is a life cast of the artist’s teenage son. Long haired and naked he lies at a diagonal, suspended in space, recalling the dead Christ in Mary’s arms. This is a pieta minus the mother. The kicker though is how this beautiful, alabaster youth, rendered, not as he first appears in impermeable marble, but via two skin-thin polyester casts, has a body barely held together at the seams. Alina Szapocznikow: Human Landscapes is at the Hepworth Wakefield until 28 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
