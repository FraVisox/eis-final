That was the first series of 13 Reasons Why, adapted from the book by Jay Asher. Originally destined to become a film, Netflix got hold of it and gave it the Netflix stretch. It did attempt to explore important issues – not only suicide but rape, self-harm, bullying, high-school sexism – sensibly and seriously, even if any messages to emerge came across as simplistic and a bit preachy: be nice to people, be a real friend, otherwise bad shit goes down. It meandered, but the cassettes and the 13 reasons in 13 episodes gave it a structure of sorts. The performances, especially from Katherine Langford and Dylan Minnette as Hannah and her friend Clay, were good. The second series continues to explore the same big issues sensitively, as well as taking on board some of the criticism and controversy the first generated (it now comes with a public service announcement, delivered by the actors, links to relevant resources, plus the parents – Clay’s especially – are more aware of what their kids are going through). And that’s about all that’s good about series two. It’s a few months later, and there’s a civil lawsuit going on against the school for failing to protect Hannah. There’s a lot of dragging through the same stuff all over again. But this time without the framework of the tapes and the reasons. The trial, of which there isn’t much, perhaps provides the crumbliest of structures, and some photos are turned up that show Hannah wasn’t alone in suffering bullying and abuse. But if the first series meandered, then this circles aimlessly with its head to the ground. Some of the acting remains decent, though Langford, the stand-out in the first season, now has to do hers as a ghost. The ghost of Hannah. The ghost of a lame device past. I’ve only watched three episodes. But that was enough. It’s like being locked in a room with a bunch of self-obsessed teens, occasionally saying things like “the truth can free you if you let it” or “sometimes it seems that no matter what you do people see you the way they want to”. I know teenagers are only concerned with what others think of them. I know if I was one I might connect better with this (it would be interesting to hear from them). I know the issues are very real, very important and, in fact, deadly serious. But they deserve a better vehicle. As drama this is pointless, cumbersome, baggy, badly written, ponderous and boring. That’s less than half of the 13 reasons why you shouldn’t bother. In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

I’m at the stage in my career that I knew what might be coming but at the same time you can never prepare for it. I’ve been released and just like every player who has experienced the scenario there is no way to ready yourself. Disappointment is immediate along with the relief of at least knowing the decision. Then you question yourself and you feel failure, worry, fear and anxiety that any person in any line of work would feel when losing their job. I appreciate how privileged I am to do a job I love and get well paid for, and I understand people who say flippantly it’s OK for the likes of me who have had a long career and all the benefits that come with that. But the sheer emotion of having to break the bad news to my wife and children who are happy in the area and at their school and having to come to terms with the fact my chances of playing at the very top level again are extremely slim makes everything daunting, painful and testing. As sportsmen and competitors we have been taught and conditioned to never give up, to keep fighting when things are against you and to have faith in our ability, so when all of those things come to a point when your services are no longer needed, when you’re no longer required, it is an extremely bitter pill to swallow no matter how much you try to prepare and know that day will come. I’ve enjoyed an incredible three years at Brighton, a period of stable improvement year on year. To have gone from the pain of missing out on automatic promotion by one goal, bouncing back and going up the next season and then beating Manchester United at home to ensure we retained our Premier League status has been nothing short of a fairytale. This journey has been led by Hughton, a manager full of humility, respect, empathy and confidence in himself because of his detailed planning and preparation for games. But behind that, supporting him, was a club with synergy where every single member of staff, the players and the supporters were fighting for the same goal. All of them had a shared vision and sense of accountability of where they wanted to go and, more importantly, what needed to be done to get there. It amazes me when we analyse football how little we take into account the human element of the game – we can all talk about systems, tactics and team selections but what actually makes the difference is the people operating on and off the pitch. Are they diligent, resilient, honest, caring and supportive as characters or do they point fingers at the first moment of hardship and worry more about themselves than the benefit of the group? At Brighton we never had that problem. That’s why it worked and I hope the philosophy of person first, player after is continued. There are so many people at the club I want to thank, who I have learned from and benefited from being in their presence. It makes it impossible to name them all but I’m confident they know how grateful I am for their help. I would, however, like to highlight the influence of two who are intrinsic to the wellbeing and success of the club’s players. The captain, Bruno, is the most dedicated, gifted, charismatic and caring footballer I have ever come across. At nearly 38 he is playing for, excelling and leading a Premier League club from a position at full-back where pace and stamina are two of the biggest attributes needed. He is an example that the so-called impossible can be achieved with hard work, confidence and passion, and he sums up everything good about the game we love. The second is one of the “invisible” people who is never mentioned on the pitch but is the oil in the machine and proof it is the work of the collective, not just the “stars” that helps achieve success. Steve Gibbon is the player liaison officer and is a man who fixes every problem possible for a club – his job is to take the pressure off players with anything and everything – and he puts his heart, soul and love of the club first to ensure the players are mentally ready to produce on the pitch. His job is 24 hours a day be it giving lifts to players, helping them find schools and houses or even paying parking fines for them, and his input is just as important as ours on the field of play to make us successful. So while I’m sad at leaving such a wonderful club and while I’m uncertain of my next step in the world of football, I feel blessed to have been part of the journey that has seen Brighton get promoted from the Championship to securing their status in the Premier League. I’m getting to the final stage of completing my Uefa pro licence in coaching and managing may be the next step, though at the moment I’m still open to playing. I will make sure I take heed of the lessons I have learned from my time at Brighton and apply them in the future as a player, coach or manager."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/18/number-of-low-paid-uk-workers-falls-to-lowest-level-in-decades","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T23:01:42Z","webTitle":"Number of low-paid UK workers falls to lowest level in decades","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/18/number-of-low-paid-uk-workers-falls-to-lowest-level-in-decades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/18/number-of-low-paid-uk-workers-falls-to-lowest-level-in-decades","fields":{"headline":"Number of low-paid UK workers falls to lowest level in decades","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A smaller proportion of UK workers are low paid than at any time since the early 1980s, due to above-inflation increases in the government’s national living wage. A report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said the share of employees who were officially classified as low paid – earning less than around £8.50 an hour – had fallen to 18%, the lowest since 1982. Further planned increases in the national living wage would reduce the percentage of low paid – those earning less than two-thirds of the median hourly wage – to 15% by 2020, the thinktank said. The number of low-paid workers is affected by the growing size of the workforce, but the Resolution Foundation said that in the year to April 2017 the total fell below five million for the first time since the early 2000s. Over the past three years, the national minimum wage has risen from £6.70 in 2016 to £7.50 in 2017 and £7.83 from April 2018. Conor D’Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The national living wage was the bold policy we needed to kick start a low-pay revolution, and it has seen low pay fall to its lowest levels since the early 1980s. But now is not the time for complacency. A higher minimum wage cannot solve all our low-pay challenges. “Workers today too often find themselves stuck on the shop floor with no chance to move up the ladder. Many are employed by one of a handful of big-hiring but low-paying firms in an industry or local area with few other options available. Women remain far more likely to be trapped in low pay than men. “Tackling these new triple threats is how business and policymakers can build on the success of the national living wage.” The report said one in six workers in the UK remain in low-paid jobs, including more than half of those employed in bars and restaurants (58%) and almost one in four people in Nottingham (24%) and Sheffield (23%). Just one in six low-paid employees permanently escaped low pay between 2006 to 2016, while 22% of women were low paid compared to 14% of men. Women were less likely to progress out of low pay, more likely to switch into other low-paying jobs and more concentrated in a handful of large firms than low-paid men. The proportion of workers paid less than the voluntary living wage – £10.20 for London and £8.75 for the rest of the UK – fell to 22% (5.9 million) last year, the thinktank said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/20/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-flow","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T08:00:52Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'flow'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/20/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-flow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/20/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-flow","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'flow'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘flow.’ Share your photos of what different means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

During Jordan Pickford’s Sunderland days he occasionally played midfield in training ground practice games. As the goalkeeper showcased an extraordinarily varied passing range, crowned by the unerringly accurate, long range, side-foot volley which has become his hallmark, he invariably looked the best individual on view. Impressed onlookers routinely agreed that Pickford possessed the sort of assured left foot leading coaches pay millions of pounds for. “It’s like watching a top midfielder,” said David Moyes, his manager at the time. “Jordan’s got a very big kick but he’s also got a very good passing range, he can go short, he can go long. Distribution is such a big part of goalkeeping these days and his is very good indeed.” Signed by Everton for £30m last summer, Pickford is also rather useful in central defence. Granted, with the ball at his feet, the 24-year-old often looks a natural-born midfield playmaker but he also seems adept as a classy sweeper. “I played Jordan at centre half in training so he understood what it was like for defenders when keepers came over the top of them for crosses,” recalled Kevin Ball, Sunderland’s former academy manager. “Jordan loved it. He could easily have been a centre half. “When he was in goal, the centre halves would split, hoping to take the ball from him but he’d just ping it upfield perfectly. I’d say ‘play it out Jordan, let them do it,’ but he’d reply ‘why? I’m better than them.’ He wasn’t being a pain, just honest. Jordan has confidence in his ability and his opinions. He’ll challenge you, he’ll say ‘I don’t agree’. I like that.” For his part, Pickford thrived under the exacting taskmaster. “Bally was a great coach who wouldn’t give us any leeway,” said Pickford. “We had to do all the old apprentice jobs, clean the dressing room, put Dubbin on the coaches’ boots.” Ball recognised that Pickford needed challenges and helped ensure that the boyhood Sunderland supporter from Washington, Tyne and Wear, received them. Loan stints at Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston duly followed with their fans being treated to not only a series of stunning saves but early glimpses of that trademark rocket like sidefoot volley with which Pickford would later make so many goals for Jermain Defoe in Sunderland’s first team. A prime example of this art can be found in filmed clips of the 75-yard ball Pickford’s left foot dispatched perfectly for Dominic Calvert-Lewin as Everton beat Hajduk Split 2-0 in the Europa League last August. It emphasises that this is a keeper who creates, as well as prevents, goals. “There’s no place to hide at places like Darlo and Alfreton,” reflected Pickford who was driven to the latter club’s home games by his parents and would sit in the back seat consuming the chicken and pasta lunches his mother had prepared in a tupperware box as they traversed the motorway network. “Playing for Darlington at 17 I learnt so much. You’re up against men, it’s a physical and mental test against big centre halves needing to pay their mortgages.” The stellar hand-eye co-ordination which would serve him so well was possibly inherited from his father, now a builder but once a gamekeeper on Lord Lambton’s County Durham estate. By the time he reached Preston, Pickford was a star in waiting. “I’ve never seen anyone kick a ball like Jordan can,” says Chris Kirkland, the former Liverpool goalkeeper who deputised for him at Deepdale. “I could never have kicked a ball as far as Jordan. “But the biggest thing about him was his command of the penalty area. All goalkeepers make saves but Jordan’s command of the area impressed me. He came out for crosses and high balls with an authority rare for one so young. He was brilliant.” Such fearlessness was evident as a small boy in Washington. Playing football with his older brother on the family’s asphalt drive the budding goalkeeper threw himself repeatedly onto that unforgiving surface as if it were a soft play area. A similarly unflinching candour, sets Pickford slightly apart from the crowd in today’s sometimes publicly synthetic football world. After Everton recently beat Newcastle United, Sunderland’s great rivals, he married a triumphant Instagram picture with the unapologetically undiplomatic message: “No better feeling than keeping them quiet.” If those north-east roots are the ties that bind the life of an England international who remains close to his family and lives with the girlfriend he has dated since they were 14, Pickford’s imposing amalgam of psychological and physical strength threatens to unnerve opponents in Russia. “Jordan has exceptional wrist and forearm strength,” says Adrian Tucker, Pickford’s goalkeeping coach at Sunderland. “He’s got excellent hands.” Not to mention exceptional feet and an exemplary mindset.

The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, spent the last year travelling across the north interviewing young people about their hopes and fears for a report called Growing Up North. From Liverpool to Hull, and everywhere in between, she asked children where they saw their future. They agreed on one thing: not London. There were girls in Manchester who fancied living in New York, boys in Bradford who dreamed of one day moving 10 miles up the road to Leeds. But London? No ta. Too expensive, they told her: “Not just in terms of housing but in terms of maintaining your lifestyle.” Longfield senses a cultural shift. When she was growing up in Yorkshire in the 1970s, like so many ambitious northern girls she was set on escaping to the bright lights of the big city. “I went from near Leeds to Newcastle University, straight down the A1 to London,” she told me. I was the same, only in the noughties: Morecambe, Edinburgh, London. Boom. I wanted to be a journalist and all the best media jobs were in the capital. All my favourite northern bands had already moved down. I wanted to be there, propping up the bar at the Good Mixer and all the other mythical venues I’d been reading about in the NME. Now, when I give careers talks to students, the question I get asked most is: “Do you think I’ll have to move to London?” Not: “I really want to”, but: “Do I have to?” I see very few Dick Whittingtons and a lot more London refuseniks, unwilling to leave their nice lives in York/Sunderland/Lancaster for a slightly bigger salary. After all, who cares if you’re on an extra £10k if you still can’t afford your own place and it can take an hour and a half to visit someone in the same city? There’s an arrogance to Londoners that turns the rest of the country right off. On the bank holiday weekend I was in the capital and did a parkrun in Croydon. Afterwards, I got chatting to a local who boasted that it was the hardest and hilliest such event in the country. I expressed scepticism, pointing out that there were courses in the Lake District that would make Croydon look like Holland. “That doesn’t count,” he said. Last week the trade secretary, Greg Hands, Tory MP for Chelsea, said Reading had been chosen as the new home for the Trade Remedies Authority because it was “well connected to whole of UK”. Tell that to businesses in Liverpool or Leeds, who will face a seven-hour round trip to get there. I moved from London to Greater Manchester five years ago, despite many warnings that I was heading straight into a career cul-de-sac. But what price a garden? Stairs? A spare room? I also thought the media had become unforgivably London-centric and I wanted to play a tiny part in challenging the capital’s dominance. Sometimes that just means pointing out that sun is forecast for Manchester when our lead story suggests the nation is about to be laid waste by a snow storm; other times it has meant reporting from what we now see as the Brexit heartlands, warning that leaving the EU was a very real prospect, however fanciful it looked from London. There is no doubt that many of the top jobs remain in the capital. But for how long? In the media alone, 3,200 BBC employees are now based in Salford, and Channel 4 recently announced plans for a “second home” outside London. The year 2016 marked a pivotal moment, when more graduate jobs were created in Manchester than in the City of London: 3,790 compared with 3,545 in the Square Mile, according to Charlie Ball of graduate career-monitoring service Prospects. Ball expects Leeds and Glasgow to overtake the City in terms of graduate jobs in the next few years. Should we thank the former chancellor George Osborne and his “northern powerhouse”? His successor may be too busy with Brexit to put much money or energy into the project – but some Whitehall functions are already devolved. Cities like Manchester are able to make their case stronger than ever before, luring incomers with Tony Wilson’s old adage that “this is Manchester. We do things differently here.” Recruiters in London are getting jittery about their ability to attract top talent. A CBI survey last month found that 66% of businesses in the capital believed London’s ludicrous housing market was having a negative impact on the recruitment of entry-level staff. Hardly a shock when the average first-time buyer now needs a salary of £100,000 to buy a two- or three-bedroom home, against £32,000 in Newcastle or £28,000 in Liverpool, according to research by Hometrack. Some 44% of companies told the CBI they offered premium wages or retention payments to attract staff, noticing how many of their employees were packing their bags and moving out of London when they hit 30. No wonder many are increasing their regional presence. Consultancy firm Deloitte told me it now offers 43% of graduate opportunities outside London, a 12-point increase year on year. Of course London has never been cheap: “Nothing is certain in London except expense,” wrote the 18th-century poet, William Shenstone. But a one-bedroom flat where I used to live in Clapton, east London, nowhere near a tube stop, now sells for almost half a million pounds. Is it any a surprise that so few artists now live in the capital? Lubaina Himid, last year’s Turner prizewinner, works happily from a Georgian terrace in Preston. IAMDDB, one of the most hotly tipped musicians on the BBC’s Sound of 2018 list, is so in love with her native Manchester that she quotes its dialling code like a rhapsody: “0161, that’s home, and will be home for ever.” Blossoms, one of the most successful indie bands on the circuit, are named after their favourite pub in their native Stockport. As it happens, I am equally fond of Manchester and London. I just don’t want to live in the latter. The more I travel around the north of England the more unforgivable it is to me that the capital gobbles up ever more investment while town centres everywhere else are reduced to pound and charity shops, and pawnbroker’s. Four years ago, the Centre for Cities polled people all over the UK in Not-London and found only 24% of Britons outside the capital thought it had a positive effect on their local economy – the figures fall to less than 10% in Liverpool, Hull and Sheffield. Meanwhile, in Chris Grayling we have a transport secretary who cancelled key electrification projects to northern rail lines last year while supporting Crossrail 2 – yet another rail line across London, expected to cost £31.2bn, which just happened to start in his own Surrey constituency. And is it not a bit rum that the transport minister, Jo Johnson, is also minister for London? I know many Londoners blame the north for Brexit, even though Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds voted remain. One sent me a petition to sign in the aftermath, calling for London’s independence. But is it that much of a surprise that, after so many decades of underinvestment from Westminster, the rest of the country saw the EU referendum as a chance to give London a kicking? We might not want to live in London, but we can still see what you’re doing. • Helen Pidd is North of England editor of the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/24/connect-by-julian-gough-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T08:00:47Z","webTitle":"Connect by Julian Gough review – a dazzling technothriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/connect-by-julian-gough-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/24/connect-by-julian-gough-review","fields":{"headline":"Connect by Julian Gough review – a dazzling technothriller","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the final pages of Connect, its central character arrives at a climactic epiphany. “Everything,” Colt reflects, “can be described at every level.” But, he goes on to acknowledge, “it’s better to describe things at the level at which they make most sense.” It is an observation that neatly encapsulates both the scale of this novel’s ambition and its most distracting tendencies, the first of which is in evidence from the start. Set in the near future, the book focuses on the teenage Colt and his mother, a geneticist named Naomi Chiang who has discovered a potent alternative to stem cell therapies. Based on the imaginal discs that are instrumental to insect metamorphosis, Naomi’s technique, if developed, could allow complex body parts – and even brain tissue – to be rapidly regrown. Colt, who spends much of his time immersed in a virtual game world, is affected by a condition that resembles Asperger’s syndrome. Pinocchio-like, he wants to be a “real boy”, and sees that promise in his mother’s work. Distrusting her own findings, Naomi has been reluctant to publish them, but her research has already attracted attention. The National Security Agency, now entirely delinquent and vastly powerful, has spotted its military potential and wants it suppressed. When Colt persuades Naomi to give a conference paper, the two are promptly apprehended and, in time-honoured fashion, whisked away to a secret base in Nevada. Colt, however, has been busy. He has stolen into Naomi’s lab, intent on engineering a neurotypical brain, and injected himself with an untested imaginal disc. “But … why?” she asks him. Colt hedges a little, then confesses: “I could talk to … to women, Mama.” It is a touching scene, and no less so for its playful deference to superhero origin stories. And as tradition requires, Colt soon finds he has been granted not just the abilities he coveted, but lots more besides: his brain is now stuffed with an outsize corpus callosum (a structure implicated in autism spectrum disorders) as well as an intricate tissue of upgrades generated from insect neurons. These enable him to escape from the NSA’s desert fortress, to keep ahead of the ensuing manhunt and to confront the “immune system”, a terrifying digital panopticon developed (in a pleasing Oedipal flourish) by his own father. These episodes are propulsive and engrossing, but life with the newly enhanced Colt isn’t all fun and games. To begin with, his condition is not in any sense “cured” – that would be inconsistent with Gough’s sophisticated and sympathetic presentation of autism. Far from exploiting it as a narrative contrivance, as other novelists have repeatedly done, he is at pains to show us the richness and complexity of experience of the atypical brain. This approach is clearly commendable, and the resulting portrait is – up to a point – illuminating and inclusive. The problem, for narrative purposes, is that the supercharged Colt becomes a singular prototype, acquiring cognitive abilities so dazzling that at first he is literally blinded. Gough has a great deal of fun with this, and for a time so do we, but as Colt’s abilities grow, he struggles to explain them to lesser mortals. When he predicts a violent eruption of solar activity, his father is intrigued, but Colt is by now reduced to using an impatient shorthand. “The math isn’t up to the job,” he explains. “But I can see it in my head.” This, too, is a familiar trope. In fiction as in film, unchecked superpowers tend to alienate the audience (superheroes have human alter egos for a reason) and to rob the drama before us of a necessary friction. Much of the remaining conflict is between an implacable artificial intelligence and Colt’s own hypertrophied intellect, and although he suffers setbacks – and faces a final challenge that requires a uniquely human solution – it is a contest largely devoid of emotional interest. What we are left with amounts to a frenetic livestream from Colt’s prodigious consciousness, relieved only by hyperactive digressions on everything from particle physics to cryptography, strange authorial intrusions and an onerous ballast of epigraphs (we don’t need constant interruptions from Bertrand Russell or Ray Kurzweil to appreciate the extent and eclecticism of Gough’s reading). Yet for all its helpless excitability, there is plenty of real excitement in this novel, and a spirit of joyous curiosity that may strain our patience at times but never quite loses its charm. What Gough attempts here is to describe everything at every level, and the effort is in many ways hugely admirable.

But to stand before it – all 80 or so square feet of it – is to experience a powerful sense of exaltation. This is a painting that seems so absolutely right, falling on the enthralled visitor, to pinch from Philip Larkin, like an enormous yes. Its colours, its shapes, its scale: what incredible joy and heat these things stir up. From a distance, I stared at it, and thought of something I liked to do as a child, which was to lie on the ground in warm sunshine, and close my eyes, and wait for swirling patterns of rose-red and gold to appear on the inside of my lids. Suddenly, for a fleeting moment, I was that child again. But there’s more. Stand well back, and Heron’s great mid-period works, painted in the late 60s and early 70s, have a blocky feel, the oil seemingly so smoothly applied, you wonder what thinner he used, what kind of airbrush. Move closer, though, and the ground shifts beneath your feet. Unbelievable as it sounds, these vast canvases were painted end to end with small Japanese watercolour brushes, and once you’re only a few inches away, everything looks at once rougher and yet more beautiful: here are patterns within patterns, a delicacy that is in almost total contrast to the painting’s overall effect. Do the two things work together? Heron certainly believed that they did. “One doesn’t hand-paint for the sake of the ‘hand-done’,” he said. “One merely knows that surfaces worked in this way can – in fact, they must – register a different nuance of spatial evocation and movement in every single square millimetre.” This extraordinary painting, and several others from the same era, form the heart of a major exhibition of Heron’s work at Tate St Ives. It’s easy to see why the Tate wanted to show Heron (1920-1999) here, in its new galleries’ first summer. Not only did the artist live and work for more than 40 years in a house called Eagles Nest nearby on the west Penwith peninsula; the bigger and more colourful of his canvases are extraordinarily well suited to these hangar-like spaces – effectively chiselled into the hillside behind the gallery’s original rooms, they are nevertheless both vast and marvellously light – where the best of them seem to float like glorious planets in a concrete solar system. The curators’ approach to Heron’s work, however, is a less easy thing to explain. I must be honest: I find it utterly exasperating. Andrew Wilson, a senior curator at Tate Britain, and Sara Matson, a curator at Tate St Ives, have taken a non-chronological approach, gathering Heron’s work into four wilfully vague and hard to understand themed groups: unity; the edge; explicit scale; asymmetry and re-complication. The idea is to show that the artist’s approach to painting throughout his life was “utterly consistent”, from the figurative work he produced in the 1940s through his move into abstraction in 1956, and beyond (his later work, which seems to me not always to be entirely successful, is very much concerned with mark-marking, and hovers in a liminal space somewhere between abstraction and figuration – even if Heron, who disliked such distinctions, would doubtless not have seen it quite like this). They also hope that by hanging paintings that were completed decades apart next to one another, visitors will be able to “experience” Heron’s work in a “non-didactic” way. Are the experts afraid, in our present climate, of seeming too expert? Perhaps. Or perhaps they really believe this is the way to learn about Heron. If so, I think they are wrong. People are perfectly capable of learning about an artist and giving themselves up to his talent; this, in fact, is what most of us actively long for when we visit a gallery. Nor are we goldfish. We can remember a painting from, say, 1943, for the 20 minutes it might take us to pitch up at one made in 1996, for which reason we’re capable of spotting certain convictions and repetitions on the part of the artist on our own. A chronological show would have been so much better, and easier to grasp, revealing both the way Heron, the son of a manufacturer of silks, developed in the years after he left the Slade, and the formal consistency to which he was so committed. As it is, it’s a jumble, its focus obscure, its motivation patronising. Still, put aside your frustration, and there are wonders all about. The earliest work is The Piano (1943), a small oil on paper depicting a window, a grand piano and various objects balanced on it. In a way, it’s perfectly ordinary: so many artists were then making work just like this. But it comes with a whiff of Bloomsbury that reminds you of Heron’s other, secondary vocation as a writer about art in the tradition of Roger Fry. And it underlines the fact, entirely lost here, that when Heron and the likes of Victor Pasmore slipped into abstraction in the 1950s, it really was an art world drama, for all that it seemed to them to be so seamless, a wholly natural thing. In this context, Christmas Eve (1951) appears as a kind of bridge between the two modes. Here is a fuggy, frenzied room, all children and candles, only you have to get your eye in to see it, and its colours have to do with summertime rather than winter. Heron’s early adventures in abstraction have an experimental feel, as if he’s working something out. “The reason why stripes sufficed,” he said of Green and Mauve Horizontals: January 1958, “was precisely that they were so very uncomplicated as shapes.” Much more exciting to me is Camellia Garden: March 1956, a dappled vista that suggests so powerfully an abundance of blood red and pale primrose petals, you’re half-tempted to sniff the air. After this, however, a great leap forward (again, neither he nor the curators see it like this). He has the chutzpah of the great Americans (Pollock, De Kooning), but his face is turned resolutely towards France (here, most of all, is Matisse). Impossible not to come over a little swoony in the presence of Square Green with Orange, Violet and Lemon: 1969 and Complex Greens, Reds and Orange: July 1976 - January 1977 with their fascinating patterns, their almost violent juxtapositions of colour. Give them the time, and they seem almost to hum, their good vibrations filling you quite blissfully with thoughts of life and love and liberty. • Patrick Heron is at Tate St Ives until 30 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-style-cladding-could-be-banned-on-tower-blocks-government-says","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T11:51:47Z","webTitle":"Grenfell-style cladding could be banned on tower blocks, government says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-style-cladding-could-be-banned-on-tower-blocks-government-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/grenfell-style-cladding-could-be-banned-on-tower-blocks-government-says","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell-style cladding could be banned on tower blocks, government says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Combustible cladding could be banned on high-rise buildings in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire despite a review of building regulations concluding it was not necessary. On a chaotic day at Westminster, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, announced a consultation on a ban as he outlined new building safety rules to reduce “buck passing” on projects and require builders to demonstrate they have taken “decisive action to reduce building safety risk”. Earlier, Dame Judith Hackitt, who the government appointed to review building regulations in the wake of the disaster that cost 72 lives, had proposed a new standards regulator as the centrepiece of a reformed building safety system that will increase the priority of safety in buildings. But her report concluded that combustible materials such as those that spread the fire at Grenfell did not need to be prohibited because “restricting or prohibiting certain practices, will not address the root causes [of risk]”. As survivors and MPs responded with anger, she then said she would in fact support a ban if Brokenshire proposed it. The conflicting announcements by Hackitt and then the government undermined what many at Westminster hoped was an opportunity to rebuild public confidence in building safety which has been shattered since the Grenfell Tower fire and the subsequent discovery that over 300 other high rise buildings wrapped in similar combustible materials. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said it “beggars belief” that Hackitt had not called for a ban on combustible cladding and insulation and told the government: “Don’t consult on it. Do it.” Survivors said they were disappointed and saddened that Hackitt had rejected their calls for a ban and David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, described her report as a “betrayal and a whitewash”. Architects, councils and fire experts also condemned the approach of both Hackitt and the government. Shahin Sadafi, the chair of Grenfell United whose family lived at Grenfell, said: “Worrying that a fire like Grenfell could happen again is something that keeps many of us awake at night. When we met Dame Judith Hackitt we asked her for an outright ban on combustible cladding. We are disappointed and saddened that she didn’t listen to us and she didn’t listen to other experts.” Hackitt also stopped short of banning controversial desktop studies, which can be used to justify using certain materials without a fire test. She said she wanted desktop studies to be carried out only by qualified people, which she said would effectively stop unregulated fire engineers from declaring systems safe. But she said the detailed results of those tests should remain commercially confidential. The announcements left residents and building owners unsure of how to make their high rise buildings safe. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said owners still “need to know what they can use to replace dangerous cladding and insulation”. Flammable insulation and cladding panels are currently being stripped from dozens of high rise buildings in England and Wales and the prime minister said on Wednesday the government would spend £400m to help councils and registered social landlords remove the cladding, suggesting to many that ministers consider it unacceptable. The row over cladding overshadowed Hackitt’s ambitious proposals for reform of building safety which she said had become a “race to the bottom”. She said the building regulations were “not fit for purpose” and said a new independent national body to approve designs was needed. It would be backed by powers to levy unlimited fines and even imprison architects, building owners and builders responsible for the worst safety breaches. Hackitt said the new system should first focus on buildings of 10 storeys or more. Currently safety approvals are given by councils or private inspection companies but would in future be decided by the new Joint Competent Authority made up of local authority building standards, fire and rescue authorities and Health and Safety Executive officials. Some in the industry warned that if the government adopts the new system it would increase costs of building significantly and slow it down, which is likely to be a concern for ministers who have made pledges to accelerate housebuilding. “We do not want to have to wait for a tragedy like Grenfell before we apply the full criminal sanctions of the law,” said Hackitt. “We have to get to a position where people putting lives at risk by what they’re doing gets picked up at the time and there’s sanctions applied there and then, not in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy like Grenfell.” Hackitt found rates of enforcement action against breaches of building regulations had fallen 75% in the last decade. But she argued there shouldn’t be prescription about what materials can and can’t be used and the onus should be on the “construction industry to take responsibility for the delivery of safe buildings rather than looking to others to tell them what is or is not acceptable”. She said: “It will be important now for industry to show leadership in driving this forward.” Hackitt said people did not bother to read regulations and when they did, they did not understand them. She said concerns were ignored during the building process because “the primary motivation is to do things as quickly and cheaply as possible rather than to deliver quality homes” and that some builders use the ambiguity of the regulations to “game the system”. She also said people in the industry did not know who was in charge and that enforcement was patchy with penalties so small as to be ineffective. She said the new regulatory framework must also address the fact that “residents often go unheard, even when safety issues are identified”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/21/the-ethics-of-wearing-feathers-its-not-just-live-plucking-thats-a-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:56:07Z","webTitle":"The ethics of wearing feathers: it's not just live-plucking that's a problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/21/the-ethics-of-wearing-feathers-its-not-just-live-plucking-thats-a-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/21/the-ethics-of-wearing-feathers-its-not-just-live-plucking-thats-a-problem","fields":{"headline":"The ethics of wearing feathers: it's not just live-plucking that's a problem","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The red carpet has been a hotbed of sartorial protest this year, with influential people opting to express their politics through their wardrobe. But as many celebrities scramble for the moral high ground, some controversial guests have slipped under the radar. They go by a few names – marabou, ostrich, peacock – and accompanied Angelina Jolie to the Critics’ Choice awards, Lupita Nyong’o to the Cannes film festival and Katy Perry to the Met Gala. Yes, feathers are suddenly everywhere again – not only in the wardrobes of glossy style icons, but also on embellished fascinators (as worn by the Duchess of Cornwall at the royal wedding) and in a sizeable proportion of the nation’s pillows, parkas and duvets. Yet, in some quarters, there is a growing discomfort with them. The fashion industry has a celebrated history with feathers. They were one of Coco Chanel’s favourite motifs, frequently used as embellishments in her collections, as well as those of her contemporaries Cristóbal Balenciaga, Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. The late Alexander McQueen was inspired by the feather – “[its] colours, its graphics, its weightlessness and its engineering” – and used it elaborately in his designs. Fastforward a decade, to the recent spring/summer 2018 fashion shows, and feathers fluttered down the catwalks of fashion houses including Saint Laurent, Maison Margiela and Moschino, making them a high street trend right about now. This pervasiveness goes some way to explaining why feathers have not rung the same alarm bells in the public consciousness as animal products such as fur and exotic skins. “Opinion polls show that the overwhelming majority of Brits would never dream of wearing real fur – because most have a clear idea by now of the ways in which animals suffer on fur farms and when caught in steel-jaw traps in the wild,” says Yvonne Taylor, the director of corporate projects at Peta. “However, many shoppers are still unaware of the cruelty inherent in the down and feather industries.” Peta claims that “workers in China – the source of 80% of the world’s down – forcefully restrain geese and rip their feathers out as they struggle and scream”. The organisation recently made headlines when it accused Canada Goose of mistreating the geese in its supply chain (an allegation that was denied by the outerwear brand). However, activists have been trying to highlight the negative impact of feathers for years – in 1890s Boston, socialites Harriet Lawrence Hemenway and Minna Hall staged tea parties to try to persuade their rich friends to stop buying hats with real plumage. So, can feathers ever be ethical? Clearly, live-plucking is not, given the distress the process causes to the animals, but what if you source feathers from the owner of a peacock that sheds its train once a year after mating season? The law on picking up feathers, designed to protect wild birds, is complex. “Finding and collecting feathers that have fallen from birds in nature sounds nice – but it isn’t a viable business model to supply designers with the volume of feathers they demand,” says Taylor. “Peta has found that whenever parts of animals are used in the fashion industry, corners are cut and abuse is commonplace.” The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the unethical sourcing of various animals, while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna compels signatories to ensure that the trade of wild animals does not threaten their survival. However, Peta – and a number of other animal-welfare groups – argue that it is impossible to track feathers back to their source because the physical products all look the same. As Taylor says: “There’s simply no fail-safe way to ensure that ducks, geese, chickens, ostriches and emus haven’t suffered for feather items.” But some retailers claim they can – including the British department store John Lewis, which sells a number of feather products, including coats and duvets. Its policy on bird and animal welfare and ethical sourcing says it can account for each stage of its own-brand production line, which uses only feathers that are a by-product of the food chain. It has set a 2020 target for its suppliers to meet the Responsible Down Standard (RDS) – which prohibits force-feeding and the removal of feathers from live birds and audits each stage in a retailer’s supply chain to ensure that down and feathers come as a by-product from healthy animals – or Downpass 2017, which has similar requirements. Some fashion brands, including H&amp;M, The North Face, Levi’s, Sorel and Lululemon, already comply with the RDS. The milliner Stephen Jones, who uses barn-fowl feathers (chicken, duck, turkey, goose, grouse, pheasant and ostrich) in his elaborate headpieces “to heighten movement, delicacy or to create dynamic line”, says he has always abided by the guidelines on the exploitation of feathers laid down in 1905 by the US non-profit conservation group the Audubon Society. He believes using feathers “is not the same as using exotic skins or fur, because the feathers that are used in millinery are a byproduct of food production,” beyond which it is “a personal point of view; whether you are carnivore, vegetarian, vegan”. He is, however, open to alternatives. “I make feathers out of tulle, plastics and other materials,” he says. Many others employ artisans to make feathers from mass-farmed poultry look like the plumes of exotic creatures. Art curator Karen Van Godtsenhoven, who staged one of the most famous celebrations of feathers, Birds of Paradise: Plumes &amp; Feathers, at the fashion museum MoMu in Antwerp in 2014, cites Paris-based Lemaire. She says the 137-year-old atelier, which supplies Chanel to this day, “can make a chicken feather look like it was plucked from a bird of paradise”. So, where can we go from here? Peta suggests that designers make vegan alternatives to animal products from recycled and sustainable materials, just as British designer Stella McCartney does for leather, but in an ideal world it wants all retailers to follow the lead of Topshop, Sweaty Betty and Asos by banning feathers from their products. Short of that, in the same way that the world has woken up to the ethical implications of fast fashion, retailers need to provide production-chain transparency, winning trust with specific policies that inform shoppers that their feathers have been responsibly sourced. For campaigners such as Taylor, however, this approach will never be enough. In her view, “all feathers are stolen property” – no matter how they were sourced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/21/uk-engineerings-gender-imbalance-is-embarrassing-leading-figure-says","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"UK engineering's gender imbalance is embarrassing, leading figure says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/uk-engineerings-gender-imbalance-is-embarrassing-leading-figure-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/21/uk-engineerings-gender-imbalance-is-embarrassing-leading-figure-says","fields":{"headline":"UK engineering's gender imbalance is embarrassing, leading figure says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The failure of British engineering companies to increase the proportion of women they employ above 10% is a source of embarrassment, one of the profession’s leading figures has said. Hayaatun Sillem, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said the gender imbalance was particularly frustrating given the significant progress made by other countries and in professions like law and medicine. “I feel almost ashamed that I have to go there and talk about the statistics that we have on women in engineering after decades of effort,” she said. “Engineers have a huge role in designing the infrastructure of the world around us and designing algorithms embedded in the world around us. It cannot be healthy that they don’t reflect the broader society that those algorithms and that infrastructure serves.” Britain’s record on employing female engineers remains the worst in Europe, with Latvia, Cyprus and Bulgaria, where about 30% of the engineering workforce are women, and Sweden (26%) and Italy (20%) all having far better records. While other countries have moved on from the “white man in a hard-hat” engineering stereotype, Sillem said, in Britain the profession’s image remains “incredibly highly gendered”. “We’re at the extreme end of the spectrum,” she said, adding that this has made it hard to attract people who could not envisage themselves working on industrial-scale construction projects. In reality, she said, the profession contributes to medical technologies, artificial intelligence and building efforts in the developing world. The academy is coordinating an industry-wide effort at communicating this to school pupils. Less than 10% of professional engineers are women in Britain. The figure is only about 15% for engineering students, exacerbating a huge shortfall in the number of engineers needed by industry. A recent report by Engineering UK suggests the country has a demand for about 124,000 engineers each year, but the actual number being appointed is 37,000-59,000 lower than this. Sillem, who was appointed in January, said that in some parts of industry, old-boy networks or macho work cultures may be contributing to a lack of diversity. “We’ve had some interesting insights into the culture at some of the big tech companies,” she said. “I don’t think it’s rational to decouple that from the lack of diversity ... there’s highly likely to be a connection.” Sillem said it was encouraging that fewer people today make the argument that there are so few women in engineering because girls have less interest or ability in the subject. “There’s a growing body of evidence that debunks that myth,” she said, pointing out that in countries like Malaysia and Oman the engineering workforce is 50% female. “The evidence just does not support the idea that there’s something inherent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/17/whitney-review-cannes-2018-kevin-macdonald","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T14:55:56Z","webTitle":"Whitney review – a heartbreaking portrait of celebrity self-destruction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/17/whitney-review-cannes-2018-kevin-macdonald","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/17/whitney-review-cannes-2018-kevin-macdonald","fields":{"headline":"Whitney review – a heartbreaking portrait of celebrity self-destruction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Oh Whitney, will we ever get over you? Film-makers aren’t yet close to doing so: newly premiered at Cannes, Kevin Macdonald’s polished and rather stoic documentary is the second in the space of a year to map the crushingly sad trajectory of Whitney Houston’s blazing star burnout, which, as we all glumly remember, ended in a Beverly Hills bathtub six years ago. The forcefully acted, Oscar-grabbing biopic can’t be far off. As Macdonald’s film hits the long latter portion of its rise-and-fall narrative – raking over facts we already know, images of ruin we’ve already seen, and heading inexorably to an anatomy of her death that Nick Broomfield’s scrappier documentary Whitney: Can I Be Me took us through last year – I felt my throat tightening and my tear ducts prickling. As the crystalline opening notes of I Have Nothing cued the closing credits, I cried, again, as I had suspected I would from the get-go. You can arrange and present the facts of Houston’s life any which way and attract viewers like me. Three years after Asif Kapadia’s Amy, Whitney returns us to the experience of watching complete self-destruction – of a voice, of a career, of a woman – and being powerless to halt any of it, to offer any care that she might notice or feel. Celebrity culture breaks your heart if you let it and Macdonald knows that: Whitney conducts its interviews and picks out its archive footage with distant journalistic reserve, intercutting it with perfunctory reels of 80s and 90s global affairs, counting on our existing relationship to her self-explanatory tragedy to do all the emotional needling. This pragmatic approach is not without its compromises. Macdonald’s film is essentially the authorised counterpart to Broomfield’s more speculative, contributor-starved one, with an impressive ensemble of Houston’s family and friends involved as talking heads. That is a mixed blessing, yielding insights and roadblocks in roughly equal measure. Houston’s hard-edged mother, Cissy, is on board, although tellingly only towards the beginning: she is happier to talk about what made her daughter than what broke her. Houston’s calamitous ex-husband, Bobby Brown, surprisingly shows up too, though he has nothing to offer: “Drugs have nothing to do with her,” he says clammily to camera. Thanks for nothing, Bobby, now as ever. The collaboration of the star’s nearest-and-questionably-dearest does gift the film with one breathtaker of an allegation: that Houston, as a child, was sexually abused by her soul-singing cousin Dee Dee Warwick, sister of Dionne. It’s a bombshell that the film guards almost too protectively, planning and pacing its emergence so carefully that its ramifications feel almost curtailed. Broomfield would have given his eye teeth for that information, not least because of the context it lends to the much-debated issue of her sexuality – the thematic spine of his film centred movingly on Houston’s intense, stymied, possibly lesbian relationship with her best friend, Robyn Crawford. Macdonald, meanwhile, addresses it more passingly, not managing to draw Brown or Cissy Houston on the evidently contentious subject of Crawford – who, once more, is pointedly not available for interview. One of Houston’s brothers is slightly less tight-lipped, going so far as to describe Crawford as “evil”. The oppressive, strangling presence of homophobia is heavily felt in this increasingly dark family portrait, although Macdonald can’t seem to press further. As this dense, disagreement-strewn coterie of relatives and advisers continues to weigh in, it is Houston’s own presence that recedes, quite deliberately, from the enterprise. There’s less interview footage than you might expect; performance sequences are few, often drawn from her tattered period rather than her all-too-brief golden age. Beaming, hot-pink flashes of her face from the I Wanna Dance With Somebody video are used as teasing, near-spectral flashes throughout, but we never get the ecstatic whole. It’s a film principally and poignantly focused on the absence of Whitney, an aching void felt as much in life as in death. Many of us missed Whitney even before she left; this imperfect documentary preys calmly and effectively on that longing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/29/a-total-blast-our-writers-pick-their-favorite-summer-blockbusters-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"'A total blast': our writers pick their favorite summer blockbusters ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/29/a-total-blast-our-writers-pick-their-favorite-summer-blockbusters-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/29/a-total-blast-our-writers-pick-their-favorite-summer-blockbusters-ever","fields":{"headline":"'A total blast': our writers pick their favorite summer blockbusters ever","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Face/Off (1997) Madman bomber Nicolas Cage stole John Travolta’s dead son’s life. So gloomy FBI agent Travolta steals Cage’s face. When Cage steals his face – and his wife and freedom – John Woo’s Face/Off becomes the biggest, wackiest and most operatic summer blockbuster in history, a gonzo combustion that flings everything from pigeons to peaches at the screen. Hong Kong cineastes might applaud a script with roots in the ancient Sichuan opera genre Bian Lian, where performers swap masks like magic. Popcorn-munchers, of which I am front row center, are here to watch whack job Cage and soulful Travolta, two actors who love to go full-ham, play each other and go deep inside their iconographies. Call it hamception. Or just call it a crazy swing that hits a home run as Cavolta and Trage battling it out in a warehouse, a speedboat and, of course, a church. As Cage-as-Travolta gloats to Travolta-as-Cage, “Isn’t this religious? The eternal battle between good and evil, saint and sinners – but you’re still not having any fun!” Maybe he’s not, but we sure are. Bravo, bravo. AN Edge of Tomorrow (2014) There’s been an increasing sense of desperation clinging to the majority of roles picked by Tom Cruise in recent years. Outside of the still shockingly entertaining Mission: Impossible series, he was miscast in the barely serviceable Jack Reacher and its maddeningly unnecessary sequel, his awards-aiming American Made was throwaway and his franchise-starting The Mummy was a franchise-killer. But four summers ago, he picked the right horse just maybe at the wrong time. Because despite how deliriously fun Edge of Tomorrow was in the summer of 2014, audiences didn’t show the requisite enthusiasm. It was a moderate success (enough to warrant a long-gestating sequel) but it should have packed them in, its combination of charm, invention and sheer thrills making it one of the most objectively successful blockbuster experiences in memory. The nifty plot device (Cruise must relive a day of dying while battling aliens over and over again) allowed for some dark gallows humor and a frenetic pace that kept us all giddily on edge while it also contained a dazzling action star turn from Emily Blunt whose fearless ‘Full Metal Bitch’ wrestled the film away from Cruise. Blame its relative failure on the bland title? Cruise fatigue? Blockbuster over-saturation? Then find a digital copy to watch and rewatch and repeat. BL Back to the Future (1985) Back to the Future very nearly wasn’t a summer blockbuster. The reshoots required after Eric Stoltz was booted off, then the fact Michael J Fox’s Family Ties commitments meant he could only shoot at night all meant filming didn’t wrap until late April. Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg duly pencilled in an August / September release. But then people started seeing it. Test scores were off the scale. Said producer Frank Marshall: “I’d never seen a preview like that. The audience went up to the ceiling”. So they bagsied the best spot the year had to offer – 3 July – hired a squad of sound editors to work round the clock and two print editors with instructions to get properly choppy. They did, and those big trims tightened yet further one of the tautest screenplays (by Bob Gale) cinema has ever seen. The only bit of fat they left was the Johnny B Goode scene: sure, it didn’t advance the story, but the kids at those test screenings knew we were gonna love it. Back to the Future is a pure shot of summer cinema: grand, ambitious, insanely entertaining. Deadpool, Avengers, take note: a blockbuster can be smart as hell so long as it wears it lightly. In the end, by the way, the film spent 11 weeks at number 1 at the US box office. That’s essentially the whole summer. CS Teminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) The first film I ever saw at the cinema was The Rocketeer. We drove into Bradford city centre, bought our tickets at the Odeon and sat through the 1991 tale which followed the fortunes of a stunt pilot, a rocket pack and a Nazi agent played by Timothy Dalton who sounded like he was from Bury rather than Berlin. The way into the multiplex there was a huge poster for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Arnie sat on a Harley with a shotgun cocked and ready. My dad was a huge fan of the original but he still couldn’t swing taking a seven-year-old to see it. It wasn’t until I borrowed a VHS copy that I finally got to see what was behind that image. Skynet, dipshits, T-1000s, a nuclear holocaust and a motorbike chases on the LA river. Blockbusters don’t usually have that edge: there’s a more brazen mainstream appeal. But Judgment Day was and still is an exception. It did huge numbers at the box office (more than $500m), was a rare sequel that was arguably better than the original and introduced really odd bits of Spanish idiom into the Bradford schoolyard lexicon. I probably would have been scarred for life watching it as a seven-year-old, but as a teenager it gave me a story I doubt I’ll ever get tired of revisiting. LB The Dark Knight (2008) The summer of 2008 was a busy one: Barack Obama emerged from a contentious democratic primary to become the first ever black presidential nominee of a major party. The dam fortifying the entire global financial system was about to burst. China hosted its first ever Summer Olympics. But somehow, and not exactly to my credit, what I remember most from that summer is the uncanny, ridiculously over-the-top publicity blitzkrieg that preceded the release of The Dark Knight, which has since emerged as not just an all-time great summer blockbuster, but an all-time great American film, period. There were faux-political billboards that read “I believe in Harvey Dent”; a weirdly nondescript website of the same name; Joker playing cards dispersed throughout comic book stores, which led fans to another website where the DA was defaced with clown makeup. Dentmobiles, Gotham City voter registration cards, a pop-up local news channel: the marketing campaign might have seemed excessive had the movie not so convincingly topped it. Ten years later, as films like Deadpool and Avengers: Infinity War try to reach those same heights of virality, The Dark Knight remains the measuring stick by which every superhero movie, and superhero villain, is measured. JN Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) In many ways, Fury Road is summer: arid, scorching, bright enough to be squinted at. The driving force behind all the high-impact driving is scarcity of water, the essence of life in a desert where death practically rises up from the burning sand. Even in the air-conditioned comfort of a multiplex auditorium in Washington DC’s Chinatown, watching George Miller’s psychotic motor opera left this critic sweaty and parched. “My world is fire and blood,” warns the weary Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in the script’s opening lines. Staggering out of a theater into the oppressive rays of the sun, it sure can feel that way. Miller’s masterpiece fits into the summer blockbuster canon in a less literal capacity as well, striking its ideal balance of dazzling technical spectacle and massively-scaled emotional catharsis. There was plenty of breathless praise to go around upon this film’s 2015 release, much of it for the feats of practical-effects daring, but the hysterical extremes of feeling cemented its status as a modern classic. I can’t deny that I’ve watched the polecat sequence upwards of a dozen times, but Miller’s film truly comes alive in Furiosa’s howl of desperation, and in Max’s noble disappearance into the throng. CB Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) It’s the music, it’s the giant boulder, it’s the Old Testament mysticism, it’s the whip, it’s the Cairo Swordsman, it’s Harrison Ford’s crooked smile, it’s the bad dates, it’s Karen Allen drinking a sherpa under the table, it’s the melted faces and exploding heads. It’s all these things plus having the good fortune of seeing this at the cinema at a very young age, therefore watching most of it through my terrified fingers. (Indy tells Marion to keep her eyes shut during the cosmic spooky ending; way ahead of you there!) The modern blockbuster as we know it was created by Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars, so the hype was unmatched when the two collaborated in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. As a kid I had no idea this was a loving homage to cliffhanger serials from the 30s and 40s, I took it as pure adventure. The seven-and-a-half minute desert truck chase (“I don’t know, I’m making thus up as I go”) is probably the best action sequence in all of cinema (John Woo’s Hard Boiled does not have a horse, sorry), but watching as an adult one notices a lot of sophisticated humor, too. (Indy being too exhausted to make love to Marion, for example, is something that didn’t connect when I was six.) It’s strange to think I watched these cartoon Nazis on VHS with my grandparents who had escaped the Holocaust, and no one benefits when you do the math to figure out how young Marion was when, as Indy puts it, “you knew what you were doing”. But for thrills, laughs and propulsive camerawork (though a little mild Orientalism), nothing tops this one. JH Independence Day (1996) Short of actually calling their film Summer Blockbuster, rarely can a film’s height-of-summer release date been so central to a film’s raison d’etre. This being the mid-90s, when po-mo and self-referentiality was all the rage, brazenly hooking your tentpole film to 4 July was seen as a pretty smart idea. Fortunately, all the ducks did line up in a row for ID4: a game-changing performance from Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum at (arguably) his funniest, a rousingly Clintoneque president in Bill Pullman and – most importantly in that run-up to the millennium – physical destruction on a gigantic scale. Much comment at the time was expended on the laser obliteration of the White House (an early shot from the Tea Party/Maga crowd?), but I personally cherish director Roland Emmerich’s signature move of detonating cars in somersault formation. Like many other huge-budget films then and since, Independence Day was basically a tooled-up retread of cheap-as-chips format of earlier decades – though who these days would roll such expensive dice on what is essentially an original script, with no comic book or toy branding as a forerunner? We shall never see its like again. AP Aliens (1986) An Aliens summer is one for moviegoers who prefer to sit in in darkened rooms when the sun is shining; the brutal confines of the fiery power plant make an excellent subliminal ad for air conditioning. In 1986, James Cameron took Ridley Scott’s elegant, iconic horror template and turned it into an all-out action blockbuster, forcing Ripley once again to face down her nemeses in a breathless fug of claustrophobia, sweat and fear. It’s relentlessly stressful and unbelievably thrilling. I first saw Aliens many years after its initial release. Owing to its sizeable and long-lasting legacy, it was at once immediately familiar, yet also brisk and brutally fresh. I understood that it was a classic, but I wasn’t prepared for just how good it is, for the pitch-perfect management of tension, the pace that never really lets up, the emotional pull. The maternal undertow of Ripley’s protection of Newt, and the alien mirror of that, adds a level of heart unusual in most blockbusters, and her frustration at being a woman whose authority must be earned again and again, and then proven again and again, remains grimly relevant, 30 years on. It’s also a total blast. Now get away from her, you bitch. RN Jaws (1975) It is the great summer blockbuster ancestor – the film that in 1975 more or less invented the concept of the event movie. And unlike all those other summer blockbusters, Steven Spielberg’s Jaws is actually about the summer; it is explicitly about the institution of the summer vacation, into which the movie was being sold as part of the seasonal entertainment. It is about the sun, the sand, the beach, the ocean and the entirely justified fear of being eaten alive by an enormous shark with the appetite of a serial killer and the cunning of a U-boat commander. And more than that: it is about that most contemporary of political phenomena: the coverup, the town authorities at a seaside resort putting vacationers at risk by not warning them about the shark. The “Jaws mayor” has become comic shorthand for the craven and pusillanimous politician. A blockbuster nowadays means spectacular digital effects, but this film is from an analogue world. It bust the block through brilliant film-making and an inspired score from John Williams, summoning up the shark with a simple two-note theme which became the most famous musical expression of evil since Bernard Herrmann’s shrieking violin stabs in Psycho took the place of actual knife-slashing. I still remember the excitement of the summer of 1975, and the queues around the block at the Empire, in Watford, round the corner from the football ground. The inspired brevity of the title meant the word was repeated over and over again to fill the marquee display: “JAWS – JAWS – JAWS” as if they were screaming it!

The boots, specially moulded for the shape of the Liverpool player’s feet, have been donated by Adidas to celebrate Salah winning the Golden Boot award for being this season’s top scorer in the Premier League. The footwear are an eye-catching, fun acquisition but one with a serious intent, the museum said. “The boots tell a story of a modern Egyptian icon, performing in the UK, with a truly global impact,” said Neal Spencer, the museum’s keeper of ancient Egypt and Sudan. Salah is this season’s footballing phenomenon, revered among Liverpool fans who call him the Egyptian king. He scored 32 Premier League goals in 2017-18, a record tally in a single 38-game season. The 25-year-old forward also has hero status in his home country and was a huge part of Egypt qualifying for this summer’s World Cup in Russia. The donation, believed to be the first football boots to enter the British Museum collection, is part of a wider modern Egypt project launched in 2016 to bolster its collection of contemporary Egyptian material. Spencer said the museum wanted to tell the story of day-to-day life in 20th- and 21st-century Egypt as well as ancient times covering topics which include sport, entertainment, international trade and design. The unused X17 Deadly Strike boots were this week photographed in front of the museum’s colossal statues of Ramesses II and Amenhotep III, but their first home from 24 May will be room 61, a gallery containing wall paintings from the tomb-chapel of Nebamun, a wealthy Egyptian official. They will be displayed near to ancient Egyptian footwear and gold pharaonic jewellery.

If you decided it would be useful to go to counselling to talk about it, how much would the therapist’s race matter? For Cambridge students, it’s emerged that the answer is “a lot”. Last month, while on-campus racism continued to grab headlines, Cambridge University’s counselling service made a vital shift in response to student demand: for the first time, black and minority ethnic (BME) students can now specifically request to see BME counsellors. As the welfare and rights officer, I pushed for the change; but the process raised a host of questions and challenges about the nature of counselling, and the way institutionalised support caters to students’ social and political identities. Conducting a student survey and report on BME students’ attitudes to and experiences of therapy, I found that 79% felt they would benefit from seeing a counsellor who was also BME. To me, this is not a surprise – we know that people of colour are more likely to experience mental health problems in the first place, are less likely to access services, and have poorer experiences within them when they do. So many aspects of mental health are informed by social creations – they don’t exist in a vacuum devoid of aspects of identity – and so our treatment and services should reflect this. The specific stressors people from ethnic minorities are up against can also be exacerbated in the university context. At Cambridge, although it is not the only example, we are in the extreme minority, and face racial profiling and stereotyping by staff, social alienation, and institutional barriers to attainment. We’re also routinely questioned about the validity and accuracy of our experiences of racism, as if they’re fantasies we’ve invented. The therapeutic environment is the last place a student wants to see these dynamics replicated – and I’ve seen students go as far as commuting to London to see therapists who “get it”. In the survey report, students described counselling experiences both in and outside Cambridge. When seeing white counsellors, students were often met with a lack of understanding when it came to race. The words “explaining”, “lecturing” and “teaching” came up more than once in students’ testimonials, demonstrating how therapy can quickly slip into providing emotional and educational labour just to get your therapist on the same page as you. Culturally relative family dynamics were also commonly misunderstood. For example, explaining that your parents aren’t controlling and over-involved, but that middle-class English parents tend to be more lax than in many cultures. Some students found the words and persisted, but some went once and never went back. Overt racism or ignorance was rare, but did happen; once in therapy a student was asked if his family happened to be fleeing a regime. But more commonly it was the little things – being asked what a microaggression was, if you’ve ever just thought about severing ties with your parents, or if you were really, 100% sure that something was racist. These are questions we’ve often dealt with, and don’t need to unravel. This conversation turns some fundamental assumptions about what therapy is about on their heads. Is it a neutral space? Can such a thing exist? A lot of the most specific challenges I’ve had have come from people I know who are therapists themselves. Some felt the goal of therapy was not to match clients to therapists, or even that differences in background were to be sought after in the therapeutic relationship. Perhaps it’s sometimes better for the listener to be removed from the problem – a more neutral entity that prompts the client to question their perceptions. Sometimes, yes. But we should let clients choose – if we truly feel uncomfortable and distant from the service provider, there’s a slim chance we’re going to progress. At Cambridge, we’re now guaranteed to be matched up with minority ethnic counsellors if we request it. We have enough BME counsellors to sustain the initiative – and through groups like the Black, African and Asian Therapy Network, we’ve found there are more minority ethnic practitioners in Cambridge than you would assume in such a white space. It’s a simple change at little expense, but it signals a fundamental shift towards client empowerment. However, we’re just one service within one university; all mental health service providers should be considering practical changes that might support people of colour, who are an at-risk group. While services commonly acknowledge the impact of gender on mental health (perhaps as counselling is a profession dominated by women), we often find ourselves afraid to talk about race – as if it’s a step too far in the direction of the “political” in an environment intended to be placid and neutral. But acknowledging race doesn’t have to be agitating. A one-size-fits-all approach is not the most nuanced way of tackling the student mental health crisis. The same groups will continue to slip through the cracks if our services do not respond to the social and political climates that they are inextricably intertwined with. Within services, people of colour deserve structures created for us, when the wider world is in so many ways structured against us.

So why not use sheep to take care of the grass, like they do in Berlin?” Montanari said the method was already used in Caffarella Park, a large protected area that forms part of the Appia Antica archaeological park in the south-east of the city. “We would like to extend it to other parks,” Montanari said. Cash-strapped authorities are struggling to maintain the city’s 44m square metres of green space, described by some as “a jungle”. The method has also been deployed in the northern city of Turin, which is also led by the Five Star Movement. But in Rome the proposals were mocked by campaign groups set up to protect the city’s parks. “What will we do with the faeces left by the sheep?” asked Massimo Proetti Rocchi, the president of Friends of Leopardi Park.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, have risen by around half in the past year. The new highs have prompted warnings that drivers face soaring petrol and diesel costs. Prices are at levels that will eat into appetite for oil and forecasters have revised downwards their expectations for demand growth this year. Experts said the rises would pose a challenge for central banks already coping with high inflation. “The biggest test may come in countries that are already seeing target or above-target inflation like the UK,” Craig Erlam, the senior market analyst at Oanda trading group, said. The rising oil price helped the FTSE 100 to a record closing price on Thursday as the London-based index closed at 7787.97, compared with a previous high of 7778.64 in January. Across Europe, shares in oil majors BP, Shell, Total and Eni were all up. Barclays bank has increased its prediction for the year’s average price from $62 to $73 per barrel and some banks are predicting oil could hit $100 next year. Here’s what’s driving up the cost of crude: Donald Trump The US president’s decision to unilaterally exit the nuclear deal with Iran caused markets to price in the impact of Iranian crude exports falling. Iran produces around 4% of global oil supplies, or about 2.4m barrels a day (mb/d). The Middle Eastern producer’s exports fell by around 1.2mb/d when sanctions were last imposed in 2012. This time around will be different as the European Union has said it is determined to keep alive the deal and will not be forcing sanctions on Tehran. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog, said: “It is too soon to say what will happen this time but we should examine whether other producers could step in to ensure an orderly flow of oil to the market and offset a disruption to Iranian exports.” Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, has already said it will work to fill any gap left by Iran. Saudi Arabia and Russia Nearly 17 months of cuts by major oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have made their mark. The curbs by the oil cartel Opec and partners have brought global oil supply and demand back into balance, to a degree that the IEA recently said it was “mission accomplished”. Together, Opec and Russia produce more than 40% of the world’s oil. Despite prices rising steadily under the restrictions, oil states have proved remarkably compliant and have not increased production as they have done during previous attempts to influence the market. The Saudi and Russian energy ministers have forged a partnership that they say has them “united shoulder to shoulder” and “completely aligned”. Opec members are expected to meet in Vienna to discuss whether the cuts should continue beyond the end of 2018, when they are due to expire. However, that decision has been complicated by: Venezuela The political and economic crises affecting the oil-rich South American country have resulted in its crude production going into freefall. The collapse has tightened oil markets much more quickly than anticipated, experts said. Output is down so much that Venezuela has cut production even more than Saudi Arabia, Opec’s biggest producer. The IEA paints a dire picture of an oil industry falling apart as conditions in the country worsen, with corruption issues, problems with payments and equipment breaking down. “Output from Venezuela’s ageing conventional oilfields is also fast declining. To make matters worse, Petróleos de Venezuela [the state-owned oil and gas company] has seen droves of its employees leave their jobs due to low wages and safety and security concerns,” the agency said. Geopolitics Iran and Venezuela are not the only sources of geopolitical instability causing oil prices to rise. “The ongoing escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, continuing conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen have significantly taken their toll on the region,” Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said. While a direct military confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia is seen as unlikely, any intensification of proxy conflicts in the region would undermine stability, the Japanese financial services group said. The IEA warned that recent geopolitical events had increased uncertainty over future global oil supplies. The global economy Globally, the economy is strong, with the IMF forecasting 3.9% growth this year. Healthy economic activity had been been an important factor in rising oil prices so far but observers are warning that crude is so expensive it will begin to dent demand for oil. “It would be extraordinary if such a large jump [since last year] did not affect demand growth,” the IEA said. The watchdog this week revised down global oil demand growth slightly from 1.5mb/d to 1.4mb/d, to reflect the impact of higher oil prices. Demand is expected to average 99.2mb/d this year. Another counterbalance to bullish prices is US shale oil production, which has boomed off the back of stronger oil prices. US production is at at record highs, up more than a quarter on levels only two years ago, and more than half where it stood a decade ago. However, Goldman Sachs said: “Shale cannot solve the current oil supply problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/17/per-kirkeby-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T14:16:25Z","webTitle":"Per Kirkeby obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/17/per-kirkeby-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/17/per-kirkeby-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Per Kirkeby obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Per Kirkeby, who has died aged 79, was one of the great experimenters of the so-called neo-expressionist style of painting. Alongside artists including Georg Baselitz and AR Penck, he rejected conceptualism, reviving a more emotional, instinctive approach to the canvas. “I’m a painter and have painted a painting,” he said. “And really, I don’t want to say anything more about it.” Yet the celebrated Danish artist, who had a 2009 retrospective at Tate Modern, also turned his hand to so much more in a career that spanned five decades, producing sculpture, architecture, films, poetry, art criticism, travel writing, ballet sets and theatrical costumes. Kirkeby’s first love, however, was geology, the discipline that informed much of this polymathic output. His oil paintings are notable for their muddy colours. A series of untitled canvases from the 1980s are typical. In one, from 1980, three metres by two, swirls of mossy greens are consumed by swathes of earthy browns. Streaks of yellow glint through. Tangles of thick brown strokes frame the composition. Kirkeby’s canvases retained their organic palette throughout his career, his work oscillating between outright abstraction and landscape painting, often within a single composition. His Wald-Variation (Forest–Variation) series from 1989 is rich with gestural green and blue brushstrokes, for example, yet at various points the outline of a tree or boulder, painted in black, is clear. Likewise Kirkeby’s bronze sculptures, which he made from 1981 onwards, are both abstract lumps and representations of the rocks that he studied on the field trips he made throughout his life. Per was born in Copenhagen to Alfred Kirkeby Christensen, an engineer and admirer of Tito, and Lucy Bertelsen, an avowed communist. As a teenager, he was sent on trips to Moscow, Berlin and Warsaw as part of a communist youth group. At Grundtvigskolen high school in a working-class area of Copenhagen, Per, who was dyslexic, gravitated to art. But on attending the Vestre Borgerdyd Gymnasium, he recalled struggling with drawing in art class, leading him to take geology at the University of Copenhagen instead. There, however, he refined his sketching skills during several field trips to Greenland, first to Narssaq in 1958 and then to the west coast in 1960. On one such trip Kirkeby and a colleague were confronted by a polar bear. Fearing for their lives, the animal was shot, through its left eye – “the only way you can kill a polar bear,” Kirkeby would later claim. In 1962, while at university, Kirkeby approached Poul Gernes, a leading light in Danish conceptualism and asked if he might join Gernes’s experimental school. Kirkeby had the naive idea that Gernes could teach him etching. Gernes agreed he would mentor the 24-year-old but at their first meeting took a copper sheet and smashed it with a hammer. “Here,” the older artist said, handing back the crumpled metal. “This is etching.” Hypnotised, Kirkeby embraced the avant-garde fluxus movement. By the time he graduated from university in 1964, having written his dissertation on the geological mapping of the southern Peary Land peninsula, Greenland, over the last 2.6m years, the quaternary period, he had already travelled to Düsseldorf, on Gernes’s encouragement, to take part in a sound work, Siberian Symphony, by Joseph Beuys. With an artist’s grant from the Danish government, the early 60s was a time of rampant experimentation for Kirkeby. While continuing his geological work – in 1965 he went to Greenland again, on a meteorite expedition to Melville Bay – he published three collections of poetry, a novel and a book of essays (notwithstanding his dyslexia), participated in various happenings and, in 1967, travelled to New York with the Korean-American artist Nam June Paik, a figure credited as the founder of video art. Influenced by Andy Warhol, Kirkeby produced his first short film in 1968, a portrait of Brigitte Bardot. His painting at the time was similarly influenced by pop art, if prosaically so, using household emulsion and collaged fragments of magazines on hardboard. His first exhibition, in the annex of the Den Frie artist’s association in Copenhagen in 1964, included Car Pictures, a single work over four panels. If the 60s saw Kirkeby in step with the prevailing artistic fashions, in the following decade he fell out with Gernes and embraced painting and its history, establishing his own neo-expressionistic style, loosely associated with the German painting scene that included Baselitz, Penck, Markus Lüpertz and Jörg Immendorff. “As I picked up a tube and carefully squeezed a little oil paint on to the palette” he recalled. “I felt a huge burden of history weighing down on my shoulders.” The German artists were represented by the gallerist Michael Werner, who visited Kirkeby’s studio in 1974. Kirkeby had his first exhibition at Werner’s Cologne space the same year. In 1976 he represented Denmark at the Venice Biennale (and returned to exhibit three further times, in 1980, 1993 and 1997), and took part in two editions of the quinquennial Documenta, in Kassel, Germany, in 1982 and 1992. In 1985 Nicholas Serota gave him a solo show at the Whitechapel Gallery in London and, again under Serota’s patronage, Kirkeby had a retrospective at Tate Modern in 2009. Yet, still, a single medium could never satisfy him. In 1973 Kirkeby exhibited his first large-scale brick sculpture, in Ikast, Jutland, a work that combined quintessential Danish red brick with Mayan architectural design, inspired by a trip to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala two years earlier. His public brickworks, which he referred to as “buildings without purpose”, can be found across Europe, including outside the German National Library, in Frankfurt, and the DR Byen station in Copenhagen, and as a series of five interconnecting arches and windows built on a grassy slope overlooking a fjord in the Norwegian county of Nordland. Not all the brick projects rejected utilitarianism however: in 1997 and 2000 he built bus shelters in the German towns of Munster and Neuss. In 2000 Kirkeby was commissioned to make eight rock-like bronze sculptures for the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house, in Berlin, and in 2005 he installed four bronzes at Copenhagen’s newly opened opera house. He painted murals for the rotunda of the Geological Museum, Copenhagen, and the Royal Danish Library, and on the ceiling of the auditorium at Aarhus University. Kirkeby enjoyed a long friendship with the film director Lars von Trier, and created title cards for Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000) and Antichrist (2009). In 1999 he turned his hand to scenography and costume, creating designs for New York City Ballet’s production of Swan Lake. “I always thought that an artist should not be easy to ‘catch’, to ‘put in a box’,” he said in an interview in 2009. In 2013 Kirkeby fell down a flight of stairs at his home in Copenhagen, hitting his head and suffering brain injury. As documented in the 2015 film Man Falling by Anne Wivel, the accident affected his memory and, often not recognising his own work, he did not paint again. He is survived by his third wife, Mari Anne Duus Jørgensen, whom he married in 2005, and four children: Sophus and Absalon, from his marriage to the film producer Vibeke Windeløv; Rebecca, from his marriage to Elisabeth Therkildsen; and Charlotte, from another relationship. His first two marriages ended in divorce. • Per Kirkeby, artist, born 1 September 1938; died 9 May 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/may/26/bristol-university-faces-growing-anger-after-student-suicides","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Bristol University  faces growing anger after student suicides","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/26/bristol-university-faces-growing-anger-after-student-suicides","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/26/bristol-university-faces-growing-anger-after-student-suicides","fields":{"headline":"Bristol University  faces growing anger after student suicides","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is exam season at the University of Bristol. Midweek the campus is quiet. Students emerge periodically from exam halls chatting with their friends. The university Twitter feed is full of posts about support services and how to deal with exam stress. There’s advice about deep breathing, offers of exam stress management workshops and free swimming and sports sessions. The backdrop to this year’s exam season, sadly as with the last, is mounting concern about student mental health. In the frantic three-week revision period running up to end-of-year exams, three Bristol university students have died suddenly. There have now been 10 student deaths in little over 18 months, a number of which have been confirmed as suicide. “There’s a real sense of anxiety and worry, which is entirely appropriate,” said Prof Hugh Brady, Bristol University’s vice-chancellor. “When you have three deaths in such quick succession – at any time of year, but especially just coming up to exams – it’s a worrying time for the institution.” After more than a year in the media spotlight, the mood among students at the prestigious Russell Group university appears to be shifting from a sense of bewilderment to one of growing anger. Students who have felt helpless in the face of each reported death are now mobilising. About 400-500 people took part in a march in the city on Friday to demand changes to mental health services at the university. Meanwhile, staff, who are doing their best to support students, feel “besieged” and “hurt” by criticism of university services. Some members of the pastoral team are on antidepressants themselves and have been in touch with Samaritans for support. One senior member of the team described how when a troubled student disappears, staff are terrified of going into their room for fear of what they will find. “It’s very, very tense indeed,” he said. Vulnerable students in his care have his personal phone number; last weekend he was up at 3.30am with a student who was having a panic attack. Students are also increasingly irritated by the university’s boasts about spending an additional £1m on wellbeing services, which they say pales into insignificance compared with the £300m being spent on the university’s new Temple Quarter campus near the railway station, part of a massive expansion programme. “We want him [Brady] to deal with the wellbeing of his current students before he brings in more and more students who may also be suffering,” said Ed Southgate, 20, a second-year English student who has suffered from mental health problems. “The support available is good. The problem is there’s not enough of it. He should make sure there are enough services for the people who are here before recruiting more students.” There are plenty of staff and students who believe the university is doing everything it can to improve mental health services and support troubled students. There will be new daily drop-in sessions from next week run with mental health charities and an additional 1,800 hours of counselling have been provided this term. “We certainly have not got everything right,” said one academic, “but each individual member of staff cares deeply about their students. Everybody is doing the best they can with the resources they have. Like everybody else, we are trying to grasp what’s going on. As an institution, we are trying to do the best we can. But there is no silver bullet.” Ruth Day, 19, a first-year maths and philosophy student, was one of the organisers of Friday’s march. She came to university with a diagnosed mental illness; she struggled during freshers’ week and took herself to hospital. A few weeks later, she took an overdose. “Being at home, I was in the care of my parents,” she said. “Here, I was in a new city. I had no health support; I didn’t know what to do. “When you get to a Russell Group university, you are used to being top of your class. At school I was used to getting 90% for my work. At university 60% is brilliant. That disparity was something I really struggled with. At school, you are used to being a big fish. Here you are just one face in a sea of faces and it feels very isolating.” Under the university’s fitness-to-study procedure, Day was deemed unfit to continue her studies. She was suspended and told to go home. “I was not allowed on university premises. I was a risk to myself and the university community.” The university stresses that the fitness-to-study procedure is rarely used, only in the most extreme circumstances for the protection of vulnerable students. Day, who got four A* grades at A-level, said the process made her feel worse. “I felt I had just completely messed up my entire future and my education because I was too sick to study,” she said. “When you are low and the university takes everything away from you, you feel lower than ever. I felt like they had seen student deaths happen before and they were scared I would be the next one. I felt they were worried about their reputation.” Brady, who trained in medicine, disputes this and said the policy was only ever used in the interests of a student’s welfare. “The last thing on our minds would be institutional reputation,” he said. Day is now back at university after appearing before a fitness-to study panel, which she found intimidating. “It made me feel like I had done something wrong, like I was in a disciplinary hearing.” Allowed to return, she felt on tenterhooks, terrified the university would suspend her again. “I felt I had to be the epitome of good health and good work ethic or I would be kicked out again.” Isaac Haigh, 22, a third-year chemistry student, said he was lucky to be able to access counselling quickly last summer because most students had left for the holidays; during term, students seeking help can face long waits. The university said there was a six-week waiting list for counselling, which compares favourably with other universities, but some students say they waited far longer to get the help they need, which may be down to a triage system prioritising patients. “You have to be so proactive to get help,” said Haigh, who has delayed his studies for a year. “If you have a mental health issue, it’s so debilitating. We need a more proactive system from the university, instead of them just offering us a hyperlink to a website. It’s so impersonal.” Emily Sykes, 20, a second-year English student, who suffers from anxiety, said that when she sought help she was encouraged to take antidepressants. “I had less than a 10-minute assessment and they decided they wanted to give me pills. But I don’t feel like it’s the right thing for me.” On the University of Bristol pages of the Tab student news website, one student who suffered a mental health crisis said they had missed lectures for an entire term but did not hear from a single member of staff. A parent of another student criticised what they described as “institutional indifference” as universities expand and pastoral care fails to keep up. “Even for the most resilient young person, being a number and not a person can have a huge impact,” they wrote. “Add into the mix social pressures, perhaps study worries or poor physical health, and the environment can quickly become toxic. Being largely invisible to the organisation that is invested with the job of helping you get a degree doesn’t exactly help. “The thrill of independence can quickly be replaced by loneliness and anxiety if there is a sense that no one really cares how you are getting on. Yes, students are adults, but they are also young people in transition and I think all universities should accept more responsibility and a greater duty of care for the general wellbeing of students at their institution.” Meanwhile, there is ongoing resistance to plans to update the university’s pastoral care system in halls of residence, where live-in academic staff currently act as wardens and deputy wardens. The university wants to introduce a 24/7 service run by dedicated, trained staff; students say the current system provides a caring backdrop in halls and a familiar, friendly face that students can approach. “Every student death is a tragedy,” said Brady. “To have a number in quick succession just amplifies that. It’s been very difficult as you can imagine. It’s a very emotional and charged situation at the moment. We are trying to do everything we can to help staff, to help students. Of course, it’s exam time which certainly amplifies things. “We are very aware of the depth of feeling among students. Some students are very upset and concerned, and want to ensure that the correct level of resource is put in place. They are really worried about their mental health and that of their colleagues. It’s something we are in dialogue with them about.” Brady said it was an issue that was affecting all universities in the UK and across the globe. “It’s something that’s transcending borders,” he said. “Mental health is our priority and it’s the priority of the sector. This is the challenge of our time.” Additional reporting by James Heale The Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

Or wants to test the limits of what is possible. Barely Methodical Troupe do both in the world premiere of a show commissioned by Norfolk and Norwich festival, which has always been a leader in recognising the artfulness of contemporary circus. Played out on a tiny diamond-shaped stage, the three men (Louis Gift, Elihu Vazquez, Charlie Wheeller) and one woman (Esmeralda Nikolajeff) employ minimal equipment and endlessly test each other using only thick rubber resistance bands, their own bodies and a single Cyr wheel. There is real invention: the wheel becomes a circular tightrope, the bands tie the performers together like an umbilical cord that must be cut. At one point, the rubber bands become like strings attached to a human marionette manipulated by two puppet masters. But the best equipment on display is the performers’ bodies. Vazquez breakdances as if the floor is electrocuted, and the male-to-female ratio is subverted by how often the mesmerising Nikolajeff bears the weight of the men, matching them for strength. Like the company’s last show, Kin, this one is directed by a dancer, Melissa Ellberger, and it shows not just in the breakdancing but in the way the movement and tricks fold into each other. The company are comfortable with their bodies – less so with the text and comedy – and the intimacy of the small space intensifies the danger and makes every drop of sweat visible.

Racism ‘Young fans see the dominance of far-right chants. Anyone who challenges it faces a threat of violence’ It is the most politically charged World Cup in recent memory: Russia, resurgent under Vladimir Putin, is set to host the 32-team tournament next month amid scandals ranging from sports doping to spy poisonings. Relations between Moscow and London are at their coolest since the cold war and the recent events in Salisbury even led to brief speculation (aided by Boris Johnson) that England could skip the tournament, recalling the Olympics boycotts of the 1980s. While individual matches such as the United States and Iran’s face-off in 1998 were political lightning rods in their time, the host country has not faced such heated criticism perhaps since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, held just two years after a right-wing military coup backed by the United States. Last week Human Rights Watch released a 44-page guide detailing repression and discrimination in Russia, targeted at the thousands of journalists expected to arrive in the country for the tournament. “Fifa still has time to show that it is ready to use its leverage with the Russian government to fulfil its own human rights policies,” Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Russia’s aspirations have changed since it was awarded the World Cup back in 2010. Then, it still appeared set on wooing the international community by holding prestige tournaments. Dmitry Medvedev was president and the reset in relations initiated by President Obama was still on track, with the goal of repairing relations after the war in Georgia. But even then, long before Salisbury, the war in Ukraine, laws against “gay propaganda” and hooligan violence in Marseilles, racist incidents in Russian football were a clear concern. Russian officials, as well as some players and journalists, insist that while the country has a problem with rightwing fans, the situation has been blown out of proportion by the press and is no worse than elsewhere in eastern Europe. The government says it has made advances in anti-racism monitoring at matches; data from independent organisations appears to support that conclusion.But with monkey chants heard at three matches since March, the spotlight will remain on the hooligan culture, largely modelled on English fans, that has grown around post-Soviet football. A critical moment in that history came just four days after Russia was awarded the World Cup in 2010, when a Spartak Moscow fan named Egor Sviridov was killed by a rubber bullet during a brawl that pitted young, ethnically Russian football fans against youths from the country’s North Caucasus. The release of the suspected killer, Aslan Cherkesov, angered nationalists. Within days, thousands of football hooligans and far-right groups were rioting on Manezh square, beside the Kremlin, in nationalist-tinged protests that took nearly everyone by surprise. Vladimir Putin laid flowers at Sviridov’s grave later that month in what was interpreted as a sign of deference to nationalists. “It was one of the showcase events where everyone saw the numbers, the power the fans have, and the prevalence of the far-right ideology among the fans,” said Pavel Klymenko, who helps monitor instances of fan discrimination for the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) network. “There was a political importance too. Putin did not condemn them. He gave in to some of the xenophobic demands of the fans. His concern was for the fans not to turn against him.” The following years saw a number of ugly incidents. Several black players, including Emmanuel Frimpong and Christopher Samba, were punished by the Russian Football Union after reacting to racist slurs hurled by fans. Ultras in St Petersburg in 2012 released a manifesto demanding their team refuse to sign non-white and gay players. And CSKA Moscow were forced to play two games in an empty stadium after hooligans set off flares and unfurled racist banners during a Champions League fixture against Roma in 2014. The ban was “the point of no return” for Robert Ustian, a 34-year-old political analyst and CSKA fan, who founded a group called CSKA Fans Against Racism. The volunteer organisation seeks to change the club’s fan culture through better education and self-policing, and Ustian believes it has helped reduce racist behaviour at matches. He helps to organise monitoring of extremist slogans and banners, including swastikas, at matches. He has received threats, he said. Many other volunteers choose to remain anonymous. “Somebody has to stand up and raise his voice against this,” he said. Russian football has taken some important steps to combat racism, Klymenko said, including the appointment of the retired Chelsea and Fulham midfielder Alexei Smertin as a dedicated envoy against discrimination in Russian football, and improved monitoring at matches. In contrast, the government in 2013 passed new legislation outlawing “gay propaganda,” including gay pride parades or support groups for young people, which led to an upsurge in homophobic attacks. The new laws were a source of controversy before the 2014 Sochi Olympics and Klymenko said that homophobic language has been used at Russian football stadiums this season but little has been done to combat it. “Homosexuality is such a taboo in Russian society that nobody really dares to address it,” he said. Of criticism over race incidents, Igor Rabiner, one of the country’s best-known football writers said, “Sometimes it’s fair, sometimes it’s much exaggerated. Much work has been done to stop it, but you couldn’t eliminate it all. First, it takes time. Second, football just reflects what happens in society in general.” In a report in 2015, Fare and the anti-extremist Sova centre in Moscow documented 99 racist and far-right displays and 21 racially motivated attacks by fans during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. In a report to be released this week, Klymenko said Fare will announce a reduced incidence of racist symbols at matches, continuing a trend over the past several years. He said incidents of recorded racist slogans, such as monkey chants, have risen, but that is likely due to the increased monitoring at matches. But incidents have still come at critical moments. In March, France’s Ousmane Dembélé, N’Golo Kanté and Paul Pogba were targeted with monkey chants during a friendly in St Petersburg. Fifa this month fined the Russian Football Union more than £22,000 for the incident. Klymenko said the audience for that match would likely reflect that for the World Cup. “The problem is that young people come and see the dominance of the far-right chants, and anyone who tries to challenge has a significant threat of violence,” he said. “They’re soaking in the culture around them.” At the Russian Cup final in Volgograd this month, officials said violent fan behaviour would not be tolerated. Andrey Bocharov, the region’s governor, said that “all measures necessary are being taken” to protect fans, including banning fans known for violent or racist behaviour from the stadiums. Most attention appears focused on preventing fan violence or a terrorist attack: during the match, streets and public transport were blocked off for kilometres around Volgograd’s stadium. Hanging out at the game were players from Germany’s under-18 squad. “They’ve all wanted to take pictures with us,” German defender Yann-Aurel Bisseck, who is black, said, adding that many Russians around town even recognised him. That had followed an emotional game against the Russian under-18 squad held around the anniversary of the Nazi surrender in 1945. “Our coaching staff told us ‘you’re not only here for football.’ We were very happy to represent Germany.” Meanwhile, fans of the clubs Avangard and Tosno streamed into the stadium. A Tosno fan named Andrey Rylkov told the Observer that concerns over monkey chants were overblown: “It’s just some of the guys having a bit of fun,” he said. “I know people where you are from tend to take everything seriously, it’s a different culture… but we don’t believe in political correctness like that here.” Andrew Roth Andrew Roth is the Guardian/Observer Russia correspondent 2. Stadiums ‘The fabulous expense of this event has gone to some place other than good architecture’ We should be used to the revolving biennial spectacle of the stadium-building binges that accompany global sporting events – Olympics, World Cup, Olympics, World Cup, with the Winter Olympics thrown in for added drama. With them come recurring stories: geometrically increasing budgets, the suspenseful fear that they won’t be finished on time, picturesque malfunctions, the endless promise of “legacy”. This time, we are promised, the event won’t bequeath rattling, crowd-starved behemoths. Almost always, it does. Russia, where several of the grounds will go on to serve lower-league clubs in small-ish cities, doesn’t seem likely to buck the trend. There tends in these sporting extravaganzas to be a scent of corruption ranging from the faint whiff of distant flatulence to the rank, ripe stench of sharing a Dutch oven with a bean-eating petomane. Russia, to no one’s surprise, is at the latter end of the scale: according to Transparency International the cost overruns of this year’s World Cup – twice the cost per spectator of Brazil in 2014 – are at a scale that can only be explained by corruption. To which sorry tales can be added the dark stories that Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 have brought to prominence, of the use of near-slaves (from North Korea in Russia’s case) to build the stadiums. All of which might make the mere look of these structures seem secondary. But, given the money, energy, materials and labour that have gone into them, the fact that they will be landmarks in their cities for decades and that billions will see them on TV, it is not insignificant. There is a limited range of known ways of designing stadiums, as their basic shapes tend to be pushed towards uniformity by consistent and demanding parameters. There is the swooping roof, often hung on wires and masts, as in Frei Otto’s tent-like stadium for the 1972 Munich Olympics. There is the backlit cushion of the Allianz Arena, also in the Bavarian capital, home of Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich and a venue for the 2006 World Cup. There is the stadium-that-looks-like-a-portable-object, of which Beijing’s 2008 “Bird’s Nest” is the best known. Russia 2018 is trying most of these approaches. The St Petersburg stadium, designed by the late Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa some time before Russia won its World Cup bid but which only opened last year after epic delays and cost overruns, goes for the mast-hung roof look. So in somewhat shrivelled form do the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov. Kazan’s roof swoops but without wires. The Spartak Stadium in Moscow, completed in 2014, and the barely finished Mordovia Arena in Saransk are homages to the Allianz Arena, big cushions with variegated colours. The Fisht Stadium in Sochi, built for the 2014 Winter Olympics and repurposed for football, goes for the portable-object conceit: its architects Populous, the multi-national sports specialists who also designed the stadiums in Kazan, Rostov and Saransk, said it was inspired by a Fabergé egg. Volgograd, overlooked by the 85-metre high statue that commemorates the battle of Stalingrad, has a woven basket-like look with hints of the Bird’s Nest. Russia has its own contribution to the styling of stadiums, in the Soviet tradition of building tributes to the space age, flightless saucers at once cosmonautic and massive. The Cosmos Arena for the pleasant southern city of Samara bets heavily on this look – appropriately, arguably, as the city was once a centre of the Soviet space programme. At the same time, mixed metaphors being permissible in the world of iconic architecture, it is said to look like a flower. It is beyond the scope of this article to tour all 12 venues for the 2018 World Cup, so I may be missing something, but from a distance it doesn’t look like being a classic, architecturally speaking. There are no gamechangers, designs that future stadium builders can plunder for inspiration, such as the two Munich venues or Renzo Piano’s splendid Bari stadium for Italia 90 (which, it has to be said, never attained a capacity crowd until 2014). Rather we are offered weary lash-ups in which well-known themes are mixed with a further, oddly widespread, approach to stadium design – the cladding car crash, in which for no apparent reason disparate bits of surface, shape and truss are hurled together. Sochi is one of several venues with this collisional aesthetic. If you truly think it looks like a Fabergé egg then you have failed to notice something fundamental – exquisite craftsmanship, perhaps – about the original. The stadiums are mostly lumpy, their soaring ambitions grounded, some bearing too obviously the scars of budget cuts, the fabulous expenditure of the 2018 World Cup having gone to some other place than good architecture. The mottled surfaces of the Spartak and Mordovia grounds are more psoriatic than anything else. Nizhny Novgorod has a classic simplicity that puts it a cut above some others, but spoils it with a sort of giant whirlpool-patterned blue-and-white shower curtain behind its outer colonnade. This is “closely inspired,” it is alleged, “by elements from the Volga countryside”. Please. Samara, by the German practice GMP Architeken, is in its appearance the pick of the bunch. It is one of the most troubled in terms of delivery, but it has a mad kitschy oomph, which will inspire affection over time. The Ekaterinburg Arena provokes mixed feelings. Its plain bowl shape is handsome enough, but it deals extraordinarily clumsily (as did the Aquatic Centre at London 2012) with two temporary banks of seating, to be removed after the World Cup is over. It also struggles with the retained fragment of an older building incorporated into the new. The effect is weird but endearing. Almost always, after last-minute panics, the venues for these sporting extravaganzas are just about finished on time. Almost always they are both over budget and flawed in their legacy. Sometimes they throw up an architectural marvel to treasure in times to come. With the possible exceptio n of Samara the billions of the 2018 World Cup are not going to buy Russia’s cities such gems.

Protest Pussy Riot’s Maria Alyokhina: ‘The state controls all the big media but they cannot cut out the eyes of the people’ Maria Alyokhina, 29, is a Moscow-based artist, political activist and member of punk provocateurs Pussy Riot. In 2012, she and two other members of Pussy Riot were arrested after a performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years in prison on a charge of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”. Since her release she has continued to agitate against the Putin administration, while the fame of Pussy Riot gave her a platform to perform around the world. A record of her experiences can be found in her book Riot Days (Allen Lane). Do you think the government sees the World Cup as an opportunity to present a better image of itself to the world? We were released two months before the end of our prison term because of the Sochi Olympics. Of course we went to Sochi, where the cossacks made their first appearance with whips, so I have no illusions about saving face or making a good impression for the west. You were arrested last month for protesting outside the Moscow headquarters of the FSB, the internal security services. What happened? The FSB blocked the messaging app Telegram in the Russian territory, because Telegram refused to give the keys for reading messages to the security services. We went with paper planes, which is the symbol of Telegram, and started throwing them at the building. We got arrested and spent 48 hours in the cage. For me that was quite frightening, because when you hear that it’s illegal to throw paper planes in your city it’s quite… strange. There have been more protests in the past few weeks… There was a huge demonstration on 30 April, with 12,000 people supporting Telegram. That was just several days before the inauguration, and before the big protest on 5 May, in which I participated as well. This protest was really hard because of the police violence – they tortured people, some activists and journalists were beaten and are still in hospital. As well as police there were fascist groups supported by the administration who violently attacked people and were not arrested – they were hand in hand with police. This is just the first days of this fourth presidential term but it’s [already] the face of it. Has it become more difficult to protest in Russia since you started? After the annexation of Crimea the language of the state changed a lot. They started to use ultra-Soviet lexicon, calling us “enemies of the state” and “enemies of the people” – but I believe that they are enemies of the people because they hire one group of citizens to beat another using [money from] taxes. They are putting people in jail for protesting more than before. We have political murders such as the murder of [physicist and liberal politician] Boris Nemtsov [in 2015]. Even the face of the system became more brutal. But for me, I’ve found ways to protest even inside penal colony, inside prison. Also I’m really happy that when I come to the demonstrations, I see teenagers, I see students. When we were arrested for throwing paper planes, 10 out of 12 were arrested for the first time. They spent their first night at the police station but they were not scared. And this is what I believe in. Because yes, this state controls all the big media, they provide really terrible propaganda, but they cannot cut out the eyes of people, they cannot cut off the ears of people. People see what is going on and they totally disagree with it. You have spent two years in prison and have suffered hardship. Has it affected your desire to protest at all? No. You mentioned that you were able to protest inside prison. Could you explain that? The Russian prison system is actually post-gulag, the feel of these prisons is the same. We have labour camps, all the prisoners are made to work and they are paid almost nothing, about $5 per month. There’s almost no medicine there, and conditions are really terrible. I went to court against the prison administration. It started a revolution, because they started to put up salaries, some prison guards were fired, and so on. For this world, it’s a big change. I believe that every gesture makes a change, a big change to the whole system. So protesting in Russia does have an effect, you think? Of course it does. For some people, it’s a question of their lives. What protest methods have you learned are effective? To not lose your sense of humour. In Russia, without it, something bad will happen. Actually how do you not make fun of a system that is afraid of paper planes? Is the Putin administration genuinely afraid of protesters like you? Well, if they repress people, put people in jail, start to call them enemies of the state, beat them, sometimes kill them – what does it mean? It means they’re afraid to lose their position, to lose their options to steal money till for ever. Are you optimistic about the future of Russia? The future is now. And now I’m not crying, so maybe it’s good. Interview by Killian Fox 4. Media and censorship ‘It’s only going to get worse!’ “It’s only going to get worse!” is the hashtag and rallying cry – snappy and monosyllabic in Russian – of Mediazona, an independent, crowdfunded news outlet in Moscow. Journalists in Russia are facing increasing violence, open and unpunished, and there are few legal safeguards for reporters. State censorship and intimidation, both physical and digital, is intensifying, while western IT giants are doing little to deter the bot and troll infestations targeting independent media outlets. Mediazona is a tiny outfit with a handful of reporters, which focuses on just one topic: Russia’s political trials and the manifold abuses inside its justice system. “There’s no public politics left in Russia, it’s just these criminal cases,” says its editor-in-chief Sergey Smirnov. Most of Mediazona’s content is just straight-up courtroom stenography: minutes of sessions where anti-fascists who have been tortured by security services to extract false confessions are denied bail; or an independent media outlet is fined by the state regulator for embedding on its website a YouTube clip containing a single profane expression. In March 2016 a Mediazona reporter, with a team of other journalists, including two foreign ones, was attacked on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, two republics in the south of Russia with a long history of bloody insurgencies, counter-terrorism operations and oppression. Their bus was torched and they were beaten by unknown assailants. Some were badly injured. The investigation is stalling - there have been no arrests or even suspects in the case. Censorship and intimidation comes in many forms, such as denying access to conflict areas. It’s next to impossible, for example, for an independent journalist to report from Syria unless he or she is accredited with the ministry of defence, sequestered on the Russian military base in Hmeymim and writing glowing reports about the heroism of Russian servicemen or puff pieces about buckwheat porridge in the mess hall. Smirnov says western IT giants also play a role in censorship. Many independent outlets rely on YouTube as a platform for their video content, which gets swarmed immediately after posting with thousands of dislikes (disliked videos then sink down in ratings) and trolls in the comments. Activists and reporters have complained about this to Google, to little effect. “And it’s only going to get worse,” Smirnov concludes.

Nostalgia Whether Soviet simplicity or the strength of the tsars, the best of times are in the past There’s a club in Moscow called Petrovich, which was hugely popular when it opened in 1997, back when Russians were only too glad the Soviet Union was gone. According to the club’s website, it was inspired by “the ironic nostalgic feeling for the good old Soviet times” and, appropriately enough, it is Five minutes’ walk from the Lubyanka, the prison building where the KGB conducted mass interrogations and a post-Soviet celebration of all things USSR, from cartoons (depicted on the restaurant’s plates) and music (Buratino, the theme song from a 1976 children’s film) to food (dumplings) and drink (bad vodka), its nostalgia was close to sarcastic. When I went back this year it was exactly the same and yet entirely transformed. Because there was no longer any irony. Now the nostalgia is real: people want the good old Soviet times back. Men in nylon suits and women with gigantic hair were partying joyously like it really was 1983. A complicated form of nostalgia is now the driving force of the high Putin era – an attempt to reclaim the best bits of imperial Russia (strength, power and unity) and the Soviet Union (predictability and simplicity and the cheap, sweet shampanskoye that fuelled the post-Stalin era). The Battle for Berlin knock-off Lego sets are on sale in the Museum of the Great Patriotic War. Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed English language television network, is running a #Romanovs100 series (“4,000 photos, 4 social networks, 1 family”) to mark the centenary of the death of the Russian royal family. The popular standup comedian Igor Meerson bases his latest set around what it was like to learn English during the Soviet era, when you knew your teacher had never met a real foreigner and you would never be required to speak it. Fashion designers and influencers such as Ulyana Sergeenko (417k followers on Instagram) and Miroslava Duma (1.6m followers) are both known for looks that fuse Soviet retro and imperial luxury. Moscow’s restaurant du jour, White Rabbit, serves traditional dishes including baked beetroot, porridge and cabbage soup (on a set tasting menu for 9,500 roubles or £110). This was almost what the historian Svetlana Boym predicted in her 2001 book, The Future of Nostalgia: “reflective nostalgia” (contemplative and wistful, possibly cathartic) is replaced by “restorative nostalgia” (where others are blamed for having destroyed the homeland). What Russia is living through is somewhere between the two. One of the biggest obstacles Vladimir Putin (and any putative successor) faces is what to do with Russia’s feelings for her past. The presence of nostalgia – real, manufactured and a curious mix of both – is key to understanding contemporary Russian culture. The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution passed largely without comment last year. (As Russian friends joked to me, Russia hardly needed to mark it because Radio 4 did such an obsessively comprehensive job.) This is understandable: what do you say about a revolution, supposedly overturned but whose heirs are still in power? To examine the legacy of 1917 is necessary but torturous for Russia. People murmur about legacy, what happened in Germany and South Africa, about commissions for truth and reconciliation. But these things are not taken seriously in Russia.The criminal case into the royal family’s death, reopened in 2015 at the request of the church, is ongoing. Now officially known as “the royal martyrs”, the family were canonised in 2000. The British royal family has been invited to July’s processions in Ekaterinburg, to honour the memory of the tsar and his family. (Strangely, they don’t seem to have replied.) The “All-Russian pilgrimage route” to the Church on Blood in Ekaterinburg, built over the site of the house where the family was killed, has been reopened. You couldn’t make this up, especially as Putin is a lifelong KGB man and one-time card-carrying communist. But never mind all that. It is expedient for him to co-opt any feelings of longing towards empire. And it’s extremely useful to harness the 19th-century view of the tsar’s rule: God-given, unquestionable, unbreakable. 1917 is an inconvenient contradiction so we don’t talk about that. Instead we talk about how sad it was that the tsar’s family were shown no mercy in 1918.The funny thing is, not only is this project working well at home but it has become a cultural export. Angelina Jolie has bought the film rights to Simon Sebag Montefiore’s book about Catherine the Great (full name: Catherine Alexeievna Romanova). The team behind Mad Men is working on a lavish series on the Romanovs for Amazon, starring Christina Hendricks and John Slattery. Meanwhile Putin appears to be cultivating a sort of nostalgia for his own rule even while he is ruling. Last week he once again nominated Dmitry Medvedev as his prime minister, the continuation of a power relationship that has lasted almost 20 years. Medvedev is well known for his love of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, which are hugely evocative for Russians who were young in the 1960s and 1970s. But why change the soundtrack when it’s working so well for you? Viv Groskop Viv Groskop’s The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature is out in paperback next month (Fig Tree, £9.99) 7. The mafia ‘The gangsters want the World Cup to go well. They’ve already made money and will make more’ Russia continues to be regarded as, in the words of a 16th-century English traveller, a “rude and barbarous kingdom”. Along with seductive honeytrap spies and hyper-violent “ultra” football fans, one of the concerns facing visitors to the World Cup has been the infamous Russian mafia. Here’s the irony, though: the close relationship between the Kremlin and crooks probably helps ensure the games will take place in completed stadiums, and in a calm, safe environment. One of the core themes of my new book, The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia, has been the long, bloody embrace between Russia’s rulers and its gangsters, and especially the professional criminal subculture known as the vory, the “thieves”. This predated him, but it was under Stalin – who had organised bank robberies and even pirate raids when he was a revolutionary – that this alliance was truly consummated. Stalin relied on collaborators recruited from the vory to keep the millions of political prisoners and slave labourers in the gulag camps in line, creating a new generation of gangsters who realised that there was money, power and security in working with the state. After Stalin died and the gulags largely closed down, the vory found ample new opportunities helping an increasingly corrupt Communist party elite loot their own state. In the decade of near-anarchy that followed the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991, the criminals came out of the shadows. Instead of being the friends of officials, they increasingly became their paymasters, or even indistinguishable from them. The dividing lines between crime, business and politics became increasingly, dangerously blurred. Sport played a central role in this. A generation of wrestlers, boxers and martial artists, once the darlings of the state, became the hired mafia muscle of choice. Some went further: a former wrestler turned racketeer, Otari Kvantrishvili, persuaded president Boris Yeltsin to grant his “Sports Academy” freedom from import and export taxes, for example. Instead of sports training, it became a smuggler’s front, selling hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Russian aluminium, cement and titanium abroad, tax free, to line Kvantrishvili’s pockets. When Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he offered the vory a new social contract. He would not crack down on them, as they had feared – but only so long as they refrained from doing anything that looked like a direct challenge to the state, such as continuing the kind of indiscriminate street violence that had been such a fixture of the 1990s, or supporting the rebellious southern region of Chechnya. If they did, they would be treated as enemies of the state and suppressed accordingly. Realising that the state was back, the godfathers accepted Putin’s deal. So organised crime is alive and well, but house-trained. The state is the biggest gang in town, the biggest crooks are the officials and business tycoons plundering the assets of the country. The descendants of the vory survive by working once again in alliance with, even for, corrupt bureaucrats. The days when thugs and politicians openly socialised together – Kvantrishvili was famously once photographed watching a tennis match with Yeltsin – may be over, but the links are strong. Vory can be useful, whether beating up an impertinent investigative journalist here, or smuggling in scarce western luxury items there. It is their usefulness to the state and the elite that continues to earn them their freedom of manoeuvre. That usefulness has regularly to be demonstrated and reaffirmed, though. The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics were a particular case in point. They were a bonanza for the gangsters. One, the Georgian-born godfather Aslan Usoyan, known as “Grandfather Hassan”, got in first even as the venue was being mooted in 2007. With open wallets and open threats, his henchmen snapped up land and hotels, knowing they would appreciate dramatically in value. The struggle to corner the market led to a spate of killings, with murders in Moscow and Sochi. Usoyan himself was killed in 2013, perhaps in part because of these disputes. But by the first day of the Games, all was quiet. After all, there was too much at stake. The Games cost an estimated $50bn, making them the most expensive on record. According to Transparency International, perhaps $15bn of that was embezzled. Of course, most was stolen by the oligarchs – typically from Putin’s inner circle of friends – granted the major construction and management contracts. Even so, the gangsters played their part, especially in subcontracted work such as providing labour-ganged workers for the construction, often in effect trafficked from Central Asia and forcibly returned once the job was done. But despite the last-minute building and occasional glitch, the Games were strikingly successful. The expected crime-related problems, from theft and prostitution to match fixing and illegal gambling, never materialised. In part this can be explained by the army of police and security officers deployed to what was, after all, a personal vanity project for President Putin. To a large degree, though, it reflected, the extent to which, precisely because of the importance of the event to the Kremlin, the godfathers themselves collaborated to make things go well. One middle-ranking police officer with whom I spoke afterwards admitted this. Of course, petty crooks flocked to “iron the firm” as Russian gangsters call fleecing foreigners. In his words, though: “The lads were under no illusions: if they crossed the line, then we police were the last thing they had to worry about.” So the pimps had to stay honest, the drug dealers sell smaller amounts, and of bona fide product. Pickpockets were warned off, and hotel staff advised not to take the opportunity to help themselves from guests’ luggage. The spectacle of using organised crime to control disorganised crime is not unique to Russia, but what is striking is the extent to which the gangsters are proactive. Instead of awaiting orders, they seek to predict and satisfy the whims of a powerful and often vindictive state. Which is why the gangsters are also eager to see the World Cup go smoothly. They have already made money on construction projects, and will make more catering to the less savoury tastes of the anticipated half million-plus foreign visitors. But this is another project regarded as essential to Russian soft power – when it needs all the good publicity it can get – and also close to the heart of a president consumed with his image and historic legacy. While there may not be that much the vory can do about racists and hooligans among the ultras – although there are certainly links with some of these fanaty gangs – it is already clear that once again the word is going out: the underworld powers expect everyone to be on their best behaviour. The underworld is facing internal tensions and challenges of its own. From tussles over control of heroin routes (almost a third of all drugs from Afghanistan now pass through Russia) to generational tensions as hungry young men impatiently await their chance at the top, these risk disrupting the status quo. The World Cup not only represents a test of the organisational capacities of “upperworld” Russia, it will also tell us how well the Kremlin is able to control its underworld, and the authority the existing godfathers can assert over their unruly minions.

The Academy expels Bill Cosby. Who’s next?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not so long ago, I was waiting for my order in a Chinese takeaway when I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly came on the radio. No one paid a blind bit of notice. The DJ didn’t make any comment about Kelly. It was just another song, another five minutes to fill up the airwaves. Would that happen now? Finally, after years of the stench of sexual misconduct following him around like a swarm of gnats, Kelly may have reached his tipping point. It is true he has never been convicted of anything, but he has settled out of court with women who have accused him of sexual offences, and almost no one, at this point, has come forward to defend him. That is thanks in huge part to the reporting of the Chicago journalist Jim De Rogatis, who has spoken to and – crucially – listened to so many of the women who wanted to talk about what Kelly did to them. Yet despite the years of stories about Kelly, until last week the music industry had never taken action against him. Then, last Friday, Spotify announced that under the terms of its new policy on “hate content and hateful conduct” it would be removing Kelly’s music from its own playlists, alongside that of XXXTentacion, who is charged in Florida with aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and witness tampering. You can still find Kelly without much trouble – he still has his own artist page – but Spotify will no longer promote him. Rival streaming services Apple Music and Pandora followed Spotify in removing Kelly from promoted content. “When we look at promotion, we look at issues around hateful conduct, where you have an artist or another creator who has done something off-platform that is so particularly out of line with our values, egregious, in a way that it becomes something that we don’t want to associate ourselves with,” Jonathan Prince, Spotify’s head of content and marketplace policy, said when the decision was made. (When I contacted Spotify to ask about the implementation of the new policy in future, I was told it had no further comment to make.) Spotify’s decision followed the #MuteRKelly campaign, which has been calling for anyone profiting from his work – including ticket agencies, streaming platforms and his label, RCA – to sever ties with him. Women of Color of Time’s Up supported the cause (“We demand appropriate investigations and inquiries into the allegations of R Kelly’s abuse made by women of color and their families for over two decades now,” it said in a statement), as did celebrities including John Legend and Kerry Washington. While you will struggle to find anyone – bar Kelly and XXXTentacion – who thinks Spotify has committed a grave injustice, it’s worth remembering that this is not a decision based on morality alone. As the philosopher Julian Baggini notes: “What’s kind of lamentable about things like this is that when companies like Spotify do make these choices, they’re driven not by consistent moral principle but by the need to react to the latest public outrage. Using ethical criteria [to make business decisions] is reasonable, but in practice this isn’t about ethics. Public outrage is very rarely accurately linked to moral seriousness.” The same fear of public outrage drove the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to expel Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby earlier this month. But while the decision concerning Cosby made sense, the one about Polanski was odder. Cosby was only recently convicted of sexual assault; Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor in 1978, fleeing the US when he believed the terms of his plea bargain were going to be ignored by the judge. His offence has not altered in seriousness since then, yet the Academy admired Polanski enough to award him the 2002 best director Oscar for The Pianist. Only now, with #MeToo in full swing, is he considered persona non grata, and despite scores of allegations against myriad Hollywood stars, directors and executives, only Cosby, Polanski and Harvey Weinstein have been expelled for sexual misconduct (the only other person expelled from the Academy was actor Carmine Caridi, after he was found to have shared a copyrighted DVD of a film with someone who uploaded it to the internet). The apparent randomness of the Academy’s behaviour does not necessarily mean its actions are inadequate, though. Think of it as pour encourager les autres. As Baggini points out: “A large part of moral sanction is about modifying behaviour in the future. People are always products of their time, but you condemn things and take action with the purpose of affecting the future.” One of the problems with policing morality – especially for Spotify, and for YouTube as it tries to clamp down on hate speech and fake news – is the scope of what is required if they are to be consistent. Which is why action seems to happen only when mass sentiment demands it. Earlier this year, after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre, YouTube cracked down on the “alt-right” site InfoWars, which had been publishing videos suggesting survivors were “crisis actors” with a political agenda. Yet countless other conspiracist and fake news videos went untouched – including, as Wired noted, InfoWars videos claiming the Sandy Hook school massacre had been a hoax. For all YouTube’s boasts about increasing its number of moderators to 10,000, about how it assiduously removed 8.3m videos in the past three months of 2017 – 76% of them unviewed – the fact is that, as Wired observed: “The pattern of waiting until something is brought to YouTube’s attention to do anything meaningful will likely continue.” (YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.) Volume is as much of an issue for music sites. XXXTentacion responded to Spotify’s action with a long list of other artists accused of assorted offences, including David Bowie, Miles Davis and James Brown, asking if Spotify would be removing them from its playlists. Kelly’s management issued a similar statement, asking if Spotify would continue promoting “numerous other artists who are convicted felons, others who have been arrested on charges of domestic violence and artists who sing lyrics that are violent and anti-women in nature”. In fact, Spotify’s policy is far from ad hoc. It was drawn up in conjunction with a variety of US pressure groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, Color of Change, Showing Up for Racial Justice, the LGBTQ group GLAAD, Muslim Advocates and the International Network Against Cyber Hate. The policy itself asserts the various transgressions that could see an artist removed from playlists (though not from the platform, on which Gary Glitter and Lostprophets remain, though without dedicated artist pages; the black metal artist Burzum, a convicted murderer, has his own artist page), but then reminds the reader: “It is impossible for us to manually review all of the content on Spotify,” and asks for users’ help in alerting it to offenders. In other words: the policy might not be ad hoc, but its implementation will be. But behind all this is one other question: why doesn’t RCA drop him, as #MuteRKelly has suggested? The answer is simple, says Chris Brown, a solicitor at the specialist music business law firm Sheridans: there’s a contract. “I’ve not seen many moral turpitude clauses in record deals that include the idea of bringing the label into disrepute. And if labels don’t have that right in there they may leave themselves open to a claim from artists for potentially being in breach of the agreement.” What about the possibility that Kelly is unable to fulfil his contractual duties? If he can’t get promoted on Spotify, might that not mean he is unable to perform his job as specified? “There’s a chance there would be a publicity clause whereby the artist is obliged to use his best endeavours to promote a record, which would involve doing TV and radio interviews, and if no one wanted to interview them, they might be in breach,” Brown says. “But it would depend on the wording of the clause, and it would be difficult to run.” Brown does expect artists’ contracts with labels to change in the wake of Time’s Up. “I think it’s entirely likely that behaviour clauses will happen. I’ve had experience of labels being nervous of artists who behave outrageously and how that will reflect on the label. That’s only going to be amplified, given the change in attitudes.” But without immediate outrage about specific incidents, it’s hard to imagine any great appetite to go purging the past. That’s not because no one takes seriously the offences that assorted artists are accused of, but more because of our own complicated relationship with art. The feminist writer Sarah Ditum notes her love of plenty of artists whose behaviour to women would be considered appalling, but observes that she can’t bring herself to write off Ike Turner’s Rocket 88, despite his violence towards Tina. “My dad’s a massive collector of blues and soul and early rock’n’roll. That’s hugely important to me, because it was my first entry into the world of music, and because of what it says about my relationship with my dad. I feel a reflexive kick against the part of me that would purge it all.” As someone who writes primarily about music, I’ve turned down the chance to interview artists whose behaviour I have found distasteful, but I’ve also interviewed Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page – whose girlfriend in the 1970s was the underage Lori Mattox – more than any other musician, because I love Led Zeppelin too much to cut them loose. Even as a feminist, Ditum feels that in the case of R Kelly, Spotify has gone far enough – not promoted, but not expunged. “I think it’s weird when institutions make decisions for us about what we can hear or see. When everything was physical, even if a label or a publisher took something out of print, there were still copies in circulation. But if things are taken out of circulation online, they stop existing, and that takes away the possibility of us making our own decisions.” For now, Spotify says it will make decisions about what music it promotes on a case-by-case basis. Which means, in practice, that the historic perpetrators of violence and abuse will probably remain untouched. Instead, wait for the next star to be called out in public, for the backlash to begin, and then for many in the music industry who have known the stories for years to jump into action. Same as it ever was. • This article was amended on 21 May 2018 to remove an incorrect reference to artists potentially making a claim of unfair dismissal.

Now it can","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A mortgage you can have until you are 99 years old was launched this week. It’s the latest in a string of home loans aimed at satisfying the growing demand for “later life” borrowing, with deals that last well into retirement. Challenger bank Aldermore says it will now let people carry on holding one of its mortgages until they are 99, and its maximum age for a new borrower applying for a home loan is an impressive 85. Its announcement came on the same day that Family building society increased its maximum age at the end of the mortgage term to 95, which means a 90-year-old could take out a home loan lasting five years. But what are the pros and cons of these deals and would you still want to be paying off your mortgage when you are in your 90s? The background Many mainstream lenders have traditionally had a cut-off age of 70 or 75. But high house prices, student debt and a rise in the age at which couples have children all mean that many people are buying a home later and opting for a term that is longer than the conventional 25 years. Plus, more people are working longer. There are also lots of reasons why an older person might want to remortgage or take on a deal after years of being mortgage-free. For example, they may want to release some equity from their home for their children or grandchildren or to finance a better quality of life. “It’s a massively growing market,” says Andrew Montlake at mortgage broker Coreco. The deals Earlier this month, Loughborough building society scrapped the upper age limit on its mortgages, so borrowers can take out a home loan for up to 25 years regardless of their age at the time of application. There are now at least 15 building societies with no age limit, including Bath, Cambridge, Harpenden, Ipswich, Leek United, Marsden and Saffron. Meanwhile, others are launching deals designed for older people, some of which are available on an interest-only basis. Aldermore’s mortgages, which start at interest rates of 3.38%, are aimed at applicants aged 55 to 85 who wish to access the equity in their home without having to sell it. The upper age limit of 99 means a 55-year-old could take out a 44-year deal, while an 85-year-old could get a 14-year home loan. These deals could throw a lifeline to people who have an interest-only mortgage coming to an end. Borrowers can use the sale of their home as their repayment strategy if they want one of these loans on an interest-only basis, but they must have a minimum of 40% equity in their property. This week, Family (part of Surrey-based National Counties building society) significantly increased the maximum term of its deals, which means a 60-year-old can now have a 35-year mortgage and an 80-year-old a 15-year mortgage. These deals must be taken out on a repayment or “part and part” basis. With the latter option, only a maximum of 50% of the loan can be interest-only. Meanwhile, Post Office Money offers a mortgage called Retirement Link, whereby it will lend up to the age of 90 if you select the repayment option, and up to 80 for interest-only. The latter is only available to those who are mortgage-free. How much could someone borrow? Aldermore gives the example of an 80-year-old widow, whose £495,000 house is mortgage-free. She is not keen on going down the equity release route and is looking to gift money to her grandchildren. She receives a total pension income of £29,000 a year. Based on a 15-year interest-only loan, Aldermore would be prepared to lend her up to £130,210 at an initial cost of £435 a month. What are the downsides? The biggest potential pitfalls relate to people’s health and pensions, says Montlake. If it involves a couple, what will happen to the household pension income if one of them dies? And what if someone agrees they will eventually sell their property but changes their mind later on? Montlake says his advice to those considering later-life deals is: “Definitely take your time and get proper professional advice on the options out there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/may/17/radio-3-is-winning-the-breakfast-battle-with-radio-4-but-the-war-is-not-won","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T13:16:08Z","webTitle":"Radio 3 is winning the breakfast battle with Radio 4 – but the war is not won | Stephen Moss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/17/radio-3-is-winning-the-breakfast-battle-with-radio-4-but-the-war-is-not-won","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/17/radio-3-is-winning-the-breakfast-battle-with-radio-4-but-the-war-is-not-won","fields":{"headline":"Radio 3 is winning the breakfast battle with Radio 4 – but the war is not won","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Over the past year or so, I have noticed an increasing number of the Twitterati saying they were giving up on the Today programme and switching to the soothing charms of Radio 3 in the morning. A few swallows do not make a summer, I thought, even for birdsong-obsessed Radio 3, but according to figures released today it looks as though the drift away from John Humphrys et al and towards Petroc Trelawny is real: research group Rajar reported that Today had lost 65,000 listeners in the past 12 months, while Radio 3’s breakfast show had gained 64,000. The missing 1,000 were not accounted for. The switchover will not have been quite so straightforward, of course: commercial radio also reported a rise, while Heart overtook Radio 1 for the first time. Moreover, 65,000 listeners makes only a small dent in Today’s reach of more than 7 million. But it will still be a welcome fillip for Radio 3, which has fewer than 2 million listeners across the station, accounts for only 1.2% of total radio listenership and is forever plagued by accusations that its cost per listener is absurdly high (its £50m-plus budget is the same as Radio 1’s, which has five times the number of listeners). That 64,000 increase represents a rise of 11% for Radio 3’s breakfast show. Expect a bit of civilised crowing by Trelawny and fellow presenter Georgia Mann. Does the change reflect the Today programme’s weaknesses or the Radio 3 breakfast show’s strengths? That is the 65,000-listener question. As someone who tends to commute between the two, I would argue that it is more about Today’s failings than new inspiration at Radio 3 (although Trelawny and Mann are capable broadcasters). Blame for the failings at Today tends to be placed at the door of Sarah Sands, who took over as editor last year. I have moaned about her myself, especially when great tracts of one programme were devoted to London fashion week and tediously self-promoting interviews with clothes designers. But these early excesses have now been curbed; on a day with a big breaking-news story, Today can still be very good. The central problem is the presenting team that Sands largely inherited. They are too dull. Who would willingly share a lift with the charisma-free rugby bore Justin Webb, let alone three hours in the morning? Elsewhere on Radio 4, Eddie Mair and Paddy O’Connell demonstrate what can be done with wit, imagination and a strong news sense. But the Today programme lacks any personality, with the exception of Humphrys, who has descended into self-parody and whose attempts at humorous sallies are routinely embarrassing. The whole thing feels like a chore for the presenters and, inevitably, it has become a routine for the listeners, too, in a good way and a bad way. We listen because we always have and because we need to know who is being grilled at 8.10am, but we also resent the tedium. Surely even God switches off for Thought for the Day, which should have been killed off once and for all by Canon Angela Tilby’s recent comparison of knife crime and cooking. Radio 3’s breakfast show is reaping the benefits of Today’s failings without having to do very much. The choice of music is broad, although I could do with fewer choral pieces – bored with Webb’s reports from Aberystwyth this morning, I had the misfortune to turn over to Herbert Howells’ motet The Heart of the Mind. Suddenly agricultural practices in west Wales seemed attractive. One thing I do like about the breakfast show on Radio 3 is that it plays the odd bit of jazz, numbers from musicals, French chanson – a splendid burst of Jacques Brel this morning – and popular song. We even had some George Formby last week. The more variety, the merrier. But the station should not celebrate the modest rise in its breakfast listening too much. Radio 3 still has many problems. I am a devotee and listen to almost every live concert it broadcasts. But I listen on catchup, often cutting out the banalities of the presenters, who react to every piece – even the second-rate performances that elicit a tepid response from the audience – with euphoria that would be over the top if accorded to the second coming. I wish the presenters would limit opinions to those of conductors and performers prior to the concerts: those interviews are genuinely useful. Much of the rest of the schedule is lacklustre. Essential Classics, between 9am and noon, is dire: terrible, cliched little featurettes; mindless broadcasting of listeners’ emails and tweets; a predictable roster of music. Ditto Composer of the Week, which generally packages Wikipedia-level info about dead composers. Record Review, which occupies close to four energised hours on Saturday mornings, should be the template for all Radio 3 programmes: intelligent, incisive commentary with no talking down to listeners. Too much of the schedule feels as though it is going through the motions. Radio 3, with infinite time and so few listeners, can be anything it wants to be. Chuck out all the tired formulas and dare to be different. Beethoven, Brel, Formby, world music, new music, more shows like Words and Music, which allows listeners to make up their own minds about what they are hearing. Do not marginalise the more offbeat shows. Give jazz a prime slot; give contemporary music a prime slot; shake listeners out of their routine. Broadcast it and they will come. I am pleased more people are listening to Radio 3 in the morning. Now convert them into Radio 3 aficionados and start to build an audience that wants to listen differently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/17/antonio-conte-fa-cup-final-chelsea-wembley-mancini-van-gaal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T11:03:33Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte may be latest to find how little FA Cup glory means now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/17/antonio-conte-fa-cup-final-chelsea-wembley-mancini-van-gaal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/17/antonio-conte-fa-cup-final-chelsea-wembley-mancini-van-gaal","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte may be latest to find how little FA Cup glory means now","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I didn’t bring the magic, it’s always been here,” Bob Stokoe said modestly after second division Sunderland had toppled mighty Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup final. “I just came back to find it.” Everyone knows what Stokoe said because the words are inscribed on the plinth of his statue outside the Stadium of Light. That is how big a deal winning the FA Cup used to be. When Stokoe died in 2004 there was never any doubt about the image that would be used to commemorate the club’s greatest post-war success. Opinion is divided over how accurately the sculptor captured the manager and the moment but the worst-dressed man at Wembley leaping off the bench at the final whistle to race to his goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery was already part of FA Cup final lore. Things are a little different now. When Louis van Gaal won the FA Cup with Manchester United two years ago he barely had time to celebrate. His moment of glory – well, the undoubted highlight of a mostly lacklustre two years at Old Trafford – was cruelly compromised by the news already circulating around Wembley that José Mourinho had got his job. It was smart of Van Gaal to have his picture taken with Sir Alex Ferguson and the trophy, because a few days later he would not have had the chance. Manchester City were no better in 2013, with news of Roberto Mancini’s departure breaking on Cup final day. The open secret was arguably a factor in City’s shock defeat by Wigan, though what was perfectly clear was that Mancini could not have saved his job by winning that game. In the Premier League/Champions League era only Arsène Wenger has been able to use FA Cup finals to earn a stay of execution, and even then there were significant factions at Arsenal who felt the end of season party at Wembley was merely window-dressing to cover up a larger pattern of failure. Only twenty-eight years ago, near the start of Ferguson’s reign at United, an FA Cup win represented the first success in England for a manager beginning to feel the pressure after three trophyless years, and even though it took a replay to see off Crystal Place it was enough to convince the board they had the right man. “I needed a trophy to buy time,” Ferguson said a couple of years later, before everyone realised quite how much time in the job he was going to get. One has the distinct feeling that even a Chelsea win on Saturday is not going to buy Antonio Conte any more time at Stamford Bridge, indeed it is debatable whether the manager even wants to stick around for next season. He would doubtless like to finish the season on a high by adding the FA Cup to last season’s title win on an already impressive CV, and so would his players. Conte would then be able to point to two seasons in England and two major trophies, which is the sort of strike rate most Premier League teams and their supporters can only dream about, though the reality is the FA Cup alone no longer constitutes a successful season for a club in the Champions League bracket. The Uefa competition has managed to hijack most of the end-of-season knockout glory, which is why Jürgen Klopp could be in line for a statue, or at least a specially commissioned new banner on the Kop, should Liverpool win a sixth European Cup next week in Kiev. The Champions League final now performs the day-of-destiny function the FA Cup used to enjoy. Win it and you are practically immortal; certainly you write your name into your club’s history. Liverpool have not won the league since 1990, the year Ferguson was fretting over Crystal Palace in the Cup final, but absolutely no one will be complaining if the season ends with a victory over Real Madrid. Younger readers might find it difficult to imagine but the FA Cup final used to be like that. In the public imagination, great deeds at Wembley would often transcend anything accomplished the same year in the league. Arsenal won the title on goal average in 1953, for example, but how many people remember that compared with the number who still revere the Stanley Matthews Cup final of the same year? Aston Villa fans will always remember 1981 as the last time they won the league (and subsequently the European Cup the following season), though the image that comes most readily to mind for most people is Ricky Villa’s goal for Tottenham at Wembley. The good news is that only clubs with Champions League aspirations tend to look down on the FA Cup. The bad news is that because of the imbalance created within the domestic league over the last couple of decades the Cup is usually fought out between top-six sides with Champions League aspirations. This weekend’s final is a case in point, last season’s final was another, and in the 18 years of the new millennium the same five clubs have been Cup winners on no fewer than 16 occasions. The only exceptions have been Portsmouth and Wigan, each with harrowing tales to tell of what happened afterwards. The magic of the FA Cup still exists, just about, but it takes a bit of finding. You need to be an underdog with a chance to make it work, someone able to regard a Cup-winning year as a proud entry in the club’s annals rather than just another hotel to book at the end of the season. Wigan fitted the bill almost perfectly, but for being relegated a matter of days later, yet the image of Ben Watson and his team-mates celebrating in the rain in 2013 is not quite the last example of Cup euphoria running over. Think of Alan Pardew and his touchline dad-dancing routine in 2016 when Palace took the lead with 12 minutes remaining. It was premature, of course, but just for a few moments there was a man who could feel the magic, see his shot at glory. Had Palace managed to hang on Pardew might have had his own statue by now, in a pose as excruciatingly inexplicable as Stokoe’s memorable combination of tracksuit, raincoat and trilby. There is unlikely to be anything as joyously daft from either manager during Saturday’s final, which is a great pity. Wembley on Cup final day is exactly the place where one ought to get carried away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/15/robin-hood-gardens-three-storeys-british-brutalism-venice-biennale","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Will this three-storey slice of British brutalism be the hit of the Venice Biennale?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/15/robin-hood-gardens-three-storeys-british-brutalism-venice-biennale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/15/robin-hood-gardens-three-storeys-british-brutalism-venice-biennale","fields":{"headline":"Will this three-storey slice of British brutalism be the toast of Venice?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘A building under assembly,” wrote architects Alison and Peter Smithson in 1976, “is a ruin in reverse.” These words, now deeply ironic, accompanied their entry to the Venice Biennale, which consisted of a billboard-size photograph of their latest project: Robin Hood Gardens, a housing estate in east London. Alongside this was a bench modelled on the concrete fins that gave their buildings such a distinctively ribbed texture. It’s almost as if the Smithsons knew that, 42 years later, their project would now be back at the Venice Biennale as a ruin – in the form of a three-storey chunk that was salvaged from the controversial housing scheme in the district of Poplar, when demolition began last year. Titled Ruins in Reverse, the installation will be a bittersweet presence at the Biennale when it opens at the end of May. The resurrected concrete segment will stand, pinned to a scaffold, among the naval brick warehouses of the Venetian Arsenale, a fragile relic of a council housing ideal long since trampled by successive British governments. Back in Poplar – where 214 council flats were housed in the two snaking concrete blocks, one now gone – will rise Blackwall Reach, a £300m “vibrant collection” of 1,575 homes, 700 of which will be “affordable”. The marketing blurb trumpets the arrival of “one brand new community” – right on the spot where another community lived quite happily until recently. The Venice installation has been orchestrated by the Victoria and Albert Museum, which announced last November that it had acquired a section of Robin Hood Gardens for its permanent collection. This “nationally important and internationally recognised work of brutalist architecture” would be added to its haul of exotic jewels and precious pots plundered from around the world. That a museum should acquire a chunk of social housing – from which residents had been “decanted”, many losing their council tenancies in the process – was deemed by some to be in questionable taste. There had been a hard-fought campaign to save the building, backed by Richard Rogers and Zaha Hadid, so where was the museum’s voice then? The V&amp;A insists that, as a state-funded public museum, it cannot take a position on the saving or listing of buildings – and once Robin Hood Gardens’ death warrant had been signed, wasn’t it better to preserve a bit of it in some form? This is the charged debate that visitors to the Biennale will be forced to consider. “It was our provocation to the museum,” says architect Liza Fior, who proposed the idea after an 18-month residency at the V&amp;A, where she had been coming up with ideas for the museum’s forthcoming east London outpost. “We asked: ‘Given the museum engages with the world through objects, can Robin Hood Gardens prompt engagement with east London?’” While exploring the V&amp;A’s archives, Fior, co-founder of the architectural firm Muf, became interested in what she calls “reverse restitution”: the idea that the wider social stories and “muddy histories” of the collection could be made more present in the museum. “The V&amp;A is full of bits of buildings that were victims of regeneration, or changes in liturgical fashion and administrative power over the centuries,” she says. There’s a staircase from a Florentine palazzo that succumbed to a road-widening scheme, along with the 1930s foyer of the Strand Palace, salvaged when this celebrated London hotel was gutted in the 1960s. “We knew it wouldn’t be easy,” she says, “but it is the role of the museum to provide a platform for these difficult conversations.” Designed in the late 1960s and completed in 1972, Robin Hood Gardens was Alison and Peter Smithson’s first opportunity to put their radical housing ideas into practice, having tested them with an unsuccessful competition entry for London’s Golden Lane Estate in 1952. “A new mode of urban organisation,” is how Peter described the project, a jigsaw puzzle of multiple house types arranged in horizontal blocks, with two-storey homes linked by “streets in the air”, intended to support all the neighbourly activity of a traditional street, complete with recessed “eddy places” outside front doors – for neighbours to stop and chat, flowerpots to congregate, and postmen to leave parcels. “It was a criticism of the typical model of estates,” says Christopher Woodward, the architect who worked on the design from the beginning. “You usually had some four-storey maisonettes, a tower with a lift, and some bungalows for old people. Instead, we embarked on this Tetris-like operation.” The result has been lauded in architectural circles as a wonder of the new brutalism, a very British strain of postwar modernism that celebrated the rough and rugged heft of raw masonry structures over the lighter, whitewashed air of its continental cousins. With two cranked blocks facing on to a central grassy mound, the complex was praised for its approach to public space, its integration of acoustic fins to baffle noise from busy surrounding roads, and the care it lavished on interior details. Fior admires how the design anticipated use, from the angle of the balustrade, not just to take off rainwater but perfect to lean on, to the details of the joinery, like hand-sized notches in the kitchen doors. She’s right – but it has also always felt a bit grim. The neighbourly East End bustle imagined by the Smithsons never materialised on their dingy decks. In a revealing BBC documentary made in 1970, Alison, wearing a space-age silver jacket and speaking like someone from another planet, expressed doubt about the project’s fate. “The realities of our working life are going to be traffic, noise, air pollution, vandalism, lack of quality,” she says. “Society is asking architects to build these new homes for them, but this may be really stupid. We may need to rethink the whole thing … We may be asking people to live in a way that is stupid. They maybe just want to, you know, be left alone.” By the 80s, Woodward’s own definitive Guide to the Architecture of London, written with Edward Jones, reflected the mood of the time, describing Robin Hood Gardens as a “particularly depressing place to live in”, with an “almost manic system of walls and moats”, concluding that it is an “example of the late modernist avant-garde determination to realise a theoretical position at all costs”. By the mid-2000s, a survey of residents by the borough of Tower Hamlets claimed that three-quarters were in favour of demolition (independent surveys suggested otherwise). They cited crumbling concrete, leaks and antisocial behaviour. “I enjoyed living there,” says Nicholas Ruddock, 72, who had a one-bed flat from 1982 until he was recently rehoused on the ninth floor of one of the new blocks across the street. “But the council hated it. They virtually gave up on doing any repairs, so the whole place was left to rot. I’m very happy in my new flat, but it seems like such a waste to destroy those characterful buildings when they could have been repaired.” Woodward is more sanguine. “I’m surprised it wasn’t demolished sooner,” he says. “The precast concrete simply wasn’t done to a high enough standard. It was poorly manufactured.” The scheme had originally been designed with in-situ concrete but, following a shift in policy, it was built from components that were produced at an “on-site factory” then hoisted into position. Following the collapse of the Ronan Point tower block in 1968, the panels were bolted together with big steel angles. The condition of the structure has made it even harder for the demolition team, who are used to turning up with the wrecking ball and mechanical munching jaws, but were suddenly charged with dismantling part of the building piece by precious piece, with some components over three metres long and weighing more than two tonnes. “The demolition crew started to see the design in a whole new light,” says V&amp;A curator Olivia Horsfall Turner. “Having thought this was just another concrete monstrosity they were tearing down, their outlook was really transformed.” She says the museum has acquired a “representative portion”, piecing together interior fittings from a number of other flats, along with the facade fins and raised walkway, to ensure that a three-storey taster of two maisonettes can be reconstructed. Longterm display plans have yet to be confirmed, but it will potentially feature in a proposed “room of rooms”, alongside other room-size objects, such as the seminal 1920s Frankfurt Kitchen, the Strand lobby and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Kaufmann Office. This ghost of thwarted dreams will be a poignant addition to the V&amp;A’s collection of extinct species – and a sad reminder that the only way future generations will be able to learn about bold state-built council housing will be by visiting a museum. • The Venice Biennale runs from 26 May to 25 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/10/mps-urge-government-to-release-cash-for-removal-of-grenfell-style-cladding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T16:21:02Z","webTitle":"MPs urge government to release cash for removal of Grenfell-style cladding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/mps-urge-government-to-release-cash-for-removal-of-grenfell-style-cladding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/mps-urge-government-to-release-cash-for-removal-of-grenfell-style-cladding","fields":{"headline":"MPs urge government to release cash for removal of Grenfell-style cladding","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs have called on the government to urgently release cash to accelerate the removal of combustible Grenfell-style cladding that remains fully in place on 54 social housing blocks and dozens more private apartment towers across England. Legal disputes over who should pay to refit buildings that failed fire tests in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire are holding up works and 44 MPs have told the housing secretary, James Brokenshire: “Our constituents … need you to act now.” Government tests showed 304 buildings failed to meet building regulations after the disaster 11 months ago, which claimed 72 lives. Only seven of those buildings are so far known to have completed remedial works. The bill has been estimated at about £1bn and residents in some buildings have been told the value of their homes has slumped, in one case from £475,000 to £50,000. The call came as the National Fire Chiefs Council issued new guidance stating that using fire wardens to patrol apartment blocks, which have cost leaseholders thousands of pounds a week, are not adequate and fire alarms should be installed. People living in affected blocks have previously been told they may need to evacuate in the case of a fire instead of sticking to existing “stay put” instructions. The guidance states that “a temporary change to a simultaneous evacuation strategy is likely to be necessary until the failings have been rectified”. Fire chiefs have preferred the stay put strategy partly because evacuation of large buildings can delay firefighting and rescue and it can be difficult for disabled people to get out unassisted. But they said the risk posed by failed cladding systems outweighed those risks. “Nearly a year after Grenfell, not enough has been done to prevent another fire,” said the MPs’ letter, which was organised by Steve Reed, the MP for Croydon North, who has campaigned for the removal of flammable cladding from the 95-apartment Citiscape building in his area. A property tribunal has ruled that the leaseholders, rather than the management company, should pay £500,000 to make their building safe. “There is overwhelming public support for action to protect these people from fire,” the MPs said. “Leaseholders facing unaffordable debt, unsaleable homes and who fear for their safety need help now. You cannot leave them living in limbo for years while the courts establish legal liability. In the end this is about the protection of human life and the right of every family in this country to know their home is safe. We urge the government to accept responsibility for putting things right because no one else can.” The previous housing secretary, Sajid Javid, had insisted that building owners were responsible for making their properties safe. In January, his spokesperson said: “We are clear we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders. We are keeping the situation under review.” A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We are working with councils and fire services to help building owners take immediate steps to keep residents safe. “Dame Judith Hackitt is also carrying out a review into building and fire safety, and she will report back shortly.” The letter from the 43 Labour MPs and one Liberal Democrat comes amid growing pressure on the prime minister to build trust in the government’s response to the Grenfell disaster. On Monday, a week before the start of the public inquiry, parliament will debate calls from bereaved families and survivors for Theresa May to appoint additional panel members representative of the community to sit alongside the chair of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, “to ensure those affected have confidence in and are willing to fully participate”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/11/edward-kienholz-dadaism-david-nash-richard-long-week-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:03:02Z","webTitle":"Cold war dadaism, symbolic Scots and dreadful dentistry  – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/11/edward-kienholz-dadaism-david-nash-richard-long-week-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/11/edward-kienholz-dadaism-david-nash-richard-long-week-art","fields":{"headline":"Cold war dadaism, symbolic Scots and dreadful dentistry  – the week in art","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter Data protection laws are changing in the UK, under an initiative called GDPR.

Christ’s upper body is held by angels for us to see the flesh that proves his humanity. It is a gentle, poetic encounter that makes the dead Christ uncannily real and immediate while inviting sombre contemplation. In its tender compassion it anticipates Michelangelo’s Pietà, carved three decades later at the end of the 1490s. • National Gallery, London Image of the week Mud is not a promising medium: it’s dull, thick and ungainly stuff. Yet Richard Long’s huge new mud drawing Gravity Crescent – part of his excellent show at London’s Lisson Gallery – is hypnotic, full of complex 3D curves that snare the eye. It looks as if eels are nesting in the wall. They writhe and wriggle, each tubular body created by a swerve of Long’s mud-stick. The raw wet earth with which he created this towering work comes from the river Avon, so perhaps the material is haunted by the river’s flashing, silver-scaled creatures. His muddy swirls mass in an engrossing swarm, capturing the flow and life of the river.

Yes, if the line-up of participants of London Craft Week – which kicked off in the capital yesterday – is anything to go by. The five-day event features several influential fashion names including Loewe, Mulberry, Christian Louboutin, Le Kilt, Alice Archer, Gieves &amp; Hawkes and Delpozo. All are taking part in workshops, exhibitions and events that aim to make the link between craft and fashion a strong one. And why wouldn’t they? In the past five years, craft has become really cool in fashion. Chanel’s autumn/winter 2016 couture show was dedicated to the women who craft the collections, known as the “petit mains”; brands which prioritise the local artisan – such as Hiut Jeans, which reinvigorated the town of Cardigan by setting up its business there – have been hailed as examples to follow. Meanwhile, fashion influencers are giving equal importance to timeless objects – such as glassware and ceramics – as they are the latest fashion trend. The creative director Alex Eagle, for example, sells hand-embroidered shoes alongside hand-thrown tableware by ceramicist Nicola Easton, while Laura Jackson’s forthcoming collection for Habitat in June features what she calls “a Wes Anderson jug – it’s massive and half red, half pink!” Collectively, it has been firmly put on the fashion industry’s agenda – and no brand has done more to plug the gap in the mainstream conscious than Loewe, the go-to luxury fashion label for purposeful pieces that have an artistic twist. Its annual Craft prize, which was set up by its creative director Jonathan Anderson in 2013, celebrates and supports international artisans who “demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value” in disciplines including ceramics, bookbinding, jewellery, leather, textiles, metal and wood. It awards €50,000 (£44,100) to the winner. “It’s about being associated with something – that’s the biggest thing we have culturally at the moment, trying to define ourselves not through image, but with a skill,” says Anderson. “When I joined Loewe, I wanted to set this prize up because I would be in the factory and see people who work in my team sit there painstakingly making bags – I mean hours and hours – and we forget that. We have teams of craftspeople refining and refining ... the hours that goes into making a bag is crazy. I thought: ‘How can I do something which I love and shed light on things that should have more light on it?’ While we are engulfed in communication and imagery, there [remains] something in humanity that makes us want to touch and thats what craft is about.” Last week, the 2018 prize shed light on Jennifer Lee, the London-based ceramicist from Aberdeenshire who has developed a unique method of colouring her clay by mixing it with metallic oxides. Lee observes the increased interest in her craft in recent years as bittersweet. “It suddenly is cool, but so bizarre, too, because all these art schools are closing their ceramics departments which is awful. At Camberwell [College of Arts], for example, where some of the most incredible makers have come through, there’s no longer a specific ceramics department because funding has been cut.” At Mulberry, which is hosting demonstrations of how its leather goods are handmade in its London flagship, an apprenticeship programme was established in 2006 to preserve the skill set that is at risk of being lost from such spending cuts. “We feel the responsibility to educate new generations about the beauty of making to nurture the talent of the people that will be driving the fashion and luxury industry in the future,” says its creative director Johnny Coca. “The programme is one of the reasons why I wanted to join Mulberry. It’s incredibly important; if we hadn’t started it [when we did], we would have been at risk of losing our workforce in the years to come. We have a commitment to be manufacturing most of our leathers goods in the UK and this scheme is crucial to keep building our future heritage.” If honouring craft is crucial to maintaining a fashion workforce, its current renaissance can also be attributed to the current rhetoric surrounding sustainability, says Samantha Roach, founder and designer at London fashion week favourite Le Kilt. “Young people in particular seem much more interested in the provenance of their clothing. They want to understand how their clothes are made and who has made them,” she says. Traditional craftsmanship is at the heart of Roach’s brand, which is running workshops over LCW in collaboration with the textile design consultancy Norn, to help educate attendees on artisanal craft techniques. It also has a current exhibition, Innovation Through Tradition, at the Michael Hoppen Gallery. “We want our customers to understand the value in an item of clothing that has its own personal story through repair, provenance and DIY touches,” says Roach. “For example, we have unravelled discarded tartan fabrics and used the yarns to weave into patches, therefore ensuring nothing goes to waste. Subculture has always been an important reference point, and we see craft as a form of anti-consumerism – it’s our own statement against disposable fashion. By educating people on the impact that clothing production has on the environment, we hope it will encourage people to invest their garments.” Craft does not, however, equate only to something handmade in the fashion landscape. It can incorporate specialist digital processes too, says the fashion designer Alice Archer, whose brand is famous for its intricate embroidery. “When I was a student, I learned how to hand-embroider and I worked for years as a hand-embroiderer, practising the skill. Now in my collections, I use digital embroidery like it is hand embroidery. I programme every single stitch on my computer, as if I am embroidering it by hand. This gives the embroideries some irregularities and a more emotional and human feeling, while making them infinitely reproducible.” Archer, who has pieces from her archive on display in the windows of The Place on Brook Street, during LCW also notes the “strong desire for modern takes on craft techniques such as embroidery, smocking, hand painted and printed pieces, and historic detailing” in the luxury fashion industry at the moment. “Clients seek unique products and experiences and want clothing to feel personal – I think ... people will invest more money in special pieces that are more timeless and classic and involve special craft processes.” Anderson agrees: “As a society we are a very romantic people. The romanticism of someone wearing a basket or making something is an inspiration. As a designer, I get more inspiration from doing [the Loewe Prize] that fuels what I do [than anything else]. I think if we have to encourage the next generation and this is what it’s about.” See the full London Craft Week schedule here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/10/radical-legacy-1968-neoliberalism-progressive","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:46:01Z","webTitle":"The radical legacy of 1968 is under attack.

We must defend it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fifty years ago today, the “night of the barricades” in Paris’s Left Bank saw riot police mounting a sustained assault on student protesters. The students responded by throwing paving stones and molotov cocktails. More than 350 people were injured and 450 arrested. Already, protests were spreading throughout France. On 13 May the French trade unions called a general strike. Consciously Marxist in its politics, the May rebellion was dramatic but not the only insurrectionary moment of 1968. In February communist guerrillas invaded the American embassy in Saigon. In April the assassination of Martin Luther King provoked riots across America. In August, anti-Vietnam war protests led to pitched battles outside the Chicago Democratic convention, and the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the Prague spring. How odd, then, to be told that the most enduring legacy of 1968 was not the radicalism of the student and anti-war movement, but the neoliberalism of the 1980s. Yet this idea is becoming increasingly prevalent, and not just on the right. The 60s revolutionary Régis Debray claims that 1968 let loose the ultra-capitalism of the 80s and 90s. From the British left, Anthony Barnett argues (in his Brexit book The Lure of Greatness) that 1968 led to a renewal not of socialism, but of capitalism. In a Guardian article on the V&amp;A museum’s 2016 exhibition about the late-60s counterculture, Polly Toynbee lamented that “out of all this revolution against ‘the system’ came a ‘me’ individualism that grew into neoliberalism”. For me, this debate is particularly urgent: I am preparing a new version of Maydays, a play that I wrote in 1983 about the mixed trajectories of those who – like me – were radical students in 1968. I am also rehearsing an autobiographical one-person show about how that year feels to me now. To do this I have interviewed others who were and are still active in the movements that emerged from the left’s annus mirabilis. It has been a sobering but ultimately sustaining experience. Certainly 1968 didn’t achieve its promise. As Tariq Ali points out, the only government to be actually overthrown by the people was that of Pakistan’s military dictator Ayub Khan. The French insurrection ended with President de Gaulle winning a general election landslide. Richard Nixon won the US presidency. But De Gaulle would not have needed his election without the uprising; and Nixon’s victory was the result of Lyndon Johnson’s de facto resignation, in the face of protests that threatened to make the war unwinnable and America ungovernable. And those protests fuelled the atmosphere of paranoia in Nixon’s White House that led to his fall six years later. As the sociologist Stuart Hall argued, one should judge political events not just by their outcome, but by their impact: 1968 was the climax of a new politics that combined an anti-Stalinist re-reading of Marxism with avant-garde cultural expression, a general spirit of anti-authoritarian rebelliousness, and a politics of personal emancipation. The idea that all of this enabled Thatcherism would have been a particular surprise to the lady herself, who was vituperative about the 60s – blaming it for the 1981 riots in Brixton and Toxteth, precisely because of the “permissive claptrap” that denigrated “the old virtues of discipline and self-restraint”. When she set out to destroy the National Union of Mineworkers and the Greater London Council, she had the 60s in her sights. Indeed, as its economic adviser Hilary Wainwright points out, the GLC was the spirit of 1968 in office. One further, obvious example of 60s permissive claptrap was the women’s liberation movement, which proved (along with the green movement) to be 1968’s most powerful and enduring political legacy. It’s possible to define feminism in purely individual terms – certainly, it transformed the personal lives of millions of women. But it also transformed the political and legislative landscape: the 70s feminist campaigner Anna Coote co-authored a guide to women’s rights, which had to be quickly revised because so many of its demands had been won. The militant feminists who attacked the 1970 Miss World contest paved the way for #MeToo, as the 1969 Stonewall riots against police harassment of a New York gay bar helped to bring about gay marriage. Far from dwindling into individualism, these movements provided an organisational vocabulary for the future. The uprisings of 2011 used technology developed by Silicon Valley capitalists: as Paul Mason points out, the Egyptian revolution was planned on Facebook, organised on Twitter and broadcast on YouTube. But the inspiration lay in the silk-screened poster art of May 1968. From black power to Black Lives Matter, from Chicago’s Lincoln Park to the steps of London’s St Paul’s, the form and content of late-60s protest saw itself renewed nearly 50 years later. There is another echo. The Egyptian revolution mobilised the unionised working class as well as the secular graduate young. The 1968 French évenéments started with demands by female and male students at the University of Nanterre for the right to sleep together. It ended with the largest strike in postwar European history. The British women’s liberation movement was inspired by Ford Dagenham machinists demanding equal pay. The industrial uprising against the 1970-74 Heath government drew on the tactics of student protest – the first major action was the occupation of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, to prevent its closure. At its best, the left has fought for both economic equality and social emancipation. Sometimes these strands have become divided, or even seen as contradictory. But 1968 brought them back together, on a global scale, and with a vengeance. • David Edgar is a playwright. His one-person show, Trying It On, opens at Warwick Arts Centre on 7 June.

Only a week in I had to deal with three failed direct debits which involved lengthy calls to the likes of British Gas and BT. First Direct, despite the guarantee, cannot give me any assurance that this won’t continue with my many other direct debits. It is blaming Bacs and a recent change to its switching processes and says there is nothing it can do. I’m anticipating a month of call centre hell as I am having to manually set up new direct debits with every company I deal with. There is no warning from anyone about the potential problems of a switch and if I’d known there was a chance of this happening I wouldn’t have done so. I’m frustrated and angry at the time-consuming mess I have now got to sort out. First Direct tried to be helpful and its advisers have been sympathetic but without being able to resolve it. They even gave me £30 compensation but, to be honest, I would much rather the situation was sorted out as I am time poor. KMcM, Liverpool So-called “seven-day switching” was introduced by all UK banks in 2013 in a £750m systems overhaul to ensure direct debits and payments can be transferred between providers in the space of a week. The idea was to encourage people to move while giving responsibility for reorganising direct debits and other payments to the new bank, rather than the customer. Before this, switching could take 18 to 30 working days. The guarantee means that your old account will only close when everything has been moved, while the participating banks will refund any charges that arise from mistakes. So you have been particularly let down – and the obstacle is that First Direct says that data protection rules mean it cannot deal with the companies with the failed direct debits. First Direct (part of HSBC) tells us that the issue was the result of an error which resulted in your direct debit originator cancelling your mandate, as opposed to collecting. It is the responsibility of the new bank to take control of the situation and sort out any problems. First Direct says: “We set ourselves high standards for customer service, and we’d like to offer our sincere apologies to KMcM for his experience. He has been protected by the current account switch guarantee which provides cover against any problems encountered as a result of a switch. We’ve apologised and offered compensation for the inconvenience.” Bacs Payment Schemes Ltd, which owns and runs the Current Account Switch Service, says: “We understand this arose as the result of a processing error. All customers are protected by the guarantee and we understand First Direct has provided compensation.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Someone who has been medically certified as having a permanent condition that affects their intelligence and social functioning (such as Alzheimer’s, but many other conditions apply) is “disregarded for council tax purposes” in England, Scotland and Wales. If the person diagnosed as SMI lives with just one other adult, the council tax discount is 25%. If the person diagnosed as SMI lives alone, the discount rises to 100%. Families who only discover the discount long after a parent has, say, dementia, can apply for a backdating of the discount at some – though not all – councils. The campaign is being led by MoneySavingExpert.com and the Alzheimer’s Society. Christine Peel says: “I had no idea people with mental impairments do not have to pay.” Her mother, Joan, has Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Peel found out about the discount through MoneySavingExpert six months ago. When diagnosed in 2005, her mother lived alone in South Shields until she entered a care home in 2014. Peel received a backdated 100% discount from South Tyneside council for the time she lived at home with the conditions, totalling £6,399. Richard Hawker claimed back £7,000 of backdated council tax on behalf of his 96-year-old mother, who had a cerebral stroke in 2008, causing dementia-like symptoms. She received a reduction as far back as 2008. Now, as she lives alone, she has a 100% discount. An investigation by MoneySavingExpert last year revealed that tens of thousands of people are likely to be missing out on the discount, which is estimated to be worth an average of £400 a year. But take-up remains low, and patchy from once council to the next. In Spelthorne borough council in Surrey, the website found only 10 residents had claimed, while in Ashford in Kent the figure was 423, despite having similar populations. One problem is that many councils give out wrong information to claimants, which often deters them from making a claim. Many councils say claimants must be in receipt of one of a number of benefits – such as attendance allowance – to make a claim. But one only has to be eligible for the benefit, not actually in receipt of it, to be able to claim. Another issue is the definition of SMI. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, a person must be diagnosed as having “severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning which appears to be permanent, and has a certificate confirming this impairment from a registered medical practitioner”. Lee Allen, the Alzheimer’s Society’s services manager for Worcestershire, says: “Lack of awareness and information about council tax discounts, and other financial support out there, only makes the situation harder for people with dementia. It’s crucial that discounts are clearly signposted locally, and simple to apply for, to make sure people get the support they are entitled to. You can find support and advice about dementia by speaking to our national helpline on 0300 222 11 22.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/10/brad-shields-eddie-jones-england-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T12:15:35Z","webTitle":"Brad Shields not alone for Eddie Jones as an England forward newcomer | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/10/brad-shields-eddie-jones-england-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/10/brad-shields-eddie-jones-england-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"Brad Shields not alone for Eddie Jones as an England forward newcomer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England’s tour squad for South Africa reads like one of those wedding‑day rhymes for superstitious brides: something old, something new, something borrowed, something out of the blue. There is more than enough in Eddie Jones’s trousseau for the three-Test series next month to raise eyebrows in both hemispheres. Three names particularly stand out in a 34-man squad shaped partly by injury and Jones’s desire to rest certain individuals. Danny Cipriani is finally back in the frame at the age of 30, granted one last chance to show he can be the man to revitalise England’s attacking game, while Sale’s Cameron Redpath, still an 18-year‑old schoolboy, has been plucked from England’s age-group ranks. In addition, on temporary loan from a disgruntled New Zealand, there is a slot for the Hurricanes captain, Brad Shields, English qualified via his parents but until now a complete stranger to the game in these parts. If Cipriani and Redpath are almost romantic choices, giving the lie to those who reckon English rugby is dull and conservative, Shields, who joins Wasps next season, is all about hard-nosed practicality. While it feels unsatisfactory to be picking a player who has never played a game of rugby in England ahead of those who have slogged their way through an entire Premiership season, Jones clearly feels his depleted pack needs all the imported oomph it can get in South Africa. With 20 players unavailable for the trip either through injury or because they are being rested and Billy Vunipola still feeling his way back for Saracens, there are a limited number of experienced ball-carrying back-rowers still standing and the 27-year-old Shields unquestionably fits the bill on that front. Is it reasonable, even so, to expect him to vault straight out of Super Rugby into the first Test at Ellis Park without breaking stride, having barely met his team-mates? Good luck to him if he does. Then again players such as Saracens’ Ben Earl, Wasps’ Jack Willis and Exeter’s Jonny Hill have hardly any experience in this sort of company either. Earl and Willis, fitness permitting, both have the potential to be England squad members for a long time; both are lively young forwards with something about them who, along with Sale’s Tom Curry, will be invited to solve some of England’s recurring back-row problems. Hill can be relied upon to get stuck in regardless, just as he does for Chiefs, but it is significant that Jones ultimately felt he could not leave stalwarts such as Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Joe Launchbury or Chris Robshaw behind. Without them England’s brave new world would have started to look worryingly callow, particularly with Exeter’s Don Armand conspicuously absent. Sale’s Jono Ross and Newcastle’s Gary Graham must also have been close, though the Falcons’ reliable Mark Wilson has made the cut. If Redpath ends up making his Test debut it will certainly be a meteoric rise given he was playing in the Rosslyn Park schools sevens for Sedbergh only a few weeks ago. Boy wonders do not always flower into 100-cap legends but the son of the former Scotland scrum-half Bryan has better genes than most and is happy to play at 10 or 12. As with Owen Farrell and George Ford in the past, having a professional rugby coach as a father is useful for fast‑tracking talent. Farrell, as expected, will be captain in Dylan Hartley’s continuing absence, which leaves Cipriani in danger of spending three weeks holding tackle bags unless the Wasps man can prove to Jones and his latest Australian hired attack consultant, Scott Wisemantel, that he is in demonstrably better form than the other established No 10, Ford. What a story it would be, however, if Cipriani were to re-emerge, almost 10 years after his last Test start, a 42-6 defeat by the Springboks at Twickenham in November 2008. First and foremost, though, England need to start winning again following three successive Six Nations defeats, starting in Johannesburg on 9 June. If not, some of the fresh relationships Jones hopes to establish next month will not last long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/ecuador-julian-assange-why-does-it-want-him-out-london-embassy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T16:00:28Z","webTitle":"Why does Ecuador want Assange out of its London embassy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/ecuador-julian-assange-why-does-it-want-him-out-london-embassy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/ecuador-julian-assange-why-does-it-want-him-out-london-embassy","fields":{"headline":"Why does Ecuador want Assange out of its London embassy?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Has Ecuador run out of patience with Julian Assange? Yes. Emphatically. In his first year in office, Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, called Assange a “hacker”, an “inherited problem” and a “stone in the shoe”. The language could not be clearer. Moreno has made it plain that the world’s most famous lodger has overstayed his welcome in Ecuador’s London embassy. Nearly six years ago, it was a different story. When Ecuador granted Assange political asylum on 16 August 2012, the country’s then foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, said Ecuador believed the WikiLeaks founder’s fear of persecution was legitimate and praised “his dedicated defence of freedom of expression” in a speech in Quito. But what was expected to be a stopover turned into a lengthy sojourn and Assange became one of the world’s most high-profile fugitives. During the past six years, he has refused to step out of the embassy building, fearing he would be arrested by British police and extradited to the US for questioning over WikiLeaks’ activities. Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences in May 2017, saying “all possibilities to conduct the investigation were exhausted”. However, he remains subject to arrest in the UK for jumping bail. Even his one-time champion Rafael Correa, who was president of Ecuador from 2007 to 2017, recently told journalists in Madrid that Assange’s “days were numbered”. Correa said Moreno, his former protege with whom he is now bitterly at odds, would “throw [Assange] out of the embassy at the first pressure from the United States”. Why has Ecuador changed its mind about him? Assange’s behaviour has not endeared him to his hosts. For instance, his tweets in favour of Catalan independence are said to have annoyed the Spanish government, souring relations between Madrid and Quito. The publication by WikiLeaks of emails connected to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election may be another reason why Ecuador’s foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa, said at the start of this year that Assange’s continued stay was “unsustainable”. Moreno has been seeking to build bridges with the US, restoring trade ties that were damaged in recent years. A poll in March showed 76.2% of Ecuadorians wanted the government to expel Assange from the embassy. How can Ecuador get him out of the embassy? In March, Ecuador cut off Assange’s internet connection, saying it had acted because he had breached an agreement not to issue messages that might interfere with other states. In a statement, the government said his behaviour on social media “put at risk the good relations [Ecuador] maintains with the United Kingdom, with the other states of the European Union, and with other nations”. Ecuador seems to be hoping that Assange’s already uncomfortable confinement will become intolerable. Are there any other options? It is hard to see how Assange can leave the embassy and not end up being arrested for breach of bail, which could lead to him being imprisoned. Ecuador has explored a number of other ideas, none of which seems feasible. In January, its foreign ministry said Assange had been made an Ecuadorian citizen in an attempt to resolve the impasse over his continued stay at the embassy. The UK Foreign Office responded by saying: “Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice.” Espinosa is one of two candidates campaigning to be elected the 73rd president of the UN general assembly next month. Some in Ecuador have speculated that she might appoint Assange as Ecuador’s United Nations representative, in order to get him UN diplomatic status so he can leave the UK. However, the foreign ministry has said if Espinosa is elected, she would not be responsible for Assange’s case. Intelligence service documents seen by the Guardian suggest the UN idea has previously been considered. Assange’s nomination as Ecuador’s representative to the UN would afford him diplomatic immunity while travelling to UN meetings around the world, one document said. It also suggested trying to smuggle him out in a diplomatic vehicle, but accepted the fact that to do so he would have to leave the embassy, and risk being detained, before getting into the car. British police ended a costly 24-hour guard of the embassy in October 2015, but the building remains under covert surveillance. Key figures Rafael Correa: president of Ecuador from 2007 to 2017 Correa came to power in 2007 at the tail end of the “pink tide” that swept through Latin America, ushering in leftist leaders such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia. Correa styled himself as an anti-imperialist, shunning what was regarded as US interference in the region. He won three elections and changed the constitution while courting, at the peak of his powers, the highest approval rating of any leader in the country’s history. The US-trained economist faced criticism when he announced in 2008 that Ecuador was officially defaulting on billions of dollars of foreign debt, forcing the country to seek unfavourable loans, particularly from China. But it was Correa’s authoritarian style and constant attacks against the press that drew more international opprobrium. He brought in a communications law that obliged media outlets to carry government messages, and used his weekly TV shows to personally attack journalists, often tearing up newspapers. Correa came to wider international attention after offering asylum to Assange in 2012. He left behind a wealthier and fairer country, but a more divided one. Lenín Moreno: president of Ecuador Moreno narrowly won the 2017 election as Correa’s successor and the candidate for his Alianza País party. Some dismissed Moreno as a puppet of his domineering predecessor, but he soon proved to be his own man. Moreno, the world’s only head of state to use a wheelchair, made good on a pledge to tackle graft by sacking the former vice-president Jorge Glas, a close ally of Correa, with Glas later sentenced to six years in jail for corruption. He criticised Correa for mismanaging the economy and leaving the country saddled with debt, mostly to China. The result is a bitter feud between former allies. Moreno, who served as Correa’s vice-president from 2007 to 2013, has repeatedly hinted that he wants to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He has also stressed that his respect for press freedom is one of his key differences with his predecessor. Moreno has a fondness for singing in public and making jokes. He has written books about humour, which he used to alleviate depression when he was left partially paralysed after being shot in a robbery in 1998. He is leading advocate of disabled rights in Ecuador, for which he was nominated for the Nobel peace prize in 2012. Moreno was appointed the UN special envoy on disability and accessibility in December 2013. This article was amended on 16 May 2018. An earlier version said that Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation because they were unable to question Assange. Assange was questioned at the Ecuadorian embassy in November 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/populists-rise-to-power-in-italy-sets-perilous-precedent-for-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T11:35:46Z","webTitle":"Populists’ rise to power in Italy sets perilous precedent for EU | Jon Henley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/populists-rise-to-power-in-italy-sets-perilous-precedent-for-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/populists-rise-to-power-in-italy-sets-perilous-precedent-for-eu","fields":{"headline":"Populists’ rise to power in Italy sets perilous precedent for EU","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Italy’s new government, likely to be formally confirmed within the next few days, sets a perilous precedent for Brussels: it marks the first time a founding member of the EU has been led by populist, anti-EU forces. From the EU’s perspective, the coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League looks headstrong and unpredictable, possibly even combustible. Leaked drafts of their government “contract” include provision for a “conciliation committee” to settle expected disagreements. Mainly it looks alarming. Both parties toned down their fiercest anti-EU rhetoric during the election campaign, dropping previous calls for a referendum on eurozone membership (popular votes on international treaties are, in any case, barred by the Italian constitution). But as they approach power, the historical Euroscepticism of the M5S and the League is resurfacing. An incendiary early version of their accord called for the renegotiation of EU treaties, the creation of a euro opt-out mechanism, a reduction in Italy’s contribution to the EU budget and the cancellation of €250bn (£219bn) of Italian government debt. The parties’ leaders, Luigi Di Maio of M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League (who counts the likes of Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán as his allies), were quick to say this leak was premature, and a later version of their contract showed the section on Europe had been much watered down. The euro opt-out had gone, and calls for changes to EU treaties and monetary policy were marked in red, meaning they are yet to be agreed. But the draft still urged a debate on the EU’s stability and growth pact, greater powers for the European parliament, a denunciation of austerity policies and the repatriation of “certain EU competences” to member states. The general tenor certainly suggests the new government will not back down from its belief that – in the words of one senior League official, Lorenzo Fontana – “people come before economic obligations”. Complaining about “unelected Eurocrats”, M5S’s Di Maio said it was time for Italy to “show courage … and change things”. The coalition could also fall out with Brussels over its plans for a clampdown on immigration and a call to cancel all economic sanctions on Russia. But of far greater concern in EU capitals are a raft of tax-cutting, welfare-boosting and budget-busting economic and social policies that could spell serious trouble in the eurozone. Both parties’ election manifestos promised to scrap pension changes made in 2011. They also reportedly plan to introduce a 15-20% flat tax and some form of minimum basic income, both of which may get watered down but are almost certain to be reflected in drastic tax cuts and big increases in welfare spending. Economists and the Italian media have costed the agreed M5S-League policy programme at between €65bn and €100bn. And the two parties have repeatedly said they feel no need to respect European commitments in implementing their programme. Fed up with the country’s long, seemingly irreversible economic decline, persistent high unemployment, and a refugee and migrant crisis, Italy’s voters turned on the political centre that has governed (or failed to govern) Italy since the 1980s. But some analysts fear that if the radical new government they elected does push ahead with its promised policies, the result could be a Greek-style banking and debt crisis in the eurozone’s third-largest economy. Italy’s debt mountain is €2.3tn, or 132% of GDP, the highest ratio anywhere in Europe apart from Greece. If – and it’s a big if – the coalition starts reversing recent reforms and racking up deficits, markets could rapidly lose faith in Italy’s ability to repay. And if that happens, things could turn quite nasty, quite quickly. Europe’s, and especially the eurozone’s, biggest fear is that Italy plunges into the kind of economic meltdown that eventually came very close to catapulting Greece – by that stage led, remember, by a radical-left government that was hellbent on overthrowing the eurozone’s rules – out of the single currency in 2015. The parallel is far from perfect, and neither M5S nor the League seem to be spoiling for the kind of fight that Syriza once sought. But the EU could most certainly do without a Greek-style crisis on an Italian scale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis-and-other-tales-of-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:45:00Z","webTitle":"How Cape Town cracked its water crisis, and other tales of hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis-and-other-tales-of-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/how-cape-town-cracked-its-water-crisis-and-other-tales-of-hope","fields":{"headline":"How Cape Town cracked its water crisis, and other tales of hope","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the obvious consequences of climate change is that our reservoirs of fresh water are running out. As global temperatures continue to rise, people around the globe will have to figure out how to manage with less water. This week we looked at how one city united to tackle its water crisis, and found other tales of people coming together and turning around bleak situations. When Cape Town announced it was rapidly approaching “Day Zero”, the moment it would turn off the water supply to a million homes due to drought, the news made headlines around the world. Four months on and the taps are still on – for now. Krista Mahr visited South Africa’s second city to find out how they did it, and what lessons can be learned by cities facing up to similar emergencies. There’s certainly no shortage of rain in the north of England, but austerity has taken a toll on community spirit there and villages and towns have fallen into disrepair. In Todmorden, residents got their hands dirty and found a solution. Naomi Larsson visited the tiny Yorkshire town from which a global movement has grown. In nearby Sheffield, Kate Lyons met some people tackling the taboo of adults with few friend when you’re an adult. Studies regularly tell us we’re feeling lonelier than ever, largely due to the decline of traditional meeting places such as churches, pubs and bricks-and-mortar workplaces. Could “speed mating” fill the gap? What we liked: Two great pieces in the New York Times caught our eye, the first on the rocks in Oman that could help save the planet, and the second on news that humpback whales near Antartica are having a baby boom. What we heard: My local community got permission to turn disused land surrounded by houses into a community garden. It started off very basic, with just some raised planting beds growing some veg. We’ve now got a poly tunnel, a brick pizza oven and barbecue and another bit of land just around the corner which we’ve planted as an apple and pear orchard. We get the local primary schools involved, and the local care home too. We grow far more food than we can eat ourselves so we hold public open days and donate excess to the local community centre, who distribute it to those who need it. Commenter Cade writing below the line on our piece about guerilla gardening It’s fantastic that they averted this, but surely one of the takeaways is that people are capable of living with less and moderating their habits if they understand the consequences – or if the consequences are severe enough. From golf courses in the middle of the desert in Phoenix to people watering their lawns at noon in Los Angeles to growing water-thirsty crops like alfalfa – why do we need to wait to start behaving more sensibly?

There were 25,475 such cancellations in the first three months of 2018, equating to 1.3% of all admissions, the highest proportion since 2005. The Royal College of Surgeons blamed the increase on “extreme pressures” on A&amp;E departments and delayed discharges. Its vice-president, Ian Eardley, said: “Patients are being forced to wait too long for planned surgery and an unacceptable number have suffered the stress of having their operation cancelled at the last minute. It is very distressing for patients who are often in pain or immobile, and the delay could mean that their condition deteriorates.” The last-minute cancellations were on top of the large number postponed in advance. Over the winter NHS England told hospitals to cancel tens of thousands of planned operations in order to free up beds. The statistics published on Thursday also show that 11.6% of patients who had their operation cancelled did not have their treatment rearranged within 28 days – again the highest proportion since 2005. The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks to start planned treatment was 491,102 in March, up 35% on a year ago. Only 87.2% of patients were seen within 18 weeks; the government’s 92% target has not been met since February 2016. The number of patients having to wait more than a year for treatment rose to 2,755, up 80% on a year ago. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, described the record number of cancelled operations as “a badge of shame for ministers”, blaming a lack of investment. The proportion of patients at hospital A&amp;E departments treated within the government’s four-hour target was 82% in April, well below the 95% standard but an improvement on the historic low of 76.4% in March. The regulator NHS Improvement said: “Too many patients are still waiting too long in A&amp;E and for planned surgery.” NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said services were clearly overstretched. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government had committed to a “sustainable multi-year settlement” for the NHS to help manage growing patient demand. “The number of cancelled operations remains low in the context of the millions of operations performed in the NHS each year,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/10/hundreds-firms-face-action-failure-report-pay-gap-gender","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T17:14:25Z","webTitle":"UK firms face action over failure to report gender pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/hundreds-firms-face-action-failure-report-pay-gap-gender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/10/hundreds-firms-face-action-failure-report-pay-gap-gender","fields":{"headline":"UK firms face action over failure to report gender pay gap","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of companies are being pursued by Britain’s equality watchdog after failing to file gender pay gap data on time. This year, for the first time, all companies and public bodies with more than 250 employees were legally obliged to publish the gap between the average amount paid to a man in their business compared with the average for a woman. The data compares men in all roles with women in all roles, rather than those in similar jobs, in a bid to highlight the prevalence of men in high-paid and management roles and to encourage companies to make changes. More than 10,600 employers have reported the gender pay gap data alongside their bonus pay gap and the proportion of men and women in four different pay grades. Last month, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the legislation, contacted 1,500 companies who had failed to report by the 4 April deadline. Since then, some have complied or been found not to be covered by the legislation. However the EHRC said it was still investigating up to 500 companies. Rebecca Hilsenrath, the EHRC chief executive, said: “Breach of these regulations is breaking the law and we’ve always been clear we will enforce with zero tolerance.” Under the statutory investigation, the EHRC is obliged to publish the terms of reference within a month of providing employers with a first draft. It is also expected to name the companies being targeted. After publishing the terms of reference it will gather evidence over a two-week period and provide a draft report within another 14 days. The final report is expected to be published three weeks later after considering representations from the employer or their lawyers. Those firms that try to avoid the statutory requirement could face a summary conviction, an unlimited fine and be forced to publish the data under a court order. The Guardian’s analysis of the 10,014 employers who submitted data by the deadline revealed that almost eight out of 10 paid men more than women. No sector paid women more than men on average. The data showed women were being paid a median hourly rate that, on average, was 9.7% less than their male colleagues received."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/11/christopher-columbus-son-worlds-first-search-engine-hernando-colon","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T10:00:38Z","webTitle":"How Christopher Columbus's son built 'the world's first search engine'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/christopher-columbus-son-worlds-first-search-engine-hernando-colon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/11/christopher-columbus-son-worlds-first-search-engine-hernando-colon","fields":{"headline":"How Christopher Columbus's son built 'the world's first search engine'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For 30 years, Hernando Colón, the illegitimate son of Christopher Columbus, travelled the world with a quest, albeit one very different to that of his coloniser father: to build the biggest library the world had ever seen. Between 1509 and his death in 1539, Colón travelled all over Europe – in 1530 alone he visited Rome, Bologna, Modena, Parma, Turin, Milan, Venice, Padua, Innsbruck, Augsburg, Constance, Basle, Fribourg, Cologne, Maastricht, Antwerp, Paris, Poitiers and Burgos – buying books everywhere he went and eventually amassing the greatest private library in Europe. Colón’s aim, to create a universal library containing “all books, in all languages and on all subjects, that can be found both within Christendom and without”, has been charted for the first time in English in a forthcoming biography. “He had somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 books,” says Cambridge academic Dr Edward Wilson-Lee. “That maybe doesn’t sound that big nowadays, but it was at least an order of magnitude bigger than the biggest libraries of the day. Most other people, even very bookish people, would have had a couple of hundred books. Other big collections of the day were around 3,000 – this was at least five times as big.” Wilson-Lee, whose biography of Colón, The Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books, is published this month by William Collins, finds it astonishing that the bibliomaniac’s story has not previously been told in English. “This is a story that was known about, but largely only to a small group of Spanish book historians,” he says. “But this was a project that was very much the reciprocal of his father’s ideas about circling the world – it was another millenarian grand project, to build this universal library.” Unlike most collectors of the day, who according to Wilson-Lee “were trawling around Swiss monasteries looking for ancient Greek manuscripts”, Colón was interested in print – and collected everything he could lay his hands on. Manuscripts, pamphlets, tavern posters – all made their way into his library. Over Christmas 1521, he bought 700 books in Nuremberg, and 1,000 more a month later. “This was someone who was, in a way, changing the model of what knowledge is. Instead of saying ‘knowledge is august, authoritative things by some venerable old Roman and Greek people’, he’s doing it inductively: taking everything that everyone knows and distilling it upwards from there,” says Wilson-Lee. “It’s much more resonant with today, with big data and Wikipedia and crowdsourced information. This is a model of knowledge that says, ‘We’re going to take the breadth of print – ballads and pornography and newsletters – and not exclude that from the world of information.’” Writing the book, Wilson-Lee has been charting the sheer breadth of Colón’s acquisitions – on Twitter. On 9 May 1531, Colón “bought a pamphlet on the 1529 Peace of Cambrai; his is the only surviving copy”; on 6 May, he acquired Capodilista’s 1475 guidebook to the Holy Land; in April he “paid 24 pfenins for a 1487 tract on priesthood at Augsburg”. Colón’s ambition echoed that of his father, who believed that Spain would one day control the whole world, the head of a universal empire. Colón considered his library to be “the brain”: housing all the information he could find across the world so that, as Wilson-Lee describes it, “any question that needed to be answered could be answered, and no information was lost”. Colón would record where and when he bought every book, what it cost and the rate of currency exchange that day, sometimes noting where he was when he read it, and what he thought of it. Clear that his collection had to be ordered – he referred to unmapped collections as “dead” – Colón had a team working to distil the thousands of volumes into summaries, called the Libro de Epitomes, and created a blueprint of the library using 10,000 scraps of paper bearing hieroglyphic symbols. “Each of the myriad ways they could be put together suggested a different path through the library, just as a different set of search terms on the internet will bring up different information. In some respects, the Biblioteca Hernandina, as it was then called, was the world’s first search engine,” according to Wilson-Lee. Known today as the Biblioteca Colombina, only around a quarter of Colón’s books remain together, after being held since 1552 in Seville Cathedral. Colón, who was also the first biographer of Columbus and a mapmaker, left his library to his nephew – “a wastrel with no interest in books” in Wilson-Lee’s view – and the books ended up locked in the cathedral’s attic for centuries. There are stories of children in the 18th century bounding up to the attic to play with Colón’s beautiful collection and look at the pictures. The collection gradually dwindled down to fewer than 4,000 books, due to the long years of neglect, theft and the occasional flood. But even with most of the library gone, Colón’s story still has great resonance today, according to Wilson-Lee. “It’s … particularly poignant and important for now. We’re similarly navigating and having to make massive choices about how we organise information – like Hernando was doing in his library,” he said.

Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, and his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, said in a joint statement that talks early on Thursday on defining a government programme and setting priorities had been positive. They said significant progress on the cabinet’s composition and who would lead it had also been made “in view of constructive collaboration between the parties with the aim of deciding everything as quickly as possible in order to give a response and a government to the country”. Giancarlo Giorgetti, a politician with the League for more than 20 years who has been mooted as a potential prime minister, was also at the meeting, as was Vincenzo Spadafora, a deputy with M5S. Although Salvini and Di Maio are not entirely out of the running, others mentioned in the Italian media as potential prime ministers include Enrico Giovannini, a former chief statistician at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Giulia Bongiorno, a lawyer who made a name for herself after her defence of Giulio Andreotti, a former prime minister found guilty in 2002 of complicity in a mafia-linked hit against a journalist. Bongiorno also defended Raffaele Sollecito, who alongside the American Amanda Knox was cleared in 2015 of murdering the British student Meredith Kercher. Salvini, who has mostly campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, could potentially take the role of interior minister with Di Maio as foreign minister. The role of integration minister, scrapped by Matteo Renzi’s government in 2014, may also be re-established and filled by Toni Iwobi, a League politician who became Italy’s first black senator when he was elected in March. A meeting between the two parties’ technical representatives will be held later on Thursday, the statement said. The latest development breaks the nine-week stalemate that prevailed after inconclusive national elections in March, but was only made possible after the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party had teamed up with the League as part of a centre-right coalition that won the largest share of the vote, agreed to step aside late on Wednesday. Berlusconi, 81, had been the stumbling block in earlier negotiations between the League and M5S, with the four-time ex-prime minister seen as a potent symbol of the corruption they have campaigned against. The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, on Wednesday gave the two parties a 24-hour deadline after they unexpectedly sought more time to clinch an agreement amid the threat of a caretaker government. It is unclear when the two parties, which between them won more than 50% of the March vote, will announce their programme and cabinet lineup. They on Thursday asked Mattarella to give them until early next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/10/north-korea-release-prisoners-summit-kim-jong-un-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T10:47:25Z","webTitle":"North Korea’s release of US prisoners doesn’t mean peace | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/10/north-korea-release-prisoners-summit-kim-jong-un-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/10/north-korea-release-prisoners-summit-kim-jong-un-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"North Korea’s release of US prisoners doesn’t mean peace","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hold the jubilation today as President Trump boarded the plane at Andrews Air Force base near Washington DC to greet three hostages released by North Korea. As a full presidential welcome celebrates this gesture of peace, expectations of the upcoming Trump/Kim summit soar dangerously high. “A remarkable foreign policy moment for Donald Trump,” said the breathless BBC correspondent – as if hostages had never been strategically released before by Pyongyang. On the runway, asked if he hoped to go to North Korea himself, Trump said: “It could happen.” Indeed, anything could happen with this irrational, impulsive president. Here’s the high risk: he expects total capitulation, and anything less than the “comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation” being demanded of North Korea will see his mood turn to furious revenge. This first small gesture is a long way from the final goal. Will anything less than total victory satisfy the nervy vanity of the US leader? North Korea has reneged on agreements before, its leader as unpredictable and combustible as the US president. So far, closing one nuclear test site is the first concrete offer. But negotiating the next stage requires subtlety, dexterity, patience, caution and some understanding of the other side – not team Trump qualities. Surrounding him are arch non-compromisers, including hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, all of them over-investing in the outcome, at risk of over-reacting to anything less than surrender. More cynical observers suggest that provoking these wild expectations will give them an excuse for attack when the deal falls short. Trump has given a blood-curdling warning of what failure means: “If I can’t do it, it will be a very tough time for a lot of countries, and a lot of people.” Stand back and ask how realistic it is to expect a country that has acquired nuclear weapons to give them up altogether. North Korea has learned that nuclear weapons bring the mighty US president to negotiate on equal terms with a minnow, the poorest and weakest of countries. Look what happened to Muammar Gaddafi when he bartered away his nuclear capability. How perverse and provocative of Bolton to keep calling for a “Libya-style deal” when Kim knows how well that ended – with Gaddafi sodomised by bayonet and riddled with bullets. Countries that turn nuclear illegally – Pakistan, Israel – gain power and status. Is Kim really willing to give that up absolutely? Will Trump accept anything less? The answer to both questions looks like a no. Jeffrey Lewis, arms control expert, warns in Foreign Policy that Kim has never pledged to abandon what he calls his “powerful treasured sword”. While the North/South Korean agreement speaks hazily of some future denuclearisation of the peninsula, Trump demands a specific short timeline. Having visited South Korea a few months ago, I hear their pragmatism, feet planted firmly in the realm of the possible. Plenty of good could come from the negotiation, with Kim offering a moratorium on testing and on intercontinental-range ballistic missiles with a pledge not to use nuclear weapons. In a summit of reason, calm, and give-and-take, these are great prizes, signalling peaceful intent and normalisation of relations. But that won’t be enough for Trump and his hot-heads, so the higher they raise expectations, the more dangerous all this looks. Meanwhile, overnight, the first direct result of Trump’s sabotage of the Iran nuclear deal landed with an entirely predicable thud. The 20 Iranian missiles fired into the occupied Golan Heights received a heavy Israeli retaliation on Iranian bases in Syria. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel may go to war with Iran “sooner rather than later” to stop it attacking Israel, after urging Trump to end his support for the nuclear agreement with Iran. Trump unilaterally tearing up an international treaty is an act of war, near as damn it. The cringe-making sight of European leaders hugging, hand-holding and flattering the US president was all to no avail, as he treats his closest allies’ views with petulant contempt. Now he stands alone in the world, with only Israel and Saudi Arabia staunchly by his side, as his Iran sanctions fall on everyone else, with oil prices already soaring. As he fulfils all the world’s worst fears and expectations, don’t hold your breath for North Korea to be the peace victory that counterbalances wars caused by Trump elsewhere. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2018/may/11/premier-league-final-day-countdown-play-offs-and-more-friday-football-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:27:48Z","webTitle":"Premier League final day countdown and more: Friday football – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/may/11/premier-league-final-day-countdown-play-offs-and-more-friday-football-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/may/11/premier-league-final-day-countdown-play-offs-and-more-friday-football-live","fields":{"headline":"Premier League final day countdown and more: Friday football – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That will do for tonite tonight – here’s a reminder of the main courses we’ve tucked into on this final pre-Premier League Friday of the season: Arsenal have suspended two coaches, believed to be Steve Gatting and Carl Laraman, after allegations of bullying Manchester City have begun discussions over a new contract for Raheem Sterling Manchester United want to sign Ajax whizz kid Justin Kluivert Mauricio Pochettino is coy on the subject of his future at Tottenham Sam Allardyce admits he can’t guarantee Wayne Rooney game time at Everton And we have some other must-reads.

See you soon! “Fortnite (or more correctly Fortnight) is a shortening of ‘fourteen nights’ or two weeks,” writes John Barrow, and at this stage of the email I can’t tell if he is mocking me or, quite possibly, subtly agreeing with the absurdity of it all. But then he teaches me, and perhaps all of us, something new: “There is also an older word, rarely used ‘sennight’ for seven nights or a week.” The estimable Ben Lake answers that last, lingering Fortnite question of mine: “As I mentioned in my extended ramblings earlier the game originally started as a base building game. There’s the fort and I believe it may mostly have been set at night. Although that may not be true but it certainly has some night sections. Pun achieved.” We could talk about this for a FORTNIGHT. Here’s something nice for the commute home, or the gazing-intently-at-your-phone-til-your-friends-turn-up part of the evening, or for lunchtime or bedtime depending on where in the world you are. It’s Barney Ronay bidding a fond farewell to Yaya Toure – a player whose gifts were somehow undervalued: We’ve talked a bit about the play-offs today, but I should point you to Paul MacInnes’s big piece about Fulham v Derby – the first leg of which gets underway in two and three quarter hours: Can Harry Kane make a late play for the golden boot? David Hytner transports you to the realm of Tottenham v Leicester: Actually, no, I do have one more question: why is it called “Fortnite”? Am I missing a nuanced piece of wordplay? Here’s a link to Jamie’s story about Raheem Sterling’s possible new contract, which we splashed below: I owe you all a rather more enjoyable Friday song after the offering I put you through earlier today ... Talking of Brighton, here are a few lines from earlier today by Chris Hughton – what a wonderful season he’s had by the way – on the need to keep their best players as they look to push on next term. “That’s been the priority, certainly for the last two seasons, and we’ve had offers for some of our better players over that period of time and on each of those occasions our chairman and owner resisted them. And I think that will be the same in the summer, it is very much about keeping hold of your best players. “I’d like to think the club is in a healthy position at this moment and what means more is making sure we enable ourselves to have a decent Premier League season next season. To do that you want to keep hold of your best players, we’ve resisted that in the past and I’m very sure that we’ll work very, very hard to resist that again.” And Liverpool seek not to mess up against demob-happy Brighton – an encounter anticipated by Andy Hunter: Europa League contenders-elect Burnley will wrap up against their former manager, Eddie Howe, on Sunday. Here’s Paul Wilson’s preview: City begin Sterling contract talks Manchester City have held initial discussions with Raheem Sterling regarding a new contract, though the expectation is any agreement will not occur until after the World Cup. It is understood that a first meeting was held between the club and Sterling’s representatives at the end of last month. With the forward set to be named in Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad, talks may not resume before July. Sterling earns around £170,000 a week on a deal that has two years left. The forward is seeking to be one of the champions’ best-paid players and can expect a rise to his basic weekly salary of at least £50,000. City are intent on rewarding the 22-year-old for the most impressive season of his career in which Sterling has scored 22 goals and was a key factor in the title being claimed with five matches to spare. Pep Guardiola said: “The club, the chairman [Khaldoon al-Mubarak] and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract – but we are going on holiday in a few days.” Guardiola also expects Sergio Agüero to stay, though he could no be unequivocal. Asked whether the striker may leave the manager said: “I think it’s not going to happen. My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know … Sergio is going to stay until he decides his time is over.” Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden have each made four Premier League appearances so need to make a fifth in tomorrow’s final match at Southampton to get a winner’s medal. “I didn’t know it but, all respect, it looks ridiculous to me,” Guardiola said of the rule. “If they want my medal I will give them the medal. They are champions – they worked from day one to the last one, training with us, in the locker room.” Arsenal have suspended two coaches after allegations of bullying. They are believed to be Under-23 coach Steve Gatting and his assistant Carl Laraman. The story first broke in the Islington Gazette this afternoon. A club spokesman told the newspaper: “We have suspended two coaches and launched an investigation following complaints from some players. These are private matters and we will not discuss any further detail.” Now here is Mark Tallentire’s look ahead to the end of season procession ... OR IS IT? ... between Southampton and Manchester City: It’s 4.07pm in London and you know what that means: that means it’s time for the Fiver! I don’t doubt that media pressure plays some part. But wasn’t he talking about the club itself not really wishing to celebrate too? I thought he was describing a prevailing climate, almost. Life as a Manchester United fan isn’t all dull – they’ve got Watford at home on Sunday! Jamie Jackson hits you with the info: What I love about this job is that every day you learn things about yourself that you never knew. He has only just turned 22. It could well happen. But people start handwringing as soon as he has a quieter couple of months; it’s a ridiculous environment sometimes. Are Leicester boring? Not after trouncing 10-man Arsenal, says Claude Puel! “I am happy about this game (Arsenal) because our last game it was not us, too poor, too boring, without intensity and quality. Without normal starting players we showed quality in desire and on the pitch. This is a good feeling for the next game and for the next season. From the kick off we put on the pitch more desire, energy, togetherness, and after we put our play in place. It is easier to play forward and give a good feeling.” They have the chance to cut loose again on Sunday when they visit the apparently joy-free zone that is Spurs. Did you see the rumours linking Sergio Aguero with a return to Atletico Madrid (who seem to like luring their old star strikers back, don’t they?) this morning? Pep Guardiola has been speaking this afternoon – and, in this take from the wires, he says it’s – probably – not gonna happen: “I think it’s not going to happen,” said Guardiola. “My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know. “It’s happened many times in these press conferences and I said maybe a thousand times Sergio is going to stay until he decides ‘my time here is over’. I said it last season and this season many times, and I say it today. That’s why I say it isn’t going to happen, but in football you never know.” Those play-off nerves are jangling, aren’t they? It’s Derby v Fulham tonight in the Championship and both of those clubs have previous for not quite holding their nerve – albeit extremely recently in Fulham’s case. Villa and Boro face off tomorrow and this message from David Bertram captures the vibe: “As a Villa fan I’m looking forward to this weekend with trepidation and dread. Boro fans seem awfully confident.” *This* is what it is like to be a football fan! “I don’t think it’s been a great season,” says James Brown. Not that one. “This sounds strange as we’ve witnessed probably one of the most brutally dominant and tactically fluid teams in Premier League history, led by somebody who I think will come to be regarded as the best club manager in football history. Yet somehow this has ended up being a bit dull. Maybe we’ve got too used to the absurdly consistent brilliance of Messi, Ronaldo, Kane, Barca, Real etc, or maybe it’s the sheen of those teams and individuals that makes the stories at the other end of the table somehow more human and relatable: Moore at WBA, the story of Huddersfield, and Hodgson at Palace (who I think has done a quite incredible job). “The CL has brought the best out of our top teams rather than the league – to watch Spurs and Liverpool on occasions has been a real pleasure. As for my own team, Chelsea, it’s not been a surprise at all to see them struggle. Just frustrating they don’t seem to want to build on their success and instead seem to prefer to go through this continual up/down cycle.” Interesting bits from Pochettino to digest in there, no? What’s your gut feeling? I suspect he’ll be there next season but a few games are clearly afoot. I also thought his comments, three entries down, about nothing being good enough struck something of a chord. Is that how it is to support a Big Club now? I’m curious. Have people talked and worried themselves into such a lather on social media, in particular, that they simply can’t enjoy being a football fan anymore? It kind of feels like that sometimes. Pochettino also had the following exchange with the Sky Sports reporter. It’s worth nothing that it’s always the Tottenham manager’s style to rule nothing out in the future and to say that ‘anything can happen in football.’ But it still felt that there was a degree of posturing/ manoeuvring to it all …. Mauricio, are we guaranteed to see you here as the manager next season? What a question eh? It’s not my... you know, I still have three years on my contract. No point in talking about that. Only you know in football that everything can happen. No-one is sure in their job, but I have a three-year contract. Like I told the media in Spain after the game on Wednesday, they asked me about my contract and about what happened at some clubs, and I told them: ‘Look, I have a three-year contract and they need to agree with Daniel [Levy].’ So you will 99% be here next season? No, today it’s 100%. Next season? I don’t know, but today it is 100% because I have a three-year contract here. But tomorrow I don’t know what is going to happen. Klopp unimpressed at timing of awards events Jürgen Klopp wrote a superb letter in praise of Mohamed Salah and Rhian Brewster to the Football Writers Association for their Player of the Year awards ceremony on Thursday, but is unimpressed with the timing of both that event and Liverpool’s own awards dinner on the same night. Salah collected the players’ player of the season and first team player of the season awards at Anfield shortly after 7pm on Thursday then flew by private jet to London to receive the FWA prize at the Landmark Hotel. He travelled straight back to Merseyside and, according to Klopp, still got an early night. But the Liverpool manager questioned the timing of the awards (usually held before the end of the season and players disappear en masse for their holidays/internationals) when his team still need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure Champions League qualification for next season. “Mo deserved all the awards he got but I am absolutely not in the mood to praise anyone for the last few months,” said Klopp. “I am really in the mood to think about Sunday. Everything he did was fantastic, otherwise he couldn’t have scored that many goals, he couldn’t have played like he played, but it is all about Sunday. “It is quite difficult for a player because there are some many challenges constantly. The next challenge was the journalists. I know it was a very important award but to bring the boy on a Thursday night before the last game to London to celebrate a party - we are not partying. The journalists should come here and give the award. You want to be really focused. The season now for most of the teams in the league is a nice time but for us it is work. “All the awards around are really deserved but hopefully the last one was yesterday and now it is about playing the game on Sunday. We need to be completely focused on the game and we will be. Yesterday we had our LFC Awards – good timing. A lot of people wished me luck for the 26th and maybe two or three people said ‘good luck on Sunday’.” Mauricio Pochettino: “It’s strange that the feeling is not great” Mauricio Pochettino has had a moan about nothing being good enough for some Tottenham supporters and pundits. The manager has secured Champions League qualification for a third successive season – on a relative shoestring and after a season away from home at Wembley – but he wondered whether the club’s glass would ever be half-full. Pochettino noted how other clubs celebrate their achievements at end-of-season awards dinners but not Tottenham. His team made sure of a top-four finish on Wednesday night with a 1-0 Wembley win over Newcastle, courtesy of Harry Kane’s 50th minute goal. Yet remarkably they were booed off by some fans after a disappointing first-half. “In the last three years, we’ve achieved massive things, to play in the Champions League, and we never celebrate,” Pochettino said. “We never celebrate! At Southampton, we avoided relegation and finished eighth in the table and we had an unbelievable party. My wife was so unhappy, I remember, because I danced. Don’t worry, there’s no video. “But it’s true – that feeling that it’s never enough. We don’t have a players’ awards [night]. Clubs like Crystal Palace or Southampton, always there was a massive party at the end of the season. It’s a little bit strange that always the feeling is not great. “I remember we finished fifth in the first season and made the Europa League. It was better than in the previous season when we finished sixth, and it was: ‘Fifth is OK but it’s not enough.’ In the second season, we finished third but we lost the possibility to win the league against Chelsea with the draw at Stamford Bridge. Then we lost against Southampton and Newcastle, 5-1, and the feeling was so bad. “Last season, we finished second but it wasn’t enough because we didn’t win the league. And this season again, despite playing at Wembley and many things from the beginning, still there’s some [feeling] where it is: ‘Yes but no, the team needs to win some titles.’” Iceland have announced their World Cup squad! This is the final 23. If you don’t have six minutes to watch this, you can see the complete list of names (albeit first names, in the Icelandic tradition) right at the end. Gylfi Sigurdsson is passed fit enough, which is great news for them – and similarly Aron Gunnarsson. You can see people like Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Birkir Bjarnason in there too. Fascinatingly, young PSV winger Albert Gudmundsson, for whom there are high hopes, comes in. The sadness is that Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, who played up front at Euro 2016 and has been injured almost ever since, hasn’t rediscovered his fitness in time. Dominic Fifield has been busy – he’s also told you all you need to know about Palace v West Brom: Arca still had it last year – remember this? The goodbyes keep on coming! JR in Illinois is a West Brom fan, so of course he’s feeling glum at what has passed since August, but he shows us some slightly more complex working than that: “My view of the Premier League season has likely been clouded by Alan Pardew relegating my club but I’d say this season has been pretty stinky. Man City was great for a while but even they became kind of boring. Man United played atrocious football and they finished second! Liverpool and Tottenham played some great stuff but probably their best parts were in the Champions League. “Outside of City’s probable 100 point tally and Wenger leaving there’s not a whole lot to remember about this season. At least I’ll have a new competition to follow next season with the Baggies back down in the Championship.” Mark Hughes doesn’t want Southampton to hang around when deciding who their long-term (it’s all relative) boss will be. Will it be him? Or someone else? Here’s what he has said this afternoon: “I think it’s important for the club that they do that [make a quick decision], because clearly there’s work to be done immediately after the season, decisions have to be made in terms of recruitment and retention of the players. “So it would make sense to make a quick appointment, but I can’t shape that or dictate that, that’s a decision for the club.” Saints supporters – happy to see Hughes get a proper run at it? Or thanks for the firefighting act and farewell? I asked, a little earlier, if this had been an enjoyable Premier League season. Paul Fitzgerald has replied: “Yes but in a very prosaic way in that Man City were very nice to watch but their dominance removed any tension to proceedings. Its like when an F1 driver is laps ahead of anyone else and you have to source a duel somewhere back in the grid. You only cut back to the winner then when he crosses the chequered flag.” That’s true. My view is that it’s really not been a good season at all but that the symptoms, at least, go beyond the teams chasing City. Everything happening below, let’s say, seventh place just hasn’t been up to much at all. Throw it all up in the air next season and those spots could just as well come out in reverse – which ought to seem exciting but ... I ... don’t really know that it is. Thinking of Fortnite and therefore, as we have been encouraged to, of Jordan Hugill – I like him and he was great for a year or so in the Championship but have there been many more needless signings this season? Name them! News from Bayern Munich: Arjen Robben and Rafinha have signed one-year contract extensions at the club. We’ll be seeing the old wizard cutting inside and letting fly a few more times yet! Conte: other people will judge our position Antonio Conte believes Chelsea are stronger now than when he arrived at the club almost two years ago with the Italian insisting he has “created a base” through his stewardship. The FA Cup finalists travel to Newcastle on Sunday retaining only faint hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League, and with Conte expected to depart Stamford Bridge in the summer despite having a year left on his contract at the club. Yet, having inherited a team who had finished 10th after a turbulent season which had seen Jose Mourinho sacked and Guus Hiddink working as an interim, the head coach believes they are in a stronger position now than then. “For sure, we worked two years and worked very hard to try to build something, to create a base,” said Conte, who will confront Mourinho’s Manchester United side at Wembley in the Cup final later this month. “I think we did this. I’m the last person to judge the moment of the club. My task is to work, to do my job in the best possible way, and to work very hard with this team, with these players for the fans. Other people will judge our position.” Asked if it would be damaging for Chelsea to fail in securing a top four finish, he said: “I don’t know. I don’t know. You must know that there is this possibility, because you play in a strong league. For this reason, you have to know this and prepare in the right way. There are six top teams at the start of the season ready to fight for a place in the Champions League. It can happen. “In the past, it happened the same. Don’t forget two years ago, Chelsea ended the season 10th and not in the FA Cup final, not in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and they were eliminated in the last 16 against PSG in the Champions League. It can happen. “But last season after a 10th place we won the league. It was difficult. We worked very hard, but we won it. After a 10th place finish. Now, probably, you can finish fifth and start with a bit of an advantage compared to when you finish 10th.” Asked about the uncertainty which surrounds his own position at the club, he added: “I think I’ve been living with this speculation since the start of this season. I always said to you, my only thought is to do my job in the best possible way. To work very hard with my players. This is my only worry. Since the start of the first game, I think... I think the time I start listening to the speculation about me, this is the moment I start to be worried.” Ben Lake has sent me an exhaustive explanation of what Fortnite is and I now feel bad that he’s been pipped so succinctly by Jon Anderson’s pith. I’ve seen Battle Royale so I think I get the rough premise. “Schools have had to shut off their WiFi or had it strain to bursting by kids playing it on their phones,” Ben notes, while perhaps more pertinently noting that football clubs are trying to use it to get into esports and the streaming scene. They’ll jump aboard anything, won’t they! Wagner confirms the next stage of Wenger’s long-ish goodbye. Huddersfield is not a bad place for an Arsenal manager to bow out, in fairness: the clubs have a very nice bit of shared history, through the brilliance of Herbert Chapman, and there’s been a healthy relationship between them down the years. So there’s some degree of circularity. Rooney confirmation. Will we see him in the Premier League again? “Fortnite is a free, ‘child friendly’, Battle Royale game that includes elements of Minecraft (building) as well as shooting,” explains Jon Anderson, not before time! “Succinct enough?” I think I’ve heard enough, Jon, yes. Heartwarming to see club media channels bigging it up then ... Who’s the new Arsène Wenger? It’s Paul Tisdale – and Richard Foster explains why: Jurgen Klopp is giving his press conference as we speak – Andy Hunter is across that one, too, so there’ll be more when it comes ... Keep your emails coming in, by the way. It’s not pub time yet! Maybe you can answer this for me: has this been an enjoyable Premier League season? Interesting snippet and a great chance for Weaver, who is 41 and an emerging name, to become a hero! We’ll have more from Chelsea later but here’s a quick PA take on their spot of potential bother from Wednesday night: Chelsea are yet to respond to a Football Association charge after their players surrounded referee Lee Mason at half-time during Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield. The Blues were charged with failing to ensure their players “conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. A Chelsea spokesperson said there was no update relating to the charge during Antonio Conte’s press conference ahead of the last Premier League game of the season against Newcastle. The spokesperson said: “We’ve got until 6pm on May 15 to respond to that charge. There’s no further update.” Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is in contention for the trip to St James’ Park following a back injury. News from Hibs, where the players haven’t seen Neil Lennon since Wednesday’s Edinburgh derby defeat to hearts. Midfielder Marvin Bartley had to handle media duties just now and was asked about Lennon’s criticism of some of his players’ “amateur” approach: “We thought we had had a very good season for our first season back in the top flight, so for the gaffer to say that. But he’s his own man and has got his own thoughts. He obviously hadn’t shared that with us so we were as shocked as everyone else.” Here’s what you may have missed: Sam Allardyce won’t make Wayne Rooney any guarantees about playing time Manchester United want to sign Ajax’s Justin Kluivert Leon Britton and Dean Whitehead are added to the list of big weekend farewells Russia and Poland have named their preliminary World Cup squads Gael Clichy has spoken exclusively to us: And you need to look out for these things at the weekend: I’m grabbing some lunch now but I’ll be back within half an hour, so don’t go too far away! Leon Britton joins the list of farewells this weekend. He’ll retire after Swansea’s relegation is – we assume – confirmed and there’s a bit of sadness to that, particularly as a side completely lacking identity could surely have used him more. You don’t need to read between the lines to see he thinks that too. It must be exhausting, after a while, when you’re a lone beacon of sanity in a morass of dross: “I have decided that this year will be my last as a Swans player,” the 35-year-old told the club website. “It’s a sad day obviously, but this season has been very difficult for me. “I have had a lot of niggling injuries and I haven’t played a lot when I have been fit. I have pushed my body through a lot, playing with injuries and injections and what have you over the years, and I think now is the right time.” We understand Wayne Rooney left Everton’s training ground because he is, in fact, injured. Stand down! Richard Dennis writes in to say he likes the cut of that Poland squad’s jib: “I know, I know, it’s a trendy pick these days, but I do like the look of Poland for the World Cup, and to threaten the later stages, semis lets say. I think there’s real high level quality sprinkled in their team now. Together with their unity, identity, ethos, an astute coach, can score goals against anyone. All that, and a fairly favourable draw. So why not?” I like the coach – Adam Nawalka – too and like a lot of the team, although I still think there’s a lot of responsibility on Lewandowski to win them games. But some of the other names, like Zielinski and Milik (if he can get back up to full steam), are pretty exciting. They should get through the group stage, for sure, and after that who knows? Darren Moore has been reflecting on a “bizarre” season at West Brom. Their match at Crystal Palace means zilch now, although another win would do Moore’s own job prospects no harm. A few quotes, taken from the wires, here: “Yes it’s been a bizarre season really, absolutely bizarre. In pre-season, nobody could have foreseen what was to come but I said from the start when I came in, you can’t cry over spilt milk. “It was about looking forward to the future, focusing on the final six weeks and to try to get continuity, togetherness, unity and team spirit - all things which go in tandem with a team moving successfully forward. “We’ve had that from everybody at the football club. We’ve come together and it’s led to positive performances and the results then followed. That was the important thing. It’s probably seen as a disastrous season but I think we all agree that we’ve finished on a real positive in the last few games.” Nobody has responded yet to my Fortnite-related plea at the top of the show, and I really don’t want to have to watch this: Good to see Jordan Hugill, mind. On that last one – Andy points out that Allardyce had said Rooney should be fit to play. The plot thickens. Anyone got the flight schedule from Liverpool to Washington? A new twist in the Wayne Rooney tale? Andy Hunter tells us that he left the Everton training ground as his team-mates went out to train – we know Rooney has had injury issues recently so that might be all there is to it, but we’ll have more as soon as we get it ... Here’s some excellent lunchtime reading for you. The good man Will Unwin went to Istanbul and had a chinwag with none other than Gael Clichy. I’ll leave some small tasters below, followed by the interview itself. Do read it in full: On his final months at Manchester City: “Your career is behind you now,” Guardiola told Clichy bluntly. “But you have a duty, every day, every session, every behaviour you have; young players are looking up to you and even if you don’t feel like a special player, you’ve done so many years in England, you’ve won trophies, you are somebody and those young players will look up to you and behave like you are behaving.” On life at title-chasing Istanbul Baseksehir: “You have to be realistic – I am not the Gaël Clichy of 10 years ago and if I was, I wouldn’t be here, that is just a normal process; but I do believe I still have something to give the club and the team. When they signed me, they told me they wanted to win the league – it could be this year, it could be next year, it could be in two years. What we do know is that we have all the weapons to do it; we have great facilities, the chairman is giving everything, we have great players and we go step by step, that’s their philosophy.” On Arsène Wenger’s departure from Arsenal: “For 22 years, what this guy has done not just for Arsenal, but for English football, people should remember. I think they came to a moment where people just want to see someone else. It’s not a matter of if you win the Europa League, the league or this or that, if you bring a new player in, they just want someone new. If even they had won the Europa League they would have asked for someone new because that’s football.” Poland have named their preliminary World Cup squad! As the source of this tweet indicates, Ipswich’s Bartosz Bialkowski is in the initial 35, as are Swansea’s Lukasz Fabianski, Southampton’s Jan Bednarek, Hull’s Kamil Grosicki, West Brom loanee Grzegorz Krychowiak and many more familiar names besides. How do you rate them? Everton travel to West Ham on Sunday, which doesn’t quite smack of being an especially jolly encounter, does it? Will it be farewell to Rooney? Farewell to Big Sam? Farewell to Moyes? Will anyone present care all that much? Jacob Steinberg’s team news and match preview will whet the appetite, though: No Arsène Wenger press conference today. He did his final one yesterday – *sob* – and a few more quotes from that have come out on the wires. Some of it can be found in David Hytner’s write-up from last night. Talking about his most cherished Arsenal memory, Wenger said: “Maybe my first title here because I came completely unknown and in my first full year I won the championship. But I would say personally from 2006 to 2015 it was certainly the period where I needed to be the strongest and did the best job. “Because to accept to commit to five years when you build the stadium to work with restricted resources and keep the club in a position where we can pay our debts back, I personally feel I did my best job in that period. Not the most glamorous maybe, but the most difficult.” Here’s that full Andy Hunter take from Sam Allardyce – who will not guarantee Wayne Rooney game time should he (/they) stay at Everton: Middlesbrough play Aston Villa in the Championship play-offs tomorrow. But do you remember when they tonked Manchester City 8-1 – with Afonso Alves, Jeremie Aliadiere and Fabio Rochemback running amok? I’ve not been on the cheese: it actually happened, and it happened 10 years ago today: I guess the biggest point of interest will be the fitness concerns around Gylfi Sigurdsson and Aron Gunnarsson, although I fully expect both to make Heimir Hallgrimsson’s selection. Can Iceland do it all again? They kind of have, already, by qualifying at all. It’s not only farewell to Arsène Wenger at Huddersfield on Sunday. It’s farewell, too, to Terriers midfielder Dean Whitehead. He will retire at the grand old age of 36 and join David Wagner’s coaching staff – eventually taking over their Under-17 side from next January. Whitehead has only featured six times this season but I’ll remember him as having had an excellent career – I make it 619 senior appearances, and he was a particularly effective box-to-box midfielder at Stoke and Sunderland. I also remember watching him absolutely crack a 30-yarder into the top corner for Oxford United at some point in the early 2000s, maybe against Rochdale? “Dean is a winner. He demands 100 per cent effort from himself and everyone around him, he commands respect and is top quality in everything he does,” Wagner says. Yes, the problem Mike outlined is from one perspective a first-world one. But at the same time it does impact downwards on everything else. If you sign up for The Recap – which showcases the very best of our sport coverage – then the latest one will be in your inbox in ... oooh ... about 28 minutes. Hey, it was a genuine question about YouTube thumb ratios. A thought for the day from reader Mike Brooks: “As a Palace fan I have emotionally reconciled myself with the prospect of relegation several times this season. Almost half the league will have had a similar experience this year so I feel the time is ripe for the following allegory. Bare with me. The paralysing fear of ‘the drop’ has come to shape the way 10 or more Premier League clubs approach their 38 games in the sun (under a blue, blue Sky). Meanwhile, the Top 6 has become a ‘mini league’ which apparently captivates the world. “Surely, then, the top flight has become a microcosm of the capitalist system whereby the exploited proletariat are so preoccupied with outdoing those around them, so dazzled by the impossible dream of ascending the class hierarchy (Leicester’s title-win was probably staged to prop this system up for another generation), that they fail to prevent systematic inequality from growing exponentially and indefinitely. “After all, what can Palace hope for having stayed up? Most likely our path is that of Swansea and Stoke. A few unremarkable seasons, a bonk of the head on the glass ceiling, and a passive sinking back to the Championship. So rise in solidarity, relegation candidates! Divest from the relegation drama, staged by the elite to preoccupy us! West Brom, Stoke and Swansea did not die, and Palace did not survive, for we are all second-tier now. “ The middle paragraph says it pretty well, actually. Wouldn’t the world be simpler if we were completely done with this idea of “growth” to some utterly nebulous end? Meanwhile, the FA has just confirmed that Gareth Southgate will go all out and name his final 23 players for Russia 2018 on 16 May – which is next Wednesday if you aren’t too hot with numbers. As trailed earlier, Russia have named their preliminary World Cup squad. One surprise is that Denis Glushakov, the experienced and often influential Spartak midfielder, only makes the reserve list. Fyodor Chalov, who scored for CSKA Moscow against Arsenal a month ago, gets a chance to impress up top. It looks as if key defenders Georgi Dzhikiya and Viktor Vasin haven’t made it back from injury in time, which is a huge blow. Do you give the host nation much hope? That last entry brings me to ask: any Boreham Wood fans in the house? I’d like to know exactly how you’ve done it this season. And so would everyone else. Do write in! There’s a huge game at Wembley tomorrow. Tranmere, thwarted by Forest Green last year, are a match away from returning to the Football League – and in their way stand, quite improbably, Boreham Wood. It’s one of the smallest clubs in the National League against probably the biggest. There’s a nice story in Jewish News about how the local synagogue in Borehamwood* plans to mark promotion. *Not a typo, it’s a longstanding anomaly that the club is Boreham Wood and the place is Borehamwood. I’ve no doubt there’ll be someone tuning in who can explain it ... I will be saying “press conference” and not “presser” throughout today’s proceedings, incidentally, because the latter is an abomination. Newcastle, of course, host Chelsea on Sunday in a game that has Top Four Significance for the visitors. Chelsea must win and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton. I’m not sure the latter, in particular, is much of a goer. We have Louise Taylor reporting from Rafa Benitez’s press conference today, while Dominic Fifield will be at the media’s standard 1.15pm date with Antonio Conte. Yes, it’s an interesting one isn’t it? I love Mitrovic and it is worth remembering, through all the pros and cons, that he is still just 23 and has had a fairly remarkable career so far, goalscoring-wise. At Fulham he’s been helped by operating in an insanely creative side and perhaps he’s responded well so a compatriot, Jokanovic, being able to put an arm round him. He seems the type who needs that. I think he has a decent top-flight future, whoever that’s with ... It being Friday, and this blog being exceptionally Friday-ish, I find myself reminded of this charming little ditty about Friday from a few years back. Three million thumbs-downs vs 800,000 thumbs-ups! Is that a YouTube record? Seems an opportune moment to step away from the computer and grab a coffee. “With this weekend being the last of round of fixtures and narratives all over the place, I feel like its episode 38 of a long season,” emails Paul Fitzgerald. “Some characters I thought were killed off found themselves back, battling a race against time or The Championship. Some storylines never really developed (Watford), and the villain of the piece wasn’t actually defeated because, well he finished second. Don’t know if the spin off in the summer will be any better.” It’s an odd situation for everyone involved, really, because Rooney needs to play a bit of a guessing game about his own future at Goodison – if one assumes Allardyce’s own situation remains as clear as mud. Hard to tell who’s pulling the strings there but you wouldn’t expect Rooney to clear off without good reason having made such an emotional return last year. We’ll get Andy Hunter’s take to you as soon as we can but here, courtesy of PA, is Sam Allardyce’s view on the future of Wayne Rooney, as articulated just now. Not sure how much this really moves things along but there is clearly something in the MLS chatter: “My understanding is there seems to have been some negotiation along the line but as for clarity as to whether Wayne is staying or going we’ll see later on,” Allardyce said. “I don’t get involved in transfers but there seems to be an interest from DC United. Only when I speak to him today I’ll find out where the situation lies. I’m comfortable with any player who wants to leave but let’s get this clear, Wayne Rooney hasn’t asked to leave.” Yes, this League Two play-off is going to be huge. These two were actually playing top-flight football against one another in 1991-92 – now they battle for a place in the third tier and it could be the start of a long way back ... Potential bad news for Manchester United? Jose Mourinho has said that Romelu Lukaku might only be fit enough for a place on the bench when Manchester United face Chelsea in the FA Cup final next Saturday. Lukaku has missed United’s last two matches after suffering an ankle injury against Arsenal last month and he will be absent again when they host Watford in their final Premier League match tomorrow. The striker is recovering in Belgium and Mourinho will be desperate to have him available against Chelsea after seeing his team follow last week’s 1-0 defeat to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion with an unimpressive 0-0 draw with West Ham on Thursday night. “We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.” A very sad anniversary today, and one that it’s important we all take time to remember. And we are, lest any of us forget, in large part here to look ahead to Super Survival Showdown Sunday – so here are the things you should be salivating at. Throw some more my way! One big early bit of transfer news – or potential transfer news – to bring you. Jamie Jackson has word that Manchester United would like to sign Ajax’s bright young buck Justin Kluivert, who is of course the son of Patrick. Kluivert’s agent, you will read here, is one Mino Raiola – so I’ve no doubt this one will go off without a single glitch ... Lots of managers due to hold court in the next few hours. Sam Allardyce takes to the pulpit up at Finch Farm around about now, I believe – we have Andy Hunter up there, and there will doubtless be plenty of questions asked about Wayne Rooney’s future. And probably Big Sam’s own, too. It’s Friday – but not just any Friday. It’s the final Friday of the Premier League season and if you thought we’d be on the beach without a care in the world then ... well ... give it a few days. Up and down the country there are managers giving pre-match press conferences for the final time this season, making wry comments about not-having-to-see-you-lot-again-for-a-while and perhaps – given the lack of obvious dramatic tension around most of Sunday’s games – kicking back and offering us a few more reflective bits, too. And there’s much more going on. The play-offs are in full swing – did you see Jon Nolan’s brilliant winner for Shrewsbury at Charlton last night? – so there’s plenty to look ahead to on that front. Derby and Fulham face off tonight in the Championship. I think a couple of preliminary World Cup squads are being announced today too – Russia’s is due and Iceland, I’m told, will name their final 23. Stay tuned for those! We’ve got a few hours for all this so let’s also, you know, chat. What have you liked the most about this season? What haven’t you enjoyed? Could the relegation and top-four fights still produce an implausible twist or two? Can someone explain to me in a concise sentence what exactly Fortnite is? Does food really taste better when it’s eaten outdoors? Drop me a line on the email and Twitter addresses above.

Trump declared in late April that the investigation “MUST END NOW!” after congressional Republicans released a report saying they found no evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia. Andrea Mitchell of NBC asked Pence if he thought the investigation was a “hoax”, borrowing a term Trump has repeatedly used to describe Mueller’s inquiry. “What I think is that it’s been about a year since this investigation began, our administration provided over a million documents, we fully cooperated in it,” Pence said. “In the interests of the country, I think it’s time to wrap it up. And I would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.” The vice-president hired outside legal counsel in June 2017 to assist him in Mueller’s investigation. Mitchell also pressed Pence about the hundreds of thousands of dollars of payments from companies to Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen. She asked how that meshed with the administration’s goal, often repeated during the election campaign of “draining the swamp”, a reference to a perceived culture of favors and lobbyist influence in Washington. Pence, often seen at Trump’s side but seldom heard on the national or international stage, said it was a “private matter” and “something I don’t have any knowledge about.” In the nearly four-minute interview, as Pence celebrated the administration’s role in freeing three Americans from North Korean labor camps. The men landed at Andrews air force base at 2.42am and were greeted by Pence, his wife Karen, and Donald and Melania Trump.

The Swansea University International Dylan Thomas prize is awarded each year for the best literary work by an author aged 39 or under – the age the beloved Welsh poet was when he died. Chingonyi, who is 31, is the first British poet to win the genre-straddling award, which has gone in the past to Max Porter’s novel Grief Is the Thing With Feathers and Fiona McFarlane’s short-story collection The High Places. This year, Chingonyi saw off a shortlist including Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends and Gabriel Tallent’s My Absolute Darling. Kumukanda is a Luvale language word connoting initiation, referencing both the rites of passage which boys from the Lovale people of Zambia and Angola go through to become a man, as well as initiation rites for young Londoners. Chair of judges Dai Smith praised Chingonyi’s “original and distinctive voice”, calling Kumukanda “mature and moving”. “Unlike many other books by immigrant writers discussing memories of the homeland and the sensations of a new country, Kayo’s volume is not a lamentation for what he imagines has been lost, but it’s a new kind of celebration, albeit a vexed one, of the joys of living in a new country,” said professor and judge Kurt Heinzelman. “For me, the particular pleasure of this volume is that the particulars of his experience are so emotionally various and culturally diverse, and that the whole collection is even more beautiful than the sum of its parts.” Chingonyi, who was born in Zambia and moved to the UK aged six, writes in the poem Self-Portrait as a Garage Emcee of how, “In time, I could rattle off The Slim Shady LP line for line / though no amount of practice could conjure the pale skin / and blue eyes that made Marshall a poet and me / just another brother who could rhyme”. In Casting, he writes: “Three years RADA, two years rep and I’m sick / of playing lean dark men who may have guns. / I have a book of poems in my rucksack, / blank pad, two pens, tattered A-Z, headphones / that know Prokofiev as well as Prince Paul.” In his review for the Guardian, Ben Wilkinson called Kumukanda “an authentic and convincing book of poems in its many nuanced portrayals and unflinching reflections … As Valerie Mason-John once dryly observed: ‘Don’t categorise yourself as a black or ethnic poet. There’s no need to, the media will do that for you.’ Chingonyi goes one better, using his lyric panache to honour pop references and cultural experiences of personal and communal significance while also turning the tables, casting a wry and intelligent eye on our wider attitudes.” Actor Michael Sheen, who presented the prize to Chingonyi at a ceremony in Swansea on Thursday night, called Kumukanda “a stunning and hugely culturally relevant collection of poems that keenly explore black culture, masculinity and identity in Britain today”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/15/country-diary-pine-marten-cute-killer-aigas-highlands","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T04:30:47Z","webTitle":"Country diary: this cute creature is a cold killer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/15/country-diary-pine-marten-cute-killer-aigas-highlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/15/country-diary-pine-marten-cute-killer-aigas-highlands","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: this cute creature is a cold killer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For more than 90 minutes we’d sat until cold air quieted the wood and the day thinned into the long shadows of the trees. By 10.30pm we were centred in an arc of artificial lamp glow. There was just the sound of a last robin across the loch, its spindly song an analogue for the vanishing day. The silent theatricality of the moment was thus complete when the creature strolled into our vision without the merest hint of drama. Its step was sprightly, its acceptance of the lamp instantaneous. It brought a touch of night in its sharp black muzzle and in the big silent dark-stockinged feet – and every now and then it paused from eating to stare hard at its own route through the trees, reassuring itself of solitude – but otherwise we were all at ease with the mutual encounter. For 10 minutes there were no sounds but the crunch of nut and the click of camera. This is the cold killer widely accused of wiping out the chicken coop in one night. This is the sure-footed predator who can race through the canopy to snatch a squirrel in full flight from a topmost twig. This is the invader well able to steal shadow-like into an occupied house and den in the attic. Yet the things I noticed most were the dewdrops beaded on its luxuriant fur, the pinkness of the pointed tongue, the relish with which those carnassials ground up nuts. It could so easily have been someone’s pet. It snuffled under our gaze for each final morsel, it tricked along a birch beam to slurp at dribbles of honey. Its route back to ground was as careless and assured as the ascent, and there was one extraordinary moment when its hind claws clipped it to a branch and down it dangled as if in a harness of loose fur, as if it had momentarily forgotten those rear legs bound above its head, as if gravity were just another plaything. It extracted a last dewdrop of sweetness. Then without sound, without more ado, it vanished and we were alone with the silent thrill of a pine marten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/eight-years-after-it-finished-why-is-lost-being-reappraised","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T06:28:02Z","webTitle":"Eight years after it finished, why is Lost being reappraised?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/eight-years-after-it-finished-why-is-lost-being-reappraised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/eight-years-after-it-finished-why-is-lost-being-reappraised","fields":{"headline":"Eight years after it finished, why is Lost being reappraised?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eight years after one of the most divisive finales in television history, it feels like Lost is on the rise again. Listen hard enough and you’ll hear the sound of it being rediscovered. It’s bubbling up all over the place. New blogs and podcasts and Reddit discussions concerning themselves with various aspects of Lost have started to appear without warning. Gamers, too, seem to have suddenly rediscovered the series. This week alone, for instance, a Fortnite user found a hatch in the woods, prompting speculation of a Lost crossover, and a Far Cry 5 user recreated the Lost island in its entirety using the game’s map editor. Meanwhile, in entertainment, you can feel Lost’s influence everywhere. It’s in the knotty time structure of This Is Us. It’s in the spectacularly high concept of The Good Place, to the point that Mike Schur literally consulted Lost’s Damon Lindelof when he started to write it. It’s in the marketing push for Amazon’s The Crossing – billed as being “from the network that brought you Lost” – even though it is certainly no Lost. And if rumours are to be believed, Avengers 4 (a film all but guaranteed to be the most successful ever) is going to be heavily inspired by Lost’s fourth series. But why now? Why have I, an ardent Lost apologist since the word go, had to wait eight long and lonely years before the rest of the world caught up with me? “I took a long time to come around,” says Jack Shepherd, who co-hosts The Lost Boys podcast. The podcast’s gimmick is that Jack watches Lost for the first time, along with his die-hard fan Jacob, before discussing it. Jack dodged Lost for so long partly thanks to its weird reputation. “My older brother watched the first few seasons and gave up because he thought it quickly became awful. Most friends never made it through season five. The length of the show – 100 episodes plus – is also daunting, especially when I’ve been told there’s a lot of filler”. He has a point. Lost was never really interested in hanging around for viewers. If you missed a couple of episodes, the whole thing had a habit of making no sense whatsoever. Once, during the original run, I was discussing an episode with a friend – this was in the show’s loosey-goosey endgame, with various dimensions and donkey wheels and pendulums at play – and we had to stop because strangers were looking at us as if we were concussed. Jack’s co-host, Jacob Stolworthy, who has watched each episode seven times, argues that this lateral complexity is exactly why Lost has managed to maintain its cachet. “Those who liked Lost absolutely loved it and pored over its every detail,” he says. “They still go on about it as fondly today.” “People fucking love this show,” adds Jack. “We get emails from long-time fans telling us that Lostpedia [the Lost wiki] is wrong, sending us scripts from the initial pilot to correct a minute point in our podcast. It’s crazy”. It’s also worth mentioning The Leftovers, Damon Lindelof’s Lost follow-up. Although not as highly watched as Lost – it was too bleak and weird for mainstream appeal – The Leftovers managed to win over an army of frothing devotees. It felt like a Lost concentrate, a similarly high-concept programme that didn’t feel the need to pander to a network television audience with 22-episode runs or episodes about tattoo origins. Better yet, it stuck the landing. The finale of The Leftovers is a genuinely breathtaking, emotionally satisfying piece of work that fed back into the original premise in a way that Lost couldn’t. After watching The Leftovers go out on such a soaring high point, and after just 28 episodes, of course you’d go back and give Lost a second chance. It doesn’t seem coincidental that this new rush of Lost interest has only surged now that The Leftovers is over. Both Jack and Jacob agree that we’ll never see the likes of Lost again. But that’s fine. We can live with Lost because it is everywhere now. Whenever we see Redditors sweat out elaborate Westworld theories, it’s because of Lost. Whenever we see deep-dive online recaps, it’s because of Lost. Shorter, more compressed series? That’s because of Lost. Whenever there’s a flashback, or a flashforward, or a terrible Britpop band named after a mechanical component, it’s because of Lost. Lost will never die. Finally, the believers have been vindicated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/may/11/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27501","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T10:57:27Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,501","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/may/11/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27501","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/may/11/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27501","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,501","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"* to mark the 200th anniversary of Karl Mark’s birth Across 7 earldom (m)ELODRAM(a) (anag) 8 nannies double def 9 thug T  UG 10 buddleias BUD + LADIES (anag) 12 horde HORDE(rn) [Michael Hordern; Royal Navy] 13 amaretto trainspOTTER AMAzes 9hidden rev) 15 inch INC(luding)/H(eel) 16 à deux AD(1)EU/X 17 clef CLEF(t) 18 nut roast TURNS TO A (anag) 20 greed G(rand)/REED 21 land yacht L(arge)/ANDY/ACHT [8 in German] 22 ikat (p)I(n)K + (t)A(t)T(y) 24 unravel (cl)U(es)/N(orthern)/RAVEL [Maurice Ravel] 25 in-depth IN  EPT/H(usband) Down 1 wash W(omen)/ASH 2 oligarch LOG CHAIR (anag) 3 rouble (t)ROUBLE 4 Karl Marx (K/l)LAR(k/L) + marks (hom) 5 endive (m)EN/DIVES 6 reds (ac)ER (rev) + DS [detective sergeant] 11 dialectic DIAL/EC/TIC [Junker is European Commission president] 12 Hindu HIND + ewe (hom) 14 trend T(odd)/REND 16 analyser AL in YEARNS (anag) 17 clerihew WE/HIRE/L(50)/C(uba) (rev) 19 rental RE  AL 20 gitano givinG IT ANOther (hidden) 21 lend LE  D 23 ante (h)A(s)N(‘t) T(h)E(n)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2018/oct/05/dr-death-the-gruesome-series-that-became-an-unlikely-hit-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-05T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Dr Death: the gruesome series that became an unlikely hit –  podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/05/dr-death-the-gruesome-series-that-became-an-unlikely-hit-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/oct/05/dr-death-the-gruesome-series-that-became-an-unlikely-hit-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Dr Death: the gruesome series that became an unlikely hit –  podcasts of the week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Talking points Another week, another podcast getting a TV remake: this time around it’s Dr Death, the smash hit series from Wondery about a two-year-long spree of medical malpractice committed by US spinal surgeon Christopher Duntsch, to which Universal Cable Productions – makers of Mr Robot and The Sinner – have snapped up the rights. Given the gruesomeness of the subject matter, the adaptation might make for challenging viewing, though that has hardly hindered the original podcast, which has been downloaded more than 8m times since launching last month, according to Hot Pod. Universal are also remaking another popular Wondery effort – the true crime series Dirty John – starring Connie Britton and Eric Bana. GM Picks of the week Heavyweight Jonathan Goldstein’s touching and surprising podcast about life-changing decisions and regrets returns for a very welcome third series. If you haven’t already listened, start with the story of Gregor, a man who lent some old CDs to Moby, which he sampled on Play (and didn’t return). This season begins with Goldstein challenging his movie star friend Rob Corddry about whether he did really break his arm when he was a child. It’s full of warmth and a style that’s part Louis Theroux and part This American Life. HV The Ratline Philippe Sands presents a finely rendered 10-part documentary, with Stephen Fry and Laura Linney reading the letters of Otto von Wächter and his wife, Charlotte. Otto, a senior Nazi responsible for mass murder in Poland, escaped justice and fled to Rome. What befell him there is the meat of an investigation that, in order to illuminate a dark corner of postwar Europe, gives its protagonist such detailed attention it nearly feels like sympathy. The result is an unpredictable curio. JS Guardian pick: Can Brexit ever happen? The Guardian’s Brexit Means ... podcast is back after a break with European correspondent Jon Henley at the helm. Yes, we know you’ve been missing it, and in this month’s show Jon recaps on all that has (and hasn’t) happened to move us closer to a deal. Can the government’s plan for Brexit happen? How can the issue of the Irish border be resolved and what will happen with the customs union? In a week when Theresa May was dancing around the issues at the Conservative party conference, this is required listening for anyone interested in the debates surrounding all these key issues. Joining Jon in this episode is professor of EU law Catherine Barnard, the Guardian’s Jennifer Rankin and Jonathan Lis from the British Influence thinktank. Your Picks The Cinemile Presenters (and married couple) Dave and Cathy walk to and from the cinema, recording their thoughts about films in The Cinemile. They don’t always agree, which gives the pod the pleasing flavour of debating a film you’ve just seen with your mates in the pub.

The housing, communities and local government committee has invited submissions to an inquiry that will consider what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “Our high streets and town centres have an important social, civic and cultural place in our society. But, many of our high streets are now struggling, facing a range of challenges including the threat posed by online retailers. “Changing trends and behaviours in recent decades – driven by a range of economic, demographic, social and technological factors – have affected the prosperity and vibrancy of our high streets.” Recent high street casualties include Maplin and Toys R Us, while retailers ranging from House of Fraser and Mothercare to New Look and Carpetright have all announced plans to close shops and cut jobs. Many restaurant chains are also facing problems, with the Prezzo group, Byron and Jamie’s Italian all closing branches. The Cau steakhouse chain, it has emerged, could also be shut down. Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Debenhams who used to run B&amp;Q, warned on Wednesday that onerous leases in UK town centres are “killing more and more retailers”. He told ITV News that the decline of the high street would accelerate unless the government reformed the tax system and landlords showed greater flexibility. Cheshire said the current system, with business rates based on property values and many retailers still wrestling with landlord agreements that include upwards-only rent reviews, gave online-only retailers like Amazon an unfair advantage. “What you’re seeing is retail facing more change in the past three years than in the previous 20 ... It’s a big structural shift which is basically saying old models have to be reinvented,” he said. “If you’re starting out now you’d have much less space, much more online and much more flexibility. No one will now be signing 20-year leases.” Debenhams is closing eight of its 165 UK stores and is in talks with its landlords about reducing space at 30 more. As well as examining the challenges facing high streets and town centres, the MPs’ inquiry will consider whether councils have the correct planning, licensing, tax-raising and other tools needed to help local areas. It is not the first time the problems facing UK high streets have been the subject of investigation. In 2011 David Cameron asked the retail guru Mary Portas to come up with a plan to save traditional high streets, then under threat from out-of-town shopping centres and supermarkets moving into non-food sectors. Now, however, supermarkets and out-of-town shopping centres are also feeling the squeeze as a result of a huge change in shopping habits. Nearly £60bn was spent via smartphones and tablets in 2017 – a figure that equates to more than £1 in every £6 spent on the high street. While the shift is benefitting online-only retailers such as Amazon and Asos, it is forcing radical change on the country’s towns and cities as huge swaths of physical retail space becomes redundant. The committee said it welcomes the views of the public on why their high street matters and what improvements could be made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/the-fiver-huddersfield-premier-league-survival-special","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:58:15Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Huddersfield and a night of diligent rehydration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/the-fiver-huddersfield-premier-league-survival-special","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/the-fiver-huddersfield-premier-league-survival-special","fields":{"headline":"Huddersfield and a night of diligent rehydration","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"WAGNER LOVE In years to come, somebody will write a cracking book about David Wagner’s Huddersfield. It won’t be The Fiver, because by then we’ll be in the retirement community, rocking back and forth and boasting about how we once had a face-to-face interview with Les Reed. But somebody will do it, because in the last two years they have produced one of the more charming stories in English football history. The book will include a great chapter on 9 May 2018. Sod the actual football, though their 1-1 draw at Chelsea was bursting with an infectious, demented heroism. The really good bit will be the story of what happened afterwards. Huddersfield abandoned plans to fly back north and spent the night drinking expensive bottles of Liver Compromiser. “You never know who you will find partying at Chinawhite,” boasts the website for the famous London nightspot. “Recent attendees have included the likes of: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Moss, Tom Cruise, Cara Delevingne, Rihanna, Drake, One Direction, Kendall Jenner, Idris Elba, Ciara, Lewis Hamilton, Naomi Campbell, Jordan Dunn, Rita Ora, Usain Bolt, Gigi Hadid, Laurent Depoitre, Jonathan Hogg and Mathias Jørgensen, aka Zanka.” After a night of diligent rehydration, the Huddersfield players got the train back up north on Thursday morning looking an absolute state. There’s a strong whiff of Old Football about Huddersfield, and that’s high praise where The Fiver comes from. Their manager David Wagner – whose reaction to avoiding relegation was to give the players a free pass for 48 hours – has shown what can be achieved without ridiculous money, ego, entitlement or a razor; we’ll forgive him and his team their comically brazen time-wasting. Wagner, the players and the fans are involved in a virtuous love triangle that The Fiver would find genuinely moving were we not clinically dead inside. Mind, if Huddersfield aren’t careful they’ll receive English football’s new kiss of death: the phrase “Model Club”. It used to apply to Southampton and Swansea, one of whom will be relegated on Sunday. It will almost certainly be Swansea, and it has now emerged that Carlos Carvalhal will be quietly bundled out the door marked ‘Do One’ at the end of the season. Chris Coleman, a specialist in getting teams out of the Championship, is the early favourite, although we quite like the odds of 5,000-1 on our stereotypical cousin, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver, getting the job. He’s Welsh, you know. In years to come, somebody will also write a cracking book on Swansea City in the 2010s. For the most part it’ll be a rollocking, feelgood yarn.

Created in partnership with the French ministry of gender equality, the hotline is one of several measures introduced by the festival as it looks to reform itself in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Cannes plans to release detailed information about the volume of calls received once the festival is over, but did confirm that several were being taken daily. The majority of calls made to the hotline do not concern participants at the festival, the representative said. Three temporary employees have been hired to staff the hotline, which operates from 9am to 2pm every day through the duration of the festival. The operators were recruited based on their ability to speak multiple languages, be good listeners and show empathy. Depending on the caller, the operator will offer advice or contact relevant professionals, including festival security staff, medical workers, local police and the victim support charity Solidarité Femmes. Cannes says it plans to keep the hotline open at future editions of the festival. “The most important things for us is that potential victims know that they can call us,” a representative said. Its introduction follows similar steps made at the industry event CinemaCon and at Sundance, where it prompted local police to open an investigation into an incident that allegedly took place at the film festival in the 1990s. The measures are indicative of an industry that is having to grapple with a culture of sexual harassment and assault in the wake of allegations against a number of prominent figures, including Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and James Toback, and the subsequent rise of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. Cannes, in particular, is in the spotlight due to Weinstein’s close ties with the event. Several of the claims made against the producer regard incidents said to have taken place at the festival, notably Asia Argento’s allegation of rape, which she says occurred at the nearby Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in 1997. Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than 70 women and is the subject of investigations in the US and the UK. The producer denies all allegations of non-consensual sex made against him. In response to the allegations, Cannes has sought to project an anti-harassment stance at this year’s event. In addition to the hotline, the festival has been including flyers in the gift bags handed out to attendees, styled in the manner of an invitation to a black tie party and emblazoned with the slogan “correct behaviour required” as well as the hashtag #NeRienLaisserPasser, or “Do not let anything go”. They warn that sexual harassment is punishable with a maximum three-year prison sentence and a €45,000 (£39,600) fine. Other organisations based on the Croisette over the next fortnight are following the festival’s lead. Attendees at the American Pavilion (AmPav), the glitzy hub for the US film industry at Cannes, are being asked to sign a waiver disavowing harassment upon entering. Organisers pointed to the high number of students who work at AmPav, as well as the female-friendly reputation of the pavilion, which was founded by executive Julie Sisk 30 years ago, as reasons for the waiver’s introduction. On Monday, the French gender equality minister, Marlène Schiappa, praised the measures introduced by Cannes and urged the wider film industry to use the festival as an opportunity to “liberate and listen to women’s voices”. “The fact that the festival’s presidents decided to fight with us against sexual harassment for not just actresses but also workers and spectators at the festival is unprecedented and a great step forward,” Schiappa told Reuters. Cannes’ move comes as wider French culture begins to reckon with issues of sexual misconduct. Last October, in the wake of allegations against Weinstein and the rise of the #MeToo movement, women in France began sharing their own stories of harassment and assault on social media, accompanied with the hashtag #BalanceTonPorc, or “squeal on your pig”. That informal development was soon followed by a formal one, with the French government announcing in March plans to issue on-the-spot fines for public acts of sexual harassment, a move that the president, Emmanuel Macron, hoped would ensure “women are not afraid to be outside”. Yet the move to combat harassment has not received universal support from French women. In January, a group of 100 female writers, performers and academics that included Catherine Deneuve and author Catherine Millet co-signed a letter denouncing the “puritanism” of the anti-harassment movement, which, it said, was seeing men “forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone’s knee or try to steal a kiss”. Cannes is also seeking to increase the visibility of women at this year’s festival. On Saturday, 100 women will walk the festival’s red carpet in order to “affirm their presence”, festival director Thierry Frémaux said. Frémaux will also announce specific measures to improve gender representation at the festival in an event on Monday organised with representatives of the Time’s Up movement. There has been repeated criticism about a lack of gender parity at Cannes, which this year features only three films directed by women in its 21-film official selection lineup. However, the festival does this year feature a women-majority jury, headed by the Australian actor Cate Blanchett. The Cannes film festival runs until 19 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/17/best-public-transport-in-hong-kong-double-decker-ferries-to-funiculars","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:41:21Z","webTitle":"The best public transport in Hong Kong: from double-decker ferries to funiculars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/17/best-public-transport-in-hong-kong-double-decker-ferries-to-funiculars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/17/best-public-transport-in-hong-kong-double-decker-ferries-to-funiculars","fields":{"headline":"The best public transport in Hong Kong: from double-decker ferries to funiculars","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In Hong Kong, there’s always a luxe way to get around. You could go all-out by chartering a superyacht, or hopping on a helicopter tour of the harbour. But some of the best rides in town are true bargains that show off the city’s hidden corners and famous sights. Grab an Octopus card – that’s the local version of London’s Oyster card – and embark on a series of unforgettable public transport journeys across Hong Kong. Star power The ride: The Star Ferry How much? From HK$2.20 (20p) Hong Kong was built around its harbour, which was both deep enough to allow large ships to moor, and sheltered enough to protect them from the typhoons that savage the region in the wetter months. There’s no better way to see this geographic godsend than the double-decker Star Ferry. Since 1888 the ferries have plied the harbour, offering extraordinary views of the city’s frankly implausible skyline. It takes just eight minutes and costs as little as 20p but it’s a vital piece of the city’s life: more than 50,000 Hongkongers still use them every day to cross between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula. You’ll want to make the trip at least twice: once on the marginally more expensive upper deck, with its air-conditioned section and expansive views, and once on the lower deck with the regular folk, where the smell of diesel is everywhere and the hum of the engine thrums through your bones. All aboard: Central Ferry Pier No 7, Central Peak travel The ride: The Peak Tram How much? HK$52 (£4.80) On Hong Kong Island, altitude is wealth. The higher you live, the better off you are. So it stands to reason that the city’s wealthiest inhabitants live in mansions on Victoria Peak, the island’s highest point. In the past, it was home to the British colonists – Chinese were actually banned from living there until 1947 – who took advantage of the cooler climes and stunning views. Back then, the only lazy way up the mountain was to summon a sedan chair. But that changed in 1888, with the opening of the Peak Tram funicular. Nowadays, those who live on the Peak mostly drive – or are driven – into town, and the Peak Tram has become more of a tourist attraction than a daily form of transportation. But quite rightly so: the tram ascends 368 metres (1,200ft) in seven minutes, hitting a maximum gradient of 27 degrees. The tram runs through dense vegetation, at times bursting out of the canopy to reveal stunning views of the city, which seems to fall away below you. And that’s before you even reach the top, where the city’s very finest views await. All aboard: Peak Tram Lower Terminus, 33 Garden Road, Central Ding when you’re winning The ride: Hong Kong Tramways How much? HK$2.30 (21p) Hong Kong’s trams are nicknamed “ding dings” after the distinctive double-bell ring that heralds their arrival. The world’s only exclusively double-decker tram system trundles at its own leisurely pace along the entire length of Hong Kong island. Board a tram at its terminus at Kennedy Town, headed to Shau Kei Wan at the other end of the line. This journey of about an hour and a half is the perfect way to get a sense of the city, soundtracked by the slow groaning of the tracks and that ubiquitous “ding ding”. Districts slide past the open windows, from the pungent dried seafood stalls of Sai Ying Pun to the towering offices of Admiralty and the humble homes of North Point. It’s worth remembering as you glide past markets, skyscrapers and low-rises that the tram tracks were actually laid along the waterfront: the 500-metre (1,640ft) or so strip of land from the tram to the current coastline has all been reclaimed from the sea. At the end of the line, Shau Kei Wan is one of the island’s sleepier, lesser-seen districts. Just next to the tram terminus is a bustling open-air produce market, and nearby On Lee Noodle (22 Shau Kei Wan Main St East, Shau Kei Wan) might just serve up the best bowl of fishball noodles in the city. All aboard: Kennedy Town Tram Terminus, Catchick Street, Kennedy Town Beach bus The ride: Number 6 bus to Stanley village How much? HK$7.90 (72p) What’s so impressive about a double-decker bus? In Hong Kong, an awful lot. For the number 6 bus will take you from urban confusion in the heart of Central to stunning sea and sand in about 20 minutes. Grab a seat right at the front on the upper deck, and watch the city shift from concrete to green in front of you. As you crest the ridge that runs along the island, Hong Kong’s southside is revealed: a lush, forested area that feels completely removed from the city. The road winds down the hillside, and branches smack into the sides of the bus as you seem to teeter over the edge of road. Every now and then you’re treated to a glimpse of the sparkling water and pale sand of Repulse Bay beach. If you weren’t planning on swimming, then stay on board for another 20 minutes to Stanley village, the seaside town with its busy clothing market and strip of open-air eateries. All aboard: Exchange Square Bus Terminus, Central"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/10/bill-shortens-budget-promises-from-higher-education-spending-to-a-tax-cut-contest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T10:40:10Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten's budget promises: from higher education spending to a tax cut contest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/bill-shortens-budget-promises-from-higher-education-spending-to-a-tax-cut-contest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/bill-shortens-budget-promises-from-higher-education-spending-to-a-tax-cut-contest","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten's budget promises: from higher education spending to a tax cut contest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1. Scrap upfront fees for 100,000 Tafe students Bill Shorten has announced a plan to scrap upfront fees for 100,000 Tafe students at a cost of $380m over five years in his budget reply speech on Thursday. Shorten said despite many trades facing skills shortages and high unemployment in some areas, workers “can’t learn the skills that industries are crying out for”. “Tafe is the best place for young Australians to develop these skills in the communities that need them,” he said. “Labor’s policy to scrap upfront fees will make it easier for Australians to gain the skills they need to get a trade, a traineeship and a quality job – and make it easier for businesses to fill skills shortages.” Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry education and training director Jenny Lambert welcomed the announcement but asked for detail on how it would be implemented in tertiary education systems administered by the states. 2. Uncap university places by ending funding freeze Shorten confirmed that Labor would restore funding to universities and aim to increase graduates by 200,000 over 12 years, a claim Labor based on modelling by the Mitchell Institute. In December the Coalition cut $2.2bn from universities, predominantly through a two-year freeze in commonwealth grants funding for teaching and learning. Universities Australia estimated the measure would leave 9,500 university places unfunded in 2018. Shorten said: “I am pleased to announce Labor will restore funding certainty to our universities. We will uncap places providing our nation with more than 200,000 university graduates.” 3. Improve income tax cuts by ‘almost double’ Shorten said that Labor would support the government’s proposed tax cut this year but in its first budget would “deliver a bigger and better tax cut for 10 million working Australians”. At a cost of $5.8bn over four years, it would support the 2018-19 tax plan and commence the planned tax refund from 2019-20 so that more than 4 million working Australians would be better off by $398 a year compared to the Liberals. “In our first term of government, a teacher on $65,000 will be $2780 better off under Labor – an extra $928 a year,” Shorten said. “A married couple – one partner in the ADF earning $90,000 and the other working in aged care on $50,000 – will be $5,565 better off under Labor, $1,855 a year.” 4. More funding for public hospitals The budget in reply revealed Labor would spend an extra $2.8bn in funding for public hospitals from 2019-25. “We’ll put more beds in emergency departments and on the wards so we can reduce the wait for people sitting in emergency rooms worrying about a child or a loved one who’s hurt or unwell,” Shorten said. 5. 500,000 more MRI scans funded by Medicare Shorten said Labor would invest $80m to boost the number of eligible MRI machines and approve 20 new licences – meaning 500,000 more scans funded by Medicare over four years. “A Shorten Labor government will ensure more communities have affordable access to life-saving scans, expanding Medicare-subsidised access to diagnostic imaging in areas where there are shortages,” he said. 6. $25m to tackle corporate crime Shorten committed to give $25m to establish a corporate crime taskforce, to equip the commonwealth public prosecutor to respond to recommendations for criminal prosecution that stem from the financial services royal commission. Shorten said the Coalition was cutting money from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which he branded “a disgrace” and “immoral”. “The government tried talking tough on this but wagging your finger in the bank’s face means little when you’re giving them a tax cut with your other hand,” he said. “Upping a penalty also does nothing if corporate criminals with deep pockets and big legal teams know they can outspend the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/10/detroit-lions-matt-patricia-sexual-assault-allegations-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T19:23:22Z","webTitle":"Lions coach Patricia says resurfacing of sexual assault charge is 'unfair and upsetting'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/detroit-lions-matt-patricia-sexual-assault-allegations-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/10/detroit-lions-matt-patricia-sexual-assault-allegations-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Lions coach Patricia says resurfacing of sexual assault charge is 'unfair and upsetting'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Detroit Lions have put their full support behind their new head coach, Matt Patricia, but admitted they had failed to uncover a sexual assault allegation against him when researching his background. The charge stemmed from an allegation against Patricia when he was in college in 1996. It never went to court after the alleged victim said she could not face “the pressures or stress of a trial”. The Lions were unaware of the case until they were contacted by the Detroit News on Wednesday. The team said they had failed to find out the information because their background check only looked at criminal convictions. However, Deadspin pointed out that it only took them 30 seconds to find out about the charge by typing Patricia’s name into public records database Nexis. At a press conference on Thursday, Patricia appeared to suggest the Detroit News’s reporting of the case was a personal attack. “I find it unfair and upsetting that someone would bring this claim up over two decades later for the sole purpose of hurting my family, my friends and this organization with the intention of trying to damage my character and credibility,” he said. The 43-year-old added “I was innocent then, and I am innocent now.” Patricia would not comments on whether he had had sex with the alleged victim and did not clarify whether he had told the Lions, or his previous team the New England Patriots, about the case during interviews. “As far as the interview process is concerned,” Patricia said, “there was ... nothing that I did not answer.” The Patriots later said that they had not been aware of the charge but New England head coach Bill Belichick said Patricia is “known to be an outstanding coach, person and family man”. A joint statement from Lions owner Martha Ford, general manager Bob Quinn and team president Rod Wood said the case “was dismissed by the prosecutor at the request of the complaining individual prior to trial. As a result, Coach Patricia never had the opportunity to present his case or clear his name publicly in a court of law. He has denied that there was any factual basis for the charge. There was no settlement agreement with the complaining individual, no money exchanged hands and there was no confidentiality agreement. In discussions today with Lions management, the [Detroit News] reporter involved acknowledged that the allegations have not been substantiated.” Wood told the Detroit News that he remained happy with his decision to employ Patricia. “I will tell you with 1,000% certainty that everything I’ve learned confirmed what I already knew about the man and would have no way changed our decision to make him our head coach,” he said. The Lions job is Patricia’s first as a head coach. He made his name at the Patriots, where he was defensive coordinator for five years. The Patriots won two Super Bowls during his time as defensive coordinator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/12/everton-sam-allardyce-jeers-both-sides-west-ham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T21:30:41Z","webTitle":"Everton’s Sam Allardyce braced for boos from both sides at West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/12/everton-sam-allardyce-jeers-both-sides-west-ham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/12/everton-sam-allardyce-jeers-both-sides-west-ham","fields":{"headline":"Everton’s Sam Allardyce braced for boos from both sides at West Ham","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"These are difficult times for Sam Allardyce, who is not only aware of the speculation that suggests he may be preparing an Everton side for the last time but readying his tough exterior for the possibility that he might be jeered by both sets of supporters at the London Stadium on Sunday, writes Paul Wilson.

If people want better results and more attractive football then we are going to have to get better players. “I think we are improving, there were games in my early days here when we sometimes only had one shot on target at home, but when you come into a club you have to work with the players that are available.

The 87-year old French-Swiss director, best known for films such as Pierrot le Fou and Week End, was widely expected to skip the scheduled press conference, held for his latest video essay The Image Book, after having missed the Cannes red carpet premiere for the film the day before. Yet shortly before the start of the press conference it was announced that Godard would be appearing after all, albeit on an iPhone held up by his cinematographer Fabrice Aragno. “It’s a bit like machine gun fire,” he quipped as journalists stepped up to a microphone to ask him questions. It is not the first time that Godard has taken an idiosyncratic approach to press duties. At a Cannes press conference for his 2005 film Notre Musique the director invited a representative from the French actors and technicians’ union to speak in his stead. Godard sat silently while the representative listed detailed complaints against the French government. Godard is considered a major figure at Cannes, despite having an antagonistic relationship with the festival. The director played a major role in the cancellation of the 1968 edition of the festival, which he proposed in solidarity with the protests taking place across France at the time. His exalted status at Cannes is evidenced by the poster for this year’s festival, which features an image from Pierrot le Fou. A mediation on the nature of images and the West’s relationship with the Arab world, The Image Book is a fragmentary series of images taken from a variety of sources, including 1950s and 60s cinema and Isis recruitment videos. The film has been received warmly by critics, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw praising its “unexpected urgency and visceral strangeness”. Among the topics touched on by Godard during his unorthodox press conference were Russia, which he suggested “we have to be kind” to, and his fears for the future of cinema. “In the next 10 years, we think in a very few movie theatres, which are quite avant-garde, they will screen my films and films in general,” he said. The film-maker was more optimistic about the future of his own career however. “Absolutely,” he said when asked whether he was planning on making another film. “It doesn’t depend on me. It depends on my legs, it depends a lot on my hands, and it depends a little bit on my eyes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/13/charles-dickens-science-museum-medical-knowledge","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Revealed: the surprising scientific passion of Charles Dickens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/13/charles-dickens-science-museum-medical-knowledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/13/charles-dickens-science-museum-medical-knowledge","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: the surprising scientific passion of Charles Dickens","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In the opening paragraph of his novel Bleak House, Charles Dickens envisages meeting “a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill”. It is a startling image, one that depicts Victorian London as a place of mud, corruption and disease. Prehistoric concerns and scientific interests are not normally connected with this author, who is known best for his depictions of social injustice, eccentric characters and occasional bouts of sentimentality. Indeed, Dickens is generally thought today to have been suspicious of science. But experts believe this reputation in undeserved, and argue that Dickens used scientific imagery throughout his writing. He also believed passionately in the use of science to improve child health, sanitation and human understanding. These themes will be outlined in an exhibition, Charles Dickens: Man of Science, opening this month at the Charles Dickens Museum, at his former home on Doughty Street in London. “For 150 years, it has been thought that Dickens was uninterested in or actually hostile to science,” said Frankie Kubicki, a curator at the museum. “That is a misunderstanding, and a travesty. He was one of the most influential scientific communicators of the Victorian age.” Among the exhibits in the forthcoming exhibition will be the travelling bag that Dickens took on foreign trips. These included a visit to Vesuvius from which he returned “burnt from head to foot”, he later wrote. Also on show will be facsimile notes of Michael Faraday’s public lectures at the Royal Institution, which Dickens subsequently edited and published in his weekly magazine Household Words. His aim with the magazine was to provide a blend of fiction, social campaigning and the science – as described by Faraday in his lectures – behind such everyday matters as making tea, fermenting beer and burning candles. The exhibition will also include a recreation of Pepper’s Ghost, a display of optical illusions created by chemist John Pepper. This used angled glass to create transparent ghostly figures, including some from Dickens’s novella The Haunted Man. By showing how easy it was to deceive the senses, Dickens and Pepper wanted to help reveal the fraudulent claims of spiritualists, who used this kind of equipment at seances at the time. For his part, Dickens was much admired by several scientists, and his associates included the palaeontologist Richard Owen, the mathematician Ada Lovelace (who on her deathbed asked Dickens to read to her from Dombey and Son) and Florence Nightingale, who prescribed his novels to wounded soldiers as a form of “treatment-by-reading”. However, the most intriguing display at the exhibition will be that of a small wax figure of Joe, the “fat boy” from The Pickwick Papers. These wax figures were the 19th-century equivalent of the models of the heroes and villains from Star Wars or Harry Potter films – though they have since earned a special scientific significance that his latter-day equivalents lack, according to the exhibition’s curators. Scientists writing in the American Journal of Medicine in 1956 said the “fat boy” character – who is constantly hungry and prone to falling asleep at every opportunity – defines a particular medical syndrome. Severely overweight individuals can be prone to breathlessness and daytime sleepiness, and the condition has since been given the name Pickwickian Syndrome. Perhaps the most telling example of Dickens’ scientific writing and his interest in social concerns is found in The Uncommercial Traveller, a collection of sketches and reminiscences. In one of these, the author speculates about the inferences scientists make about extinct creatures from the remains they have left behind – and what future generations would deduce about his society. In particular, he speculated whether or not they would be able to use ancient remains to sense “the existence of the polished state of society that bore with the public savagery of neglected children in the streets and never used its power to seize and save them”. The remark underlines Dickens’s belief that, above all, science should serve society, and explains his commitment to the use of medical knowledge to improve lives. For example, the depictions of sick and dying children in his novels helped change attitudes to childhood disease, and led to his campaigning for the building of the world’s first children’s hospital – a few blocks away from his Doughty Street home – at Great Ormond Street.

The 20-year-old scored his third hundred in 10 first-class matches to turn day one against Yorkshire on its head following a sticky start on an unusually green-tinged pitch. At 69 for four and 162 for six either side of lunch Surrey were struggling after Joe Root’s decision to let the toss go uncontested and bowl first - Root is captaining Yorkshire this weekend following illness to Gary Ballance. A score of 200 was in doubt against a team full of confidence having beaten champions Essex last weekend despite posting 50 in the first innings. But Pope, a calm head on young shoulders, guided Surrey to 366 for seven. Having come in at six, the diminutive former England under-19s right-hander battled hard with his fifth-wicket partner, Dean Elgar, (61) to share 68 before Rikki Clarke dominated a key 129-run stand for the seventh wicket either side of tea, taking the score to 291 for seven. It was only once the belligerent Clarke, who passed 10,000 first-class runs, departed for 71 to Jack Brooks with the second new ball that Pope (131) kicked on, showing the flamboyance which has also made him useful against the white ball. Maybe he will take to 100-ball cricket? That is, of course, as long as it goes ahead. Speaking at tea on BBC Rradio, Surrey’s chief executive, Richard Gould, admitted there is plenty of confusion surrounding the ECB’s plans for the new competition. Asked whether he thought it would go ahead in 2020, he said: “I don’t know.” Earlier Mark Stoneman was lbw to Tim Bresnan for 10, Rory Burns was caught at first slip off Brooks - his 400th first-class victim - for nine and Ben Foakes caught behind off Steve Patterson for 18. The Division One leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 133 by Lancashire at Trent Bridge, including two wickets for Jimmy Anderson, before the visitors responded with 157 for four. Haseeb Hameed posted a duck. The champions, Essex, having suffered their first Championship defeat in 19 against Yorkshire, are struggling again, away to Worcestershire. They were b owled out for 177 – Alastair Cook hit 37 – before the hosts responded with 47 for no loss. At Taunton rain meant only 58.1 overs were possible between Hampshire and Somerset, with the visitors 198 for eight. James Vince hit a flighty 44 and Tom Abell took three wickets. In Division Two Eoin Morgan’s 76 for Middlesex (356 for six) against Gloucestershire at Lord’s represented his first Championship fifty since September 2014. Dawid Malan matched him. Fourteen wickets fell on a helter-skelter opening day between the leaders, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The teenage seamer Henry Brookes was shaping to be the headline act for Warwickshire with four wickets, including three in an opening spell that had the visitors 52 for six and 118 for seven by lunch. But Steven Crook (92) and Doug Bracewell (81) changed the complexion as a stand of 122 pushed them up to 256. They also shared three wickets in Warwickshire’s reply of 100 for four. Ian Bell is 55 unbeaten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/eric-schneiderman-jian-ghomeshi-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"From Ghomeshi to Schneiderman: how men who say they're feminists can fool us","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/eric-schneiderman-jian-ghomeshi-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/eric-schneiderman-jian-ghomeshi-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde","fields":{"headline":"From Ghomeshi to Schneiderman: how men who say they're feminists can fool us","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The women’s stories of abuse mirror one another so closely you can almost hear the echo. “All of a sudden, he just slapped me.” “He began to choke me.” “He asked if I like it rough. I was so shocked.” “He pulled my hair so hard my neck flew backward, and when it did he smacked me.” In the first two quotes, “he” is Eric Schneiderman, the celebrated New York attorney general who resigned last Monday after the New Yorker published reports of brutal and repeated physical assaults, including that he hit and choked four women over a period of years. In the second two, it’s Jian Ghomeshi, the former celebrity broadcaster whose career shattered in 2014 in the wake of nearly a dozen allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, from hitting and punching to whipping with a belt, and remained in pieces despite a 2016 acquittal of criminal charges. Both men deny the allegations. A hallmark of the #MeToo movement isn’t how diverse the stories of abuse, harassment and assault have been. It’s how repetitive. Yet nowhere are the parallels more striking than in these two cases: the Schneiderman allegations are uncannily familiar to those of us who followed the Ghomeshi trial closely in Canada. Above all, these are stories of men whose reputations as feminist progressives cast a kind of smokescreen not just over society, but also over the very women who have claimed abuse. The question isn’t just about who would believe the women. It’s about whether the women – faced with men of such golden reputations – could believe themselves. Schneiderman, after all, was the former New York state senator who sponsored the Strangulation Prevention Act (which could, ironically, aid his downfall). As attorney general, he was a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement and a critic of Harvey Weinstein. Ghomeshi, for his part, put his star power behind the White Ribbon campaign, an organization of men and boys fighting violence against women, and pitched Q, his hugely popular CBC radio show, as a harbour of inclusiveness. Their cultural currency at the time of the accusations couldn’t be higher. “All of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly on to my ear,” Michelle Manning Barish told the New Yorker about Schneiderman. She said he choked her and hit her repeatedly so hard she developed recurring ear problems. Tanya Selvaratnam said he “slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her,” the magazine reported. She added that eventually, “we could rarely have sex without him beating me”. As I read this, I heard the voice of Lucy DeCoutere in 2014. “He did take me by the throat and press me against the wall and choke me, and he did slap me across the face a couple of times,” the actor told NPR, after the Toronto Star first reported allegations against Ghomeshi. The newspaper described another woman’s story: “She says he demanded that she kneel, then hit her repeatedly about the head while she stared up in shock.” Some of Shneiderman’s accusers described confusion: between the man they thought he was, and the man who was treating them this way. They justified his behaviour, or convinced themselves there was nothing wrong – or that they were wrong – just as Kathryn Borel, who said Ghomeshi sexually assaulted her at work at the CBC, convinced herself that his behaviour wasn’t criminal. “The relentless message to me, from my celebrity boss and the national institution we worked for, were that his whims were more important than my humanity or my dignity,” Borel wrote. “So I came to accept this.” Similarly, when an unnamed ex-girlfriend in the New Yorker story told her friends of Schneiderman’s abuse, “a number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.” Even the language of defense feels parroted. Schneiderman responded to the allegations by claiming consent. “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,” he wrote, in what could have been modeled on Ghomeshi’s 2014 statement: “I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.” In the New Yorker, Selvaratnam called Schneiderman a “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” character. During Ghomeshi’s trial, one witness told the court that “he went from being really nice, to this rage, and dark”; writer Anne Kingston later described it as “the Mr Hyde we never saw”. What happened at the Ghomeshi trial could teach us a lot about what might be in the future for Schneiderman. The women’s statements to media and police came back to haunt them, as the defense team scrutinized every small, changing detail. His subsequent acquittal plunged the country into a kind of moral chaos. Was the criminal justice system broken? Was the crown attorney inept? Were the women simply liars? Could you make an allegation publicly and still survive a trial? One woman told me on the courthouse steps that she’d lost her faith in the courts. Canada has yet to see another high-profile sexual assault trial to reverse that despair. That could be a lesson for New York: not to place all your hopes for sexual assault justice into a single trial, and not to conflate the work of journalists who check stories with the requirements of courtroom testimony. It can, of course, go another way. Bill Cosby’s trial – where multiple women were allowed to testify, and an expert witness explained the conflicting and sometimes irrational behaviours of victims – has given women hope. Perhaps the Schneiderman allegations will follow that path. The thornier question, however, will remain: why exactly it is that men who robe themselves with feminism find it so easy to fool the rest of us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/united-airlines-tomato-juice-planes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"Why do we drink so much tomato juice on planes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/united-airlines-tomato-juice-planes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/12/united-airlines-tomato-juice-planes","fields":{"headline":"Why do we drink so much tomato juice on planes?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"United Airlines know a thing or two about weaselly management-speak. Last year when a passenger was forcibly removed by police from an overbooked flight, bleeding and screaming, their spokesman initially called it as an “involuntary de-boarding situation”. CEO Oscar Munoz doubled down, referring to the removal as “re-accommodating the customers”. This week the airline announced they were “streamlining” their onboard menu items on flights under four hours – their way of saying customers would be getting less food and fewer options. Muffins would replace hot breakfasts, wraps would replace full lunches, and tomato juice as a beverage option would be phased out. Customers were quick to express their outrage, and today United U-turned on the tomato decision. So why is the beverage – which is not particularly popular under normal circumstances in America – drunk so much on planes? There have been a number of scientific investigations trying to answer that question. In 2015, Robin Dando, a physiologist at Cornell, found that exposure to loud noises, like that of a jet engine, dulls sweet flavours but intensifies the umami taste present in tomato juice. Five years earlier, German airline Lufthansa commissioned research into the popularity of tomato juice when they realised they were serving 53,000 gallons a year. Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society found people enjoyed it more on planes because our taste and smell receptors are less sensitive at altitude, which means people enjoy the freshness of the juice without the earthy, mulchy taste. Those research-based accounts seem somewhat contradictory, though: can the taste of the drink be both enhanced and dulled? Even if they can, do ordinary passengers know that before they order the drink? It’s more likely there is a psychological basis for the popularity. Choosing a drink on a flight is an unusual situation: you have to decide when the trolley comes to you whether you’re thirsty or not. The beverage is normally free – meaning you want to extract as much value as possible. Tomato juice hits an odd sweet spot: it’s the only drink on the trolly that feels healthy, extravagant and unusual – plus you’ve seen so many other people order it, it becomes a tradition, the same way you eat popcorn at the cinema or hotdogs at a baseball game. There might be another reason too, which goes back to United “streamlining” the food options. With less free food available on flights, many people are hungry when the drink cart comes around but don’t want to pay for a meal. Tomato juice has a lots of fibre and high water content, and makes you feel full even when you’re not. It’s basically a cold soup; you could even call it a free meal. So congratulations to United for realising their huge screw-up and reinstating it. Or, as a United spokesman put it, in the company’s inimitable style: “With all of our food offerings, we monitor customer feedback and what they would prefer and adjust accordingly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/breaking-bad-to-the-paradise-papers-all-you-need-to-know-about-money-laundering","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T04:39:57Z","webTitle":"Breaking Bad to the Paradise Papers: all you need to know about money laundering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/breaking-bad-to-the-paradise-papers-all-you-need-to-know-about-money-laundering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/breaking-bad-to-the-paradise-papers-all-you-need-to-know-about-money-laundering","fields":{"headline":"Breaking Bad to the Paradise Papers: all you need to know about money laundering","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What is money laundering? In British law, money laundering is defined as the process of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property. It is an offence to launder your own ill-gotten gains, but you can also be prosecuted for knowingly helping manage another person’s dirty money. An offence only occurs if the cash can be identified as the proceeds of a crime; for example corruption, bribery, theft, drug dealing or even tax evasion. In practice, laundering usually involves injecting cash gained through these kinds of activities into the legitimate financial system, in a way which disguises its origins, so that the money appears to come from a clean source. In the UK, the offence carries a maximum prison term of 13 years. The main legislation governing money laundering is the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The longest sentences are reserved for complex schemes, which involve abuse of trust and power, pressuring others into helping, and a long and close relationship between the money handler and the criminal. Why is money laundered? It is difficult to spend dark money without first hiding where it came from. A criminal may suddenly find themselves with large amounts of cash. Too much to keep under the mattress. Enough to arouse the suspicion of the bank manager when it is deposited. Paying for houses, cars, holidays and school fees with stacks of £50 notes is difficult to do without attracting the attention of the taxman. Spending and safeguarding the money can be as complicated as acquiring it. The predicament is explained in the television series Breaking Bad, when corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman tries to persuade a drug dealer to hide the source of his earnings by investing in a nail salon. “I’ve got three little letters for you: I-R-S,” Goodman warns. “If they can get Capone, they can get you.” Crime boss Al Capone’s control of the Chicago underworld was famously brought to an end not by the police, but by an 11-year sentence for tax evasion. Gangster finance is something of a side issue. The cases that in recent years have made money laundering an international issue more typically involve helping the rich and powerful salt away gains from activities that are clearly illegal, but for which they are unlikely to be prosecuted at home. Recent examples include the looting of Angola’s sovereign wealth fund, the sale of valuable mining concessions in the Democratic Republic of Congo in exchange for bribes paid to its president, the government-sanctioned theft of state assets by Russian oligarchs or, in what has become known as the Magnitsky case, the acquisition of wealth by public officials through a complex tax fraud. How can criminal funds be concealed? With the advent of universal banking, and therefore traceable money, gangsters began to look for ways to disguise their earnings. Traditionally, this was done through businesses where tax inspectors might struggle to determine the number of customers, or the quantity and value of what was sold. Businesses like restaurants, nightclubs, bakeries – or nail salons. Revenues from crime would be injected alongside genuine income from painting nails. They were then banked, taxed, and legitimised. These methods belong increasingly to the analogue era. Since the 1980s, digital money has allowed the laundering business to move offshore, and the amount of being moved has ballooned into the hundreds of billions. An estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime puts the annual sum at between 2 and 5% of global GDP, so between $800bn and $2tn. As the agency says, even the lower number underlines the seriousness of the problem governments are facing. Meanwhile, the trickle of money into tax havens which began in the last century has become a flood. The total now held in offshore banks is estimated at 10% of global GDP and rising. Britain alone launders £90bn each year, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). The figure includes the proceeds of almost all serious and organised crime committed in the UK, but also a significant amount of the corruptly obtained assets of politicians and public officials from overseas. This loot finds its way mainly into the housing market. Companies incorporated in the UK’s network of tax havens own 57,000 properties in Britain. Of these, 16,000 are in just two London boroughs: Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, according to research by Global Witness. This is high-end money laundering, and it is a thriving British industry staffed by a network of what the NCA describes as “professional enablers”, who in exchange for a fee will turn a blind eye to how the cash was obtained and who really owns it. The key actors here are lawyers, bankers, accountants and a loosely regulated but vital part of the chain – fiduciary service providers. The now-defunct Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca provided fiduciary services. It was licensed by tax havens to incorporate offshore companies and its employees acted as nominee directors and shareholders, lending their signature to the paperwork and bank accounts of companies over which they had no real control and in this way hiding the real owners. A typical offshore laundering scheme involves layers of anonymously held shell companies and unregistered trusts. Trusts are particularly controversial, because their existence is usually not recorded by any government. The money flows out of the country where it was acquired – say China – into a bank account controlled by a Jersey trust, for example, which in turn might control a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. That company may then be used to purchase real estate in a safe, law-abiding city like London. Hedge funds and other collective investment schemes, many of which are also managed using offshore structures, are another favoured route. Offshore companies can be used to collect deposits from bribes or frauds and those deposits are then moved into legitimate investment schemes with a minimum of questions asked. Profits from the scheme emerge clean and can safely make their way into the ordinary retail banking system. Why has money laundering become a talking point? For years reporters and prosecutors working to trace unpaid taxes, oligarch fortunes and financial frauds have only been able to follow the money so far. The roadblock created by offshore secrecy has limited understanding of what happens in, say, the British Virgin Islands or the Isle of Man. Thanks to a series of massive data leaks from tax havens, the lid has been lifted. The files of HSBC’s Swiss bank, the Panama Papers and most recently the Paradise Papers have exposed in great factual detail the offshore machinations of the world’s wealthiest individuals and corporations. What is the government doing to prevent financial crime? The latest round of efforts to stem the flow of dark money into Britain began some years ago, during David Cameron’s premiership. He made it a central theme of Britain’s presidency of the G8 group of wealthy nations. Leaders attending the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland were persuaded to sign declarations promising to make company ownership more transparent. Cameron held up his end of the bargain. All those owning more than 25% of a company registered in England and Wales must now give their name and basic details including a contact address. But he did not extend this transparency to trusts – in fact he lobbied against it in Europe. And he left office before the same reforms could be introduced where they were most needed: Britain’s network of offshore tax havens. The baton was picked up by the campaigning Labour MP Margaret Hodge. She formed a cross-party alliance with the help of the Liberal Democrats and the former conservative minister Andrew Mitchell. On 1 May, 20 Conservative MPs stood ready to defy the government and ministers capitulated. Hodge’s amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill means that if Britain’s 14 overseas territories do not introduce public registers of company owners by December 2020, they will be ordered to do so by the crown. If passed undiluted, the reforms will lead to the unmasking of the owners of hundreds of thousands of screen companies within less than two years. The reform has been condemned as a colonial throwback by the overseas territories and it will be fiercely resisted, particularly by the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Other havens have close relationships with certain industries to sustain them after transparency comes. Bermuda is an insurance hub; the Caymans Islands are a nexus for hedge funds. Most of the UK havens service between 10,000 and 30,000 offshore companies. By comparison, the BVI is an incorporation factory – it was responsible for supervising 390,000 active entities at the end of 2017. BVI Premier Orlando Smith has stopped short of calling for independence from Britain, but he has said the move “calls into question our very relationship with the UK”. Cameron set the ball rolling on other important reforms. In January, legislation known as unexplained wealth orders came into force. The laws are designed to help prosecutors seize the UK assets of individuals who are suspected of corruption but are unlikely to be taken to court in their country of origin. America now looks weak on transparency - states including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada allow beneficial ownership to remain hidden. The US does tolerate these onshore havens, but its federal agencies have aggressively pursued Swiss and British banks. Since 2010, any bank wishing to do business with America (most banks need to deal in dollars) must disclose all US account holders to the Internal Revenue Service, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Unfortunately, the flow of information is one way because the US has not agreed to share information on foreign nationals holding accounts in America. What next? Government has promised to introduce transparency to the Land Registry by 2021. Any overseas company that purchases UK property should by then be required to declare its owners publicly. Campaigners are concerned about the three-year delay, and believe the measures should come into effect immediately. They would also like transparency to be extended to trusts, with government registers recording who their beneficiaries are and what assets they control. Reforms are still needed in the three crown dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. They have more freedom to set their own rules and can in theory choose whether to introduce public registers of the beneficial owners of offshore companies. Hodge and Mitchell believe they can be persuaded, and are planning a tour of the islands. “What we plan to do now is to go to the Isle of Man for talks there and then possibly to Guernsey and Jersey,” says Mitchell. “The intention is that we will try and persuade them of the wisdom of copying what Britain and the Overseas Territories have done and what most of Europe is going to do.” The latest anti money laundering legislation from Europe provides for public registers of company owners in all member states by 2019. If the crown dependencies resist, they will be outliers. “All territories associated with Britain ought to be governed to the same standards and with the same transparency,” says Hodge. “The purpose of this measure is to tackle all dirty money entering through any British territories. You can’t leave a few out.” Further reading The BBC television series McMafia was adapted from a book of the same name written by the former Guardian and BBC journalist Misha Glenny.

The precise nature of the complaint is unclear but the club have confirmed they have placed them on leave and launched an investigation. Gatting and Laraman were not in the dugout for Tuesday’s Premier League International Cup final against Porto at the Emirates, which was the first public sign that something was amiss. The under-18 coach, Kwame Ampadu, stepped up to take the team and he oversaw a 1-0 defeat. An Arsenal spokesman said: “We have suspended two coaches and launched an investigation following complaints from some players. These are private matters and we will not discuss any further detail.” Arsenal have made great strides at academy level – they won the PL2 title this season – and they did well to reach the final of the International Cup, having been one of 12 English teams to enter alongside a dozen others from mainland Europe. Ivan Gazidis referenced the club’s progress at youth level on the day that Arsène Wenger’s end-of-season departure was confirmed and he said that the manager’s replacement had to be committed to giving young players a chance. “Under the radar, we’ve got a lot of players coming through – not just ones that you already know about but the next generation, as well,” the chief executive said. “That value of giving youth a chance is very important.” Gazidis has overseen a raft of changes at the club, including at youth level, where Per Mertesacker, the soon-to-be-retired defender, will step up at the end of the season to become the academy head, replacing Andries Jonker, who departed in February of last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T07:08:32Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden: the liberal everyman spoiling for a fight with Trump as 2020 looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden: the liberal everyman spoiling for a fight with Trump as 2020 looms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Among recent pilgrims to the Arizona ranch of Senator John McCain was Joe Biden. The Republican, who has an aggressive form of brain cancer, urged the former vice-president to “not walk away” from politics, Biden told the New York Times. It did not take much imagination to see this as a metaphorical shove – into the next race for the White House. Biden has the desire, the pedigree – and the rage. On Friday, incensed by reports that a White House aide had dismissed McCain with the terse comment “he’s dying anyway”, the 75-year-old Democrat let rip, declaring that decency in the administration had finally hit “rock bottom”. It was just the latest evidence that Biden is spoiling for a fight with Donald Trump. Whereas Barack Obama has maintained a zen-like calm even as his legacy is eviscerated, Biden has taken the gloves off, hammering the president’s policies and personal conduct, even suggesting that he would like to “beat the hell out of” Trump over his crude remarks about women. But in 2020 he would be up against the most competitive and crowded Democratic field in many years. The point will be brought home on Tuesday, when the Center for American Progress in Washington hosts potential contenders including senators Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Chris Murphy, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as the former housing secretary Julián Castro and New York mayor Bill de Blasio. Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: “There are three lanes to look at. In lane one, there is ‘Bernie-lite’, which could be Bernie himself. In lane two, there are people who think, for a variety of reasons, that’s not the right way for the Democratic party to go and we ought to be 21st-century reformers. “Lane three is the Biden lane. He’s really sui generis. If people are looking for a unifier and don’t want to shed internecine blood, the argument for Biden could be potent. On the other hand, he has always underperformed as a presidential candidate in the past.” Biden made unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1988 and 2008. He did not run in 2016 after the death of his son Beau. But he has repeatedly not ruled out a shot at 2020. He published a book, Promise Me, Dad, and has been travelling the country, a tour extended beyond its original schedule. This week, at an event organised by his own foundation and the Brookings Institution, he expressed indignation at the plight of the middle class, offered a preview of a nascent manifesto and frequently veered off script for dramatic effect. “I love Bernie but I’m not Bernie Sanders,” he said. “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble … We have not seen this huge concentration of wealth. The folks at the top aren’t bad guys. I get in trouble in my party when I say wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks. I’ve found no distinction, I really haven’t.” But then, in what some might find a contradiction, he went on: “This gap is yawning. It’s gaping and it’s having the effect of pulling us apart. You see the politics of it. And the country’s not going to stand for it forever so we have to deal with the tax code. It’s wildly skewed toward taking care of those at the very top. It overwhelmingly favours investors over workers and it’s riddled with unproductive expenditures.” The paradoxical comments illustrated Biden’s dilemma – or opportunity. On the one hand, he is a centrist and having spent 36 years as a senator and eight years as vice-president can hardly be described as an outsider. On the other, he has faced criticism over links to the financial services industry, a major presence in his home state, Delaware. A New York Times report three years ago noted that Biden supported a bill in 2005 that would have made it more difficult for consumers to seek bankruptcy protection. Obama voted against it. Executives and employees of the credit card issuer MBNA contributed roughly $200,000 to Biden campaigns from 1989 to 2010, the paper said. Warren was among those who called him out on it. Still, as Democrats tack left on issues such as healthcare, Biden may seek to tap into the economic populism that propelled Sanders to run Hillary Clinton close in 2016. Many pundits have speculated that straight-talking Biden would have done better than Clinton at appealing to blue-collar voters and neutralising Trump in the ultimately decisive states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In his speech at Brookings, there was a glimpse of how Biden might attempt to play both sides. “If you listen to Barack, you’d think I climbed out of a coalmine with a lunch bucket from Scranton in my hand,” he said of his Pennsylvania origins, prompting laughter. “It’s not true.” His father was “a white-collar worker, a salesperson”, he said, who moved the family in search of greener pastures. Biden portrayed himself as an everyman. He said his own three children each graduated from university with six-figure debts despite working 30 hours a week and financial support from their parents. He distanced himself from political action committees and the curse of money in politics. “You may remember,” he said, “that when I filed my financial disclosure as vice-president the front page of the Washington Post said it’s probable no man has ever assumed the office of vice-president with fewer assets than Joe Biden. “My net worth was between $50-150,000. When I left [public office] after 44 years it was still between $50,000-150,000 because I said I’d never own a stock or bond for fear of conflict, I would never engage in a business enterprise, even those that were legal and appropriate, and I would never accept an honorarium. So I got the dubious distinction but I also had absolute independence my whole career.” His policies offer a blend of pragmatism and progressivism. He proposed fixing the tax code so that it no longer favours investors over workers and free community college funded by eliminating the stepped-up basis tax expenditure that allows heirs to reduce the capital gains taxes they pay on inherited assets. “Every state university should be free,” he said, in an echo of Sanders. “We can afford it.” Biden demanded the removal of workers’ barriers to fair pay – “Give me an economic reason why a sandwich maker has to sign a non-compete clause” – a massive infrastructure rebuilding programme – “I got in trouble as vice-president when I landed in La Guardia and I said this is a third-world airport” – and a scheme that would encourage investment in innovation and entrepreneurship beyond the usual major cities. There was also an audition for the role of candidate willing to go toe to toe with Trump. “There has been such a fertile ground for this phony populism that we are living through now, and it is a phony populism as my friend John McCain would say,” said Biden, earthy and pugnacious. “It’s all about making room for the abuse of power.” ‘The audacity of grope’ For all the efforts at triangulation, and his liberal credentials on abortion and gay marriage, the former vice-president has counts against him. They include his age, his Clinton-like association with the party establishment and copious video footage of him touching women, dubbed “the audacity of grope” by Comedy Central’s The Daily Show – hardly a message the party wants to promote, even if Trump has been accused of worse. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of The Working Class Republican, said: “We’re in the MeToo era. He has a reputation for being more tactile than is socially appropriate. There is energy in the feminist wing of the Democratic party and part of that is driven by the sexual misconduct allegations against Trump.” Olsen added: “Joe Biden has wanted to be president for decades. I’d be really surprised if he didn’t go for it this time. This is his last chance. In the polls last time, he was clearly drawing from the right of the Democratic party. That isn’t going to change. The hardline progressive isn’t going to say, ‘Joe’s our man.’ That means he has the weaker hand.” Biden may have to jostle for position with Kamala Harris, Sanders and other senators, former attorney general Eric Holder, ex-Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. Even so, Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to past presidential campaigns, said: “The most likely person, in my view, is Joe Biden. He has the broadest support in the party. He can speak across the constituencies and he’s well liked. That’s important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/huddersfield-arsenal-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:49:24Z","webTitle":"Huddersfield v Arsenal: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/huddersfield-arsenal-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/huddersfield-arsenal-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Huddersfield v Arsenal: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger takes charge of his final game against Huddersfield, fitting final opponents considering another Arsenal legend, Herbert Chapman, managed both clubs to huge success.

He went on to say that he stands with John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia and Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, as well as, “all of the Canadians – including the First Nations – who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline.” For months, Alberta and British Columbia have been locked in a standoff over plans, spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, to expand an existing pipeline and lay nearly 1,000km of new pipe from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast. The $7.4bn project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, would nearly triple the flow of Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to the west coast. It has been bitterly opposed by some in British Columbia, who point to the impact that a dramatic rise in tanker traffic could have on the region’s southern resident killer whales, a population already on the knife-edge of extinction, as well as the province’s multibillion dollar tourism industry. Others point to the existing pipeline’s track record; since 1961, the Trans Mountain pipeline has reported approximately 82 spills, with around 30% of those spills occurring along the pipeline’s route. Efforts to stop the expansion have heated up in recent weeks, with thousands of people joining indigenous-led protests in British Columbia. More than 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs. The political stalemate over the project catapulted into the national conversation last month after Kinder Morgan Canada announced it was halting all non-essential spending on the project and planned to walk away unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May. In response, Justin Trudeau said Canada’s government was prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward with the proposed plans. “The Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada – it will be built,” he told reporters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/11/peter-lewis-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:56:57Z","webTitle":"Peter Lewis obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/peter-lewis-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/11/peter-lewis-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter Lewis obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Peter Lewis, who has died aged 91, was the British Library’s director general of bibliographic services from 1980 to 1990, a post which put him at the forefront of the library’s measures to convert its vast general catalogue from paper into digital form. He was born in Oxford, to Charles Lewis, a colour sergeant in the British and then the Indian army, and Florence (nee Kirk), who was a lady’s maid before her marriage. Peter left the Masonic school at Bushey in Hertfordshire aged 18 in 1944, and joined the Royal Artillery towards the end of the second world war. During his military training he was based first in Glasgow and then near Watchet in Somerset. On leaving the army he took a job as a library assistant at Brighton public library, the beginning of a career as a librarian that took in posts in Plymouth and Chester before he joined the Board of Trade (now DTI) library in London. There he became a fellow of the Library Association and published a book, The Literature of the Social Sciences (1960). After a period at the Queen’s University School of Library Studies in Belfast, he became librarian of City University in London and then, in 1972, at the University of Sussex, moving with his family to Hurstpierpoint, near Brighton. At the same time he continued his activities with the Library Association as vice-president and honorary treasurer, and was invited by the then recently established British Library to join the Anglo-American committee defining new cataloguing rules, which he subsequently chaired. In 1980 he moved to the British Library’s bibliographic services division, where he was in the vanguard of implementing innovative technologies and where he stayed until retirement. Peter and his wife, June (nee Ashley), whom he had married in 1952 after they met as fellow workers at Brighton public library, then moved from Sussex to the village of Wenhaston, north Suffolk, where he plunged himself into the social life which he said the previous 25 years of committees and commuting had largely denied him. Amateur dramatics took up much of his time – he was a highly praised Falstaff and an outstanding King Lear – and he also enjoyed choral singing. He edited a history of the village, and after retiring from acting became president of his local theatre group, the Circle 67 Players. Peter and June kept each other going resolutely and he was a dedicated carer, supporting her through severe physical disability. June died in January. Peter is survived by their two children, Kate and me, and two granddaughters, and by his sister, Daphne.

Chvrches are about to go on tour for a year and a half, and she wants the protein. When I first met the band, in a Thistle hotel in east London in 2012, Mayberry was strengthening her diaphragm for the demands of singing live. On the back of their debut album, they played 365 dates in two years and the diaphragm worked out fine. Chvrches could not have known, sitting in that unremarkable hotel, what direction their rise to fame would take. Mayberry is a frontwoman developing in plain sight, through a well-publicised struggle with particularly vicious internet trolls to where she is now: living in New York and making records with wizard producer Greg Kurstin. There have been some impressive associations along the way: being interviewed by Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney; campaigning for girls’ empowerment with Amy Poehler; support slots for Depeche Mode. She is coming to terms with the fact that if you are famous, you will always be someone’s projection. “I definitely fall into one of two categories,” she says brightly, sucking an ice tea. “Diminutive, wet-blanket snowflake or angry feminist bitch.” The band made their name in 2012 when a mysterious and tuneful song called The Mother We Share appeared on music website Fader with no information at all as to who they were, save to say they were two guys and a girl. The formula was powerful: emotional lyrics (by Mayberry, then 24, sung in a pure and slightly intergalactic Scottish soprano); big, bittersweet tunes, and the kind of synths that suggested a nerdish life immersed in Prince, Eurythmics and Cocteau Twins. At that point in the history of music and the internet, a band with no background information was a novelty. Six years later, Chvrches still haven’t had any top 10 singles, but are world-famous: a strange trajectory they might finally be in a position to explain. Martin Doherty sidles up behind Mayberry at the coffee shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. He lives 97 paces from Mayberry, who moved to New York from Glasgow in 2015. Doherty is 35, dry, with a strong brogue and a Socratic way of talking about his band. “Have we ever had a top 10 single anywhere? No. Have we had consistent play on US radio? Absolutely.” His girlfriend, who helps the band with costumes, has been scouting branches of Zara in the 33C heat for a couple of shirts and hands Doherty a spotty one which he is quite content to wear. The “other guy” in Chvrches – Iain Cook – waits for us in his studio across town. Anyone who’s paid attention to the band over the years knows that they like to shed light on the perils of rock photography – girl in the front and men in the background, slightly out of focus. Doherty and Cook suffer their own kind of stereotyping: of similar height and build, with similar facial hair, people are sometimes not sure which is which. (“On the simplest level, I am the topline writer and Iain is producer,” says Doherty. “But it’s much more complicated than that.”) Their third album, Love Is Dead, sounds like a bid for the top 10. Songs are cleaner, with more space, a bit more anthemic – more “direct”, Chvrches concede. A duet with Matt Berninger of the National is cool, minimalist and full of air. Eight of 12 songs were produced by Kurstin, most famous for work with Adele, Lily Allen and Foo Fighters. It is a sign of the band’s strong-headedness that they did some sessions with Dave Stewart, but then decided not to use any of his songs. Apart from the pollen count twice that of Glasgow, New York has been good to Mayberry, who enjoys the anonymity, being able to “mind my own business and be off-grid a bit”. Her boyfriend, the actor Justin Long, has just told her about the Chappaquiddick incident, when Teddy Kennedy drove his car off a bridge in Massachusetts in 1969, swam free but left his 28-year-old female passenger inside. For Mayberry, the key point is: he was still allowed to continue in politics. Whether she likes it or not, she is always “on”. She talks about the rebrand of Playboy magazine: “I know women who are saying it’s really empowering. You can’t reclaim the concept of Playboy: you’ve all got fucking Stockholm syndrome!” She suspected Trump would get in when she watched the presidential debate that aired after the pussygrabbing incident. “The approval ratings were still up, and people were still listening. They’re talking about illegitimate babies and affairs now, but people didn’t care at the time that he bragged about assaulting women, so…” She still gets a shock when she sees signs saying “no concealed weapons in this movie theater”. She spoke out against Florida senator Marco Rubio’s gun control policy recently in the wake of the Parkland school shooting, and got a tweet from someone who threatened to come to a Chvrches show with an AK47. “Rubio is a weasel,” Mayberry says. She grew up 10 miles away from Dunblane, and was eight at the time of the school shooting there. Mayberry – who wrote her master’s thesis on images of femininity in women’s magazines – has drawn attention to the gendered language that people unthinkingly use to describe female musicians. A (female) MTV journalist called her a “heartbreaker”; in 2012, I thought nothing of calling her “formidable” – a word often used by men to describe women who scare them a bit. In the intervening years, something has changed. If you write too much about the way a female singer looks now, you look a bit silly. She says that being “short” automatically makes her the cute, infantilised little girl, but her outspokenness results in the “angry” tag and confuses people. “Do you make yourself unpalatable and find yourself out at sea?”, she says to me. “Or do you take internet breaks, when too many people Photoshop cum on your face?” This last example happened recently, for which reason she is currently “not on the internet”. When Chvrches started out, she used to read all the comments from fans because she managed the band’s Facebook page. When the rape threats started, she screen-grabbed and retweeted them. She got immediate responses: “This isn’t rape culture. You’ll know rape culture when I’m raping you, bitch,” said one. She wrote a piece for the Guardian, in 2013, about online sexism, years before #MeToo made the discussion commonplace: “My hopes are that if anything good comes out of this, it will start a conversation… encouraging others to reject an acceptance of the status quo,” she said. To anyone who asks whether she makes things worse for herself by responding to the trolls, she replies that such questions are part of the problem. We meet the week before R Kelly was removed from Spotify under their new “hateful conduct” policy, and I ask her why #MeToo was yet to take on the music industry. “The film world feels like a smaller world than music,” she says, “and it’s unionised in a way that music isn’t, and everyone knows each other – actors will be going up for the same jobs. In music, everyone’s working on their own separate projects. Who’s the person you complain to? “I don’t want to sound negative here but I don’t know any lady that was surprised by #MeToo. But I do feel that if you’re lucky enough to already be successful in the industry, you must put your money where your mouth is. If you continue to work with certain directors, or certain producers, then you’re saying a thing, but not being the thing. You can’t turn around and make money from exactly the same system that’s oppressing everybody else.” She pauses, looking a bit melancholic. “See, this is why I can’t have a nice time…” The unsavoury individuals have not altogether disappeared, and the band now has a list of the names, photos and locations of certain people (“the ones who are the most aggressive and delusional”), which is handed to a security company on tour for due diligence. Venues can’t exclude paying customers unless they’ve actually done something – so, surreally, these chaps come in to watch the show, flanked by security guards. “It’s just someone on the internet till it’s not,” Mayberry says. “You can’t come to our shows and not be aware of this stuff now. We made this a thing that we talked about. You’re always getting ‘girl in a band’ questions, so at least have a constructive conversation about it. It doesn’t take that long, you know? It only takes two seconds of your life to say: ‘I don’t agree with white supremacy. I don’t agree with homophobia.’ I think about politics, so it would be inauthentic not to talk about it.” For their new album, Chvrches “speed-dated” several potential producers in LA before settling on one they liked. One was so far off the mark that they ended up watching a Metallica documentary under blankets on the sofa to recover from the shock of trying to work with him. Doherty won’t reveal who that producer was but adds, grinning: “I know for a fact that they really work for one person. If I was a directionless vocalist who had just had a shit-ton of styling done, and I looked amazing and sounded amazing and had no idea what I wanted to do, I would go to him and have an amazing career!” On their very first day working with Dave Stewart, one of the band’s electro-pop gods, a strange thing happened. When the time came for Stewart’s customary martini (6pm), he held Mayberry back and fired up a video clip of Milla Jovovich giving a rousing speech in the 1999 film Joan of Arc. Stewart said something to the effect of: “You could be that, but you don’t want to be. I can see it in the interviews, I can see it in the performances, you want to be this thing... but you’re not doing it.” Mayberry was miffed. “He was making me wax on and wax off!” she says, thinking of Karate Kid. “I was like, what do you mean, Mr Miyagi? Have I not tried hard enough? But he was right. As a frontperson you are the first point of contact for the band. Are you really connecting with people? Maybe you’re just a little downtrodden, and you’re trying 75%. Does 100% feel too vulnerable?” Stewart taught the band a lot, but they found the sessions felt old when they came to make the record. With Greg Kurstin, there was a particular naturalness in their personal chemistry. They wrote the first single, Get Out, on the first day and then cancelled the rest of the speed dates. Kurstin “felt easy and safe – safe to try out new things,” says Mayberry. “There was a lot of talk about what people were going to have for lunch. It wasn’t someone trying to pull us into their world, or make a pastiche. The people we ended up connecting with most were the British people – Dave, Steve Mac [who produced the track Miracle, widely described as a banger] – and Greg has worked with a ton of British acts. Maybe there was an understanding of that sense of humour, and that sense of melancholy. We never wanted to be the Scottish band that went to LA.” Doherty is amused when US radio DJs get excited about meeting Scottish people and reveal a shared heritage four generations ago. “I was relatively miserable in Glasgow,” he says. “I’ll go back there eventually, when this is all done!” The connection between outsiderdom and pop is long established. Points of rejection occurred for all members of Chvrches. Mayberry wanted – she is embarrassed to say – a Playboy T-shirt at school; the cool girls were wearing them, but her parents didn’t let her buy one. She never befriended the crowd, and started combing the record shops of Stirling on Saturday afternoons. In Europa Music on Friars Street, she found, among the used CDs, Sleater-Kinney’s Dig Me Out. A line in the Heath Ledger film 10 Things I Hate About You led her to Bikini Kill and the Raincoats. “Who knows, if I’d been accepted by the girls in the Playboy T-shirts my life could have been very different.” Doherty spent many years working as live keyboard player for the Glasgow band the Twilight Sad, who never let him join as a member, or write. “I tried to join that band loads of times and I have never felt more rejected in my entire life!” he says. “I guess lot of people’s ambition comes from some kind of professional or social rejection at some point. I thought, I’ll just write my own songs, then. And that was it.” He was ready to retrain as a history teacher when he started working on early demos with Cook, whom he’d known since 2004, when they studied music at the University of Strathclyde. You start to get the sense there was a real game plan. “Was there a certain level of awareness? Yes,” Doherty says. “We’re a classic albums band, which is what I always wanted to be. It was all about establishing our identity. We were very protective over that in the beginning. Maybe overly concerned. We were very guarded. The fact that I can talk about it now speaks to how much things have changed.” Talking to Doherty is a crash course in how to build a band. “What we really understood was that touring would be how we broke the band. It’s done hardcore on the road. But here is this incredible new tool, a force for good and evil, the internet. There was this democracy on SoundCloud at this time, maybe 2011 to 2014, where you could use it as a very pure form of marketing. It was about whether people were interested in what you had to say musically, and nothing else. So did we know that, when we put our songs online with zero details? Yes. I had just spent the last seven years being highly available and getting nowhere for it. Be less available and you will become more interesting!” After The Mother We Share, Chvrches gigs started to sell out. Then there was a slot on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. Now, for album three, they’re waiting; watching the streams and the dates booking up – 5,000-seaters mainly, across America, Europe and Japan. Together we head 20 minutes across town to the neighbourhood of Bushwick, an area still considered, in the words of Chvrches’ Glaswegian manager, rather spicy: there are lockups, food stores and a huge pile of road salt in an orange hangar, alongside coffee shops peopled by prescription-strength hipsters. In the most ironic of moments, a graffiti tour passes us, its guide yelling through a loudhailer: “this is not a graffiti tour.” “Painfully cool,” agrees Cook, sitting in his small studio, a unit in a local collective, with a psychotherapist across the corridor (“That would have been useful a year or two ago,” says Mayberry). They wrote 45 songs in here last year, only three of which made it on to the album: My Enemy (the duet with Matt Berninger), Really Gone and God’s Plan, no relation to the Drake song. Cook’s mixing desk is decorated with Michael Jackson bubblegum cards from a local flea market, and a model ET. Cook, who at 43 is the band elder, was lecturing and writing film and ad music after his time in the Glaswegian band Aereogramme when he first brought Mayberry in to work on some demos. Now, his baby has taken off. But getting an outside producer in? “It was really hard because it took us years to get to this point,” he says. “It was great with Greg, because it felt like we had another member of the band – but I’d be saying, ‘you’re stealing my shit!’ The whole time we were in Greg’s studio, I never sat down at a computer.” Instead he was doing keyboards, bass and writing melodies. “For the first sessions I was thinking, ‘I’m really not sure how I feel about this!’ Then I learned to help the process, rather than sit around wondering what to do.” Cook misses Glasgow more than the others. He’s giving up his Brooklyn flat when they go on tour and moving his stuff home for a while – “It’s really expensive to live in New York,” he says (he can’t be doing with Airbnb). A naturally retiring type, he came off social media six months ago, deleting Facebook and Twitter. “What good can come of it?” He was shocked by the level of abuse that Mayberry got online, “and the debate has caught up with us. I really can’t see things going back to being as bad as they were.” He is happiest talking about Kurstin’s recording equipment. Kurstin would “pull toys from his cupboard” to show them, like a LinnDrum II drum machine, “which is what Prince used in Purple Rain, and Cocteau Twins used in the 80s”. You can hear it in Never Say Die on the new album – “in verse two, when the percussion gets weird”. Chvrches have had songs on Gray’s Anatomy, CSI, Mr Robot and Lucifer – but still no top 10 single. “Who isn’t interested in a hit record?” Cook blinks. “Surely everybody wants that?” It is time for the photoshoot, and the test shots are over quickly for the men, as you might expect. In their Zara shirts, Doherty and Cook stand on the street discussing how strange it is that Doherty doesn’t remember either the Garbage Pail Kids or Magic Eye pictures, when Mayberry emerges in a pink dress with a pair of heavy black boots. Clive James wrote about her boots once, wondering why any angel as wildly delicate would be wearing them. He contrasted Mayberry with Taylor Swift: “Whereas Lauren very properly gets fighting mad if any poor dumb male critic calls her the cheesecake element of Chvrches, Taylor is unashamed about concentrating into her image every element of cheesecake in the patisserie.” Back in 2012, Mayberry told me that “we never wanted to be two producers and a girl who wears some shoes”. Now, Mayberry occupies a unique space whereby even the smallest gesture – putting on a frock – is a political act. “I can look back at pictures of us and trace the mental health issues,” she says. “At first we were having fun – the early press shots are a bit more theatrical and escapist. Then I started wearing baggier and baggier clothing, and less and less makeup, trying to make myself as inoffensive as possible, and it didn’t change anything – if anything, the online abuse increased. A couple of days before the first record came out I was sitting in a hotel room thinking: ‘I am so over this, and yet it is what I have wanted to do since I was 17.’” In summer 2015, she attracted more trolls because she wore a dress in the video for a song called Leave a Trace. Shorts and T-shirt made sense as a feminist, it seemed, but not a black frock and heels. “Hypocritical... slut... bitch... whore...” they said. “Cavemen,” she retorted. “I see this across all aspects of culture, especially with a particular type of female artist,” Doherty told me earlier. “I don’t totally understand it. It is very deep and very complex and very fucked-up.” And so begins an hour-long promenade around the spicy Bushwick and its famous graffiti. But this is no ordinary photoshoot. Over a long walk, the band diplomatically repel the requests of the photographer – girl on her own, girl with arm over her head. They’re asked to stand in front of graffiti saying “Diva”: “that’s not really our thing,” says Doherty. At the end of the shoot, the photographer requests a Mexican wave for his personal collection. He’s got a sequence of such photos – some former presidents have taken part, he says. “Maybe they should get back to work,” suggests Mayberry, calling time.

Except the Bank of England","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Mark Carney is not so much an unreliable boyfriend as a schoolboy who keeps getting his homework wrong. The Bank of England governor gave his quarterly review of the economy last week and yet again confounded earlier expectations that he would increase the cost of borrowing. Whereas in the past Carney has confidently predicted that the economy is robust and capable of absorbing increases in interest rates, only to find plausible excuses for not going ahead, this time he was unable to offer any coherent defence. At the press conference held following the Bank’s quarterly inflation report, Carney was challenged by journalists again and again that his answers failed to add up. He became irritable and on occasion abrupt with his interrogators. His counterpart at the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has a similar reputation for spiky relationships, especially with the press. But his excuse for never raising interest rates is consistent. He avoids the trap of exuberance based on a few months of good economic news, unlike Carney. It means Draghi has rarely made the mistake of leading consumers, mortgage payers and the financial markets to believe the cost of borrowing will rise imminently when in the end it does not. Carney tells us time and again that things are about to get better and that the end of easy money must accompany this improvement. The question is, will anyone believe him again when he says interest rates are about to rise?The Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee, of which Carney is chair, always has a good excuse for another delay. It said the bad economic news in the first few months of the year was just a blip and once normal service is resumed, rate rises will begin to kick in. Yet to anyone outside the Bank, the downward trend is clear. The economy is slowing and to an alarming degree. Ever since the Brexit vote the housing market has deflated. The number of transactions has fallen and prices growth stalled. It is a market held up by government subsidy in the shape of George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme, and now even that is not enough to propel it forward. The Halifax has reported a decline of 3.2% between January and March, the steepest fall in nine years. The lack of action in the mortgage market is reflected in the credit markets, which have shown a major squeeze on the growth in secured and unsecured borrowing. It seems that fewer and fewer people each month want to borrow to spend and invest. This might not matter if pay growth was about to take off. That it will take off has been the Bank’s central projection since the beginning of the decade. But it has never happened. Carney said low unemployment and a high number of job vacancies meant an uplift in wage growth was still imminent. Over at the Office for National Statistics, the measure of average weekly wages points in a different direction. It shows weekly incomes have fallen in every month since October 2017 to hit £486. This compares with an average wage (in 2015 prices) that reached a high point of £522.50 a week in 2008. In April last year the average was £8 higher than today at £494. Wages are a crucial element of household spending power. The other is credit. If both are going down or growth is falling, the economy has a problem; it’s not a blip. Inequality, not merit, is behind soaring art valuations While sitting in the back of a car, Damien Hirst scribbled a sketch of a shark and handed it to his driver as a tip for a smooth journey. The chauffeur later sold the piece, which had taken the enfant terrible of British art about 30 seconds to draw, for £4,500. The anecdote reflects well on Hirst’s generosity, but portrays the wealthy art-buying community in a less flattering light. And that group of rich aesthetes is having a busy fortnight. Last week the private art collection of David Rockefeller was sold off, fetching multimillion-dollar prices including $115m for Picasso’s Fillette à la corbeille fleurie (Young Girl with a Flower Basket). On Monday, Nu couché (Reclining Nude) by Amedeo Modigliani goes up for sale at Sotheby’s in New York with a valuation of at least $150m. Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) went on sale with an estimated value of $100m last year before it was sold for a record $450m, so the Modigliani valuation could be conservative. If the price of art is driven by a combination of aesthetic merit and scarcity, Hirst’s dashed-off piece doesn’t pass the test. The sale of a Modigliani or a Leonardo at least meets those requirements. But what links all three pieces, and raises wider questions about the art market, is wealth. There is a significant number of people ready to waste their capital on objects that, in a world with more equally distributed wealth, would never achieve those valuations. Roman Abramovich, who made his fortune buying Russian state assets on the cheap, spent tens of millions on a pair of paintings by Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon, while Steve Cohen, the billionaire hedge fund owner whose SAC fund pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, paid $165m for Masterpiece by Roy Lichtenstein. The art market is not an arbiter of taste. It is a symbol of inequality. We can’t have a sensible debate on train tickets without mentioning their prices The key words in the rail industry’s announcement of a review of fares regulation last week were “revenue neutral”. In other words, the £9.7bn a year that passengers spend on tickets will not be reduced – or increased. Some of the points raised in the statement by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), formed by train operators and Network Rail, are sensible: that seven-day season tickets do not reflect the realities of flexible working (and, implicitly, a three- or four-day-a-week season ticket would be better); that multiple single fares are often cheaper than a single through ticket; and that the amount of fares available on the rail system – a boggling 55 million – is too many. But failure to address the average price of tickets – whether allowing that price to fall to encourage more rail journeys, or actually raising prices in order to pay for, say, new lines and trains – leaves the impression of an incomplete review. As the RDG admits, the funding balance between the fare payers and taxpayers – the latter paid a net £3.4bn into the railways last year – will not be scrutinised because “this choice is rightly a matter for governments”. Whether total fare revenues rise or fall should be a matter for voters and their representatives, but that should not dissuade train operators and Network Rail from offering its informed opinion on whether the railways require greater investment and who should pay for it. So far, the nation’s balance sheet has done the heavy lifting. At £46bn and rising, Network Rail’s debt is too large. Relentlessly raising fare revenue – up 18% over five years – while pushing down the taxpayer contribution – down 21% over the same period – seems an unjust balance given the public, social and environmental good that railways represent. Let’s have a sensible, open debate about it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/gold-keepers-why-premier-league-will-only-get-richer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:54:45Z","webTitle":"Gold keepers: why the Premier League clubs will get only richer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/gold-keepers-why-premier-league-will-only-get-richer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/gold-keepers-why-premier-league-will-only-get-richer","fields":{"headline":"Gold keepers: why the Premier League clubs will get only richer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For many decades in football’s development the end-of-season standings, triumphs and disappointments were pored over as sports results, not generally reckoned for their impact on clubs’ bank balances. Those days have dwindled as football’s revenues have swollen, as investors have bought clubs to make money for themselves, and as the financial gap between clubs and leagues has dramatically widened: cash has become a much more prominent consequence of winning and losing. For Premier League clubs a top-four finish is a landmark achievement to secure Champions League qualification – and the financial windfall it delivers. It is quite staggering to see that Leicester City made €82m (£70m) from Uefa TV payments last season for their run as reigning Premier League title holders to the Champions League quarter-finals. Due to Uefa’s agreed formula for allocating the riches, rewarding clubs for their progress and where they finished domestically the previous season, Leicester made almost double the €43m (£38m) Tottenham Hotspur made, still a very tidy bonus. Uefa starts new 2018-21 TV deals next season and has promised yet more money for the privileged top clubs, although the precise amounts are not yet divulged. The great financial divides distort and undermine competitiveness but there is no serious effort in football to distribute money more equally. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin is leading an examination of ways to alleviate the damage to “competitive balance” but has acknowledged that his room for change is practically limited. The real pressure is the other way, from rich clubs wanting more, as with the so-called “big six” Premier League clubs currently seeking a greater share of the league’s international TV rights, which have always been shared equally between all 20 clubs. In English football the enormous inequality is weirdly celebrated, the Championship play-off final hyped annually as football’s richest match, as if that is something the nation should be proud of. As play-offs are one-off matches, which can be decided like last year’s between Huddersfield and Reading on as narrow a margin as a shootout, the winner’s vast financial reward is clearly not in proportion to the achievement. The money simply encapsulates the divide between the Premier League and the Football League’s three divisions, from which First Division clubs broke away in 1992 so they could keep the lion’s share of new satellite TV money. The Premier League’s success, now garnering more from international TV rights, has meant the breakaway’s gap, despite the Football League’s attractions, best efforts and rebranding into the EFL, has stretched much wider. The Premier League clubs, and those relegated from it with lucrative parachute payments, are feasting on their record £8.4bn TV deal from 2016-19. Although UK income from Sky and BT Sport will fall from £5.13bn to £4.46bn during the 2019-22 deals because of BT Sport not bidding aggressively for the main packages, the Premier League executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, is confident that international growth will take it over the current £8.4bn total. The contrast with the EFL is alarming and puts Championship clubs under financial pressure as they strain to pay the players who might take them up. The EFL’s current TV deal amounts to £90m a year – 3% of the Premier League’s, shared among all 72 clubs. From 2019 a new five-year deal will pay £120m annually – improved, but still a fraction of Premier League riches. Parachute payments land the inequality into the Championship itself. The bottom three Premier League clubs last season, Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, made £97m, £99m and £93m respectively in 2016-17 from Premier League TV rights; parachute payments for relegated clubs are now £42m in the first season in the Championship, £34m in the second and £16.6m in the third, a huge financial advantage on other clubs. A club relegated after one season in the Premier League is paid two years of parachutes, not the third £16.6m, so the minimum windfall of promotion is £170m-£180m. Recognition of this divide did finally lead to the Premier League releasing a fraction of its money to the EFL directly in “solidarity” payments. They are not insignificant: £4.5m to each Championship club, £675,000 to those in League One, £450,000 for League Two clubs, but nowhere near enough to bridge the gap. A study into the effect of parachute payments by academics Rob Wilson, Girish Ramchandani and Daniel Plumley of Sheffield Hallam University documents the huge financial advantage they give clubs relegated from the Premier League and that they reduce competitiveness in the Championship. “The competitive balance of the [Championship] in general has declined in recent years,” they conclude. To address this, they suggest parachute payments should be shared throughout the EFL rather than paid only to relegated clubs, or a handicap system – or the abolition of parachute payments altogether. “[Their] premise in the early years was to soften the financial blow of relegation,” the report says, “but in light of increasing broadcasting fees all it appears to have done is to give relegated teams a significant advantage over their competitors.” The authors, though, recognise the Premier League’s power, leading to “powerful ‘super-clubs’ that monopolise the market to some extent”, means suggestions for greater equality are largely futile. The pressure is the other way: from big clubs, for inequality to be increased, in their favour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/how-do-i-become-a-spy-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:45:27Z","webTitle":"How do I go about becoming a spy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/how-do-i-become-a-spy-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/14/how-do-i-become-a-spy-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"How do I go about becoming a spy?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I want to be a spy.

But on Tuesday the nightclub will play host to an altogether different mind-bending experience. More than a thousand people are expected to gather at the venue, where pumping beats will by replaced by deafening silence for what is being billed as the biggest group meditation ever held in Britain. Self-styled meditation guru Will Williams is staging the event to launch his new book, The Effortless Mind. The aim, he says, is to attract a new generation to “the inner joys of meditation”. Fabric epitomises the “old hedonism”, he says – a drink-and-drugs-fuelled dance scene from which people traditionally stagger home at dawn. “I want to bring a new hedonism into its space. It’ll be a dynamic, energised night but we’ll all wake up the next morning feeling fantastic,” he says. So it will be mocktails, not cocktails, on the menu. Williams knows only too well the pain of the morning after the night before. A former booking agent for bands and musicians, he used to “indulge in every bit of debauchery you can think of”. But, a decade ago, his life changed after a friend persuaded him to try meditation. At first, he saw it as a means to conquer insomnia and a “brilliant cure for hangovers”. But he was soon hooked and moved to India to study with “the masters” for three years. Experimenting with different types of mindfulness, he kept coming back to vedic meditation. “It doesn’t involve chanting, religion, or uncomfortable sitting positions,” Williams says. “It’s easy, it’s cool, it works.” But he didn’t stop at his own personal enlightenment. Williams calculated that taking the art of ancient eastern meditation and turning it into a thriving western business was the lucrative way forward. He now runs meditation studios in two venues in central London (a three-day course costs around £300) and plans to expand across the country. Williams has no shortage of converts to what he describes as a path to “deeper fulfilment”. One of his newest is Take That’s Howard Donald. After two decades of dismissing “the whole joss-stick-burning thing” that other members of the group embraced, Donald says he now swears by it. “It’s helping me be more creative, but without the drugs,” Donald, who has just turned 50, said. “The thoughts and colours are amazing, the golds, the reds, the blues – I don’t know what they mean, but the visions you get in your mind, they’re beautiful. “The song ideas are flowing even when I’m in the middle of a meditation – sometimes, I just want to cut it short and get the dictaphone out,” he says. “You get emotional sometimes. But that’s good, it’s about letting stuff out, clearing your body, bit by bit.” While grateful that Donald is positive about his experiences, Williams is keen to distance himself from the meditation and celebrity love-in. He worries that it can inspire some, but make others cynical. “We need to show that wisdom, meaning, joy, purpose – it’s about you, me and everyone. We’re all going through the same emotional challenges, whoever we are,” he says. “Meditation is a vehicle, a drug if you like, and a really powerful one.” • To order Effortless Mind by Will Williams for £12.74, go to guardianbookshop.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/12/eddie-jones-heat-england-world-cup-game-changers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T21:01:40Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones puts heat on England in search for World Cup game changers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/12/eddie-jones-heat-england-world-cup-game-changers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/12/eddie-jones-heat-england-world-cup-game-changers","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones puts heat on England in search for World Cup game changers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The heat is on Eddie Jones, after three successive defeats in the Six Nations ended his long honeymoon, and it will be turned on his England squad when they prepare for next month’s three-Test tour of South Africa with a machine humidifying the indoor training facility at their base in Bagshot. The head coach has next year’s World Cup in mind more than the altitude for their first two matches against the Springboks, in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. He wants his players to be prepared for potentially hot, humid conditions in Japan and the machine will be given an airing before this year’s autumn series and the 2019 Six Nations. “Our training centre will become a heat and humidity environment,” says Jones, who coached Japan from 2012-15. “Some players will struggle and it will have a detrimental effect on how they play rugby. There are ways you can overcome that and this is one. It is important to do it now because it enables us to find ways to help them cope in the World Cup. “The temperature in the training facility will reach 30 degrees with 75% humidity. You could have eight weeks in Japan at that temperature: no one knows because it can fluctuate significantly but in Tokyo that temperature is regular. It becomes a different game, like playing in a thunderstorm. The ball becomes slippery and we want to get the players used to those conditions, because we do not have the luxury of playing in Japan beforehand.” Jones will be without a core of experienced players in South Africa. Some, including Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes, Anthony Watson and George Kruis, are injured; others, such as Dan Cole, James Haskell and Danny Care, have been “rested”, and it is in those who have been omitted that the direction Jones is taking to Japan may be tracked. Would Mike Brown and Chris Robshaw have a summer off but for injuries to Watson and Sam Underhill? In the Six Nations England were the least effective team at the breakdown, struggling to recycle ball quickly and slow down the opposition. They lacked dynamism and were largely narrow and one‑paced. But both the tour squad and the group assembled to train in Brighton next week for the 27 May match against the Barbarians at Twickenham have an emphasis on mobility as well as power. “The game is only going to get faster and more athletic,” says Jones. “All the law interpretations are geared to the ball being faster: New Zealand drive the laws and they are obsessed with quick ruck ball. It is going to happen and we need to improve there. We have to change not skill sets but behaviour.” South Africa have reacted to three stagnant years after the last World Cup by appointing Rassie Erasmus and aligning their Super Rugby franchises with the Boks. Jones notes the difference that would make but when asked whether he would be lobbying for the breakdown in the Premiership to better reflect international rugby and the Champions Cup, a greater contest for possession that would encourage clubs to groom and play specialist openside flankers, his reply shows he is resigned to noninterference. “I can’t control that,” he answers. “How can I have an influence? I do not own any club. We don’t control the referees, the clubs do.” So Jones must plough on without the synchronisation most of his rivals enjoy. “You need specialist 7s: that role has become even more important as the game has changed, with a distinct responsibility at the first breakdown, and 6 and 8 have complementary roles, but the breakdown now is about every player.” The front- and second-row choices for South Africa highlight the need to play with sustained pace and Jones has called up Dan Robson and Danny Cipriani, who are adept at getting the ball wide quickly. Jones says he knows 70% of the squad he will take to Japan and is looking for the other 30%. Jones is taking the 18-year-old Sale playmaker Cameron Redpath to South Africa even though he has not made an appearance in the Premiership this season. Five of the seven inside backs, excluding the scrum-halves, are 10s, with Henry Slade, who started in that position for Exeter, and Ben Te’o the exceptions, as Jones strives for quick ball. Coaches regularly come up with wheezes such as contraptions that turn the air hot and humid, but it is players who will win the World Cup. “We want someone to come through who will give us something different,” says Jones. He wants his players to be instinctive, starting with the fly-half George Ford, who now has Cipriani to push him. “Certain teams want the 10 to play as part of the system and that takes away his instinctiveness. Our job is to open that up for him. We want to see what Danny can add. He played the game east-west [running laterally] but now he is more north-south so he is worth having a look at. Just tell him to leave his dinner suit at home; you can’t play rugby in that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/why-all-the-sniping-at-single-women-are-they-having-too-much-fun","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T17:25:49Z","webTitle":"Why all the sniping at single women – are they having too much fun? | Hannah Jane Parkinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/why-all-the-sniping-at-single-women-are-they-having-too-much-fun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/why-all-the-sniping-at-single-women-are-they-having-too-much-fun","fields":{"headline":"Why all the sniping at single women – are they having too much fun?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, now put your hands up! Because you ruin absolutely everything and deserve to be called out. Endlessly, and around the world. The latest example is Kanji Kato, a Japanese MP who has called single women a “burden on the state”. Annoyingly, there is a grain of truth in this, if the single women are childless, as ageing populations put pressure on national health services, including our own NHS. In the past, globally, when people tended to have more children, those children cared for their parents and other older relatives. But in many countries that trend is declining, requiring medical professionals, nurses and retirement homes to bridge the care gap. But it never seems to be the case that politicians pipe up about single, childless men, who also grow old and need care, and who, in their youth, are deified as ambitious or approved of as charming, roguish scamps. It’s women who, in the words of another Japanese politician, are the “birth-giving machines”, and any who choose not to have children, or who can’t, are deemed to be malfunctioning. But hey, single women have become used to this attitude, alongside the millennial generation, who are also responsible for everything bad or depressing. Single women are making everyone feel awkward (particularly the entire global tabloid press if that woman is Jennifer Aniston). Their need for babies is forcing the rest of us to pay for them with our taxes and provide IVF on the NHS (a move that “casts doubt on the government’s family-friendly credentials”, according to the Telegraph). Apparently, single women are also responsible for men who go on murdering sprees because they had the indecency to reject them. It’s amazing that single women have the audacity to roam about in daylight, as if they were, in fact, not single and therefore normal. A favourite series of articles of mine on this subject are titled along the lines of: Avoid the Mistakes Single Women Make, which include (really) “being shortsighted about life”, “falling down on the job of life” and “giving up and caving in” . It’s not really a new thing, viewing single women as freaks. Remember that Bridget Jones quote, when she is asked why so many women in their 30s are single? “I don’t know. I suppose it doesn’t help that underneath our clothes, our entire bodies are covered in scales.” Single women deserve a break. Especially because it’s actually society that is ruining everything for single women. There is the extortionate cost of renting alone, or forking out double the cost when you holiday solo, then having to watch couples coo at origami swan napkins while they demand you take photos of them. There is trying to pretend that other people’s babies don’t all look the same. Or, for single women who have children, having to deal with society’s raised eyebrows. A 2017 report found that single women were much happier than single men, mostly because they are not tied down with the emotional and domestic labour that comes with being a woman in a (heterosexual) relationship. It probably also has something to do with the fact that nobody can veto your Netflix choices if you’re the only one making them, and not being dragged along to a partner’s work do. Could these snide asides at single women just be the politics of envy? Arctic Monkeys have turned into the old drunk in the corner It’s extraordinary, really, what has happened to Arctic Monkeys. The band made their name thanks to their authenticity, and now a song on their new album, Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino, has Alex Turner playing an ageing rock star and singing “maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s” – despite being born in 1986. Turner has told BBC’s Radio 1 that he feels embarrassed by his old lyrics, even though their second album beautifully summed up a dying relationship as, “Several hours or several weeks / I’d have the cheek to say they’re equally as bleak”; while the new record, five years in the making, includes: “I can get you on the list for all the clubs” and has a song called The Ultracheese. It’s not that Arctic Monkeys are bad now – it’s just that they were so much fun then. It was exciting, for those of us who had the bootleg recordings from live gigs, to see their songs transform from the rough to the recorded version (often with name changes – When the Sun Goes Down was first named Scummy). It’s part of the joy of being a music fan; watching acts (or their collaborators) evolve and innovate. And though I’m sure repeated listens of TBH&amp;C may unearth melodies, somewhere, at the moment it feels like the audio equivalent of an enforced David Lynch marathon and Turner’s piano practice. I mean, Britney went from … Baby One More Time and pronouncing the word baby as “babe-un” and 12 years later gave us Toxic. Kanye’s debut single took a Chaka Khan vocal and made her sound like a chipmunk, but eventually gave us Power. Some acts evolve, others change their DNA. I’m mourning then, for a band that represented all the joy of that first Jägerbomb at a house party and now sound like the drunk old guy in the corner of a pub muttering under his breath. Giggling as they choke To Carpinteria, a town 85 miles from Los Angeles, which has begun to stink of weed more than a student with low-slung pants and a This Guitar Kills Fascists sticker. Californians voted in 2016 to legalise marijuana, which is great if you love a toke. But it would be awful for people like me who gag on pretty much all of London’s pot-filled streets – Carpinteria’s air essentially sounds like one big plume of dope smoke. Still, the UN found that 44 UK cities and towns are so polluted that they are dangerous to breathe in, dope or no dope. At least in Carpinteria, they’re probably giggling as they choke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/gardens-what-to-do-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this To call sweet rocket (Hesperis matronalis) a border filler would underplay its brilliance as a scented flower of late spring and early summer.

Theresa May has divided members of her deadlocked Brexit inner cabinet into two groups, tasked with tweaking the two rival plans to find an acceptable compromise. But ministers remain pessimistic about the prospect of finding a workable solution, with one comparing the process of wearing down their opponents with the Marathon des Sables, an endurance race across the Sahara. “It feels like everyone’s quite entrenched,” said another senior source. The impasse has stalled negotiations in Brussels, and is becoming increasingly politically embarrassing for May, who was challenged by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, about the “shambles” of her negotiating strategy in parliament on Wednesday. A spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday: “We think both options have merit, we’re discussing both of them further. The groups reflect the issues that have been raised in relation to the two models. The groups are working through these issues of priority and need to come up with the right solution.” He added: “We are not setting any further deadlines for ourselves apart from October. That continues to be our focus.” October is the deadline by which the government hopes to agree the outlines of a trade deal, to allow time for parliament to ratify it. But the EU27 have stressed that they want to see progress on the Irish border issue in particular before the European Council meets next month. The depth of the divisions in cabinet burst into the open last week, with the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, describing May’s favoured customs partnership as “crazy”. The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve, who has repeatedly challenged the government over its Brexit plans, said Johnson should resign if he disagreed so profoundly with other members of the cabinet. “The prime minister has a difficult task and I don’t think it’s helped by this tendency of the foreign secretary to express himself,” he told the Guardian. “If you don’t like a policy, you leave the government. That’s what you should do. If there are problems, you either accept them or you have to go. That’s your choice.” Asked if that meant he thought Johnson should resign, he said: “He should resign. Yes.” But allies of Johnson stress that both proposals remain in play, and point out that the business secretary, Greg Clark, has spoken out in favour of the partnership plan. The cabinet breakout groups have already met once and will gather again on Monday. Brexiters remain deeply sceptical about the customs partnership, which also has the backing of Philip Hammond, and would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. This “hybrid model”, as it is also known, will be discussed by the group including David Lidington, Liam Fox and Michael Gove. Brexiters fear it will force Britain to remain too close to the EU; copying the bloc’s product standards and regulations, for example. One Brexiter suggested the prime minister may be hoping the persuasive Lidington can “flip” Gove or Fox. The other group will discuss the so-called “max fac” proposal favoured by the Brexit secretary, David Davis.

Falcón ought to be the favorite. He’s up against Nicolás Maduro, the deeply unpopular and increasingly authoritarian president who is seeking another six-year term despite leading this oil-rich nation into its worst economic crisis in decades. Yet Falcón is the underdog. He’s resigned to the usual dirty tricks from the ruling Socialist Party, including the use of state food hand-outs to lure hungry people into voting for Maduro. But what most infuriates him is friendly fire: Venezuela’s largest opposition parties are denouncing Falcón as a stooge for participating in an election they say will be a sham – and which they have vowed to boycott. “This makes it a lot more complicated,” Falcón admits. “But we are going to take risks and follow the democratic path. Now is not the time for politicians to go into hiding.” Falcón has been buoyed by polls that show him either ahead or within striking distance of Maduro. He also points to research showing that even on an unfair electoral playing field, it’s almost always better to participate than to stand down. A 2009 study by the Brookings Institution of more than 100 electoral boycotts – from Afghanistan to Iraq to Peru – found that their goal of rendering elections illegitimate in the eyes of the world was rarely achieved. Instead, they left the boycotting parties in an even weaker state. Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, says that Sunday’s election presents an extremely rare opportunity for voters to remove an autocrat through peaceful means. Surrendering to Maduro, he says, “is the biggest mistake I’ve seen the opposition make in a decade.” The leaders of the largest of the 20-some parties that make up the opposition coalition claim that electoral conditions are so grossly weighted in Maduro’s favor that voting on Sunday would be pointless. Most electoral officials are Maduro loyalists who, in past elections, have turned a blind eye to vote tampering and the last-minute relocation of polling places in opposition strongholds. The government controls most TV and radio stations which transmit a constant stream of of pro-Maduro propaganda. It is also fomenting the notion that the ballot is not secret and that people who vote for the opposition will lose government jobs, public housing, and vital food handouts. “It matters little whether this threat is real or perceived. Most people can’t afford to risk their paltry food rations to in order find out,” wrote the Caracas political blogger Emiliana Duarte. Maduro’s re-election pitch “pretty much comes down to ‘vote for me if you want food, starve if you want to make a point’”, she said. At a campaign rally in the western city of Barquisimeto, Maduro put it this way: “The Fatherland protects you and gives you everything. And you must give the Fatherland political power.” But just to make sure, the government has banned the two most popular opposition politicians – Leopoldo López who is under house arrest for inciting violence and Henrique Capriles who faces trumped-up corruption charges – from running. Those allowed on the ballot are two lesser-known figures: Falcón and televangelist Javier Bertucci, who is attracting big crowds by turning his campaign events into makeshift soup kitchens. Carlos González, an anti-government activist who heads a Venezuelan business association, says the name on the ballot doesn’t matter: “Jesus Christ could be the candidate and Maduro would still prevail because the system is set up for him to win,” he says. The opposition has taken this argument overseas, convincing the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries to denounce the balloting as a sham. “Yes, Venezuelans want to vote. But we don’t want to legitimize the Maduro regime and the misery that he has brought to the country,” said Negal Morales, an opposition lawmaker. “To vote would be to take part in a farce.” Some critics contend that the boycott came about after the opposition was outmaneuvered by government negotiators. In discussions over electoral conditions, the opposition drew a line in the sand, demanding a neutral electoral tribunal, a postponement of the balloting until October, and the presence of international observers. After months of talks, the government conceded almost nothing. According to one observer, that left the opposition feeling obliged to save face by making good on its threat to sit out the election. “Maduro wants people to abstain,” Francisco Rodríguez, Falcón’s chief policy advisor, said. “He wants nobody to come out to vote because that’s the only election he can win. And the opposition fell into that trap.” However, unfair electoral conditions don’t always mean victory for authoritarian rulers. In a 1988 plebiscite in Chile, voters were asked if they approved of extending the regime of military dictator Augusto Pinochet for another eight years. In a surprise result, 56% voted “no” and Pinochet left office two years later. Looking back on that outcome, Genaro Arriagada, the national director of Chile’s “no” campaign, once declared: “Even in a dictatorship, the worst mistake is to not participate.” With that in mind, Falcón has been barnstorming the country to convince people to that their votes matter. A former governor of the western state of Lara, Falcón was once a vocal supporter of the Bolivarian revolution ushered in by the late Hugo Chávez in 1999. But Falcón broke with Chávez in 2008 and has become a fierce critic of Maduro. His blunt campaign slogan is ¡Se va! – Spanish for “He’s leaving”. Speaking to a crowd in a working-class barrio in the industrial city of Valencia, Falcón called Maduro “the president of hunger and misery”. He pointed out that the average monthly salary is no longer enough to buy a carton of eggs and outlined his plan to scrap the bolívar, Venezuela’s badly devalued currency, and replace it with the US dollar. Last year the country’s economy shrank by more than 13%; hyperinflation is set to hit 13,000% and the prolonged crisis has driven some 5,000 Venezuelans to leave their country every day, according to the UN. Maduro has said that he is a victim of “economic warfare” waged from Washington; his critics blame the cratering economy on mismanagement. Meanwhile a steady stream of multinationals have withdrawn from Venezuela saying that currency controls and shortages make it impossible to do business in the country. This week, the breakfast cereal maker Kellogg’s announced that it was pulling out because of the “economic and social deterioration in the country.” In the crowd at Valencia, one newfound Falcón supporter, Maricarmen Vidal, said she used to work as a cleaning woman in the house of a middle-class family in Valencia. But to escape the economic meltdown, the family moved abroad and she was thrown out of work. Now, she eeks out a living selling tiny bags of sugar and coffee on a Valencia street corner. Vidal says about the only thing she knows about Falcón is that he’s not Maduro – “but that’s enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-environmental-policy-goves-labour-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:07:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on environmental policy: Gove’s labour lost | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-environmental-policy-goves-labour-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-environmental-policy-goves-labour-lost","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on environmental policy: Gove’s labour lost","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Let’s suppose that Michael Gove is entirely sincere in his desire to improve the countryside and to manage and mitigate, the effects of humans on their environment. He may be. He has announced a number of new and eye-catching measures, most recently an attack on disposable wipes, which will take effect some time in the radiant future he imagines after Brexit; and to a certain kind of romantic middle-aged Tory imagination, Brexit represents a return to the pastoral world of childhood when those white shapes bounding across the meadows were lambs, not plastic bags or wet wipes escaping on the wind. The real question is whether any Conservative can now deliver for the environment. Take the matter of wet wipes. To threaten them is an eye-catching stunt, if the threat was ever real: Defra now says that there is no question of a ban on them. That clarification is less likely to stick in the mind than the idea that at last something is being done to stop the growth of fatbergs and the proliferation of unsightly muck along our riverbanks as well as in our sewers. But it is not surprising that Defra has repudiated any idea of actually banning them. For one thing, such a ban would be immensely unpopular. Even if many of the modern products are frivolous, and strictly speaking unnecessary, others are not frivolous at all. The growth of disposable cleaning cloths has been one of the real improvements that modern life has brought. From disposable nappies through to sanitary products and the wipes now used in hospitals, there is a real demand for these things from almost everyone who has had to use the alternatives. Besides, the industry points out that much of the problem arises not from products which are designed to be flushed but from those which are not but which get flushed anyway. It’s possible that a campaign of labelling alongside a PR campaign and carefully targeted tax rises on ecologically undesirable materials could shift behaviour and this would certainly be a policy worth trying. But it would require coordination and attention to detail. There would have to be carefully targeted regulation. There would need to be a willingness to stand up to consumer pressure. There would, in short, have to be an effective set of bureaucratic procedures of exactly the sort that the Brexiters imagine “freedom from Brussels” would deliver them from. The control we took back would have to be replaced by self-control, and where is the fun in that for a party that believes in deregulation on principle? This is a wider question that goes far beyond the question of wet wipes or even supermarket bags. The present EU regulations have been irksome both for industry and for government. Lawyers have been able to force government action over things like air pollution precisely because they have been appealing to EU standards enforceable in British law. All this will change after 2020, and the regulatory body proposed by Defra is the first example of the kind of structure that the government wants to replace the EU mechanisms. As such it is hugely disappointing. It does not matter whether Mr Gove is sincere and has been defeated by the Treasury, or if he is simply hugging his own huskies in an attempt to detoxify his and his party’s brands. What matters is that the proposed body will not have regulatory teeth. It will advise, but it cannot compel. Anyone can announce grand schemes of environmental improvement and 25-year action plans. What matters is not whether the government now promises to eliminate plastic waste or even hybrid cars by 2040 but whether it can produce reasons for believing that these things will happen. Any sustained and effective programme of environmental protection will be expensive, financially and politically. A willingness, and still more a determination, to ensure that those prices are paid needs to be given institutional expression which is independent of the whims of the party faction in power. Nothing of that sort is visible in Mr Gove’s proposals and without such a guarantee his schemes are as eye-catching, as empty, and as ultimately worthless as a plastic bag drifting out at sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/germany-resists-returning-museum-exhibits-to-ex-colonies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T04:00:19Z","webTitle":"Germany moves slowly on returning museum exhibits to ex-colonies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/germany-resists-returning-museum-exhibits-to-ex-colonies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/germany-resists-returning-museum-exhibits-to-ex-colonies","fields":{"headline":"Germany moves slowly on returning museum exhibits to ex-colonies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Berlin’s longest-standing African is 13 metres tall and carries in his bones the wisdom of 150m years. The skeleton of the Brachiosaurus brancai, the star of the city’s natural history museum, was dug up by a German paleontologist between 1909 and 1913 in Tanzania, then part of the German empire’s largest colony. When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced last November that he wanted to use his presidency to lay the ground for “the temporary or permanent restitution of African patrimony to Africa”, many thought the time had come for the dinosaur to head back home. But, six months later, the Berlin Brachiosaurus is not moving an inch: a sign, activists and historians say, that Merkel’s government is failing to respond to Macron’s call with a similarly bold message, and that German museums are dragging their feet. New guidelines on the restitution of objects from “colonial contexts” were unveiled by the German culture minister, Monika Grütters, on Monday. She accepted the need to re-examine the provenance of objects amassed not just in the three decades in which Germany emulated other European states empire-building on the African continent, but during a colonial period defined as stretching back to the 15th-century conquistadores and into the present day. Grütters said she wanted to continue the politics of remembrance that had had “a great share in shaping Germany’s reputation in the world”. She said: “For too long, the colonial period has been a blind spot in our remembrance culture, and reassessing it is part of our responsibility in Germany towards former colonies.” But while Germany’s first official definition of colonial contexts is surprisingly broad, critics say the bar for restitution claims has been set discouragingly high. The non-binding guidelines state that returning artefacts with a problematic history to their country of origin must not be a “compulsory solution”, and should be considered mainly for objects that violated the “legal and ethical standards” in the former colonies at the time. Eckart Köhne, the director of the German museums association, said of Macron’s appeal: “If that is an appeal that means museum collections should be packed wholesale into a lorry and shipped abroad, then we do not consider that the right way.” Activists have criticised the new document as a clear rejection of the French president’s initiative. “The guidelines are an attempt to preserve vested colonial interests that is doomed to failure”, said Tahir Della of the initiative for black people in Germany (ISD). “Every day, members of the communities of African origin in Africa and here in the diaspora have a better picture of which of their looted treasures lie in the cellars of European museums, and they won’t rest until they have got back what belongs to them.” “German museums need a strong signal from the government,” said Jürgen Zimmerer, a historian of colonialism at Hamburg university who also contributed to the new guidelines. “There needs to be a clear indication of a political will to engage with the colonial period. Without it, the impression prevails that for Germany this is only about money.” Macron’s comments have focused public debate in Germany about the country’s “colonial blindspots” as Berlin prepares for the opening of the controversial Humboldt Forum in 2019, which will unite the city’s ethnographic and Asian art collections in a reconstruction of its Prussian-era palace. On Wednesday, Berlin’s Prussian cultural heritage foundation formally returned nine objects from the city’s collection to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, which represents indigenous peoples from south-western Alaska. A research project had revealed that the artefacts – including two broken masks, a child’s cradle, and a wooden idol – had been removed unlawfully from Alaskan native graves by the Norwegian ethnologist Johan Adrian Jacobsen in the 1880s. More prominent objects in Berlin’s collection, such as the Brachiosaurus brancai, however, are unlikely to be moved by the new restitution drive. The excavation of the colossus from Tanzania’s fossil-rich Tendaguru formation started in 1909, two years after colonial powers in German east Africa had squashed an armed uprising known as the Maji Maji rebellion, resulting in the deaths of 250,000–300,000 people from the local population. But a three-year research project into the conditions of the dig, funded by the German federal ministry for education and research to be published later this year, found that the Brachiosaurus’s bones were dug up under conditions of “fair” pay, without slave labour, said the natural history museum’s director, Johannes Vogel. Vogel told the Guardian that the dinosaur, the tallest mounted skeleton in the world, was not a cash cow for his museum but a live research object that was expensive to maintain. Earlier this month, Tanzania’s foreign minister, Augustine Mahiga, waived demands for the restitution of plundered cultural artefacts from the colonial period. Speaking at a meeting with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, in Dar es Salaam, Mahiga said the dinosaur “does not belong to Germany or Tanzania” but should be considered a piece of world heritage, and praised the museum’s treatment of the remains. “The German taxpayer pays a lot of money to preserve it,” he said. The Tanzanian government is a recipient of German development aid. Instead of restituting the skeleton to Tanzania, Vogel said, the museum was proposing a programme whereby Berlin would help train up Tanzanian palaeontologists and technical workers to explore the large uncharted sections of the Tendaguru formation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/anthony-bourdain-newfies-newfoundland-show-tweet-response-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:30:45Z","webTitle":"Anthony Bourdain show angers Canadians over 'derogatory' nickname","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/anthony-bourdain-newfies-newfoundland-show-tweet-response-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/anthony-bourdain-newfies-newfoundland-show-tweet-response-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Bourdain show angers Canadians over 'derogatory' nickname","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain’s TV show has set off a social media storm after it used a controversial nickname for Newfoundlanders to promote an upcoming show filmed in Canada’s most easterly province. In the lead-up to an episode featuring a visit to Newfoundland and Labrador, the Twitter account for CNN’s Parts Unknown encouraged viewers to “Embrace the Newfies as they are.” The tweet – which has since been deleted – provoked a swift reaction on social media. “Ah, you had me until you called me a Newfie. I find it a derogatory term,” wrote one, while another pointed out that the word is “highly offensive to many here”. Seamus O’Regan, Canada’s minister of veteran affairs, who hails from Newfoundland, also weighed in, writing simply on Twitter: “We don’t like it.” The origin of the word has been linked to Americans, who are believed to have coined it in the 1930s or 40s to imply that Newfoundlanders are unintelligent and lazy, said James Baker, a Newfoundlander and postdoctoral fellow who has delved into the history of the word. “The consensus is that it was something that was created not by Newfoundlanders themselves, but by outside groups to refer to Newfoundlanders in a derogatory manner,” he said. At times the word has made waves nationally; in 2015, the then federal NDP leader, Tom Mulcair, apologised for using it as a synonym for stupid some two decades earlier while speaking in Quebec’s national assembly. CNN’s tweet, however, was embraced by many online. “I sir am a proud ‘Newfie’. I only find the term derogatory when someone means it to be that,” wrote one person. Another noted: “I believe I speak for the vast majority of Newfoundlanders when I say this really wasn’t a big deal.” The show had unwittingly waded into what some described as one of the island’s hot-button topics. “Newfie is one of those words that non-Newfs should avoid. There’s always been the debate here about whether or not it’s offensive. Newfs use it to describe themselves but many don’t like mainlanders using it.” Those behind the Parts Unknown account later apologised. “We regret our use of the word ‘Newfie’ to describe the people of Newfoundland. We apologize for any offense and will stick to Newfoundlanders going forward,” they wrote on Twitter. Soon after they added a tweet aimed at distancing the account from the show’s host. “Tweets on this account are not written or reviewed by Anthony Bourdain,” they wrote. “Once again we apologize.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/manchester-city-raheem-sterling-contract-pep-guardiola","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:41:47Z","webTitle":"Raheem Sterling opens talks with Manchester City over contract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/manchester-city-raheem-sterling-contract-pep-guardiola","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/manchester-city-raheem-sterling-contract-pep-guardiola","fields":{"headline":"Raheem Sterling opens talks with Manchester City over contract","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City have held discussions with Raheem Sterling regarding a new contract, though the expectation is an agreement will not be reached until after the World Cup. It is understood a meeting was held with Sterling’s representatives at the end of last month. With the forward set to be named in Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad, talks may not resume before July. Sterling, who joined City from Liverpool for £44m in the summer of 2015, earns about £170,000 a week on a deal that has two years remaining. The forward is seeking to be one of the champions’ best-paid players and can expect a rise to his basic weekly salary of at least £50,000. City are intent on rewarding the 22-year-old for the most impressive season of his career in which he has scored 23 goals and been a key factor in City winning the title with five matches to spare. Pep Guardiola said: “The club, the chairman [Khaldoon al-Mubarak] and myself want him to stay a long time, renew his contract but we are going on holiday in a few days.” Guardiola also expects Sergio Agüero to stay, though he could not be unequivocal. Asked whether the striker may leave the manager said: “I think it’s not going to happen. My desire is it will not happen but I don’t know … Sergio is going to stay until he decides his time is over.” Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden have each made four Premier League appearances so need to make a fifth in Sunday’s final match at Southampton to get a winner’s medal. “I didn’t know it but, all respect, it looks ridiculous to me,” Guardiola said of the rule. “If they want my medal I will give them the medal. They are champions – they worked from day one to the last one, training with us, in the locker room.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/may/12/alabama-1963-unseen-photographs-civil-rights-montgomery-colin-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T13:13:07Z","webTitle":"Alabama, May 1963: how the Observer captured America’s racial tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/12/alabama-1963-unseen-photographs-civil-rights-montgomery-colin-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/12/alabama-1963-unseen-photographs-civil-rights-montgomery-colin-jones","fields":{"headline":"Alabama, May 1963: how the Observer captured America’s racial tensions","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘It was 1963 and I was in Washington DC. My picture editor at the Observer, Peter Crookston, knew I was in the US on my way to get married in Vancouver, and he sent me a telegram. ‘Get down to Birmingham, Alabama.’ So I did.” Photographer Colin Jones is casting his mind back 55 years, to a time when the slow pace of communications made journalism both simpler and more confusing. “I wasn’t sure what was happening in Alabama. I wasn’t sure what to expect. But I had my cameras with me.” Jones soon discovered he was flying into the cauldron of the civil rights movement just as it was boiling over. That April in 1963 Martin Luther King had written from the city’s jailhouse: “Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.” This was why Birmingham had been selected for the next phase in the struggle for equality. It began with economic boycotts, sit-ins, marches and fruitless attempts to negotiate on the part of African Americans. The response came in the form of bombings, mass arrests, and police and Ku Klux Klan-led violence. Jones, who was 27 at the time, found the segregation shocking, he says: the ubiquitous “no blacks allowed” signs; the extreme poverty of the African American neighbourhoods in contrast to the air-conditioned, whites-only department stores. “I didn’t think America was as bad as this. It was like South Africa during apartheid, which I’d seen.” Days before Jones arrived in Birmingham, the authorities had broken up a protest by schoolchildren with high-pressure fire hoses and attack dogs on the orders of the notorious public safety commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor. Jones’s images record the immediate aftermath – the wreckage of homes destroyed by rioting (with clean washing hanging among the rubble); released protesters emotionally sharing their grievances; the recently bombed AG Gaston Motel (King had stayed there; the home of his brother, AD King, was also bombed the same night); and opposing ranks of African American protesters and white law enforcement – which made for intrinsically dramatic compositions. “I just took as much as I could because I wasn’t 100% sure what was going on,” says Jones. “But you could tell there was something in the air. There was an atmosphere – like something was going to happen. I didn’t see black people being aggressive against the police but the police would have been aggressive to them. They didn’t want to upset the police or give them an excuse to get their batons out.” Neither side objected to being photographed. The police were almost conceited, Jones says, proudly brandishing their weaponry. African Americans on the street (mostly men) often filled him in on what was going on and pointed him in the right direction. They even invited him into a meeting at the 16th Street Baptist Church, the headquarters of the campaign. Less hospitable was Bull Connor, who Jones encountered several times. In fact, it was Connor who found him. “He drove up and he saw that I was white. He wanted to know who I was and where I came from. He was very officious and he clearly ruled the roost. There were columns either side of the road: the black side and the whites. And Connor said to me: ‘If you go and join them [the black side] and if something happens, I won’t hesitate to shoot you.’ ” Jones was not fazed. “I’d been in Vietnam.” Although he did notice that on the back seat of Connor’s car were loose shotgun cartridges. “I should have photographed them.” The Birmingham campaign was not in vain. The media coverage and worldwide shock brought the civil rights issue to the attention of President John Kennedy. In June, he set in motion what came to be the 1964 Civil Rights Act, telling the nation: “The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.” That September, however, in one of the worst atrocities of the era, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church during a Sunday morning service, killing four young girls. Jones would have loved to have gone on following events, he says, but he had places to be, like his wedding in Vancouver. He sent his rolls of film to London without having seen any of his images. Some of them he had never seen at all until his visit to the Observer office last week. “When I first started here, I didn’t know one end of the camera from the other,” he says. His career took him around the world, from Swinging London to Asian poverty, Soviet Russia to Afro-Caribbean immigrants in 1970s London. In Alabama, there was an aspect of “right place, right time”, but Jones’s images seem to convey the whole story, emotionally as well as factually. “People often say you’ve got to have a ‘good eye’,” he says. “But it’s not your eye that takes the pictures, it’s your brain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/stuart-lancaster-england-leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T20:59:11Z","webTitle":"Stuart Lancaster: ‘I would never not want England to do well’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/stuart-lancaster-england-leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/stuart-lancaster-england-leinster-racing-92-champions-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Stuart Lancaster: ‘I would never not want England to do well’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For more than 12 centuries pilgrims have travelled to northern Spain in search of spiritual fulfilment and emotional comfort. Stuart Lancaster has only to alight from Leinster’s team bus at Bilbao’s San Mamés stadium rather than walk the trail to Santiago de Compostela but, after two-and-a-half years, his journey to professional redemption is finally complete. The Champions Cup final against Racing 92 is not just about one man but it is a particularly resonant day for England’s erstwhile coach. The last must-win showpiece games his family attended were in 2015 when England were bowing out of their home World Cup at Twickenham. A big occasion for rugby lovers in Dublin, Paris and the Basque country also marks a personally significant return to the sunlit uplands for Lancaster and his wife, Nina, their two children, parents and friends. Those who assume sacked English coaches simply shrug their shoulders and ease into another highly paid role are oblivious to the stark reality. Cumbrian farmers’ sons never wallow in self pity but even Lancaster’s positivity drained away during 2016 when he was jobless with no clear route back into top-level rugby. This week, in a small room on Dublin’s south side, it all finally came tumbling out. “The main thing was a lack of purpose. Not having a team to coach was really eating away at me, not being able to put anything right and just having to sit there thinking about it. It is very difficult when you are out of work.” But for a series of unexpected coincidences, he might still be in Leeds agonising over what might have been. The first emerged on the eve of the 2016 domestic season when Leinster’s defence coach, Kurt McQuilkin, headed back to New Zealand at short notice because his sister was ill. By sheer luck Lancaster used to play with Simon Easterby, Ireland’s forwards coach, whose brother Guy was the Leinster manager. When Lancaster’s name first came up in the Ireland office, the nearest man across the desk was Andy Farrell, previously a member of his England coaching staff. Even now Lancaster sounds immensely grateful: “If this role hadn’t come up, I don’t know how it would have played out. There was certainly nothing else in the pipeline. There was no time for ‘Am I or am I not good enough to be coaching at this level?’ It was a case of: ‘You’re in because we’re at Glasgow on Friday.’” The existence of direct flights from Leeds to Dublin also avoided having to uproot his two children, Sophie and Dan, from their A-level studies. All those dawn airport dashes through the snow to catch his twice-weekly flights have been worth it. At his first team meeting, Lancaster told the players they could win in Europe – “My opening line was: ‘I think we can do great things here’”– and now they are 80 minutes from doing so for the first time since 2012. Their still-improving squad are increasingly the envy of Europe and the players are glowing about Lancaster’s technical input. Among the believers is their tactical kingpin Johnny Sexton, another instrumental figure in his recruitment. “Johnny texted me and said: ‘Let me know what you need me to do to help get it over the line.’ That is pretty powerful coming from a guy who we’d played against five times with England.” Which begs several tantalising questions. Could it be that Lancaster would make a better international coach now than the less experienced model hired by England after the incident-packed 2011 World Cup campaign in New Zealand? Ireland have already drafted in Farrell and, after 2019, there are likely to be a number of vacancies in all sorts of interesting places. Alternatively – “I really enjoy the day-to-day element of club coaching” – could this most approachable and personable of sporting figures may yet conclude he is naturally more suited to club and provincial team preparation? As things stand, it gives him the same match-day buzz without the managerial distractions that restricted the amount of hands-on coaching he did with England. Wherever he goes next, he has promised not to make that same mistake again. Not being the formal number one – with Leo Cullen the Leinster director of rugby – also does not bother him. “I am quite happy to take on responsibility and decision-making if needs be but I don’t have to be the number one. Wayne Smith is a good example. He was coaching New Zealand, then he went to Northampton, then he came back and worked under Graham Henry. I don’t want to give the impression I wouldn’t want to go back and be a number one at some point but it works at the moment for me. As long as I’ve got a strong role that would be fine.” He does admit that watching England from afar can still be tricky, particularly when a Leinster-heavy Ireland beat his former charges at Twickenham in March. “You can’t help but look and see how the team are doing. You are so invested in it.” Lancaster’s team never lost three championship games on the trot or finished fifth but he remains faithful to the players. “England are still a great team. I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins. I would never not want England to do well, particularly when I know how hard the players worked in 2012-15. What happened in the World Cup hurts them just as much as it hurts me.” Ah, the World Cup. Maybe a Leinster win would alleviate some of the pain that clearly lingers. “Obviously I still look back with huge regret that we didn’t do better. Things didn’t go well for about half an hour of the Wales game and that changed everything.” In a results-based business, the fallout was never going to be pretty. “It’s tough, particularly for my parents, when criticism is coming your way. I would look at other coaches and feel for them because it’s difficult to get back.” All of which makes his family’s presence – minus his daughter who turned 18 this week – in the San Mamés stands all the more special. Despite his protests to the contrary – “It’s more about repaying Leinster than vindication” – one of modern sport’s most heart-warming comeback stories now awaits its conclusion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/know-many-women-suffer-fibroids-uterine-tumours-fka-twigs-not-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T17:25:57Z","webTitle":"The painful truth about fibroids: why FKA twigs is not alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/know-many-women-suffer-fibroids-uterine-tumours-fka-twigs-not-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/11/know-many-women-suffer-fibroids-uterine-tumours-fka-twigs-not-alone","fields":{"headline":"The painful truth about fibroids: why FKA twigs is not alone","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was, said the singer FKA twigs, “a fruit bowl of pain every day”. She likened the size of the fibroids – benign tumours that had been removed from her uterus in December – to fruit: two cooking apples, three kiwis and a couple of strawberries. The nurse, she added, “said that the weight and size was like being six months pregnant”. Her experience, the singer said, was “excruciating at times and, to be honest, I started to doubt if my body would ever feel the same again … I know that a lot of women suffer from fibroid tumours and I just wanted to say after my experience that you are amazing warriors and that you are not alone.” She shared the post on Instagram last week, which was picked up by news organisations around the world – indicating how rare it was for anyone to talk openly about fibroids, even though it is a condition that affects about a third of women at some point in their life. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths of the uterine muscle that develop in or around the uterus. “It’s unusual for them to be painful,” says Dr Virginia Beckett, a consultant gynaecologist and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “Usually, they’re very small and harmless. They can occur either on the outside of the womb, within the muscle wall of the womb or pushing on to the inside of the womb.” Many women will never even know that they have them but, for some, they can cause debilitating pain, bleeding, heavy periods, discomfort during sex and, in some cases, fertility problems. Their cause is unknown, but thought to be linked to oestrogen levels – women of childbearing age are more likely to develop them and they can shrink in women who have been through the menopause. African-Caribbean women are more likely to suffer from larger fibroids that cause symptoms. There is no known way of cutting your risk, says Beckett. “There are no dietary methods or medications and having your baby early or late makes no difference.” A recent all-party parliamentary group on women’s health – which also covered the condition endometriosis – found “unacceptable treatment” for women with fibroids. It reported that 42% of women said they were not treated with “dignity and respect” and nearly half were not told about the short- or long-term side effects of treatment. It found that 12% of women took up to two years even to be treated for their fibroids. One woman told the survey she had been told by her gynaecologist that there was only one treatment option. “I was only offered a hysterectomy and only through my own online research did I discover the other options out there. I had to ask for these other treatments,” she said. Another respondent said her symptoms were ignored. “Far too often, women put up with symptoms and incredible pain because they are not aware of what is ‘normal’ and they feel stigmatised by talking about ‘women’s problems’,” said the report. Bridgette York, a solicitor who founded the Fibroid Network patient and campaign group, was diagnosed with fibroids when she was in her mid-20s. She says that, at the time, some 20 years ago, women – even young women who hadn’t had children – were being pushed towards unnecessary hysterectomies. “It was very distressing emotionally and people weren’t talking about it,” says York. After doing lots of research, she was treated nine years after the diagnosis with a myomectomy, which removed the fibroids but kept her womb intact. She had four fibroids removed, with one measuring 33cm (13in) across and the largest weighing 5kg (11lb). York recovered well and went on to have twins. One of her concerns now is the number of women who are offered medication to treat symptoms rather than a cure. Some drugs also act as contraceptives and are often prescribed to women in their 20s and 30s who may not be aware that it may delay their ability to conceive once they come off it. Medication can be useful for some women, but York says there are safety and efficacy concerns. She points to the drug Esmya (ulipristal acetate) – in February, the Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency informed medical professionals that it was the subject of a new EU safety review after several women suffered serious liver damage while taking it. The agency ruled that it should not be prescribed to new patients and that liver function should be tested once a month for women already on it. “We’re concerned that women are not being given all of the options, and not being given informed choice, and that drugs [might not] have as much effect as they think it might do, especially if they have large fibroids,” says York. The all-party parliamentary report found that 70% of women were told about hysterectomy, with 38% undergoing one. However, in many cases, fibroids can be treated with less extreme surgery, but also non-surgical interventions such as uterine fibroid embolisation, which is carried out by a radiologist who essentially blocks the blood vessels “feeding” the fibroid. Woodruff Walker, a pioneer of uterine fibroid embolisation, says not enough women are being told about the treatment by gynaecologists, either because they are not familiar with it or because it is not something they offer. “For about 25% of patients who come to me, who have fought their way through the system, embolisation is not mentioned by their gynaecologist as an option.” There are also newer treatments involving laser or ultrasound to destroy the fibroid, but the NHS points out that “the long-term benefits and risks are unknown”. “We do have some medical therapies, but they’re not useful for very large fibroids,” says Beckett. For large fibroids, she explains, “you would probably offer a hysterectomy. You can do open surgery to remove the fibroids and leave the womb, but that can be quite complicated. You can remove smaller ones laparascopically [through a small incision]. You can do minimally invasive techniques to interfere with the blood supply of the fibroid [such as embolisation] and, if they are impinging on the lining of the womb, you can remove them through a camera that goes into the womb through the cervix.” Embolisation “is not extremely widely available and there are some disadvantages to it. You can get quite significant pain afterwards and the data on fertility is not very well established. The data is much more established with traditional surgical methods,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/burnley-bournemouth-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:23:16Z","webTitle":"Burnley v Bournemouth: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/burnley-bournemouth-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/burnley-bournemouth-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Burnley v Bournemouth: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Burnley are looking for their first win in five matches, against Bournemouth, but no one really cares about that at Turf Moor.

And act more stupidly he then did. He began by embracing Donald Trump as “a brother” and ended by suggesting slavery had been a “choice”. The backlash was swift. From 50 Cent to Spike Lee to Roxane Gay, celebrities, scholars and seemingly half of Twitter pushed back, pointing out the imbecilic character of West’s comments on slavery. Not only had savage force been used to capture, transport and maintain transatlantic slaves, but, despite the brutality, slaves had constantly rebelled against their condition, heroically and at great cost. But if West’s claims were idiotic, much of the response was equally so. The problem for many critics was not just what West said, but also that he was a black man saying it. His was an act of betrayal of the black community, indeed of his very blackness. This argument was made most elegantly, and brutally, by the essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates. In an acerbic tear-down titled I’m not black, I’m Kanye, Coates recalled his mother’s response to Michael Jackson. He “was dying to be white”, she observed; he was “erasing himself, so that we would forget that he had once been Africa beautiful and Africa brown”. Thirty years on, Coates has a similar response to West. Black music, he argues, is inextricably linked with black history and community. And West, like Jackson, is attempting to escape that history and community, to be not-black. West champions “a white freedom”, a “freedom to be proud and ignorant”. And, writes Coates, all blacks “suffer for this, because we are connected”. Many on the left have long seen rightwing black or gay people or women as traitors to the cause. There is something disturbing in this claim that there is a right way of thinking for oppressed peoples and that those who dissent are committing betrayal. It is a way of thinking about race, community and heresy that has deep, reactionary roots. “Traitors” is how Islamists describe liberal Muslims. It is how the apartheid government in South Africa explained white anti-apartheid activists. And it is the label that the far right has long hung upon white anti-racists. Thomas Mair, who murdered Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, saw her as a “collaborator”. “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain,” he declared at his trial. It may be comforting to imagine that if black people are being reactionary, then they are not really black, or at least they are attempting to escape being black, by espousing “white” ideas of freedom. But is it really less reactionary to imagine that ideas come colour-coded than it is to claim that slavery was a choice? Or any more progressive to insist that West is not black because he backs Donald Trump than it is to see Trump as a “brother”? While some denounced West as a traitor, others insisted that whites should butt out of the debate. “If you think that you get to criticise black people for selling out to the system of anti-blackness that you as a non-black person benefit from and help maintain,” wrote Ijeoma Oluo, a Seattle-based writer, “you need to check your privilege and be quiet for a while.” Whites, she added, should “stay in your own lane”. This, too, is an old racist trope. “As a person of colour,” critic David Dennis wrote in a 2013 essay on West, “I’ve been told repeatedly to ‘stay in my lane’. From something as simple as being followed around my neighbourhood by police to my profession, where I’ve been told to stick to writing about ‘black stuff’ and leave the ‘real news’ to white writers.” Where racists patrol the streets and the workplace to ensure black people know their place, a new class of “anti-racists” seek to police public debates to ensure that only the right people speak and only the right things get said. Segregation of public debate in the name of “anti-racism” – and that is what the demand to “stay in your lane” amounts to – is no more progressive than the racist segregation of social space. Any struggle against injustice requires us to get out of our lanes, to insist on the right, whoever one may be, to speak as we see fit, against every wrong. As Kanye West and many of his critics have shown over the past weeks, there is more than one way of being reactionary. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/11/cheer-up-theres-a-royal-wedding-coming-up","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:00:48Z","webTitle":"Cheer up, there’s a royal wedding coming | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/cheer-up-theres-a-royal-wedding-coming-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/cheer-up-theres-a-royal-wedding-coming-up","fields":{"headline":"Cheer up, there’s a royal wedding coming","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Whatever your views on the monarchy, it would be a bad idea for republicans to hold protests near the wedding of Prince Harry and Megan Markle (Report, 5 May).

Leave.EU, backed by the outspoken Ukip donor Arron Banks, was one of several pro-Brexit campaign groups founded to fight the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, it failed in its attempt to be named the official campaign for Brexit by the Electoral Commission. This designation instead went to the rival Vote Leave group, which was allowed to spend up to £7m during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. This meant Leave.EU was reduced to being a second-tier campaign group, legally allowed to spend just £700,000 during the referendum campaign. Following a lengthy investigation the Electoral Commission has concluded Leave.EU broke this reduced spending limit by at least £70,000 and possibly substantially more. This was largely as a result of paying substantial sums to a US political consultant, Gerry Gunster, who later introduced Banks to Donald Trump at an impromptu meeting at Trump Tower in late 2016. The Electoral Commission also concluded that Banks incorrectly declared £6m worth of loans he made to the campaign group, that appropriate receipts had not been kept, and that the campaign’s chief executive, Liz Bilney, may have “knowingly or recklessly” signed an inaccurate spending return. How is Leave.EU being punished? Leave.EU’s punishment for spending too much money in the EU referendum is to have to spend a bit more now. The Electoral Commission has fined the campaign organisation a total of £70,000 for failures in its declaration, with the regulator noting the level of penalties “has been constrained by the cap on the commission’s fines”. The punishment could prompt calls for a review of election funding law, given it is relatively small for a campaign that also spent millions of pounds in the unregulated pre-referendum period. There may be a worse outcome for Bilney, a business associate of Banks who served as Leave.EU’s official campaign chief. She has been reported to the Metropolitan police for a potential criminal investigation into whether she made a false declaration on the spending return. Did the Electoral Commission find any links between Leave.EU and the activities of Cambridge Analytica? Banks has always maintained that, while they initially attempted to hire Cambridge Analytica, this plan was dropped when Leave.EU failed to be designated as the lead Brexit group, meaning the data targeting business never actually worked on the referendum campaign. The Electoral Commission’s report largely bears this out, concluding that Leave.EU was largely bluffing about its use of Cambridge Analytica, in an attempt to make its campaign look more sophisticated. The report also suggests that the Cambridge Analytica boss, Alexander Nix, overstated his company’s association with Leave.EU in public, in the hope of winning business from the campaign group. The investigation states that despite public statements by the organisations involved there is no evidence that Cambridge Analytica had input into the Leave.EU campaign during the regulated period and “the relationship did not develop beyond initial scoping work”. Instead, the data targeting company privately asked Leave.EU to stop using its name in public, fearing the association could cause it reputational damage. However, the commission pledged to keep this aspect of the investigation under review in case further evidence about Cambridge Analytica comes to light. Will this stop Brexit? Almost certainly not, given it is the key policy of Theresa May’s government, although it could prompt a reform of campaign finance laws. MPs are increasingly aware that is is difficult to find appropriate punishment for breaking electoral spending laws once an election result has been declared and accepted by the public. Pro-Brexit MPs have also accused remain campaign groups of colluding to evade spending limits, although the Electoral Commission declined to investigate. Meanwhile, the official Vote Leave campaign group is facing a separate ongoing investigation into whether it broke its own £7m spending limit by channelling substantial sums of money to a fashion student during the final days of the campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-national-picture-overwhelming-reminder-of-wilful-gaps-in-australias-history","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T01:59:24Z","webTitle":"The National Picture: overwhelming reminder of wilful gaps in Australia's history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-national-picture-overwhelming-reminder-of-wilful-gaps-in-australias-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-national-picture-overwhelming-reminder-of-wilful-gaps-in-australias-history","fields":{"headline":"The National Picture: overwhelming reminder of wilful gaps in Australia's history","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Interrogating Australia’s missing history – all of those events around the colonial frontier that so many of us never heard about at school or read of in the history texts that supposedly guided us – is a fraught but critical responsibility of our leading cultural institutions. The National Gallery of Australia, no stranger to telling the stories of frontier war – most recently in last year’s third annual Indigenous art triennial, Defying Empire – has taken a welcome and courageous step with The National Picture: the art of Tasmania’s Black War. Curated by Tim Bonyhady and Greg Lehman, it’s an understatement to call this exhibition innovative. The National Picture, which interrogates the at-best patchy visual record of the Black War and genocide of 1820s van Diemen’s Land, is audacious on both an intellectual and curatorial level, and provocative beyond comfort even for those more conversant with the darkest episodes of Australian history. The National Picture speaks truth to ignorance. But it also bellows it to political power at such a critical national moment, a moment when we have a federal government that is wilfully deaf to the voices of Indigenous Australians demanding honesty about the past. I’ve never wept in an art exhibition before. But when I stood before four portraits of Indigenous Tasmanians including Trucanini – paintings that were purchased from their creator, free settler Benjamin Duterrau, by a colonial government in 1837 to commemorate the Aboriginal people it had set about exterminating – the emotion was unanticipated and overwhelming. The story of our nationhood has long been incomplete. Historians and writers of all genres have steadily been filling the gaps, attempting to document how the land was stolen and its original inhabitants violently dispossessed after 60,000-plus years of habitation, their culture appropriated and the country renamed. Now The National Picture steps into a yawning gap, interrogating the visual record of the colonial artists who worked in the place we now know as Tasmania during the black war, to tell of the profound impact of policies that reduced an Indigenous population of around 6,000 at the turn of the 19th century, to a few hundred within a generation. The exhibition takes its name from a painting by Duterrau that has long been missing. Duterrau’s A National Picture was his intended magnum opus, the culmination of his project to retrospectively depict the removal of the black war’s survivors to island missions by the so-called “protector” and peacemaker George Augustus Robinson. This picture vanished, like so much of our history – although some like Lehman hold out hope, as some might for the Thylacine, for its rediscovery. But its creation has compelled curators Bonyhady and Lehman to assemble the art of its milieu, to show us how white eyes regarded the war and the attempted extermination of Tasmania’s Indigenes. Rarely until the 1930s did colonial artists depict the Tasmanians, focusing instead on those of New South Wales. And when they finally did, they paid little attention to the conflict itself, instead focusing heavily on ethnographic depictions of either the last of the “wild” Indigenes or those they regarded as the “missionised” Aboriginal people. The missing element of the story is exemplified nowhere more starkly, perhaps, than in Thomas Bock’s portrait of Togerlongerter, one of those the authorities regarded as being among the last of the “wild” warriors. As I look at the portrait Bonyhady explains that Togerlongerter lost an arm during the war. Yet the picture doesn’t convey this injury. “The question is whether the artist was sparing us that detail to dignify the subject – or to avoid detailing the truth of the conflict. It is open to interpretation,” Bonyhady says. It is possible, of course, to interpret this with less generosity, and to ask if the missing arm might serve as a metaphor – like Duterrau’s A National Picture itself – for all that intentionally wasn’t portrayed explicitly. And so with a knowledge of these omissions, you can regard Duterrau’s large paintings of Trucanini and three others, once hung in the colony’s legislative assembly, as portraits of survivors of so much that is adequately recorded only in Indigenous recollection, bequeathed by oral history. Of his own part in governor George Arthur’s program to purge the island of its Indigenes, Robinson wrote: “The system adopted towards the Aboriginal inhabitants is, I believe, quite unique ... history does not furnish an instance where a whole nation has been removed by so mild and human a policy.” In the exhibition catalogue – a meticulous and beautiful treasury of the years of scholarship behind the exhibition – Lehman observes that “this was the kindest genocide ever conceived”. A centrepiece of the exhibition is Duterrau’s The Conciliation (1840), a depiction of the “capture” of the last group of “wild” blacks by Robinson in 1832. In January 1832, the Colonial Times reported: “On Saturday last the twenty-six Aborigines captured by Mr Robinson, marched into town ... arrayed in battle order, each male carrying three spears of 12 to 15 feet long in the left hand, and only one in the right. As they continued advancing they shrieked their war song, and if report says true, the view with which they were induced to accompany Mr Robinson was that they should seek redress from the governor.” It is one of Australia’s best known colonial paintings. Yet The National Picture illustrates just how inadequately the writers of so much colonial history may have scrutinised it. Lehman writes how a “closer analysis ... casts doubt on the assumption that Duterrau’s history painting was intended to be a simple commemoration of an equitable treaty, or a celebration of ‘benevolent heroism’”. Indeed, the painting is rich with symbolism and allegory, adding a complexity and empathetic insight to Duterrau’s observance. A kangaroo stands vulnerably, in easy reach of a hunting dog, itself an icon of trust and loyalty, while all but the warrior shaking Robinson’s hand continue to wear their necklaces. Could these adornments represent the Tasmanians’ culture and how it would be forgone with capitulation? In her introduction to the catalogue, Franchesca Cubillo, a Larrakia, Bardi, Wardaman and Yanuwa woman and NGA curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art, writes how we should “look beyond these depictions of predominantly anonymous Aboriginal figures” and draw on other records to understand the terrible events in Tasmania. “We must also consider Aboriginal oral history and contemporary Tasmanian Aboriginal responses to this imagery so as to reinstate a more accurate picture of what was occurring.” The exhibition incorporates the work of contemporary Indigenous artists – including Julie Gough, Ricky Maynard, Gordon Bennett and Marlene Gilson – as a response to the colonial painters with their capacities to avoid the most critical subjects or, like the renowned John Glover, to incorporate Indigenous people as “staffage” – incidental figures – in the landscape.” “It’s a very emotional story. When I look at the exhibition I see many paintings, but of course what I see more than anything else are the individuals,” Cubillo says. And we can only wonder at their stories, still missing amid so much of the history, just like A National Picture by Duterrau, or the Thylacine. • The National Picture is showing at the National Gallery in Canberra until 29 July 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists-facing-3-years-in-jail-over-unlawful-assembly","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T10:29:30Z","webTitle":"Hong Kong democracy activists facing three years in jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists-facing-3-years-in-jail-over-unlawful-assembly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists-facing-3-years-in-jail-over-unlawful-assembly","fields":{"headline":"Hong Kong democracy activists facing three years in jail","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Hong Kong court has found two former pro-independence lawmakers guilty of unlawful assembly for attempting to force their way into a legislative meeting in 2016. Yau Wai-Ching, 31 and Sixtus “Baggio” Leung, 26, of the Youngspiration party tried to enter a legislative council on 2 November 2016 to take their oaths as legislators, in a chaotic episode that has been a rallying point for Hong Kong’s fledgling pro-democracy movement. Yau, Leung and three assistants who accompanied them could face up to three years in prison, according to Hong Kong’s public order ordinance. They have been granted bail until 4 June when the court will hand down their sentences. When trying to enter the legislative meeting in November, the group clashed with security guards. At the time, Yau and Leung had been banned from such meetings and were facing judicial review after staging an anti-China protest at a previous swearing in ceremony in October. Yau and Leung had unfurled banners that said “Hong Kong is not China” and changed the text of their oaths to swear allegiance to “Hong Kong nation.” Their case has raised concerns over Beijing’s tightening hold over the city, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese control in 1997. Universities have advised students not to participate in pro-independence activities. Other pro-democracy lawmakers have been disqualified. After their protest in October, Beijing issued an interpretation of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, maintaining that oaths must be read out “accurately, completely, and solemnly”. Hong Kong’s high court in mid November declared Yau and Leung’s oaths invalid, disqualifying them from serving as legislators. Yau and Leung have said that they were still lawmakers at the time of the 2 November meeting and should have been allowed to enter the legislative council. Acting Kowloon city magistrate Wong Sze-lai said the case was about order and not legislative affairs. “Even if they are Legislative Council members, [they can’t] use that as an amulet to commit criminal behaviour,” she said, according to the South China Morning Post. The two have previously said they would appeal the verdict if found guilty. In a Facebook post on Thursday Yau wrote, “Whatever the verdict tomorrow, don’t forget your goals and principles. Everyone’s path is different. Time will one day judge that we are on side of victory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/12/coalition-could-take-queensland-seat-from-labor-at-byelection-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T22:02:43Z","webTitle":"Coalition could take Queensland seat from Labor at byelection, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/12/coalition-could-take-queensland-seat-from-labor-at-byelection-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/12/coalition-could-take-queensland-seat-from-labor-at-byelection-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Coalition could take Queensland seat from Labor at byelection, poll shows","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New polling shows the Turnbull government could take the marginal Queensland seat of Longman from Labor at the looming byelection triggered by the dual citizenship fiasco, with the One Nation vote sitting on 15%. A new ReachTel survey of 1,277 residents across the federal electorate of Longman taken on Thursday night has the LNP polling ahead of Labor on two party preferred terms 53% to 47%. But the research, funded by The Australia Institute, also suggests the Turnbull government’s proposal to cut tax for Australia’s biggest businesses is unpopular, with only 17% endorsement. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A majority of respondents (53.7%) believe the third phase of the income tax cuts proposed by the Turnbull government, to flatten the tax rate on incomes between $41,000 and $200,000, is unfair. Voters were asked whether they supported or opposed tax cuts delivering an average of $530 a year extra for low and middle income earners in the first four years, and tax cuts for high income earners in seven years time. More Longman voters opposed the measure (47.3%) than supported it (38.3%). Consistent with a Guardian Essential poll published the day before the budget, more people supported funding for service delivery (43.5%) than tax cuts (19.2%), with 28.8% saying revenue should be used to decrease debt and pay back the deficit. Only 1.9% of the sample nominate tax cuts for corporations as a priority. The Labor incumbent in Longman Susan Lamb resigned on Wednesday following the high court’s ruling in the Katy Gallagher case. The ruling triggered a super Saturday of byelections which is looming as a mini-election and has been called a referendum on the tax policies of the major parties. It would be a significant upset if the LNP snatched back the seat because a government has not taken a seat from the opposition at a byelection for a century. The resignations this week have triggered contests in Longman, the Tasmanian seat of Braddon, the South Australian seat of Mayo and the Western Australian seat of Fremantle. There will also be a byelection in the seat of Perth, because of the resignation of the Labor MP Tim Hammond for family reasons. Given the contests will stretch party resources in the run up to a federal election, the Liberals are highly unlikely to run in Fremantle, which will be a Labor/Green contest, and may not run in the seat of Perth either. The Liberals are in the process of preselecting candidates for Longman, Braddon and Mayo. The Labor incumbents will defend their seats, as will the Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie, who resigned on Friday. Sharkie is the most likely casualty from the upcoming super Saturday of byelections triggered by the latest wave of dual citizenship resignations, analysts have said. Sharkie won the formerly safe Liberal seat in the Adelaide Hills on preferences in 2016, with the help of an unpopular opponent in former MP Jamie Briggs and the once-powerful campaign clout of then senator Nick Xenophon. This time, she is likely to face a well-known name in Georgina Downer, daughter of former foreign minister Alexander Downer who held the seat from 1984 to 2008. While Sharkie is regarded as a very attentive local member, Xenophon’s political cachet has dwindled since the colossal loss of SA Best at the March state election. Sharkie’s party has been rebadged from the Nick Xenophon Team to the Centre Alliance, but Flinders University associate professor of politics, Haydon Manning, whose wife ran for SA Best in the state election, said volunteers and donors felt burnt by the recent loss. “[Sharkie] doesn’t have the money, she doesn’t have the database,” Manning said. “But she has been the incumbent for two odd years, she has worked tirelessly, she has got good demeanor, and she is a person that this seat has not had, in that she is focused on the community.” Internal Liberal party polling in Tasmania suggested the Coalition was in front in Braddon 53-47, but Tasmanian election analyst Kevin Bonham said it was based on an “utterly woeful” sample size and should be dismissed. Braddon has a history of swapping sides and has not been held for more than two consecutive terms since 1998. Labor’s Justine Keay won it in 2016 and has a 2.2% margin. Bonham said he expected Labor would retain all four of its seats, failing a catastrophic campaign mistake on behalf of one of its candidates, or a superstar candidate from the Liberal Party. “If they lose any of them it will be too embarrassing for words,” he said. He said Longman, which Lamb won from the LNP’s Wyatt Roy in 2016 on an 0.8% margin, was the most at-risk Labor seat. Bonham added that Lamb was the most likely to get a sympathy vote over her inability to revoke her UK citizenship. One Nation has named controversial former state candidate Matthew Stephen as its pick for the electorate, and has said it will not preference Labor. “In the state election, Labor put me last and that’s exactly where I’d like to see them on my ballot paper,” Stephen told the Australian. ALP resources in Western Australia are expected to focus on Perth. Preselection is likely to go to WA Labor state secretary Patrick Gorman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/11/royal-wedding-pub-washington-dc-pop-up","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:21:39Z","webTitle":"Markle Sparkle, anyone?

Royal wedding bar pops up in Washington","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Beatles are being blasted over the pub’s loudspeaker, and the boisterous bar crowd are enjoying “Markle Sparkle” cocktails. The walls are adorned with pink and white floral arrangements – and the kitchen is being guarded by a statue of a Beefeater, the ceremonial guards more often spotted protecting the Tower of London. This is the Royal Wedding Pub, a pop-up bar in Washington DC that has been created to capture excitement about the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, an American actor, on 19 May. “I hate to use cliches, but it’s like that fairytale thing where the commoner girl meets the prince,” says Megan Biggins, a local resident who along with three of her friends has donned a fascinator hat for the outing to the pub. It has already drawn hundreds of patrons each evening since its official launch earlier this month, with the most devoted willing to queue up, sometimes for hours. The temporary venue has a fan-vaulted ceiling and stained glass, modeled after St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Prince Harry was christened and will marry his bride. The Royal Wedding Pub is the latest creation by Drink Company, a group behind other viral pop-ups that included pubs inspired by Game of Thrones and Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival. The “Markle Sparkle” is one of the most popular drinks – a twist on an Aperol spritz with rose cider and edible glitter. Twiglets are among the snacks. “She’s the first American princess. We’ve got to pay homage to her,” says Matt Fox, the special projects director at Drink Company. Paul Taylor, the company’s head of bar concepts, says the team dove “down the rabbit hole” to get every detail right. “The names of the cocktails are important, the ingredients are important, the glassware is important,” he says. The “When Harry Met Meghan” cocktail is served in a royal wedding collector’s mug. The scotch-based drink is made with ginger, a cheeky reference to Prince Harry’s hair, and banana. The latter, Taylor says, is a favorite of the couple’s. With drink in hand, visitors congregate inside a recreation of the Buckingham Palace throne room, replete with red and gold curtains. Pub-goers wrap themselves in a red velvet robe and pose for pictures with a stuffed corgi, as cardboard cutouts of Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Queen Elizabeth herself flank the two thrones. The Royal Wedding Pub has drawn a range of patrons, most of them young women, from self-confessed anglophiles to fans of the Netflix series The Crown. Some simply want to see what all the fuss is about. Pamela Boundy is the embodiment of an American aficionado of the royal family, holding court at the corner of the bar in a gold paper crown that comes as a keepsake with a cocktail aptly named God Save the Queen. A resident of Midland, Michigan, she is visiting her daughter in Washington and is planning a watch party at her home for the royal nuptials at 4.30am local time in DC. “We have a red carpet and everybody dresses up for the occasion,” says Boundy. “My husband dresses up in a tuxedo and plays the butler. We serve an English breakfast and clotted cream.” The family hosted a similar affair when Prince William wed Kate Middleton, but the idea of an American princess has ramped up their excitement. “It’s about time,” Boundy says. On the big day itself, when Prince Harry and Markle are to officially wed, the Royal Wedding Pub plans to open doors first thing in the morning for a watch party. All of the day’s proceeds will go to the Invictus Games Foundation, the international sporting event founded by Prince Harry for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women. One thing US TV viewers of the wedding apparently won’t see, though, is Donald Trump or Barack Obama – who is friends with Prince Harry – attending the event, after it emerged there would be no official political invitations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/11/theresa-may-sets-up-cabinet-teams-to-thrash-out-customs-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T23:23:10Z","webTitle":"Theresa May sets up cabinet teams to thrash out rival customs plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/theresa-may-sets-up-cabinet-teams-to-thrash-out-customs-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/11/theresa-may-sets-up-cabinet-teams-to-thrash-out-customs-plan","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May sets up cabinet teams to thrash out rival customs plans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has divided her cabinet into two groups to fight out their differences over Britain’s post-Brexit customs arrangements, intensifying speculation that she is preparing to delay her decision on the issue. No 10 sources confirmed that the prime minister had formed the working groups, which would report back on her preferred customs partnership model and the maximum-facilitation option at next Tuesday’s meeting of her inner Brexit cabinet. Her senior ministers are split over how Britain should manage its customs arrangements with the European Union after it leaves the bloc, with the issue threatening to divide the cabinet and the Tory party itself. One group will focus on the customs partnership plan, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU – until now Downing Street’s favourite option, but dismissed this week by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as “crazy” and unworkable. The group will include Brexiters Liam Fox and Michael Gove, along with leading remainer David Lidington, the minister for the Cabinet Office. The Brexiters’ preferred “max-fac” proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks, will be studied by remainers Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, along with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, a key leave supporter. Downing Street insiders suggested that each group of ministers had been picked for their relevant departmental responsibilities, rather than to give each proposal a “going over” by opponents. Neither Johnson nor the chancellor, Philip Hammond, were included in the working groups, with cabinet sources suggesting that they were considered to be the “ultras” on each side, meaning their involvement could have made discussions difficult. The ministers only have until Tuesday to examine their options, with civil servants’ support, leaving them little time to focus on detail. This has increased the likelihood that each team will conclude both options need yet more work. Whitehall officials believe they can persuade Brussels that a redrafted version of May’s preferred plan is workable, despite EU negotiators previously describing it as “magical thinking”. Cabinet sources claimed that few ministers were likely to shift from their established positions on post-Brexit customs arrangements. Fox is understood to be immovable over his opposition to the customs partnership, while friends of Davis have suggested he could quit over the issue. However, one senior Whitehall insider suggested the move could give the prime minister a “dignified way out” from her customs partnership plan, which has infuriated hard Brexiters who see it as a way of keeping the door open to staying in the customs union. One cabinet minister told the Guardian: “The prime minister wants to find a way through this that keeps the party together. Her instinct is to stick as closely to the status quo as she can get away with. “We’ll end up with a fudge on the customs union just so we can say we’ve delivered Brexit. She just wants to kick any decisions down the road for as long as she can.” A No 10 insider added: “We want to get the right solution. This will help”. It came as Labour accused the government of “effectively subverting democracy” after an announcement of coming government business made no mention of any major Brexit-related legislation to be debated in the House of Commons. Announcing the Commons schedule for the next fortnight, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, gave no timings for the return of the EU withdrawal bill from the Lords, or any news on three other key Brexit-connected bills. The inaction will reinforce the sense of a government gridlocked over the Brexit process, with no agreement in cabinet over a future customs deal with the EU, and speculation ministers might seek to delay decisions still further. This has prompted speculation that a transition period could be extended, in part to allow more time for a new customs arrangement. On Thursday, Nick Timothy, May’s former joint chief of staff, argued that this could happen, an idea immediately rejected by Downing Street. The further delays on Brexit legislation reinforces the belief that ministers hope to avoid any Commons defeats by putting off any big decisions by MPs until the government has finalised its strategy for exiting the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/11/anne-alys-citizenship-questioned-as-crisis-rolls-on","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T04:36:25Z","webTitle":"Anne Aly produces letter from Egyptian embassy clarifying citizenship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/11/anne-alys-citizenship-questioned-as-crisis-rolls-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/11/anne-alys-citizenship-questioned-as-crisis-rolls-on","fields":{"headline":"Anne Aly produces letter from Egyptian embassy clarifying citizenship","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Labor MP Anne Aly has produced a letter from the Egyptian embassy stating she renounced her dual-citizenship two days before the 2016 election was called, after fresh questions were raised about her eligibility to sit in parliament. According to the letter, Aly only had Australian citizenship when she nominated for the election and was therefore validly elected to federal parliament. Aly was forced to seek clarification from the Egyptian embassy on Friday after attention was drawn to her eligibility, with The Australian suggesting her individual situation bore similarities to Labor senator Katy Gallagher’s. The high court ruled unanimously this week that Gallagher was ineligible to sit in parliament, which set off a chain of resignations from four MPs, including three from Labor. Labor and the Coalition are now preparing for a “super Saturday” string of byelections in four states that will be crucial to the next federal election, including Queensland and Western Australia. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon On Friday Aly produced a document dated 11 May 2018, from the Egyptian embassy declaring she renounced her citizenship on 6 May 2016, and that “nothing further needed to be done to make her renunciation effective.” “In addition, according to the Egyptian Law Article 16 of Law Number 26 issued (in) 1975, that any Egyptian who obtains another Nationality without permission will lose his/her Egyptian Nationality by default,” the letter said. It meant Aly received confirmation of her renunciation two days before Malcolm Turnbull called the election on 8 May 2016. Writs for the election were issued on 16 May, and nominations closed on 9 June. Questions were raised about Aly’s eligibility because, according to the citizenship registry which was established in December, she sent an official request for cancellation of her Egyptian citizenship on 4 May 2016, a month before nominations closed, but she did not produce a letter confirming if or when that request was met. Labor’s leader, Bill Shorten, asked Aly to reconfirm the advice she had received from the Egyptian embassy. When asked if Labor would release that advice, Shorten said: “I think she’ll have to make that public.” Malcolm Turnbull then called on Aly to provide proof she was not a citizen of Egypt when she nominated for the election. He reminded voters, during a press conference in Sydney, that Shorten had repeatedly claimed last year that Labor’s vetting processes for its MPs were better than the Coalition’s but he had been proven wrong. “Now we have Dr Aly ... who Mr Shorten has assured us is eligible to sit in the parliament,” Turnbull said on Friday. “She has to provide proof that she was not a citizen of another country at the time she nominated for parliament.” Aly told Sky News she attained Australian citizenship when she was a child, but she contacted the Egyptian embassy again on Friday to put voters’ minds at ease. “I understand that the Australian people need clarity on this, particularly after the recent high court rulings, and I’m very happy to comply with that clarity,” she said. “I think this lays [the issue] to rest once and for all.” On Wednesday the high court unanimously held that Gallagher was ineligible to sit in parliament because she had failed to renounce her British citizenship by the nomination deadline for the 2016 election. In Gallagher’s case, the court adopted a strict approach to the constitutional bar on foreign citizens sitting in parliament, clarifying that taking “all steps reasonably required” to renounce foreign citizenship was only a defence where foreign law “irremediably prevents” the Australian citizen from doing so. That would require an “insurmountable obstacle” to renouncing foreign citizenship, five justices said in a joint decision. The court held there was no such irremediable impediment for Gallagher and found that the requirements of UK law could not be described as onerous. Three Labor MPs – Josh Wilson (Fremantle, WA), Justine Keay (Braddon, Tasmania) and Susan Lamb (Longman, Queensland), as well as the Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie (Mayo, South Australia) resigned within hours, accepting the Gallagher case as a precedent because they had relied on the same defence. All their electorates except Fremantle are marginal seats, setting Labor a task to hold Longman and Braddon and giving an opportunity to the Liberal party to retake Sharkie’s seat of Mayo. Shorten must also defend the seat of Perth after the frontbench MP Tim Hammond’s resignation, which comes into effect on Friday along with the other MPs. Aly holds the WA seat of Cowan on a 0.7% margin. At the 2016 election she won the seat with a 5.2% swing. Shorten said he was confident Labor would win every byelection coming up – the date has not been announced – and dared Malcolm Turnbull to run Liberal candidates against Labor. “I’m curious if Mr Turnbull is even going to run candidates in every seat where there’s a byelection, he hasn’t actually told us that,” he said. “I’m going to see if he’s too chicken to turn and put his miserly tax cuts against my better tax cuts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/11/nude-modigliani-painting-expected-to-fetch-150m-at-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T11:36:44Z","webTitle":"Nude Modigliani painting expected to fetch $150m at auction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/11/nude-modigliani-painting-expected-to-fetch-150m-at-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/11/nude-modigliani-painting-expected-to-fetch-150m-at-auction","fields":{"headline":"Nude Modigliani painting expected to fetch $150m at auction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When it was first exhibited in Paris in 1917, Amedeo Modigliani’s female nude Nu couché (sur le côté gauche) caused such a stir that the police were called and the gallerist was accused of outraging public decency. On Monday it is expected to sell for more than $150m (£111m), becoming one of the most expensive paintings ever and helping push auction sales this fortnight to more than $2bn as the world’s wealthy splash out on masterpieces for their private museums. The pre-sale estimate is a record. Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi, which sold for $450m in November, had a pre-sale estimate of $100m. The Modigliani sale, at Sotheby’s in New York, will generate a huge profit for the Irish thoroughbred stud owner John Magnier, who bought the piece from the Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn for $26.9m in 2003. Simon Shaw, the co-head of Sotheby’s impressionist and modern art department, said the increase in the painting’s value “reflects the growing love of Modigliani’s work and the significance of this piece in his oeuvre”. He added: “It’s a masterpiece-driven market, collectors are increasingly good at differentiating the best from the rest and this is an A+ piece from an A-class artist.”Shaw said that the Italian masterpiece, which was the star of a recent Tate Modern exhibition, could easily exceed the record $170.4m paid for a Modigliani in 2015, when another of his 22 nudes from the period was sold to the Chinese billionaire Liu Yiqian and his wife, Wang Wei. Liu, a taxi driver-turned real estate and pharmaceuticals billionaire, bought the painting to display at one of his two private museums, which are designed to introduce Chinese people to western art as well as display the couple’s traditional Chinese art collection. Lui told the New Yorker in a rare interview that he was interested in Modigliani for the way he lived and died as for his paintings. “It’s not just his art but his life. Every object has its story,” he said. Liu also broke the record price for Ming dynasty porcelain when he bought a tiny piece known as “chicken cup” for $36.3m in 2014 and immediately sparked outrage by drinking from it for the cameras. Liu is expected to be in the bidding for the Modigliani when it goes under the hammer. “There is tremendous connoisseurship in China,” said Shaw, who will be the auctioneer for the Modigliani sale. “There are a number of very sophisticated investors with deep pockets and a desire to collect the best of the best. The masterpiece market is truly global and we also expect collectors from America, Europe and Russia to be among the bidders.” At 147cm wide, it is the largest work that Modigliani painted. The majority of his reclining nudes are in museums, mostly in the US. In New York, the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) and the Met own one each. The only one in the UK is in the Courtauld Gallery in London. The Sotheby’s impressionist auction will end a remarkable fortnight of sales in New York, where the rival auction house Christie’s has been selling more than $1bn of art from the estate of Peggy and David Rockefeller. Among the highlight of this week’s sale was Picasso’s 1905 Young Girl with a Flower Basket, which fetched $115m, and Monet’s Nymphéas en fleur, part of the Water Lilies series, which sold for a record $84.6m. While still huge sums, the prices do not come close to the record $450m paid last year for Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi by the Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Farhan. The piece is to go on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T20:59:38Z","webTitle":"Tempers flare as Manchester United seal second with draw at West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tempers flare as Manchester United seal second with draw at West Ham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester United must know that it is a possibility that they will spend another season in the shadow of their formidable neighbours. The most famous club in England are 19 points behind Manchester City with one game remaining and while this forgettable draw secured second place for José Mourinho’s spluttering team, that will not be cause for celebration when they consider the ease with which Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking champions have cantered into the distance. The gap is vast and United will struggle to cut it as long as they continue to toil against opponents as limited as West Ham. Mourinho argued that a point was a respectable reward but United’s fans, who spent much of the second half bellowing their support for the hospitalised Sir Alex Ferguson on a drab night, must be concerned at their team’s negative approach. Forget about the late sideshow flare-up between Paul Pogba and Mark Noble The real intrigue was that when Mourinho turned to his bench as this dire game neared its conclusion, he did not consider the merits of Anthony Martial. Instead he opted for caution, turning to Eric Bailly and Ashley Young to see United over the line, and Martial stayed in his seat, yawning along with the rest of us. “When the game goes to minute 70 or 75, you don’t win, you don’t lose,” Mourinho said. “We deserved the point and second position. When you are not ready to be champion, second position is the best available.” It might seem harsh to be critical given that United got the job done, assuming their task was to participate in a grim slog. Yet it is hard to shake off the impression Mourinho is managing expectations in an effort to make it seem that he cannot be blamed for his team’s failure to compete with City. He had glowered more than usual before this game and his observation that some of the players at his disposal are not good enough to challenge Guardiola’s side did not seem like a classic motivational ploy. United, who made eight changes after their defeat at Brighton, rarely suggested that they were going to respond to their manager’s curious form of tough love. They needed time to adjust to an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2 system and although they looked solid in the central areas, it must have alarmed Mourinho when Chris Smalling’s failure to deal with Aaron Cresswell’s cross almost allowed Marko Arnautovic to give West Ham an early lead. Arnautovic turned an awkward header over, however, and United started to threaten sporadically. Pogba had the freedom to roam behind Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, and Mourinho’s side could argue that they were unfortunate not to be in front at the interval. Scott McTominay sent a shot inches wide after an error from Manuel Lanzini, Lingard had two swerving shots pushed away by Adrián, and West Ham were indebted to a brilliant piece of athleticism from their goalkeeper in the 23rd minute. Sánchez, who scored a hat-trick for Arsenal on this ground last season, must have been licking his lips when Antonio Valencia found him with a cut-back from the right. He had time to pick his spot and he tried to bend a shot high to Adrián’s right. The Spaniard responded with a sharp stop, however, and then he sprang back into position to turn Luke Shaw’s fizzing low drive against the woodwork. It is two years to the day since West Ham said farewell to Upton Park with an emotional victory over United and with his team’s Premier League status secured, there was an argument that this was an opportunity for David Moyes to let go of the handbrake. Yet West Ham’s pragmatic display had a sapping effect on the atmosphere and did little to further the Scot’s case that he deserves a contract extension at the end of the season. “I thought the players showed a great attitude,” Moyes said. “Sometimes when you get safe you can slip away with it but they were at it the whole night. It was a thoroughly deserved point.” At least Arnautovic gave it a go. The Austrian took on United’s back three on his own at times and he deserved better after a powerful surge down the right only for João Mário to jab the cross wide from close range. With Romelu Lukaku unavailable and Mourinho waiting until the 74th minute to bring on Marcus Rashford, United’s attacks lacked a potent presence. Sánchez was persistent and he almost took advantage of indecision from Adrián early in the second half, however. Yet West Ham were relieved that Angelo Ogbonna raced back to head the Chilean’s chip off the line. Declan Rice, another assured presence at the back, would also earn appreciative applause for a fine tackle on Sánchez. West Ham’s reluctance to throw caution to the wind was hard to justify, with Moyes waiting until the 66th minute to introduce Andy Carroll. Yet the temperature only rose when Pogba and Noble clashed. Both men were booked but Carroll could face punishment from the Football Association after appearing to lash out at Shaw. At least Noble and Pogba had cooled down sufficiently to share an embrace after the final whistle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/12/the-resistance-now-women-congressional-primaries-midterms-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T12:00:30Z","webTitle":"Women dominate congressional primaries – now to win office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/12/the-resistance-now-women-congressional-primaries-midterms-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/12/the-resistance-now-women-congressional-primaries-midterms-2018","fields":{"headline":"Women dominate congressional primaries – now to win office","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Women take over ballots First they marched, now they’re running. And winning too. Female candidates dominated in the first multi-state Democratic congressional primaries of the 2018 midterms. Out of 20 open primaries with women on the ballot on Tuesday night, voters selected a female nominee in 17 of them. The development is only fitting after women orchestrated the opening salvo of the national post-Trump resistance, bringing tens of millions into the streets the day after the inauguration for the Women’s March. In the aftermath there has been a deluge of women intent on channeling that energy into political candidacy. Emily’s List, a women’s candidacy advocacy group reported a more than 20-fold increase in inquiries from women interested in running after Trump’s election. According to Politico’s Women Rule candidate tracker, 599 women nationwide have run or have said they’ll run for US House, Senate or governor in 2018. Of the more than 100 who have already stood for primaries this year, 56% have won so far. Women currently occupy just 20% of seats in Congress despite making up half of the US population. Most of the winning Democratic candidates from Tuesday are facing an uphill climb in the November general elections, as nearly all are in districts that Republicans are heavily favored to win, but it’s still representative of a shifting candidacy landscape. A number of women also stood for Republican nominations on Tuesday but they did not fare as well as Democratic women, winning less than half the seats they competed for. House races aren’t the only places women are making huge imprints on the ballot. In Georgia’s 22 May gubernatorial primary, voters will be choosing between one of two Democratic Staceys – Stacey Evans and Stacey Abrams. Either would be the first female executive in the state’s history, and despite the fact that the state hasn’t elected a Democrat to the office since 1998, polling suggest the race could be very competitive. Haspel hearing harangued The Senate confirmation hearing for CIA director nominee, Gina Haspel, was interrupted multiple times by demonstrators upset about her connection to the torture of foreign detainees. A 33-year veteran of the agency, Haspel ran a secret detention centre in Thailand in 2002 where inmates were tortured. In 2005, she drafted an order calling for the destruction of nearly 100 videotapes of interrogation sessions. “Bloody Gina! Bloody Gina! Bloody Gina! You are a torturer,” one protester yelled before being escorted by Capitol police. Another group of Code Pink activists were removed before the proceedings began, and several were dragged out by authorities as they yelled about torture. One of the protesters removed from the chamber was Ray McGovern, a former CIA operative turned activist who has been highly visible in criticizing the agency, especially on torture, since the mid 1990s. Haspel has pledged not to bring back any such torture program if confirmed. “I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, on my watch, the CIA will not restart a detention and interrogation program,” Haspel said. What we’re listening to In the week that Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, it’s been uplifting to listen to the latest episode of the podcast Call Your Girlfriend, entitled The Wind in Your Hair. It’s an interview with Iranian journalist and author Masih Alinejad about everyday life for women in Iran. An exile in Brooklyn these days, after several years in the UK following her ousting from Iran in 2009, Alinejad is a face of the resistance on both sides of the ocean. She wrote about her opposition to the president’s notorious travel ban. And she has a campaign against the compulsory wearing of hijab (emphasis on compulsory), hence the title of the podcast episode and also her new memoir. And the new season of Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History podcast has arrived, in which he re-examines something from the past often “overlooked or misunderstood”. This time it’s the civil rights era. The freshly illuminated stories are a useful antidote to Trump’s divisiveness on race and a timely companion to the pop protest sensation of the past seven days by that other Donald – Glover, the one also known as Childish Gambino.

The incident took place just south of the Niger-Mali border when a joint patrol was returning from an attempt to find a leader of Isis in the Greater Sahara (Isis-GS), Doundoun Cheffou, and were taken by surprise by a much bigger force of militants on motorbikes and pickup trucks. Five Nigerien and four American soldiers were killed. The deaths of the four Americans became a political scandal in Washington – where there was little awareness of US military operations in the region – and an unseemly row broke out between Donald Trump and the widow of one of the slain soldiers, who said the president told her that the young soldier “knew what he signed up for” during a condolence call. Among several lapses, the report released on Thursday by US Africa Command found that the soldiers had not trained long enough together with their Nigerien counterparts or rehearsed basic procedures such as what to do if they came under fire. The US training team misrepresented the original aim of the patrol as reconnaissance rather than a kill-or-capture mission, so the decision to approve it did not go high enough up the chain of command. A second mission to look for Cheffou was properly approved but an airborne force that was supposed to take part, turned back because of poor weather. Ultimately the small joint patrol of 30 Nigeriens and 12 Americans, was ordered to go to an abandoned camp near the Malian border in the hope of gathering intelligence. On the way back, it stopped at a village called Tongo Tongo to take on water and talk to local leaders. The patrol was ambushed as it left the village. A surveillance drone had been used to ensure that there was no threat near the Isis camp the patrol had gone to explore, but it was not sent southwards to check the road back to their base at Oallam, some 50 miles north of the capital, Niamey. Instead it was sent northwards, towards the Mali border. Initially under the impression that they were being attacked only by a small group of fighters, the patrol did not call for help until an hour later. By then it was too late. A mobile force of 150 or more Isis-GS militants descended on them from the east, outflanking and scattering the patrol, forcing the soldiers to retreat and ultimately abandon their vehicles and run for their lives on foot. A Guardian investigation after the Tongo Tongo incident revealed that the American soldiers had been stripped of their weapons and guns, and that two of the bodies had been dumped in a car with the engine running, implying that their attackers had been about to drive off with them. The official report found that the militants abandoned their vehicles after the arrival of French warplanes, who reached the scene 47 minutes after the patrol called for help, and flew low over the scene in a show of force. The report found that US and Nigerien soldiers fought heroically, but that the seeds of the disastrous ambush had been sown in the preceding months, before the US special forces team even arrived in Niger. Due to “personnel turnover”, the report found, “only half the team had conducted any collective training together. “If you don’t have the people there at the appropriate time to conduct the training, if they come late … it impacts the ability to have cohesion,” the head of US Africa Command, Marine General Thomas Waldhauser told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on the report. When the special forces team arrived at their base at Oallam, it did not conduct basic drills with its Nigerien partner forces that would have allowed them to coordinate in combat, despite language barriers. “If you get to a situation when you’re under enemy contact, you need to be able to operate like clockwork without having to speak … and in this particular case, the team did not conduct those basic soldier-level skills,” Gen Waldhauser said. In early October, when the US junior officers leading the special forces team submitted a request to go on patrol, they simply copied the wording from an earlier reconnaissance mission, rather than giving an accurate description of their plan. The misleading request, however, did not lead directly to the ambush, the investigators found. A second mission was approved on 3 October, to go after Cheffou (who though not named in the summary of the report published on Thursdayis confirmed by US officials to have been the target), and a third mission, the next day, to go to the suspected Isis camp. Waldhauser said that even before the report was produced, his command had changed the way it carried out its counter-terrorism training missions. They will have now have the option to use more armoured vehicles with more firepower, and more surveillance drones. “We have beefed up a lot of things posture-wise, with regards to these forces,” Waldhauser said. Overall, he stressed that there had to be greater emphasis on the fact that US trainers are in Africa to train and advise and not to go into battle. “Tactical operations are there to be carried out by the partner force, not by US forces,” he added. “We are now far more prudent in our missions, the missions we actually accompany have to have a strategic value in terms of the enemy we are going against – do they have a strategic threat to the United States.” Waldhauser did not say whether the doomed patrol on 4 October would have taken place at all under the new guidelines. The Pentagon said there would be no changes to the overall scale of its mission in Niger. At Niamey airport on Thursday, men in camouflage trousers worked at the loading ramp of a US air force cargo plane. On the other side of immigration, gum-chewing soldiers with France’s counter-terrorism force in the Sahel, waited to pick up arriving colleagues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/chinese-broadcaster-loses-eurovision-rights-over-lgbt-censorship","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T09:13:54Z","webTitle":"Chinese broadcaster loses Eurovision rights over LGBT censorship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/chinese-broadcaster-loses-eurovision-rights-over-lgbt-censorship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/chinese-broadcaster-loses-eurovision-rights-over-lgbt-censorship","fields":{"headline":"Chinese broadcaster loses Eurovision rights over LGBT censorship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The European Broadcasting Union has blocked a Chinese broadcaster from airing the Eurovision song contest after it edited out LGBT elements from an online stream of the semi-finals on Tuesday. Mango TV, a video-streaming site linked to one of China’s most watched channels, Hunan TV, blacked out the performance of Ireland’s Ryan O’Shaugnessy, during which two male dancers depicted a fraught relationship. The site also pixellated a rainbow flag waved during another performance. The EBU said on Friday it had terminated its partnership with Mango TV because the censorship was not in line with its “values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music”. Conservative attitudes towards LGBT issues in China are slowly changing. Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1997 and removed from the government’s list of mental disorders in 2001, but discrimination and practices such as forced gay conversion therapy are still used. Last month, LGBT activists pushed the popular microblog Weibo to reverse a ban on gay content. Hunan TV, known for its progressiveness, has previously made shows featuring LGBT content. Although Eurovision is not widely popular in China, news of the censorship circulated around social media on Friday. One Weibo user wrote: “Is this really that sensitive? If things keep going this way, soon even rainbows in the sky will have to be blurred out.” Another wrote: “SARFT is really disgusting,” referring to the country’s entertainment regulator, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. It is unclear whether regulators ordered Hunan TV not to show O’Shaugnessy’s performance or whether the channel made the decision independently. Hunan TV purchased the rights to broadcast the contest for the first time in 2016 and one of its executives told ESC Daily, a website reporting Eurovision-related news, that she hoped China would follow in Australia’s footsteps and one day be invited to compete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/11/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:52:17Z","webTitle":"Police confirm death of Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/body-found-in-search-for-frightened-rabbit-singer-scott-hutchison","fields":{"headline":"Police confirm death of Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police in Scotland have confirmed the death of Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison, after his body was discovered following his disappearance on Wednesday. Police made the discovery at Port Edgar near South Queensferry in Edinburgh at 8.30pm on Thursday, with Hutchison’s family informed. Hutchison, 36, was last seen at 1am on Wednesday, when he left the Dakota hotel in South Queensferry. The band had posted a message on Twitter asking for anyone with information to contact police, adding: “We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.” Fans sent messages of support, summed up by Hutchison’s brother and bandmate, Grant, who told Radio X earlier this week: “The support’s been immense … There’s nothing that is so insurmountable that we can’t figure it out together and help you to get better and we’re all here for you and we all love you very much.” After hearing of his death, Frightened Rabbit posted a message on Instagram reading: “There are no words to describe the overwhelming sadness and pain that comes with the death of our beloved Scott but to know he is no longer suffering brings us some comfort ... he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared.” Hutchison had addressed mental health difficulties in his songwriting. In an interview published on Noisey last week, he described his mood: “Middling. On a day-to-day basis, I’m a solid six out of 10. I don’t know how often I can hope for much more than that. I’m drawn to negatives in life, and I dwell on them, and they consume me.” In a 2016 interview, he spoke of experiencing anxiety attacks, and of how affected he was by his emotions: “I’ve always seen that kind of emotional turmoil as an illness. It’s one that lasts for quite a long time and can’t be fixed. You know, you describe it as a ‘hurt’ – why would you describe it as that if it weren’t actually painful? It’s not just mental torment.” Hutchison formed Frightened Rabbit initially as a solo project in 2003, before Grant joined him to record their debut album in 2006. The band expanded to a five-piece, and amassed a loyal following for their soul-baring, emotionally rich songwriting, including Aaron Dessner of US band the National who produced their most recent album, 2016’s Painting of a Panic Attack – Dessner said he was “devastated”, and called Hutchison “a dear soul and a brilliant songwriter”. Robert Smith of the Cure had invited them to appear at Meltdown festival, which he is curating in London in June, and the band were also set to support US singer-songwriter Father John Misty in concert in May. Hutchison had recently completed a tour with the band to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their breakthrough 2008 album, The Midnight Organ Fight, and another with his other band, Mastersystem. He had recently spoken of plans for a sixth Frightened Rabbit album, saying: “I would like for that to be finished by the end of the year.” Among tributes to the singer, the radio DJ Edith Bowman tweeted: “You ok fella? Sending love and a shoulder if you need it” to Scott after his final messages – wrote on Twitter: “Can’t really believe I’m reading this. Saddest awakening ever. Love and best wishes to all the Hutchison and Frabbit family.” Stuart Murdoch from Scottish band Belle and Sebastian wrote: “Tragic news about Scott Hutchison. The whole music community in Scotland was praying for a different outcome. Folks, if you are up against it, having dark thoughts, please tell someone, family, a friend or a doctor. There is always another way, though it might not seem like it.” Mogwai’s Stuart Braithwaite said Hutchison was “a lovely, warm talented guy and was loved by so many people”, while Franz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos called his death “a terrible loss”.

According to documents collated by The New York Times, Pruitt joined Pell and others for a $240-a-head dinner in June 2017, an engagement that was left off official schedules of Pruitt’s Vatican visit. In an email sent during the dinner, one EPA staff member said Pell and Pruitt had discussed a Wall Street Journal article reporting on proposals for a military-style “red team/blue team” debate on climate science. Climate science denial groups, including the Heartland Institute, have been pushing the idea of such a debate for years. The proposal from Pruitt for the debate appears to be on hold. The New York Times reporter Eric Lipton, sharing documents on Twitter, commented that Pell’s name had been left off multiple versions of Pruitt’s EPA schedule for the Vatican trip, which included a private mass and special tours. Pell, the Vatican’s treasurer, has dismissed the science linking greenhouse gas emissions with dangerous climate change. Pruitt has also refused to acknowledge the science showing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning as a main driver of global warming. Pell has previously given the annual lecture for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a UK climate science denial group, in which he said adding CO2 to the atmosphere would be merely good news for plants. His speech was described by climate scientists as “utter rubbish” and “flawed”. One GWPF funder, Australian hedge fund billionaire Michael Hintze, has also donated millions for renovations at the Vatican and sits on the board of the Vatican Bank. Hintze has also been a major donor to the UK’s Conservative party. Pell is a long-standing spiritual mentor to former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who delivered the GWPF’s 2017 annual lecture. The cardinal has been on leave from the Vatican to return to Australia, where he is facing historical sexual offence charges, which he denies. It was first revealed that Pell was under investigation in February 2016, but he was not formally charged until 29 June 2017 – almost three weeks after the dinner with Pruitt. Also at the dinner was Leonard Leo, who heads the conservative judicial group the Federalist Society and who, according to an earlier report in the New York Times, had helped the EPA to organise the June 2017 Vatican trip. The Federalist Society is a noted “pipeline” for supreme court appointments under the Trump administration.

Dushaun Henderson-Spruce, 24, has been charged with mail theft and fraud in an alleged scam that saw items including American Express cards in the name of the chief executive and other board members being delivered to his address in Rogers Park, the Chicago Tribune reported. So much mail was arriving at his seven-storey building that the carrier had to leave it in a US postal service tub because there was no room in the mail box, the Tribune said. Henderson-Spruce, who spent a brief period in 2012 working as a package handler for UPS at the company’s sorting facility in Hodgkins, Illinois, was held in custody Thursday and scheduled for a detention hearing next week. The scam began when Henderson-Spruce submitted a post office change of address form on 26 October to switch the company’s official address from 55 Glenlake Parkway NE in Atlanta, Georgia to his apartment at 6750 North Ashland Avenue, according to the charges. The Tribune reported that Henderson-Spruce did not have to give any proof of his identity in order to carry out the scheme. The initials “HS” were written on the signature line, but were then scratched out and replaced with “UPS”, according to the charges. A UPS security coordinator discovered the change almost three months later on 16 January. A week later postal inspectors retrieved about 3,000 pieces of mail from the apartment, the complaint said. The correspondence included letters addressed to the company’s CEO and executives, sensitive documents with personal information and corporate cards and cheques. Fifth Third Bank investigators found that more than 10 cheques addressed to UPS totaling more than $58,000 were deposited into Henderson-Spruce’s account, the charges said. Henderson-Spruce has previously said it was a mix-up and his identity may have been stolen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/14/should-i-grow-my-own-marijuana-how-what-to-do-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"Should I grow my own weed at home?

Here's what you need to know","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Canadian government, which is likely to legalize cannabis nationwide this summer, said it planned to allow home grows of up to four marijuana plants, which might yield 5lb in a year to an experienced grower, and is certainly consumable by an experienced smoker. In response, the Canadian Real Estate Association hit the panic button and called for a nationwide moratorium on home growing until it can be better studied. The group says home grows could deplete property values, and also raise rents, especially for low-income tenants. Supporters of the law say four plant grows pose minimal risk. As legalization spreads, more cannabis enthusiasts are naturally going to want to try cultivation for themselves. The 2018 National Gardening Survey found 15% of US households would grow marijuana at home if it was legal. But, along with edibles, home growing is generally among the most contentious topics within the legalization debate. Allowing it, police say, enables criminals to hide in plain sight. For law-abiding growers it could invite burglaries, since their stash is worth $1,000 a pound and easy to resell. Firefighters worry about the blazing hot lightbulbs growers use and their elaborate electrical set-ups. The plants can attract unappetizing blights like spider mites, fungus gnats, powdery mildew and grey mold, also called bud rot. And the odor can annoy neighbors. The most vocal opponents of home growing may be the Quebec government which has said it will not allow home grow immediately, as part of an effort to legalize at its own pace. But home growing has its pleasures. Like tomatoes or carrots, growing one’s own cannabis is cheaper than buying it, and a chance to learn something. “There’s an empowerment that comes from being able to do it yourself,” said Nichole Graf, who left New York City with her partner in 2013 to start a marijuana farm in Washington state. Growing, she said, would also be useful if the administration went after the industry and pushed the drug back to the illegal market. With her business partners, she co-authored Grow Your Own: Understanding, cultivating and enjoying cannabis, a nicely illustrated and eco-minded introduction. “It’s not rocket science,” she said, but it does involve some knowhow. How to grow your own weed Cannabis is a sexed plant; the drug is the flower from the female. The hard to detect presence of a male plant can ruin the flower produced by a whole room of females. To avoid pollination, large-scale marijuana grows typically use clones instead of seeds, and Graf recommends novice growers to begin with clones as well. The wrong lighting can also be ruinous for a very expensive crop. For the home grower, this matters much less, and Graf says it helps someone develop their appreciation for the plant. Amid rising interest in home grows, companies have developed home grow pods controlled by smartphone apps and other more modest growing kits and accessories. With strong weed no longer hard to find, home growing is a chance for connoisseurs to grow for CBD, a chemical commonly associated with the plant’s medicinal properties, or for a plant’s terpene profile (bouquet). Marijuana growing can be relatively straightforward or “as complicated as you want to make it”, Graf said. Like so many aspects of cannabis, this is a culture advanced largely by solitary men, deeply invested in their competitive world. Conversations about variation in soil substitutes, light spectra and humidity are frequent and achieve Warholian feats of boredom. They’re also potentially very important. As a high-value crop, cannabis may attract investment into lighting, water management and other agricultural technologies that might go ignored when the crop is $2 heads of lettuce. These new technologies are environmentally friendly and potentially earth-shattering politically, since they could transfer agriculture to cities. That’s probably a few years off though. For now, one place which has accepted home grow is Vermont. Of the nine US states which have fully legalized, Vermont is the only one not to allow a commercial industry. Instead, the state will allow possession and home growing, up to six plants, including two flowered females. Marijuana won’t be anything new to Vermont; it is, after all, the state that gave the world Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ice Cream and the jam band Phish. But the opioid-ravaged state sought to create a buffer between itself and a new for-profit intoxicant, instead making it legal but not readily available. It’s practically un-American to postpone commerce for the sake of the public good, another reason why Vermont’s experiment with growing your own is worth watching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/14/chile-mapuche-indigenous-arson-radical-environmental-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T07:01:40Z","webTitle":"Indigenous Chileans defend their land against loggers with radical tactics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/chile-mapuche-indigenous-arson-radical-environmental-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/chile-mapuche-indigenous-arson-radical-environmental-protest","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous Chileans defend their land against loggers with radical tactics","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is late autumn in southern Chile, and in the region of Araucanía, the leaves have turned copper and gold. But on the road to the mist-shrouded town of Lumaco, the hills are covered with rows of charred pines. “We burned these forests as an act of legitimate resistance against the extractive industries that have oppressed the Mapuche people,” says Hector Llaitul. “If we make their business unprofitable they move on, allowing us to recover our devastated lands and rebuild our world.” This year has already turned out to have been a particularly combustible one in a decade of rising attacks by indigenous Mapuche activists against the Chilean state and big business. Over several few days in April, crops were burned, roads were blocked and 16 forestry vehicles were set ablaze outside of the regional capital, Temuco. Such actions have become more and more common. According to statistics published by a local business association, there were 43 attacks in the region in 2017, mainly arson attacks against logging firms. “Anyone who hasn’t been in the Chilean forest doesn’t know this planet,” wrote Pablo Neruda, who grew up in the region – and whose verse was inspired by its wild landscapes, and the indomitable spirit of its native people who were only conquered after Chilean military campaigns in the late 19th century. Today, however, much of the west of the region would be unrecognizable to Chile’s finest poet. In the last 50 years, monoculture pine and eucalyptus plantations have replaced the biodiversity of the original forests. Meanwhile, Mapuche groups have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reclaim ancestral lands and gain political autonomy. Llaitul is a spokesman for the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco (CAM), an anti-capitalist organization that uses direct action and sabotage tactics. The group has also demanded the release of the shaman Celestino Cordova, who was convicted in February 2014 for an arson attack on a farmhouse north of Temuco that resulted in the deaths of an elderly couple, Werner Luchsinger and Vivianne Mackay. Cordova began a hunger strike in January after officials denied his request to complete a religious ceremony outside of the prison. He temporarily suspended the strike in April to negotiate. “The government practices and respects Catholicism but it discriminates against Mapuche spiritual beliefs,” he said from a hospital bed, guarded by police officers. “The Mapuche have been impoverished spiritually, culturally and economically by Chile. I’m willing to sacrifice my life for my people.” But Cordova’s conviction in the high-profile Luchsinger-Mackay case has made it tougher to win public sympathy for his cause, said Nicolas Rojas Pedemonte, a professor at Alberto Hurtado University in Santiago and author of a new book on the Mapuche conflict. “That case was an inflection point for the conflict,” he said. “It was the first fatal attack, it turned Chilean media against the Mapuche and was used by the state as a Trojan horse for a repressive response.” Police presence has since been heavily increased in Araucanía leading to the militarization of the region and increasingly indiscriminate targeting of indigenous people, according to Rojas. In January 2017, charges against several Mapuche – including Llaitul – were dropped after it was revealed that police had used manipulated WhatsApp messages as evidence in arson cases. “I don’t even use WhatsApp,” says Llaitul, brandishing a tiny Nokia. The Luchsinger-Mackay case was also the first sign of a split in Mapuche activist ranks. A new more radical group – know as the Weichan Auka Mapu (the Struggle of the Rebel Territory, WAM) – emerged, adopting an explicitly anti-Chilean stance and the tactic of burning churches – most recently during the Pope’s January visit to the region. Llaitul says the CAM rejects the targeting of individuals and that direct action against forestry projects is the first stage towards reclaiming the land for Mapuche settlements. On a former timber reserve overlooking Lumaco, his vision is being put into action. The logging firm, Arauco, abandoned the project following repeated arson attacks and today, in a small clearing, a dozen young men and women are hammering timbers together on the construction of a house in the woods. A Mapuche red, blue and green flag flaps from the apex. “When we recover lands we plant crops, breed animals and reconstruct our cultural world,” says Llaitul. “We will build houses but our first priority is a spiritual centre, the rewe.” The rightwing government of the current president, Sebastián Piñera, has a different vistion for the future of Araucanía, the region with the worst poverty and unemployment rates in the country. Ministers visited Temuco in April to finalize plans for a major growth plan for the region, focusing on tourism, agriculture and energy investments and training programs to allow the 150,000 hectares of land turned over to Mapuche groups in recent years to return to production. The plan, to be launched in August, is also expected to increase the purchase of private lands by the national indigenous development agency. “People in Araucanía are calling out for peace and development. Over the years so much investment has been turned away due to security fears,” says Luis Mayol, the Santiago-appointed administrator of Araucanía. “Piñera won 63% of the vote in this region – the Mapuche people want growth like everyone else. However, there is a small number of terrorists with radical ideologies and the resources to generate fear.” While the development plan aims to win the support of Araucanías indigenous groups, accompanying amendments to the anti-terrorism law aim to make it easier to convict arsonists under terrorism charges. “Our current legislation is quite useless: too many violent acts are being processed as regular crimes,” says Mayol. “We need to bring our definition of terrorism in line with those of countries such as the UK and Spain. For me, the systematic burning of trucks and churches are terrorist acts.” Back at the reclaimed timber plantation, Llaitul remains defiant as two young Mapuche lift roof rafters into place on the new construction. “When there was no Mapuche struggle, the government did nothing for us” he says. “We’re not asking for palliative measures or integration, we want territory and autonomy for the Mapuche nation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/10/featherstone-hull-fc-challenge-cup-sixth-round-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Six sin-binned, one sent off  as Hull beat Featherstone amid Challenge Cup chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/featherstone-hull-fc-challenge-cup-sixth-round-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/10/featherstone-hull-fc-challenge-cup-sixth-round-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Six sin-binned, one sent off  as Hull beat Featherstone amid Challenge Cup chaos","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a night where a 123-year record was equalled, seven cards were shown in a chaotic half-hour of action and one side finished with nine men on the field, it is perhaps inevitable that the continuation of Hull’s three-year unbeaten run in the Challenge Cup was relegated to a mere footnote. Their quest for a third successive cup triumph eventually continued here; in terms of the scoreline and the final result, it was somewhat straightforward despite an admirable effort from Featherstone. Everything else could not have been more surreal. Magic of the cup? At times, this felt like sheer pandemonium. Perhaps the headline was the 36th-minute try scored by the Featherstone wing, Luke Briscoe, which equalled the sport’s all-time record for scoring 17 tries in consecutive games, set in 1936 by the Leeds great, Eric Harris. It is a phenomenal milestone, and one which deservedly should be recalled after an otherwise-chaotic evening in West Yorkshire. “He’s absolutely phenomenal,” the Featherstone coach, John Duffy, said of the wing, who could now break the all-time record next weekend when Rovers face Leigh. Featherstone’s focus now turns towards attempting to secure promotion to the Super League via the Qualifiers – and they should take heart from the fact that they will face far worse sides than Hull this summer and yet pushed the reigning holders for periods of this all-action encounter. But by the time victory had long since been secured courtesy of Bureta Faraimo’s two second-half tries, an entertaining cup tie had descended into farce. In total there were seven cards; three yellows to Featherstone players and three to Hull, before Faraimo’s red card seconds before full-time for an appalling challenge on Shaun Robinson. It meant Hull ended the game with just nine men – but before those shambolic scenes, the visitors were, in the end, worthy winners. They face a mounting injury crisis before next Sunday’s Magic Weekend date with Hull KR though; they could be without more than a dozen first-team players for that game, including Faraimo, who surely faces a suspension. Without the first-choice half-back pairing Albert Kelly and Marc Sneyd, their star here was Jake Connor, who scored two of the five first-half tries that put the visitors 30-10 ahead at the break – and though Featherstone fought valiantly thereafter, a comeback never seemed likely. Briscoe’s historic try was followed by another after the break, but when Connor’s superb looping pass found Faraimo soon after, it was clear there would be only one winner. Soon after his second, though, the rugby took a backseat to the card-laden anarchy of the final quarter. Not that Hull, who will be in Sunday’s quarter-final draw, or Briscoe, who has his place in history, will remember that in a few weeks’ time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/10/sorry-angel-apology-not-accepted-for-tedious-age-gap-gay-romance","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T21:21:09Z","webTitle":"Sorry Angel – apology not accepted for tedious age-gap gay romance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/10/sorry-angel-apology-not-accepted-for-tedious-age-gap-gay-romance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/10/sorry-angel-apology-not-accepted-for-tedious-age-gap-gay-romance","fields":{"headline":"Sorry Angel – apology not accepted for tedious age-gap gay romance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Christophe Honoré’s Sorry Angel is the story of a 90s-set love affair. It is often poignant and humorous but also placid and complacent, with performances bordering on the self-regarding and even faintly insufferable. Jacques (Pierre Deladonchamps) is a handsome, successful writer in his early 40s, HIV-positive and living in Paris. He is dealing with career-disenchantment and writers’ block – and also a stagnant and unsatisfactory love life. His discontent is not immediately soothed by being invited to a literary festival in Rennes, where he is thoroughly annoyed at the shabby hotel where they’ve put him up – something appropriate for a B-lister – and in a fractious and grumpy mood he does not show up at the venue straightaway but goes instead to a movie show, Jane Campion’s The Piano. There he spots the cute young student Arthur (Vincent Lacoste) in the row opposite, who is bi, and living with fellow student Nadine (Adele Wismes). On a glorious, dangerous whim, they whisper flirtatiously to each other, now quite uninterested in the film. (Arthur will later describe it as “a bit storybook”.) Something has clearly happened – there is a spark between the older cosmopolitan intellectual and the younger, pertly bookish Breton. Clearly things must be reassessed in both their lives. Arthur has to settle things with Nadine, a problem he approaches in a mood of shrugging casualness. Back in Paris, Jacques himself has many things to work out, things more difficult for an older guy with more life experiences and ties of loyalty. Any serious new partner will have to get on with his intelligent young son, whom he has had with a female friend and who stays over regularly. A former lover of Jacques’s, with whom things have ended badly, is now dying of an Aids-related disease and begs Jacques to take him in so that he can die with him. Jacques has an on-off thing with a former pickup, whose frank sensuality is still something that he prizes on some level. And Jacques has a complex, protective relationship with his friend, confidant and neighbour Mathieu – a really good performance from Denis Podalydès – who may himself have feelings for Jacques. And Jacques’s own condition is not necessarily stable. There is a strange moment when Arthur proposes coming to Paris to visit Jacques – it is the subject of a waspish exchange between Jacques and Mathieu, prompted by the news that Arthur will be attending an ACT UP meeting. “For a visitor, going to ACT UP is like visiting the catacombs.” Well, possibly. But the flip cynicism is not easy to read here. And the reccurrent note of torpid drollery and melancholy in this film strikes me as exactly the sort of self-involved fatalism that the passionate ACT UP campaigners in Robin Campillo’s superb film 120 BPM wanted to blow out of the water. And for all the sadness and ostensible romance, there is something disconcertingly passionless and anaemic in this movie. Though without music, Sorry Angel is not entirely unlike Honoré’s somewhat fey musical entertainments Beloved (2011) and Love Songs (2007) - and Arthur is a kind of smug and self-satisfied role in which Honoré might until recently have cast the puckishly narcissistic Louis Garrel. There are some attractive aspects to Sorry Angel: Paris always looks terrific in it and Denis Podalydès is a warm and sympathetic presence, particularly when he participates in a silly, fun dance with Arthur and Jacques in his apartment. The beachside scenes with Nadine reminded me of something by Eric Rohmer. But there is something slight and unrewarding in this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/10/mohamed-salah-awards-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T21:30:23Z","webTitle":"Mohamed Salah sweeps up awards and suggests his future is at Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/10/mohamed-salah-awards-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/10/mohamed-salah-awards-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Mohamed Salah sweeps up awards and suggests his future is at Liverpool","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mohamed Salah has said his ambitions for silverware with Liverpool extend beyond this season and that progress to the Champions League final represents the start of a new era under Jürgen Klopp. The Egypt international has been linked frequently with a move to Real Madrid, Liverpool’s opponents in Kiev on 26 May, during a debut campaign at Anfield in which he has scored 43 goals. The 25-year-old’s impact was recognised again on Thursday night when he was named players’ player of the season and player of the season at Liverpool’s awards dinner. Salah collected the prizes at Anfield before taking a private jet to London to collect another one, the Football Writers’ Association player of the year award. Before his departure, Liverpool’s leading scorer was asked directly about leaving the club only a year after his £36.9m arrival from Roma. “I’m very happy here, I’m very happy and everything is fine,” replied Salah, who is expected to be offered an improved contract by Liverpool. “I have got ambitions for the future with Liverpool. As you can see we had a great season and now we are in the Champions League final and everyone is excited. It is just the start. This is my first year here and it is the same for some other players. I didn’t watch all the games last season of the team but this year we have had an unbelievable year.” Liverpool need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure a place in next season’s Champions League irrespective of the outcome against Real. Salah believes he can be part of a sustained period of success at Anfield. “We are very comfortable we will be playing in the Champions League next season,” he said. “On the way to the final we beat top teams like Manchester City and Roma. It is just the beginning. We want to qualify for the Champions League next season and then we want to win the Champions League final. We will play to win against Real Madrid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/hurricane-season-may-be-even-worse-in-2018-after-a-harrowing-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Hurricane season may be even worse in 2018 after a harrowing 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/hurricane-season-may-be-even-worse-in-2018-after-a-harrowing-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/hurricane-season-may-be-even-worse-in-2018-after-a-harrowing-2017","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane season may be even worse in 2018 after a harrowing 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US may have to brace itself for another harrowing spate of hurricanes this year, with forecasts of an active 2018 season coming amid new research that shows powerful Atlantic storms are intensifying far more rapidly than they did 30 years ago. The peak season for Atlantic storms, which officially starts on 1 June, is set to spur as many as 18 named storms, with up to five of them developing into major hurricanes, according to separate forecasts from North Carolina State University and Colorado State University. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon provide its own 2018 hurricane predictions. The initial forecasts of an above-average season for hurricanes follow a punishing 2017, most notable for Hurricane Harvey, which drenched large areas of Texas, Hurricane Irma’s sweep over Florida and the devastation that stubbornly lingers in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria. These huge hurricanes brought winds of up to 185mph and lashing rains, causing hundreds of deaths, flattening homes, felling power lines and ruining roads. Combined, the three storms caused around $265bn in damage, and all ranked in the five most destructive hurricanes ever recorded. Many communities, particularly in Puerto Rico and Texas, are still struggling to recover from last year’s hurricanes as the upcoming storm season approaches. And while the US may be spared 2017 levels of devastation this year, scientists have warned that the warming of the oceans, driven by climate change, is likely to stir greater numbers of prodigious storms in the future. Atlantic hurricanes are intensifying far more rapidly than they did 30 years ago, according to a new study that analyzed the acceleration in wind speed of previous storms. Major hurricanes are defined by a sharp increase in speed, of at least 28mph in a 24-hour period. Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that these big hurricanes are, on average, speeding up 13mph faster in this 24-hour period than they did 30 years ago. Much of this has to do with shifts in a natural climate cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Separate research from the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests this natural variation will combine with escalating warming in the oceans and atmosphere, caused by the burning of fossil fuels by humans, to produce stronger hurricanes in the future. A warm ocean surface, combined with consistent wind patterns, contribute to the formation of fiercer, if not more numerous, hurricanes. In the weeks before Hurricane Harvey smashed into Texas in August last year, the Gulf of Mexico’s waters were warmer than any time on record at around 30C (86F), the NCAR research found. “The implication is that the warmer oceans increased the risk of greater hurricane intensity and duration,” said Kevin Trenberth, an NCAR senior scientist and lead author of the study. “As climate change continues to heat the oceans, we can expect more supercharged storms like Harvey. “While we often think of hurricanes as atmospheric phenomena, it’s clear that the oceans play a critical role and will shape future storms as the climate changes.” Hurricanes act as a sort of relief valve for hot tropical oceans, funneling heat away into the atmosphere. Persistent warmth in the oceans, however, adds further energy to hurricanes and risks causing worse damage to life and property when these storms make landfall. Faced with the prospect of supercharged hurricanes, as various other burgeoning climate change-related threats, Donald Trump has rescinded Obama-era rules preparing infrastructure for climate impacts. He has taken an axe to policies that would lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars and power plants and announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. This agenda has been criticized by researchers who have called for an urgent reappraisal of the risk posed by climate change. “We know this threat exists, and yet in many cases, society is not adequately planning for these storms,” Trenberth said. “I believe there is a need to increase resilience with better building codes, flood protection, and water management, and we need to prepare for contingencies, including planning evacuation routes and how to deal with power cuts.” This year, however, the focus will again be on disaster recovery rather than long-term mitigation. Ken Graham, director of Noaa’s National Hurricane Center said that the “entire Gulf Coast is at risk from storms and that several hurricanes can strike in a single season”. “Don’t wait for a hurricane to be on your doorstep to make a preparedness plan, by then it may be too late,” he added. “Take the time now to get prepared for the season ahead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/10/eddie-hearn-1bn-transatlantic-streaming-deal-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T20:00:21Z","webTitle":"Eddie Hearn boasts $1bn transatlantic streaming deal is ‘biggest ever in boxing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/10/eddie-hearn-1bn-transatlantic-streaming-deal-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/10/eddie-hearn-1bn-transatlantic-streaming-deal-boxing","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Hearn boasts $1bn transatlantic streaming deal is ‘biggest ever in boxing’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Eddie Hearn had promised a blockbuster announcement to shake up boxing, and on Thursday he confirmed he had sealed a $1bn contract with a US media partner to deliver what he is calling “the biggest ever deal in boxing”.

Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas arrived at the Players Championship in the knowledge they could knock Johnson from the ledge upon which he has sat for 15 months by Sunday evening. Johnson’s response, typically, arrived by way of actions. His Sawgrass first round of 66 was bogey free. Afterwards, he appeared unmoved by all the fuss. “I definitely want to stay there but if someone passes me it’s not going to change anything,” he insisted, in a blow to those seeking stories beyond birdies and bogeys. “I’m still going to go back out next week and try to get it back. Obviously this week if I play really well I’ll still be No 1. If I don’t, someone’s going to pass me, which is OK. “My expectations are the same for every tournament. I want to play well and I want to put myself in a position to have a chance to win on Sunday. I haven’t had the best record here but it’s a golf course that I like. I enjoy playing it and I feel like I should play well here.” Indeed, it offers hope to Johnson’s pursuers that he has finished no better than 12th at Sawgrass. Rose was the first man to lay down a challenge to Johnson. The Englishman has never been world No 1; a situation his 68 suggested he is keen to change. Rose offered a smile when asked if he had contemplated rankings when in game mode. “Not after Dustin got four, five, six under,” the former US Open winner said. “I thought I better play well this week to not go miles behind him again. “Obviously it’s all well and good talking about it, but if he wins then he’s off and gone again. So that’s the thing, it’s a little bit about timing, when you play well and what other guys are doing. But no, I was just trying to focus obviously on my round. “It’s very strong at the top. Dustin has a lot of challengers but to fend them off for over a year now? That’s pretty undisputed as a world No 1 if you can do it for over a year. So the next guy in I would imagine obviously will be delighted, but I think there could be a little of to-ing and fro-ing for the next six months or so with how many guys have the opportunity.” By close of play, Johnson’s six under tally formed part of a six-way tie for the lead. Alex Noren, Matt Kuchar, Patrick Cantlay, Chesson Hadley and Webb Simpson completed the sextet. Rory McIlroy’s 71 was most notable for a terrific chip in for a birdie from a treacherous position behind the 4th – his 13th – green. “You could have given me another 100 balls and I wouldn’t have holed out,” he admitted. “I don’t think people would appreciate how tough that was unless they were down there. It’s a bonus if those ones drop.” Spieth’s recently troubled relationship with this venue continued. The Open champion’s 75 was especially poor given it included an eagle at the 12th. The Texan found water three times. Thomas, who completed a group with McIlroy and Spieth, signed for a 73. Tiger Woods had been solid rather than unspectacular when reaching the 18th tee one under par. He then pulled his iron shot into a lake, with the subsequent bogey giving him a 72 in what was the toughest of Thursday’s conditions. Phil Mickelson, in the company of Woods, slipped to a 79."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/the-bridge-recap-season-four-episode-one-a-brutal-beginning-of-the-end","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T21:00:12Z","webTitle":"The Bridge recap: season four, episode one – a brutal beginning of the end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/the-bridge-recap-season-four-episode-one-a-brutal-beginning-of-the-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/the-bridge-recap-season-four-episode-one-a-brutal-beginning-of-the-end","fields":{"headline":"The Bridge recap: season four, episode one – a brutal beginning of the end","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"SPOILER ALERT: This is for people watching The Bridge at BBC2 pace. Don’t read on if you haven’t seen episode one of the fourth series. If you’ve seen further ahead, please do not post spoilers. Hello, and welcome back to The Bridge series blog. After a slightly extended Saga holiday, imagine it reemerging ominously from some typically overcast Scandi-noir fog bank. Season three of The Bridge wrapped up in December 2015 with an uncharacteristic glimmer of hope for our damaged but dogged cross-country cop collaborators. Back then, single-minded Swedish investigator Saga Norén (Sofia Helin) and angular Danish thief-taker Henrik Sabroe (Thure Lindhardt) might have struggled by themselves to overcome the various challenges. Could she beat a bogus murder charge? Could he track down his missing kids? All felt like they might be achievable if the sometimes lovebirds continued to work together. So it feels like this fourth (and, according to the creators, expressly final) outing has been a long time brewing. The Bridge has been upgraded to BBC2 Friday night primetime and these final eight episodes will be parcelled out individually rather than doubled-up in the BBC4 tradition. Even if it might take a while to adjust to a single Bridge serving each week instead of a double-decker there was still no shortage of dramatic density and knotty plotting to unpack. While Saga was coping with her newly restricted routine, Henrik had to deal with a grisly ritualistic killing, one seemingly designed to create political uproar. The victim was Margrethe Thormod, head of the Danish immigration board, a department embroiled in scandal after literally popping champagne corks to celebrate winning the deportation case of a gay Iranian. Kidnapped, bound and buried up to her neck in the hardscrabble sand under the show’s totemic Øresund bridge, Margrethe was slowly and methodically stoned to death. Of all The Bridge’s various inciting incidents involving mutilations and desecrations, this nocturnal slaying felt like one of the cruellest. Cutting to a long shot when the rocks started flying might have been intended to make things feel less horrible. But viewing the killing – even briefly – from such a distance also somehow added to the dreadful sense of helplessness. That grisly murder was just the start. We also got a taste of shock-haired Iranian dissident Taariq Shirazi successfully evading Margrethe’s deportation order with the clandestine help of Copenhagen’s gay bar network, heard rumblings of faceless Swedish leftwing radical group Red October ramping up a volatile campaign and spent some uncomfortable moments with devious Don Brolund, a toxic cabbie ready to blow a gasket over the disappearance of his brutalised wife and son. This disparate web of spindly plot strands entangled key players in both Copenhagen and Malmö, dragging the case into The Bridge’s wheelhouse of believable cross-border team-up territory. (For some, the inclusion of Richard Dahlqvist, a male hack apparently better-looking in real life than his byline pic might have been pushing plausibility a little too far – and that was even before we discovered he had an identical twin brother.) But didn’t it feel a little strange processing all of this stuff with Saga almost completely sidelined from the main story? Saga in the slammer So big bad Mama Norén’s painstaking, vindictive season three plan to frame Saga for her murder (actually a carefully planned suicide) was successful. The first few frames of episode one focused on Saga’s new status quo in a place with lots of bars but no drink, robotically waking up and pulling on shapeless prison-gear instead of her signature leather strides. There were upsides: conjugal visits from Henrik, free pottery classes and fellow lag Elsa seemingly desperate to make friends. But there were many more downsides, such as cop-hating Lucinda Ardic deliberately picking a fight just two days before Saga’s case was due to be reviewed in the light of new evidence (her mum apparently blabbed to a psychologist about wanting to frame her daughter). The reductive way of looking at Saga banged up is that routines have always helped keep her on an even keel. But, as she points out to Henrik, in prison the routines are all imposed, so do little to soothe her psyche in such a fraught environment. In truth, we all probably predicted that Saga would end up getting acquitted: conjugal exchanges of information aside, would it really work if she was locked up for the whole final season? But an unexpected last-minute backstabbing – by timid Elsa rather than tough-as-nails Ardic – suggests that even if Saga survives to episode two, she may be diminished. Henrik: new partner, old demons Meanwhile, on the outside: Henrik has a prickly, sleazy new partner called Jonas Mandrup (played by Mikael Birkkjær, although a million miles away from his role as Birgitte’s ex Philip in Borgen) and the Thormod case weighing heavily on his mind. The Danish security service is taking an interest and it doesn’t really help that the unreconstructed Jonas keeps referring to their main lead, Shirazi, as the “Iranian homo”. For all his ratty intuition and covetable turtlenecks, Jonas is clearly not the partner to bring out the best in Henrik, especially when the tortured tech is agonising over the fate of his two daughters. They have now been missing for eight years and – as Henrik confesses to a support group – he is struggling to achieve any sort of closure. Should he abandon his search? The reappearance of his kids in vivid hallucinations suggests that he needs to do something about his psychic trauma, the quicker the better. Here’s hoping Saga survives her prison perforation to help prop him up. What do we know? Margrethe Thormod, head of the Danish immigration board, was stoned under the Danish side of Øresund bridge by persons unknown. Paramedics estimate it would have taken between 75 and 90 strikes to kill her. Her husband of more than three decades, Niels, collapsed upon hearing the news. Thormod initially went missing after getting a cab to the Dronningen hotel, four hours before she was supposed to catch a flight. The cabbie who dropped her off, Don Brolund, claims she asked him to pick her up an hour later, but she never showed. Radical leftwing group Red October – who previously favoured online rabble-rousing over physical action – were implicated in the killing. Investigative journalist Richard Dahlqvist was approached by a group claiming to be Red October for a clandestine meeting, and he convinced his twin brother, Patrik, to come along as backup. After seemingly being stood up, Richard was kidnapped. Henrik uncovered Brolund’s violent past. The cabbie had an alibi for Thormod’s disappearance but fortuitously managed to track down and terrorise his wife, Sofie, before being warned off at knifepoint by his teen son, Christoffer. Taariq Shirazi, the gay Iranian refugee whose deportation case triggered the champagne scandal, was surviving as a fugitive in Copenhagen, assisted by bar owner (and potential Kenny Rogers stunt double) Silas. Despite being located by Henrik and Jonas, he managed to evade them. Notes and observations The only thing cuter than the wonky mug Saga made in prison pottery class was Henrik’s volcanic reaction to Jonas slagging it off. The sideplot of Sofie and Christoffer being in some sort of ad-hoc witness relocation programme also introduced a wizened white-haired woman apparently looking for new tenants/recruits. Any theories about what her deal might be? Probably no need to tell you that the gay bar, Grotten, where Shirazi sought refuge translates as “cave” (somewhere you are likely to find bears). If you call your online leftwing activist group Red October, you must surely expect to be hunted at some point? The mention of “Matador MP47 Hectorra 3” as an important bit of evidence suggested it could be a weapon of some sort. In fact, it’s a type of fancy sports car tyre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/14/katy-brand-feminism-generation-divide-theatre-3women-play","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"Katy Brand: 'We don’t want to replace men – we just want equal airtime'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/14/katy-brand-feminism-generation-divide-theatre-3women-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/14/katy-brand-feminism-generation-divide-theatre-3women-play","fields":{"headline":"Katy Brand: 'We don’t want to replace men – we just want equal airtime'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I recently gave a talk at a girls’ high school. I mention this not only because I am a virtue-signalling monster but also because one of the young women asked something that brought me up short: “How should we react, as young feminists, to older women who don’t seem to support us?” I sat there and goldfished for a moment, keenly aware that these freshly minted teenage minds sat among their esteemed “older women” teachers. But this is one of the issues I have been grappling with in my debut play, 3Women, which is about three generations of the same family, aged 18, 40, and 65. They come together in an increasingly claustrophobic hotel suite the night before a wedding, ostensibly to enjoy some family bonding time. As more wine is ordered and drunk, the gloves come off, and there are old scores to settle. The drama and comedy of three women getting tipsy and having it out is immensely enjoyable and satisfying to write. But I also wanted the characters – Eleanor, Suzanne and Laurie – to talk about feminism, from a baby boomer’s proud memories of her suffragette grandmother, via the Generation X-era of self-knowledge, self-determination, therapy and healing, to now, with the millennials’ gender fluidity and their future facing dreams of artificial wombs and true equality for all permutations of humanity. So, in answer to the question regarding older women, my immediate response was: “Have a little empathy.” The women of Eleanor’s generation propelled feminism at an incredible pace through the postwar decades, and yet have not always been able to benefit personally and professionally in the ways I have, and those born after me. They were the architects of social change, but they couldn’t live in the house they built because they were still expected to conform to social stereotypes their mothers had to submit to. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be sometimes, even for the most generous of spirit. Let’s listen to those women. In fact, let’s all listen to each other, across the generations. We all have our stories to tell. If we fight, we can’t progress. And there are many vested interests in keeping us fighting. 3Women is a play I have been wanting to write for several years, but as is often the way, other projects came up. I got pregnant and had a baby, and then there are all the other little pressures that life throws at you. Suddenly, last September, I had a strong desire to write it, and write it quickly. And the timing was right. Because the past year has been an immensely inspiring time for me, and for many other women. For the first time ever, I properly reported an incident of sexual harassment. I told a man in the street who demanded a smile that I didn’t feel like it at that precise second. I cut my own hair. (That was a mistake, in hindsight, and a nice man called Engin sorted it out for me. Thanks, Engin – you did what you could.) People keep asking me three things about 3Women. Is it autobiographical? (It’s not.) Is it part of the #MeToo movement? (It’s not about sexual assault, but I am very happy to be part of the broader tapestry of women finding their voices and using them, loudly.) What is the message? I’m not sure how I feel about messages in writing, and there are no thinly veiled agendas here. But there is a backlog of women’s stories to be told, and I am glad to be one of those with the opportunity to address the imbalance. Women don’t want to replace men – we just want equal airtime. But to do that, we must take ownership of our lives – and it’s never too late. In 3Women, all three characters are starting a new chapter – higher education, marriage, a move to another country – because they believe it will make them happy. And, amazingly, the pursuit of happiness is still considered brave, selfish, or even subversive, especially for women. But this is a moment for roaring, for taking what we want, not for being meek and mild. It shouldn’t be an act of courage to have the life you want. It should be easy. It should be normal. It doesn’t have to be this hard. 3Women is at Trafalgar Studios, London, 15 May-9 June.

Overton is the oldest man in America, as well as the oldest US veteran. The Texan is still very much in fighting shape, telling reporters from Dallas News that he has “no pains, no aches”. So, what’s his secret to living a long and healthy life? Well, Overton told reporters sagely: “Don’t die.” Also, it would seem, early starts, cigars and a medicinal tipple. Overton tends to get up with the lark and sometimes smokes more than 12 cigars a day. He’s also fond of a little whiskey, telling Cigar Aficionado that putting a little bourbon in your morning coffee is “like medicine”. Caffeine fans will also be glad to know that Overton is fond of a cup of coffee or four. Overton isn’t the only centenarian to have shared their, occasionally rather dubious, advice for a long life. Here’s some health and diet advice from some of the world’s longest-lived people. Stay away from men In 2015, Jessie Gallan, then Scotland’s oldest woman, told reporters that her “secret to a long life has been staying away from men. They’re just more trouble than they’re worth”. Gallan, who passed away later that year at the grand old age of 109, also advised regularly eating porridge. As it turns out, recommendations that you stay away from men if you would like a long and healthy life are rife. In 2011 Gladys Gough, from England, put her longevity down to never getting married or having a boyfriend. “That probably had something to do with it. I just couldn’t be bothered with men.” Then there’s Leandra Becerra Lumbreras, who died in 2015 at the impressive age of 127. According to her family, the Mexican woman credited her long life, in part, to never getting married. Lots of chocolate and naps Earlier this year Eunice Modlin, from Indiana, celebrated her 102nd birthday. A milestone marked by a lifetime of chocolate and snoozing apparently. “She has two pieces of dark chocolate a day and takes a nap,” her granddaughter explained. Modlin also never smoked or drank, and always got a lot of exercise. But I’m going to swear it’s the napping and chocolate that kept her going. A glass of Guinness a day keeps the doctor away Doris Olive Netting celebrated her 100thbirthday last Friday with a glass of Guinness. The centenarian from Britain says she’s had a glass of Guinness a day for almost 70 years. “She refuses to go a day without drinking it,” her granddaughter told the Sun. Bacon keeps you going When Ruth Benjamin of Marshall, Illinois, turned 109 she put her advanced age down to a stable marriage, not drinking, and a love of bacon. Good news if you’re more of an eggs than a bacon person: Emma Morano, who died aged 117 last year, attributed her longevity to good genes and three eggs a day. Two of which were raw. Basically, don’t die For the record I’d advise against immediately incorporating six G&amp;Ts and lots of chocolate into your daily diet. All of the advice above should probably be taken with a pinch of salt (not too much – sodium is bad for your heart). Ultimately, the only iron-clad advice is Overton’s. Try not to die!

Yep, that's right","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Borrowers will be able to take out a bigger mortgage when buying greener properties for the first time, under a pioneering scheme to encourage energy efficiency. Research has found that factoring in the efficiency of a home into lenders’ affordability calculations could allow them to increase loans by £11,500 because buyers’ electricity and gas bills will be lower. That theory will become reality from June, when Welsh help-to-buy loans will take into account the energy rating of new-build homes worth up to £300,000. The move is one of several innovations being mooted to overcome householders’ inertia on energy efficiency, alongside tax cuts for greener homes. The Welsh government said the change should open up the housing ladder to more people and encourage buyers to consider energy ratings. Rebecca Evans, Wales’s housing minister, said: “We hope to see lenders follow our lead and making energy efficiency part of the mortgage consideration for all homebuyers in Wales.” The Building Research Establishment, which has undertaken research into green mortgages, said it hoped banks and building societies would wake up to the importance of factoring energy use into lending decisions. Andrew Sutton, the group’s associate director, said: “My primary hope is that the mortgage industry reacts.” He said lenders were aware there was a growing argument to factor energy efficiency into their decisions but they were understandably nervous about moving first, and the costs of implementing the changes. Barclays is one of the first to offer a green mortgage product, offering borrowers a discount on the loan’s interest rate on new-builds rated in the top two energy bands, A and B. However, Sutton said the approach also had big potential for existing homes. For example, a homeowner wanting to borrow £10,000 extra on their mortgage for a loft conversion could potentially borrow more if during the work they put in insulation that took the property from an E-rated home to a C-rated one. Such incentives could change the “my home is my castle” mindset that has held back efficiency improvements in privately owned homes, Sutton said. Other carrots have been suggested in recent years to encourage householders to install insulation, from lower stamp duty for efficient homes to council tax discounts for greener properties. Richard Twinn, senior policy adviser at UKGBC, said the Welsh green mortgage scheme was symbolically hugely important but stamp duty would be the real gamechanger. “Stamp duty is probably the single most effective mechanism the government has to apply to this,” he said. The plan would be revenue neutral for the Treasury because duty discounts for buyers choosing more efficient properties would be offset by people paying extra for draughty, inefficient ones. The government is due to announce new policies later this year, potentially in the autumn budget, on how to encourage people to make their homes more efficient. However, Twinn cautioned against high expectations, saying small trials were likely rather than a “big bang” on stamp duty incentives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/windrush-grenfell-suffering","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"From Windrush to Grenfell, the powerful only see tragedy when it suits them | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/windrush-grenfell-suffering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/windrush-grenfell-suffering","fields":{"headline":"From Windrush to Grenfell, the powerful only see tragedy when it suits them","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, leaving the dead floating in the street and the living stranded on highways and rooftops, a huge crowd of mostly black and poor people descended on the city’s convention centre, where the cameras, but little else, were waiting. When asked why relief organisations had been caught off guard, the hapless director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael Brown, responded: “We’re seeing people that we didn’t know exist.” Since the population of New Orleans was well known, a more accurate assessment would have been: “We’re seeing people that we didn’t realise we were supposed to care about.” Such is the nature of scandals in the west involving the marginalised. The outrage emerges not from the revelation that a particular injustice exists. The injustices are usually known, assumed and acknowledged. It was not news that New Orleans had a significant poor, black population that had no means of getting out of the city, any more than it was news that black Americans were being shot dead with impunity, or that in the Mediterranean migrants who could be saved were perishing at sea. We knew. The scandal resides in the popular recognition – often sudden, unpredictable and fleeting – of the humanity in those suffering the injustices. It took the story of Trayvon Martin’s death, his killer’s acquittal, and the body of another black man – also called Michael Brown – being left on the street in Ferguson for four hours before America would finally pay attention. Similarly it took the body of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, a Kurdish Syrian refugee crossing the Mediterranean with his family, to wash up in Bodrum, face down in the surf, for Europe to even begin to engage with the effects of its migration policy. In each case the privileged appear involuntarily struck by a sudden bout of empathy. For a moment, those who are excluded become human beings. A child – not “another refugee” – has drowned; a teenager – not “another black kid” – has been shot. And in that moment a paradigm shifts. A previously supine public demand to know how this could happen, either unaware or uninterested that the polity was taking its cues from them. Politicians, caught flat-footed, wonder when and how the rules changed. They assumed there would be no political price to pay for malign neglect, active mistreatment or flagrant discrimination. For the longest time they were right. They had licence. Worse still, we gave it to them. So the political class made the calculation that some people simply don’t matter and on this basis some live, some die, others stay and some are deported. The fact that these actions are unjustifiable is only relevant if those who make them are called upon to justify them. Sadly, that all too rarely happens. And then, for whatever reason, the dam bursts. People won’t stand for it and suddenly politicians can’t get away with it. Caught trying to rationalise their ambivalence about the pain they have knowingly caused they become evasive, lie or simply try to tough it out with narrowly tailored expressions of regret, in the hope we will all move on. The aftermath of last June’s fire at Grenfell Tower, in London, in which more than 70 died and roughly the same number were injured, has followed this pattern. A calamity of this nature had long been predicted. The local residents opted for fire-resistant cladding but were overruled by the local council because it was deemed too expensive. Earlier this week it transpired that another non-flammable option that would have been cheaper was also rejected. A 2013 inquest into the Lakanal fire in 2009, in which six people were killed in a tower block in Camberwell, south London, found the council “did not prioritise carrying out fire-risk assessments” on residential properties, despite several warnings, and that buildings like Grenfell should be fitted with sprinklers. And then there was the brutally prophetic warning from the Grenfell Action Group seven months before the fire. “[We] have reached the conclusion that only an incident that results in serious loss of life … will allow the external scrutiny to occur that will shine a light on … the malign governance of this non-functioning organisation.” The reason those with power did not act on these warnings is because they deemed those most likely to be affected to be powerless. They were proved wrong. Grenfell Tower triggered a national conversation about social housing, austerity, deregulation, poverty and social exclusion. Those debates have receded from the national gaze, but outrageously, the cladding that made them necessary, has not. Six months after the fire, just three out of 160 social housing tower blocks identified as dangerous were known to have been reclad with safer materials. “We’ve got compassion fatigue, we say, as if we have involuntarily contracted some kind of disease that we’re stuck with no matter what we do,” writes the US academic Susan Moeller. But she argues it is avoidance, not fatigue, that averts our gaze. So we look the other way until another tragic conflagration injects a sense of urgency into our indignation. Similarly, Windrush was only a scandal in so far as those who made it possible got caught and exposed. The Home Office was repeatedly warned by lawyers that some people were being wrongly threatened with deportation and that destroying landing cards would impede someone’s ability to prove how long they had been here. According to one whistleblower, from around 2013 onwards the number of requests from people from the Caribbean for confirmation of their arrival date began to increase. “People were writing to say, ‘I’ve been here 45 years, I’ve never had a passport, I’ve never needed a passport. Now I’m being told I’m not British, because there is no record of me.’” Six months of reporting didn’t budge them. They knew. They just didn’t care. And, until the last couple of weeks, they thought their indifference would not be a problem. What’s encouraging about these moments is that they show a significant constituency is receptive to a more humane kind of politics. What is disconcerting is witnessing how much people have to endure before people speak out and act on what they know to be happening and know to be wrong. “You already know enough,” writes Sven Lindqvist in Exterminate All the Brutes. “So do I. It is not knowledge we lack. What is missing is the courage to understand what we know and to draw conclusions.” • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/may/11/theyre-out-to-get-you-study-finds-cyclists-face-paranoia-about-drivers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"They're out to get you: study finds cyclists face paranoia about drivers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/may/11/theyre-out-to-get-you-study-finds-cyclists-face-paranoia-about-drivers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/may/11/theyre-out-to-get-you-study-finds-cyclists-face-paranoia-about-drivers","fields":{"headline":"They're out to get you: study finds cyclists face paranoia about drivers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As a cyclist in a busy urban environment, it can seem that some drivers are out to get you. And now a new study has concluded that for many bike riders, this is only too true: a sense of paranoia is a clinical reality. The research led by Lyn Ellet, a clinical psychology academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, studied 323 cyclists in London aged between 18-66, and used a series of questions to gauge their levels of paranoia when on a bike. Published in the journal Psychiatry Research, the study found that when measuring so-called state paranoia – how paranoid people feel in a certain situation – 70% of the London cyclists studied expressed at least one of the following feelings about drivers: that they are hostile to me; want to upset me; want to harm me; or have it in for me. In contrast, the study discovered, when measured for trait paranoia – how paranoid people are in general – the cyclists tended to show relatively low levels, and there was no apparent link between riders’ state and trait levels of paranoia. So, what is to blame for such strong feelings, summed up by one participant who is quoted in the study as saying: “I honestly view every driver as if he’s trying to kill me”? It’s seemingly down to the generally feral road conditions faced by cyclists in London (and, you could add, in most other places in the UK, not to mention other countries). The study puts it thus: The present research indicates that paranoia towards motor vehicle users may be common when cycling in London, and that far from being a pathological response, observed state paranoia is an understandable response to an urban environment containing significant and very real threat. The present findings reinforce and add a further dimension to the pressing public health need to focus on and protect urban cyclists. Highlighting this point, the study also looked into reported paranoia among travellers on London’s tube system, another transport method which has its negatives, though very rarely connected to a real personal threat to one’s safety. Here, the study said, state paranoia levels were notably lower, and there was a more general correlation between how paranoid people felt on the tube and their more general levels of paranoia. On the specific feelings expressed by cyclists, 58% felt drivers were hostile to them; 45% believed drivers wanted to upset them; 29% thought drivers wanted to harm them; and 50% said of drivers that they “have it in for me”. I fully understand these sentiments, though I perhaps feel a bit differently. I don’t generally think drivers are deliberately out to harm, harass or upset me – with the important caveat that this does very occasionally happen. Instead, what terrifies me is the lack of care, the casual approach to taking risks against a desperately vulnerable human on a bike by someone safely encased in a tonne of protective steel. This casual approach to others’ peril was eloquently expressed in the early 1950s by Alan Lennox-Boyd, at the time the transport minister in Winston Churchill’s government. He said: Accidents in the main arise from the taking of very small risks a very large number of times. A thousand-to-one chance against an accident may not be rated very high, but for every thousand people that take it there will be an accident. (As an aside it’s worth noting that several decades later, aged 78, Lennox-Boyd was killed by a car when trying to cross Fulham Road on foot. It’s not clear if the driver was taking one of those thousand-to-one chances, for example by speeding.) The vital point to stress is that pretty much everyone on the roads does take such risks, and often in several modes of transport. On foot you might nip across the road as a car approaches while checking your email; on a bike you might slip through a narrow gap, or chance a light on amber; in a car you could go too fast, or glance down when a phone message flashes. The one difference comes in terms of physics: it’s only in charge of a motor vehicle when we have a realistic chance of killing or maiming another human. It is not an equal interaction. And this is the key lesson, I’d argue, about the paranoia study: if anything is out to get you, it’s a road system still overly skewed towards the flow of motor traffic, rather than the safety of the most vulnerable road users. And that’s what needs to change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/aug/25/sean-connery-at-90-appreciation-peter-bradshaw-james-bond","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-25T07:26:22Z","webTitle":"Sean Connery: a dangerously seductive icon of masculinity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/25/sean-connery-at-90-appreciation-peter-bradshaw-james-bond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/aug/25/sean-connery-at-90-appreciation-peter-bradshaw-james-bond","fields":{"headline":"Sean Connery: a dangerously seductive icon of masculinity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is the most famous self-introduction from any character in movie history. Three cool monosyllables, surname first, a little curtly, as befits a former naval commander. And then, as if in afterthought, the first name, followed by the surname again – for all the world as if we needed it narrowed down, and wouldn’t recognise one of the world’s most famous fictional brands. Sean Connery carried it off with icily disdainful style, perhaps at the baccarat table, in full evening dress with a cigarette hanging from his lips. The introduction was a kind of challenge, or seduction, invariably addressed to an enemy. And the subtly anglicised Edinburgh accent, which appeared to soften or muddy those monosyllables, encouraged legions of comics and pub bores to think that they, too, could do the voice. In the early 60s, Connery’s James Bond was about as dangerous and sexy as it got on screen – until directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Sidney Lumet came along, and saw how Connery’s on-screen menace could be taken to the next level. Connery became James Bond in 1962 after minor roles in British movies and an appearance in a Walt Disney whimsy called Darby O’Gill and the Little People. As 007, he was an instant, staggering success – conveying exactly the right dangerous sexiness and borderline-sociopathic capacity for disciplined violence – much mocked, much drooled over. The former milkman and bodybuilder was the working-class Bond, a Bond who had come up through the ranks, though director Terence Young reputedly schooled him in the ways of classiness: how to dress, how to light a cigarette. Connery’s natural muscular power and wry humour modified the elegance and eccentricity of Bond in just the right way. Ian Fleming was sufficiently impressed to fabricate Scottish roots for Bond in subsequent books. As much as the Beatles, it was Connery’s charismatic Bond who kept alive Britain’s postwar amour-propre. Does Britain appear to be waning pathetically on the world stage? Oh no. Britain is still powerful – but in secret, you see, like 007. Connery’s Bond created the notion that the soft-culture brand image, the tricks and the toys, the gadgets and the cars, could be just as potent as real power and wealth. He played the role seven times, in Dr No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and then two afterthought Bonds, Diamonds Are Forever (1971), when his hairline appeared suddenly to come forward after some years of retreat, and Never Say Never Again (1983), effectively a retread of Thunderball. His public image was merged with that of 007, and he accepted this burden with the same dangerously simmering resentment and controlled anger that made him such a glorious success as Bond. Perhaps only Daniel Radcliffe has experienced the same utter immersion or self-annihilation. Connery went on to great things outside Her Majesty’s Secret Service – but it took a while. Long after he had handed in his gun and renounced his double-O licence, Connery maintained the prerogative of sexiness. For the 1999 heist caper Entrapment, nearing 70, Connery was considered an entirely plausible action lead and romantic partner for the 30-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones. His appearance in Hitchcock’s Marnie in 1964 focused on the dark side that had been nurtured in the Bond franchise, but without the justification of missions on the secret service, it looked more unsettling. His wealthy publisher Mark Rutland is arrogant, possessive – and a rapist. The saturnine darkness of Connery answers the strangeness and anxieties in Tippi Hedren’s mysterious Marnie. The other great Connery picture from the Bond years was Sidney Lumet’s brutal The Hill (1965), in which he plays a soldier sent to a military prison camp in the Libyan desert and forced, with the others, to endure sadistic punishments such as climbing a man-made “hill” in full pack in the burning sun. This role showcased the rougher, tougher side of the young Connery that 007 had smoothed away somewhat. The 70s were a mixed bag for Connery. He appeared as the mysterious exterminator Zed in John Boorman’s cult sci-fi Zardoz (1974), and the famous image of Connery in a bizarre red posing pouch and thigh-length boots is something that has tested the faith of Connery fans for decades. He had another brilliant, brutal role in Sidney Lumet’s The Offence (1971) as a cop who has murdered a suspected child molester during interrogation and whose motivations are gradually disclosed in flashback. He had two other great films in this period. John Huston’s The Man Who Would Be King (1975) was a classic epic in the Lean style, based on the Kipling novella, in which Connery and Michael Caine play British ex-military chancers Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan. Trying their luck in the land of Kafiristan, they look to become staggeringly wealthy when the credulous natives mistake them for gods. Richard Lester’s Robin and Marian (1976) found a quieter, gentler register in Connery, owning up to his advancing years, really for the first time in his career – playing the ageing Robin Hood, opposite Audrey Hepburn’s Marian. The 80s saw Sean Connery in various autumnal and humorously self-deprecating moods. His simmer and smoulder had aged well into a potent maturity – Connery endured endless “single malt” analogies from well-meaning interviewers – and that baldness, once feared, looked like authentic masculinity. He played Agamemnon in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981), and he also won a much-merited Academy Award for best supporting actor in Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables (1987), playing the courageous, straight-arrow cop Jimmy Malone, who helps Kevin Costner’s Eliot Ness take on Al Capone, played by Robert De Niro. Connery’s comic chops were on display playing Professor Henry Jones, disapproving dad of Indiana Jones, in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) – though Connery was only 12 years older than Ford. There were other roles, and Connery contributed to Finding Forrester (2000) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) with great aplomb. By this time, his legendary status, quite distinct from Bond, was something he carried around with him. I’ve met Sean Connery just once, in 1999, at the Edinburgh film festival, of which he was patron, introduced to him by the festival’s then artistic director Lizzie Francke. Unlike other men of his age, Connery seemed to have got taller with his years, and I remember almost leaning back to look up at him, as if trying to see the flagstaff atop a famous building – although that was maybe just natural awe. He stood as still as a statue at those public red-carpet events, and let the guests and the paparazzi come to him. I remember him saying to me, crisply, and with a formidable air of daring me to disagree: “Lynne Ramsay’s Ratcatcher is a great film.” It was the opening film at Edinburgh that year. Of course I agreed, but could think of nothing worthwhile to do or say other than to open and close my mouth idiotically, like a goldfish, and finally squeak “Yes.” After a second or two, Sir Sean turned and resumed his conversation with Lizzie, accustomed to this sort of encounter with gobsmacked male journalists. But I’m glad I said something to this legendary figure – and didn’t try to introduce myself formally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/10/scottish-parliament-likely-to-reject-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T15:01:03Z","webTitle":"Scottish parliament likely to reject EU withdrawal bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/10/scottish-parliament-likely-to-reject-eu-withdrawal-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/10/scottish-parliament-likely-to-reject-eu-withdrawal-bill","fields":{"headline":"Scottish parliament likely to reject EU withdrawal bill","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Scottish parliament is expected to reject the UK government’s plans for sharing EU powers after Brexit, increasing pressure on Theresa May to offer further compromises. A large majority of MSPs are likely to back calls by the Scottish government to reject the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday after Holyrood’s constitution committee said the UK government’s proposals were unacceptable. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister who is effectively deputy prime minister, is expected to make a further appeal for a political solution on Friday when he addresses business leaders at a CBI Scotland lunch in Edinburgh. MSPs will vote on whether to give the EU withdrawal bill their legislative consent, under a convention agreed in 1998 where an act of parliament at Westminster affecting the Scottish parliament’s powers should get Holyrood’s prior agreement. That vote is not binding on the UK government but it threatens to force the prime minister into making a highly controversial political decision to impose Westminster legislation on Scotland against Holyrood’s will. Unless the two sides reach an agreement before the bill is finally passed by the Commons next month, the dispute will also end up in the UK supreme court at a hearing already set for late July. It adds significantly to May’s problems with the legislation after she suffered a series of defeats on her Brexit plans in the Lords and is attempting to heal deep rifts inside her cabinet over the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, was pressed several times on Thursday to say whether his government would impose the measures on Scotland by Joan McAlpine, convenor of Holyrood’s culture and external affairs committee. Mundell refused to say because he wanted to wait for the result of next Tuesday’s vote but he indicated that if no agreement was reached, the UK government would implement the consultative mechanism that the Welsh government agreed to last month. The long-running dispute between the Scottish and UK governments centres on how they will jointly manage 24 areas such as food quality, toxic chemicals and farm subsidies after Brexit, through a series of joint frameworks. Backed by the Labour group at Holyrood, the Lib Dems and the Scottish Greens, the Scottish government insists that none of these joint frameworks can be changed without Holyrood’s express consent. The UK government says that gives Holyrood an effective veto over policies operating at UK level and affect the devolved legislatures in Wales and Northern Ireland too equally. Instead, the UK and Welsh governments have agreed that the devolved legislatures will be consulted on any changes, on the understanding nothing will change without consent. Those measures are also being introduced in Northern Ireland because the UK government is in control at Stormont after its power-sharing executive collapsed last year. Mundell told the culture committee the dispute with the Scottish government was “a pinhead constitutional argument” since ministers in Edinburgh had already agreed that the 24 areas needed joint agreement at UK level. Bruce Crawford, convener of Holyrood’s constitution committee, said they were “deeply concerned” that the EU withdrawal bill did not require the UK to get Scottish consent. “There is scope for a reasonable solution to be found. If there is parity and both governments are treated equally, and both are bound by political agreement, then this can be amicably resolved,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-innovations-we-need-for-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T13:30:29Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2017-18 review: innovations we need for the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-innovations-we-need-for-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-innovations-we-need-for-the-future","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2017-18 review: innovations we need for the future","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Injury bins There is a coming-together on the pitch, perhaps two players rising to contest a high ball or a player on the run being dispossessed by a sliding challenge. One, whose team are leading, stays down. He appears to be in pain. The physio is beckoned on and kneels over his man to administer treatment. After a while the ailing player is helped to his feet and is led, limping gingerly and wincing in apparent agony, from the field. But it is as if an invisible, all-healing forcefield rings the pitch, because the moment he hobbles across the white line he spins and demands to return to the fray. The referee waves him on and he sprints back to his position, suddenly in rude health. Attempting to deceive the referee by feigning injury is a bookable offence, for unsporting behaviour, but in these circumstances it is absolutely never punished, and not only does this tactic steal chunks of action from almost every match it often interrupts the flow, divesting teams of momentum. It is, in short, cheating, and annoying. Unless officials can properly enforce the law concerning unsporting behaviour, even retrospectively, another option is required. So how about giving each stricken player 60 seconds to get on with play, after which – unless they are bleeding, in which case they are already forced off the pitch for as long as it takes to stem the flow – they are obliged to leave the field for a period of no less than five minutes. You never know, the idea of placing your team at a numerical advantage might prove to have surprising restorative powers. Close of play hooters To aid the tension and uncertainty that surrounds stoppage time, I offer a simple proposition, borrowed from rugby league: as soon as the referee believes that sufficient additional time has been played at the end of each half, an aggressively loud hooter is sounded. From that point, play continues indefinitely until the ball goes out of play (fouls conceded by the team not in possession don’t count – you can’t just kick someone to end a match), at which point the half/game is over. This is probably only a very marginal improvement on the status quo, and many matches would end with nothing more dramatic than the player in possession when the hooter sounds immediately blootering the ball into row Z, but in certain close-fought games I believe it would add a pleasing bonus period of total chaos. Action against begging fans An unpleasant recent novelty has been a rise in the number of young fans going to games with signs beseeching a particular player to give them his shirt. Why do you want a dirty shirt? It’s just another thing in a world full of things. If you go home and try to tidy your bedroom, you’ll find you’ve already got more than enough things. And dirty shirts aren’t even good things. Creating a shirt-begging sign suggests an expectation that a free shirt might be the result; from that moment if he or she does get the shirt the moment will have been stripped of innocence and spontaneity, and if they end the day empty-handed they will be disappointed. I’m not suggesting players shouldn’t give away their shirts, however dirty and useless they are. The point is, and this is something I believe very strongly, children who go to matches with signs asking for things are precisely the children who should not be given things."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/13/the-whale-ustinov-bath-nightfall-bridge-an-ideal-husband-vaudeville-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: The Whale; Nightfall; An Ideal Husband – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/13/the-whale-ustinov-bath-nightfall-bridge-an-ideal-husband-vaudeville-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/13/the-whale-ustinov-bath-nightfall-bridge-an-ideal-husband-vaudeville-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: The Whale; Nightfall; An Ideal Husband – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are few bigger theatrical wallops than a large story in a small space. Laurence Boswell’s production of The Whale is exactly that. The tiny and brilliantly adventurous Ustinov, where Boswell is artistic director, has put on a stream of bright new work – including The Father and Intimate Apparel. Samuel D Hunter’s play, first seen off-Broadway in 2012, is the most capacious drama I have seen for ages. It is dominated by the idea of Moby-Dick; it contains Mormons, furious children abandoned by parents, a man who leaves his wife for a gay lover, notes on how to write a literary essay. Oh, and the central figure is morbidly obese. Shuler Hensley, who starred in the original production, is superb as the man whose disappointment can be measured in layers of fat. Round as a top, he is beached in his room: Tim Shortall’s design perches a scuzzy bed in front of videos of waves. He is mourning the death of his lover, racked at the damage he has caused the family he deserted, and teaching English literature online: “Do your students know what you look like?” barks his alarming daughter, who turns up to goad him. Every movement involves a wheeze and the risk of a fall; every memory brings regrets; his face looks as if it is about to melt. Yet he is vivid with two qualities often considered incompatible: a sweet nature and a questing intelligence. Although there is no maudlin happy ending, there is constant energy: from Hunter’s writing and from Boswell’s production, which features sceptical bursts of brass between scenes. In an exceptionally strong cast, Rosie Sheehy is a knockout as the clever teenager fuelled by fury. Unstintingly snarling, she has a hate blog on which she disses her family and her contemporaries (she has no friends); her favourite word is “retard”. There is no hint of sentimentality in her performance: a rat-a-tat-delivery, a sullen stare, her whole body shaped like an insult, and just once a glimmer of grief beneath it all. Sheehy is one of the finds of the year. Put a small play on a large stage and you end up with a whimper. On the beautiful wide space of the Bridge – increasingly alluring in the summer as the theatre opens out to the riverside – Barney Norris’s new play promises big things. A study of unhappiness and entrapment in a fading rural landscape, Nightfall is part of the theatre’s increasing fascination with the countryside – as seen in Jerusalem and more recently Albion. Rae Smith’s design and Chris Davey’s lighting – both outstanding – create a place that is both familiar and apocalyptic. A massive rusting oil pipe, big enough to contain a whole cast of characters, slices across the back of a quiet smallholding: it might have been wrenched from a Tate Modern installation. As the play opens, two lads are tapping into it: sparks fly, like reflections of the stars above. They are the fizziest things in a desultory evening. Norris is still in his early 30s and will write stronger plays than this. A busy backstory – a family felled by bereavement, a terrible crime and a cover-up, a manipulative mother and inexplicably passive grownup children – does not translate into urgency of action or feeling in Laurie Sansom’s sauntering production. This is also the first time I can remember in a professional theatre that I’ve been unable to hear what was being uttered. These are four good actors – Ophelia Lovibond, Ukweli Roach, Claire Skinner and Sion Daniel Young – but they are performing with more delicacy than power. There is greater gusto in the latest play in Classic Spring’s Oscar Wilde season. Apart from anything else, here is Frances Barber, so scarlet as a vamping villainess that she might have jumped off a playing card, and Edward Fox as an aristo dad, his every crease stiff with entitlement. An Ideal Husband, first staged in 1895 when Wilde was struggling financially, contains one of his best and most provoking lines: ‘‘Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike.” It also contains a key to Wilde’s plays: “As a rule everyone turns out to be someone else.” The disguise here is an ingenious misleading of the audience: a question of which character will actually behave most decently. The upright husband of the title, a politician, turns out to have founded his fortune on treachery: years ago he sold a cabinet secret; now he risks exposure. It is the most preening and flippant of characters who behaves with probity and generosity. Jonathan Church’s clear, stately production neatly brings out the paradoxes. In one respect it excels. Freddie Fox, playing the son of his real-life father, is exquisite as a creamily contemptuous dandy who seems likely to prove a loving spouse. It is a performance full of inventive grace notes – buffing his nails, aiming a kick at his father’s back – but also strong and direct. Wilde claimed that there was no one like the author in An Ideal Husband. Fox made me feel sure he was fibbing about that.

So over the top of the pick-pack-pock-puck of the practising batsmen there was the sound of workmen hammering and drilling, fixing loudspeakers on the scaffold grandstands and new hoardings around the impermanent pavilion. Down the road a man was putting a fresh coat of paint on the railings by the station. The Irish have been waiting, working, a long time for this first Test match and want everything to go just so. “It’s been quite a while building up to this since it was announced,” said Ireland’s captain, William Porterfield. “I am sure there will be a lot of different emotions that will flow through everyone in the next 24 hours.” Mainly excitement, he said, but some anxiety, too. The pitch is green, the forecast awful and Pakistan have a formidable attack. Ireland aren’t short of first-class experience – they’ve more of that than this callow Pakistan side – but Boyd Rankin is the only man among them who has ever played a Test. So even Porterfield, 33, and Ed Joyce, 39, aren’t quite sure how they will handle it all. The team had a long chat with Marcus Trescothick after their warm-up match against Somerset to get a better idea about what to expect. “He talked about the experience of playing Test cricket and how the standard is just that little higher than county cricket, how it’s more relentless,” Porterfield said. It was nothing they had not heard before from their coach, Graham Ford, but Porterfield still found it reassuring. The captain and his team are acutely aware that they are not just representing themselves, but all the Irish cricketers before them, the men who never had the chance to play a Test. “It would be remiss if we didn’t talk about everything that has gone before us. Not only over the last five or 10 years, which everyone remembers, but about every cricketer who has ever played for Ireland. On and off the pitch, administrators and a lot of people have devoted a lot of their lives to make this happen.” Cricket has a long history in Ireland. There were playing in Phoenix Park back in 1730, and by 1860 it had become one of the most popular sports in the country. There were around 300 clubs in Ireland at that point and the national team waswere strong enough to beat MCC by an innings at Lord’s in 1858. Everything started to change when the Gaelic Athletic Association was formed in 1884, and then, at the turn of the 20th century, banned GAA members from playing or attending foreign sports. Back then, there wasn’t an Irish Cricket Union to protect or promote the sport. As a result the game, so strongly associated with England, dwindled in popularity. It became a minority sport, played in patches of Northern Ireland and middle-class areas of Dublin and Cork. The national team played annual matches against Scotland and tour games against counties and countries. They won some famous victories, against South Africa in 1904, West Indies in 1928 and 1969. But they were seen as beer matches. Even in the 1990s, when Cricket Ireland finally appointed their first full-time coach, Mike Hendrick, the game was an amateur affair, and often as not the players would have to covering their own costs. When Adrian Birrell took over as coach in 2002, he was told the boot of his company car was supposed to double up as a storeroom for the team’s kit. When Warren Deutrom became the chief executive in 2006, he was the board’s only full-time member of staff, with a part-time PA who worked four mornings a week. It is fitting that Pakistan are their opponents in this first Test, since they were the team Ireland beat in their breakthrough game, on St Patrick’s Day at the 2007 World Cup, a three-wicket victory that put them on the front pages and to the forefront of associate cricket. After that, Deutrom pushed through the modernisation of the sport. The first professional contracts followed in 2009, an interprovincial domestic competition was launched in 2013 and now, 11 years after that win in Jamaica, they are at last being allowed to play Test cricket. Porterfield played in that famous match in 2007. “It’s obviously been a long journey,” he said, “but in some ways a pretty quick journey as well.” When Porterfield started, Ireland did not even have ODI status, “now tomorrow we’re going out there and playing the first Test match for Ireland”. Along the way there has been, he said, “a long banging of the drum”. And now it’s done, there’s excitement, anxiety, and more than either of those, the gratitude. “It just culminates with us being lucky enough at the time of our careers to be able to take the pitch to play that first Test match.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/may/13/ronan-farrow-interview-woody-allen-harvey-weinstein-me-too","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T06:45:43Z","webTitle":"Ronan Farrow: Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein and me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/13/ronan-farrow-interview-woody-allen-harvey-weinstein-me-too","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/13/ronan-farrow-interview-woody-allen-harvey-weinstein-me-too","fields":{"headline":"Ronan Farrow: Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein and me","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Thanks for taking the time,” says Ronan Farrow when we meet at a central London hotel. Farrow is the journalist whose exposé of Harvey Weinstein helped kickstart the #MeToo movement. Just 30 years old, he looks, up close, about 13. But he has packed into his three decades more adventures and achievements than most of us could manage in two lifetimes. Of course he had a head start. He was the only biological child of two extremely famous people: Woody Allen, arguably America’s most celebrated living film-maker, and Mia Farrow, herself a child of Hollywood royalty, star of many films and ex-wife of Frank Sinatra. By the time that he was five, Ronan had witnessed his parents’ epically bitter break-up, his father’s new relationship with his 22-year-old sister (Farrow’s adopted daughter) Soon-Yi (the cause of the vicious split), and the allegations that his father had sexually abused his seven-year-old adopted sister Dylan Farrow. A court case and custody battle ensued in the relentless glare of the world’s media. These were, to say the least, formative experiences, but there were plenty more to come in Ronan’s childhood. First off, his mother adopted five more children after the split with Allen, bringing her brood to 14, some of them disabled or suffering from serious illness. One, named Tam, died of heart failure when Ronan was seven. By the time he was 11 the young Farrow was at university studying for a degree, a double major in philosophy and biology. At 16 he was enrolled at the prestigious Yale law school. In the meantime he’d been travelling with his mother to places like Sudan, Liberia and Angola on humanitarian missions. Allen made a living out of joking about his fears of the world beyond the urban sophistication of Manhattan and spent a lifetime in analysis discussing his neuroses. His son seems made of sterner stuff, but that was still a lot to process for a child. Yet, if anything, the 15 years that followed have been even more incident‑packed. When he’d just turned 21, his sister Lark Previn (adopted by Farrow when she was married to the conductor André Previn), died after a decade-long illness. Finishing his law degree, he worked for former US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, when he was special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. After Holbrooke died, Farrow became secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s special adviser on global youth issues, before taking a summer role as the “visiting scientist” at the Centre for Disease Control in Nairobi. Next he won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University, where he began a philosophy doctorate. All along he was writing journalism for a variety of publications, and after Oxford he hosted his own TV show, Ronan Farrow Daily, on MSNBC and then an investigative section on NBC’s Today. It was while working on the NBC show that he began looking into rumours and allegations that the film producer Harvey Weinstein had sexually abused a number of women. When NBC showed its reluctance to take on Weinstein, Farrow took his story to the New Yorker, and the rest is history. In any case, for his considerable efforts Farrow and the New Yorker shared with the New York Times a Pulitzer prize, the highest award in American journalism. And if all that’s not enough, Farrow has just published a hefty 400-page book called War on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence. It’s a sober and rather thoughtful account of his experience working for Holbrooke and how the creeping militarisation of US foreign policy has undermined and curtailed diplomatic initiatives with self-defeating results. That’s why he’s sitting before me in the Soho hotel, in a natty black suit and immaculately pressed shirt with sunless white skin and striking blue eyes – to talk about the book. The day before I meet Farrow, the New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman had announced his resignation, after a piece by Farrow and Jane Mayer in the New Yorker documented allegations that Schneiderman, a vocal critic of Weinstein and staunch defender of women’s rights, had himself assaulted several women. Just before that, another story by Farrow had presented evidence that the private intelligence agency Black Cube, which was employed by Weinstein to gather negative information on his accusers, had also been recruited to find damaging information on proponents of the Iran nuclear deal in the Obama administration. A day later President Trump announced that he was withdrawing US support for the deal. Suddenly global news and Farrow’s preoccupations seem indistinguishable, as if international diplomacy and sexual abuse by powerful men were all part of a great interlocked conspiracy. Did it seem to him that his interests were converging into one enormous story? “I was in a briefing with a number of reporters and a source recently,” he says. “And one of the journalists present said: It’s not stories plural, it’s all one big story. And I think there’s some truth to that. With respect to the reporting I’ve been doing specifically, you’re looking at the very same systems of power and the abuse of power and the suppression of stories that are employed by powerful men in Hollywood and powerful people in politics.” The book is a compelling mixture of political analysis and personal anecdote written in a reflective, almost nostalgic tone that betrays none of the doubt and uncertainty or zeal and tunnel vision that are the common characteristics of youth. Instead his sympathetic but critical portraits of Holbrooke and Clinton seem the product of a mind that is old before its time. The prose is steeped in a kind of worked-at maturity, a moral seriousness of the sort that his father instinctively made fun of. If Allen was always the overgrown child, ridiculing the responsibilities of adulthood, then Farrow is the premature grownup, earnestly trying to make the world a better place. In his book Farrow records an outburst from the flamboyant Holbrooke in which the veteran diplomat took his acolyte to task for his inflated sense of self. “I know you think you have destiny. That you’ll do great things,” Holbrooke told him. Had he ever thought of himself in those terms? “I think the point was he was really describing himself,” he says. Yes, perhaps, but was he not also describing you? “I don’t particularly view myself as someone who must ascend to a particular status or place in history. I would be foolish to claim that I am not ambitious. I am someone who works around the clock. But it’s a very different kind of ambition to Richard Holbrooke’s. I always have a little voice on my shoulder from my childhood, and probably from my mother and the kind of family she built. It was very much rooted in altruism and I admire that tremendously and I would not have the strength to do it myself, but it did give me this sort of inherited sense of public service.” He does indeed appear to be a workaholic. His private life is low-key, when he’s not hanging out with celebrities, though he is said to be in a relationship with former Obama speechwriter and popular liberal podcaster Jon Lovett. But, as he says, it’s public service that he prefers to focus on and one aspect of that is a warning, voiced in his book, that the world is going backwards because of diminishing US foreign influence. To many people around the globe that diminishment can only be a good thing. But Farrow makes a strong case for the benefits of long-term strategic American diplomacy of the kind, he says, that is being crushed by the White House. To those who see any American influence, however benign, as a sign of imperialism, Farrow has a chastening message. “There’s a lot of positive leadership in the world today,” he says, “but the problem is that we’re not witnessing the withdrawal of America from diplomatic leadership and the succession into that space of Angela Merkel. We are witnessing China nipping at the heels of the western powers and coming into its own in a lot of ways in diplomatic leadership but still very much evincing a retrograde set of attitudes on human rights.” He talks about China’s leadership deserving close scrutiny, which is a much more restrained turn of phrase than the language he was using back in 2008, when he declared the Beijing Games “the genocide Olympics”, as a result of China’s malign role in Sudan. Now he notes how hard the Chinese are working, making investment in infrastructure in countries around the world where “the US doesn’t even have ambassadors any more”. He writes in his book of how Trump has accelerated this process, but also how it’s been a growing part of US politics under several administrations, including that of Nobel peace prize winner Barack Obama. Farrow argues that Obama centralised power at the expense of diplomats in the state department, and talks about a “celebrity general” culture, with the military gaining too much influence on decision-making abroad, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But he also praises Obama for the Iran nuclear deal that Trump has just torn up, the thaw in relations with Cuba that Trump is threatening to reverse and the Paris climate change accords, which Trump has already committed to leave. Although he’s too diplomatic to say it, Trump is the embodiment of everything that Farrow abhors. It seems at best paradoxical that a nation that has been thrown into self-analysis as a result of the Weinstein revelation could have voted for someone who revelled in the language of sexual harassment. “I think if anything those two facts are closely related and quite consistent,” he says. “I think a lot of survivors of sexual violence and particularly women felt that the election of Donald Trump was a rebuke or a return to a time in which these sorts of stories were not heard or cared about. And I think the political backdrop absolutely informed the frustration of survivors who finally felt they couldn’t wait any longer to speak.” It’s typical of the answers he gives during our interview: articulate, heartfelt and yet a little rehearsed. The effect is like listening to a series of right-thinking summaries – perfectly reasoned but a touch preachy. But then Farrow has been at the frontline of a moral crusade that has not only inspired millions of women across the world but also features people – mostly women – who have suffered real and sometimes appalling abuse. That position comes with a certain responsibility and Farrow wears it with a solemn authority. For example, when I ask him if he is now being approached by many people with stories of abuse, he says: “I do field a fair amount of incoming leads and I’m profoundly grateful for that, and anyone reading this story, if you have an experience or a bit of knowledge that is of international newsworthiness, please do email me. My email is on my Twitter account.” That “international newsworthiness” is not ironic. It’s the plane on which he operates, and he’s not about to pretend otherwise. I suggest that the history and nature of journalism means that the emphasis is on getting the story rather than offering ongoing support to traumatised sources. Can a journalist who often works 18-hour days and admits to never seeing friends really provide much by way of aftercare? “The answer is I absolutely feel an ongoing obligation to every source that was brave enough to help expose injustice, and that obligation doesn’t end on the day that the story is published. I think if you ask any of the sources who have worked with me on these very difficult stories – and these relationships are not always easy because these stories have an explosive impact on their lives – they’ll tell you I am there for them to take the late-night calls and there to work with them if there is fallout, and my heart breaks for them when there’s a high cost of telling these stories. But mostly I’ve found that I’ve had the opportunity to celebrate them healing as a result of telling these stories.” As Farrow rightly points out, the cases he has reported on involve allegations of serious crimes that should not be confused with the “grey area” of bad dates and misinterpreted signals. He doesn’t agree with some of the more vehement activists who insist that all women who say they have been raped or sexually abused should be automatically believed. “My job is to interrogate as thoroughly and as sceptically as possible every allegation that is in a story I’m reporting and to, in an almost legalistic way, stress-test those claims. And I have very difficult conversations explaining to the very brave sources in those stories that the best armour that they can have as a source is my sceptical interrogation of their allegations.” Farrow remains measured and dispassionately meticulous in his analysis as we discuss the various complications that surround issues of sexual abuse – the power and influence of the abuser, the vulnerability of the abused, the harsh legal process. He only begins to look a little flustered when the subject turns to his sister Dylan’s allegations of molestation at the hands of their father, Allen, which Farrow himself introduces into the conversation. When listing the various antecedents, including the Bill Cosby case, that led up to the #MeToo moment, Farrow cited his sister, who “came forward with a very difficult allegation against a powerful man that she had maintained for years but felt the need to speak about again”. I couldn’t help but notice that the unnamed “powerful man” was Dylan’s own father, Woody Allen, although in this most complicated of families, even that fact is open to question, courtesy of a comment made by Mia Farrow in a 2013 Vanity Fair interview. She told the writer Maureen Orth that Ronan was “possibly” Frank Sinatra’s child. Ever since, people have drawn attention to the resemblance between Ol’ Blue Eyes and Young Blue Eyes. It’s more apparent in photographs than in the flesh, where it’s obvious that the person Farrow most looks like is his mother. In any case Dylan’s allegations, which now date back 26 years, remain the subject of dispute. Allen has always denied them. There isn’t room here to cover all the details, but suffice to say that it centres on a visit Allen paid to Mia Farrow’s home in Bridgewater, Connecticut in August 1992. Dylan said soon afterwards and continues to say that Allen assaulted her in an attic. The Connecticut state attorney investigated but did not press charges and the New York department of social services found “no credible evidence” to support the allegations. However when Allen sought to gain sole custody of Dylan, Ronan and their brother Moses, the judge censured Allen and he was denied visitation rights with Dylan. He was only allowed to see her under strict supervision. In such circumstances, where there is no certainty over what took place (the court-appointed child sexual abuse expert at the custody case suggested it was likely that Mia Farrow coached her daughter – but the judge was critical of the expert’s report), I wondered what the responsibility was of society at large. Since the Weinstein revelations, a number of actors, including Rebecca Hall, Colin Firth and Greta Gerwig, have announced that they would never work with Allen again. Is there a danger, I asked, that the presumption of innocence was being cast aside in a fever of (belated) righteous indignation? “That’s absolutely not a fair characterisation of the facts,” snaps Farrow, suddenly flashing an inner steeliness. “There is an abundance of evidence that Woody Allen was engaged in a pattern with respect to underage women and that’s in the trove of documents the Washington Post uncovered; it’s in the civil proceedings that happened and the family court proceedings that happened in New York, where there was intense debate about the age of my other sister he was engaging in sexual relations with in our household. This was a serial fixator on underage girls. Now if your suggestion is that every single allegation worth reporting has to be a massive case of serial rape on the scale of Harvey Weinstein, I don’t agree with that premise.” It’s relevant though because in the open letter from Dylan that was published online in the New York Times in 2014, in which she reasserted the original allegations against her father, she criticised the actors who stood by Allen and acted in his films. I restate the question, simply noting that there is as far as I’m aware no criminal case being mounted against Allen – so how should society treat him? “I would say the individuals in that category are many. Harvey Weinstein is in exactly the same category. These are claims that have not been interrogated to the point of a final legal disposition.” That’s true, but earlier he had told me that he was “talking to accusers of Harvey Weinstein right now who are being asked by law enforcement in various jurisdictions to be at the heart of criminal proceedings”. Again, that doesn’t seem to be the case with Allen. “Look, the jig is not up until we all lay down to die. There are going to be criminal repercussions for I think a number of men around whom there has been credible reporting on these kinds of allegations. And Woody Allen is in that category. I think people who ask the kinds of question you just asked very often haven’t read into the investigative reporting around it. “If you look at Andy Thibault’s exhaustive reporting in Connecticut Magazine back in the day or Maureen Orth’s investigative reporting, it’s very clear that it is towards the end of the most heavily corroborated cases that have emerged publicly. Otherwise I wouldn’t have spoken out in support of my sister. “I think in terms of society’s obligation to react to individuals who have not been convicted, like a Harvey Weinstein or a Woody Allen or for many years Bill Cosby, it’s absolutely correct to draw the distinction that you’re talking about a man who hasn’t been convicted in a court of law – until they have been. And I always note that distinction. The separate issue of whether people should boycott a person professionally is a personal decision. Clearly many people, including my sister, feel strongly that people shouldn’t work with these individuals. I’ve highlighted that survivors feel that way, and that it makes them feel invisible and marginalised when people validate individuals with a very serious cloud of suspicion over them, but I haven’t particularly called for a boycott of anyone.” It’s a great speech, full of conviction and supporting argument. I can’t claim to know whether he’s right or wrong in his assessment of his father. What’s beyond doubt is that Allen acted in a profoundly creepy fashion in starting an affair with Farrow’s sister. It also, one can imagine, would have had a destabilising impact on a young boy working out his place in the world. As Farrow himself once noted: “He’s my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.” And Farrow, you sense, is a deeply moral person. He is also a deeply ambitious one. At the moment he’s setting the news agenda with a series of incendiary stories, and there’s talk of him getting his own investigative TV show. But I’m not sure that this young man who has already experienced so much will be content to restrict himself to journalism. If the opportunity arose, would he not prefer to have a big career in politics? He’s ready, as ever, with a political answer. “I think quite aside from anything else,” he says, “I’ve made too many enemies through my journalism ever to run for political office in the United States.” In the post‑Trump world, I tell him, no one can say that. “That,” he concedes, laughing, “is possibly a fair point.” “Thank you for your time,” he says, finishing the interview in the same way as he began it.

But this isn’t merely a team of endearing nerds. Students sitting exams have much to learn from the work ethic of the St John’s squad. We asked Rosie McKeown, Matt Hazell, John-Clark Levin and James Devine-Stoneman for their revision tips. Go in with a strategy The team first prepared for the show by scouring YouTube videos of old episodes to find common topics – and the same approach works with past exam papers, says McKeown. They’ll help you suss your weaknesses and the course structure. “More so than learning the content of the course, it’s about working out what you need to know and then using your time as efficiently as possible. People approach revision as something separate from the work you’ve been doing all year, which is a mistake. If you look at it as part of the process, then it’s less daunting.” Repeat to perfection Don’t get too complacent about the topics you think you know well, team captain Devine-Stoneman advises. “I try to cover a topic at multiple points in the run-up to the exam. A month or two beforehand, I run through my notes again, and again in the days leading up to it. If you don’t have much time, make sure the things you do know, you can ace. It’s usually better to go in with a selection of things you can do very well than a half-hearted knowledge of a range of things.” That way, Hazell adds, you can always try to steer an awkward question back to something you know. Use flashcards The team is big on flashcards. Devine-Stoneman uses an app when he gets a free moment in the lab as a PhD student in materials science. McKeown also uses them for both her languages degree and quizzing. “I’ll focus on flashcards in the last steps before the exam,” she says. “I tend to use different colours. Nice stationery is a motivation for me.” Take breaks with rewards The team agrees it’s important to have a rewards system in place when studying. McKeown says she always has a puzzle book or novel on the go. “Organise yourself so you don’t have to revise all through the night. It’s good to relax in the evening. There comes a point when you stop absorbing information.” Cram with purpose “I’m big on last-minute cramming,” says Hazell. “I’m quite aggressive in setting goals. If there are three days before an exam, with 24 lectures to revise, set daily targets so you can feel like you’re making progress and you’ll have covered everything.” And if you run out of time, “know when to cut your losses”, he says. “If there’s a small area of the syllabus that’s going to take a huge amount of time to revise, I ditch it.” At this point, “it’s about making sure you know what you know in more detail”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/10/youtube-pranks-fake-terror-attacks-isis","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T18:13:21Z","webTitle":"Fake terror attacks: why are the frightening pranks going viral?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/10/youtube-pranks-fake-terror-attacks-isis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/10/youtube-pranks-fake-terror-attacks-isis","fields":{"headline":"Fake terror attacks: why are the frightening pranks going viral?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It sounds like another terrifying story of insurgent terrorism in the Middle East: on Tuesday, men dressed in the black garb of the Islamic State stormed through a mall in Iran, brandishing swords and guns, shouting “Allahu Akbar”. Shoppers reportedly fled the scene in fear. It was reminiscent of the 2017 Tehran Isis attacks in which 17 people were killed. Except that the mall “attack” was actually a Punk’d style prank. The weapons were fake, and the presumed terrorists were actually actors. The whole incident was a piece of viral marketing for a film called Damascus Time about an Iranian father and son who are kidnapped by Isis. Some shoppers worked out what was going in and filmed the stunt on camera phones, but others can be heard screaming in terror. The film’s director has since apologised – he said he had not been expecting one of the actors to arrive on horseback – but he is far from the first person to pull this kind of stunt. He was just following a tradition of prank terror plots begun by American teenagers. There are so many videos of fake terrorist atrocities that you can watch entire compilations of unsuspecting members of the public, running, screaming and vomiting in fear. Most of them have been created by young western YouTube stars, many with millions of subscribers. They tend to involve someone dressed in stereotypical Arabic clothing, dropping a package at the feet of some strangers and running away. In one clip, people drinking on a boat all jump into the sea after a bag is thrown aboard. In another, laughing emojis flash on the screen when a man urinates on himself in fear after being surprised in a public restroom. Joey Salads, a YouTuber with 2 million subscribers, has become notorious for these kinds of pranks. He tries to couch his videos as a “social experiments”, claiming to compare reactions between a man shouting “Allahu Akbar” when he drops a steel box on the floor with that of a man in western dress saying “praise Jesus”. Unsurprisingly, people are more distressed by the former prank, but the videos say less about Islamophobia than they do about the wild west of YouTube content, where pranksters seem to be able to get away with almost anything, with little interference from the site. Last year, the British YouTuber Arya Mosallah, who had 650,000 subscribers, apologised after he made prank videos in which he approached strangers for a conversation and then threw liquid in their faces and ran away, leading them to believe they were victims of an acid attack, common in Britain at the time. Re-uploaded versions of the video can still be viewed on YouTube. Some of these pranks seem too horrifying to be real, and in some cases they aren’t. Sam Pepper, a YouTuber with 2.3 million subscribers, apologised for faking a prank in which he appeared to kill someone’s best friend in front of him – admitting everyone in the video knew what was happening. In his apology, he said the pressure in the pranking community to make new videos led him to fake some of his content – a very odd version of peer pressure. YouTube has said videos like Pepper’s do not violate its community guidelines and the site rarely removes prank videos. In most cases it’s more likely that the police will get involved than online moderators. Australian pranksters the Jalal Brothers were arrested by anti-terror police after they faked a series of terror attacks, including aiming a fake AK-47 at a small child. They later admitted that that video was entirely staged, but the police had not been not aware. Despite the dangers and clear distress involved, new videos are emerging all the time. At this point, many people are more likely to be caught up in a faked YouTube prank than an actual terror attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/10/to-the-ends-of-the-world-review-brutal-french-take-on-the-war-in-vietnam","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T16:07:14Z","webTitle":"To the Ends of the World review – brutal French take on the war in Vietnam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/10/to-the-ends-of-the-world-review-brutal-french-take-on-the-war-in-vietnam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/10/to-the-ends-of-the-world-review-brutal-french-take-on-the-war-in-vietnam","fields":{"headline":"To the Ends of the World review – brutal French take on the war in Vietnam","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Guillaume Nicloux is the director of that rather extraordinary comedy The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, in which the famous author created what amounted to a bizarre 94-minute cameo as himself, and also the bittersweet autumnal drama Valley of Love, with Isabelle Huppert and Gérard Depardieu. Now he has brought to the Director’s Fortnight section in Cannes an extremely confident and undeniably well-made Vietnam war movie, with something of Oliver Stone’s Platoon, except with the French in the role of the doomed occupying force, which in the 1940s preceded that of the Americans. The movie uses the term “Indochine” or “Indochina” in the opening titles, a colonial-era phrase, now rather frowned on, and predating the modern south-east Asia. I was forced to admit that Nicloux puts together a brutally violent but persuasive movie, steeped in its period and setting; although the violence can be suspiciously macho, and it incidentally flirts with the very tricky orientalist sub-Miss-Saigon fantasy of the mysterious Vietnamese prostitute whose submissive purpose is to showcase the dynamic star quality of the male lead, tormenting himself with erotic obsession, tragic romanticism and self-hate. There is also a pretty preposterous small role for Depardieu as the all-wise, all-knowing expatriate writer who serves as the young antihero’s dormant conscience. Gaspard Ulliel is probably still best known for playing the young Hannibal Lecter in Hannibal Rising in 2007. The brutal dismemberment and the violence of this film perhaps made him the right casting in Nicloux’s mind – severed heads and hacked body parts are forever being plonked in front of us – and the first shot shows Ulliel giving it the full Lecter as he stares maniacally into the camera. He plays Robert Tassen, a young French army officer in Vietnam in 1945 who has witnessed his brother being tortured and killed by the invading Japanese forces with the complicity of the Viet Minh. He is shot and dumped in an open grave with all the other corpses, presumed dead, until he regains consciousness and somehow manags to stagger out of the horrendous pit while the supervising soldier goes off for a smoke. After fainting in the jungle and being nursed back to health by villagers, Tassen somehow walks back into town and volunteers for active duty. His new mission is to form a revenge commando unit with homegrown comrades and various Vietnamese soldiers who are (notionally) loyal to the French. Their purpose will be to outwit the insurgent guerrillas with their own cunning – and finally kill the Viêt Minh leader. Tassen forms a rough-hewn love-hate friendship with Cavagna (Guillaume Gouix) and also has a kind of respect for the civilian writer and sage Saintonge, played mostly in the seated position by a slightly ridiculous and very corpulent Depardieu. But he falls in love with the demure prostitute Maï (Lang Khê Tran) who in her inscrutable gorgeousness drives Tassen to distraction. As I said, this is a very clichéd and shopworn fantasy, but Lang Khê Tran does invest it with some power and dissident force. Ulliel is charismatic and confident, and the film is good at showing the real hatred that the colonial forces had for the civilian population, who were all considered guilty by association in respect of any rebellious attack, a mentality inherited by the Americans. The oppressive anxieties of the jungle are well represented, and also the sheer, ever-present heat that would help to drive out any European invader. It is an almost oppressively physical film. The sleeping soldiers are kept awake by the groans of someone masturbating in the next bed; the men are often shown naked, and one soldier is shown dying in agony, because some insect has bitten him on the penis – clearly, a jungle fate worse than death. Nicloux finesses an enigmatic ending that may be inspired, a little, by the Kurtzian mystery of Coppola’s Vietnam. It really does feel like the end of the world, in its way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/21/brussels-locals-guide-shops-bars-restaurants","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T05:30:17Z","webTitle":"A local’s guide to Brussels: 10 top tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/21/brussels-locals-guide-shops-bars-restaurants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/21/brussels-locals-guide-shops-bars-restaurants","fields":{"headline":"A local’s guide to Brussels: 10 top tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Parc d’Egmont Veer sharply left by the Chanel store on Boulevard de Waterloo and you’ll find yourself in a tiny oasis among Brussels’ busiest shopping streets.

The 32-year-old has an offer from DC United to move to MLS in July, with the Washington club willing to give the former England captain a two‑year contract. DC United have held talks with Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, but are one of several overseas opportunities available to the boyhood Evertonian. Rooney’s preference is to remain at Everton where he is under contract until next summer. Everton have an option to extend his deal by a further 12 months but doubts over whether it will be activated, coupled with his reduced playing time under Sam Allardyce, have left Rooney considering a move. Everton have denied that their leading goalscorer this season has asked to leave. The former Manchester United striker has had a mixed campaign in a poor Everton side. He scored 11 goals in an impressive first half of the season, securing several important victories in the process, but his last goal came on 18 December and he has been frustrated by his deployment under Allardyce. Rooney reacted furiously to being substituted in the 57th minute of the Merseyside derby last month and he had been withdrawn at the same point against Manchester City the previous week. Rooney’s opportunities next season would appear limited under Allardyce but the 63-year-old’s future at Everton is uncertain. The striker wants clarity on Allardyce’s position, or whether he features in any new manager’s plans, before deciding whether to move with his young family to the US. Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, has several key issues to address beyond Rooney. Despite Allardyce’s claims to the contrary, Moshiri is expected to commence another overhaul of the club’s management structure with Marcel Brands, the technical director of the Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, lined up for a similar role on Merseyside. Brands’s arrival would affect Steve Walsh’s position as director of football and, as well as a replacement for Allardyce, Moshiri must also appoint a successor to the departing chief executive Robert Elstone and advance plans for a new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/10/implications-of-the-property-price-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T16:45:41Z","webTitle":"Implications of the property price fall | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/10/implications-of-the-property-price-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/10/implications-of-the-property-price-fall","fields":{"headline":"Implications of the property price fall","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Larry Elliott (Opinion, 10 May) rightly welcomes a small fall in house prices reported by the Halifax.

We have to wait for the publication of Land Registry data, which lag behind the headlines, before real house price trends can be uncovered. The small decline in house prices also needs to be placed within recent historical context. The average house price is now 7.9 times average earnings (9.1 times for newly built homes). To return to levels of housing affordability last seen 20 years ago, house prices would need to halve. Finally, the UK economy, economic wellbeing, and some elements of the welfare state are so linked to rising house prices, governments will tend to apply policy approaches that keep the housing market buoyant. A managed and ongoing reduction in house prices is desirable, but the consequences of rising numbers in negative equity and the deleterious effects on social services need to be considered too. Kevin Gulliver Operational director, Human City Institute • Given that you trail Larry Elliott’s piece on p1 of the Journal and coupled with the report by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, same issue, on the mental stresses on “generation rent” (‘I have sleepless nights stressing about the future’, G2), may we hope that the need for a decline in house prices might become the Guardian’s official leader line? I write as one whose house, bought 50-odd years ago, is indeed our greatest asset – but who fears for our grandchildren’s generation. Peter Fiddick Kew, Surrey • Last week’s letter from the Green New Deal Group (5 May) repeated a common plea for homes to be built on brownfield sites, as opposed to the green belt or countryside. Unfortunately, as a town dweller, I’ve seen the downside of this policy. In our town, any available space, including back gardens, is seen as fair game for building. The result is loss of open space, light, privacy, parking spaces, vegetation and wildlife, while increasing noise and congestion. Housing over-density reduces the quality of life for all residents and visitors. As these are usually small developments, there is no requirement to make them affordable for local people or to prevent them being sold as second homes. Councils are unwilling or unable to refuse planning permission due to government planning targets and the misleading designation of brownfield sites. Objections from residents are ignored, making a mockery of local accountability.

Later, after inadvertently absorbing a minuscule quantity through his skin, he was obliged to stagger home and lie down on his sofa, where, “in a dreamlike state, with eyes closed… I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours”. It was more than an impressive display, though: Hoffman felt convinced he’d been inducted into a secret of the universe, “the mystical experience of a deeper, comprehensive reality”. Mere days after the birth of LSD, scientists split the first uranium atom. One of these two world-jolting events went on to reshape civilisation, but by the mid-1960s, the other had been banished to the shadows. Research funding ceased and LSD was outlawed along with psilocybin, the psychedelic ingredient in magic mushrooms, introduced to the west in 1955 by an open-minded Manhattan banker. A trapdoor to another dimension had briefly opened, but now it seemed decisively slammed shut. Michael Pollan, author of In Defence of Food and The Omnivore’s Dilemma, was born a bit too late (though also, I think he’d admit, a bit too square) to participate in the psychedelic era. “The only way I was going to get to Woodstock,” he writes, “was if my parents drove me.” But then in the 1990s that trapdoor reopened a crack: American scientists quietly began research indicating that psychedelics might enormously benefit the terminally ill, alcoholics and those with “treatment-resistant” depression. How to Change Your Mind is Pollan’s sweeping and often thrilling chronicle of the history of psychedelics, their brief modern ascendancy and suppression, their renaissance and possible future, all interwoven with a self-deprecating travelogue of his own cautious but ultimately transformative adventures as a middle-aged psychedelic novice. In other words, this is a serious work of history and science, but also one in which the author, under the influence of a certain Central American toad venom, becomes convinced he’s giving birth to himself. Improbably, the combination largely works. It is to Pollan’s credit that, while he ranks among the best of science writers, he’s willing, when necessary, to abandon that genre’s fixation on materialist explanation as the only path to understanding. One of the book’s important messages is that the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics, for the dying or seriously ill, can’t be separated from the mystical experiences to which they give rise. Judging from the testimony here, it’s because the drugs allow a glimpse of “boundless awareness” – a perspective beyond the small and solitary ego – that patients with advanced cancer find themselves at peace with the notion of death, while depressives learn to feel hope. “Oh God, it all makes sense now, so simple and beautiful,” says one dying man and that feeling persists for the remainder of his life. The book makes clear that it’s no mere hippy cliche to say that LSD and psilocybin were banned because of the threat they posed to the established social order. (The real health risks of these non-addictive drugs, Pollan explains, are for most people exceedingly small.) LSD “truly was an acid, dissolving almost everything with which it came into contact, beginning with the hierarchies of the mind… and going on from there to society’s various structures of authority”. Timothy Leary, though he emerges from these pages as a showboater who’d have been more help piping down than turning on or tuning in, probably had it right. “The kids who take LSD aren’t going to fight your wars,” he predicted. “They aren’t going to join your corporations.” It was an outcome that couldn’t be permitted. The big risk for a writer here, as Pollan is aware, is that first-person reports from the frontiers of consciousness have a way of seeming utterly banal on the page: there’s an inverse relationship between how amazing it is to perceive that “I was God and God was me”, or that “the core of our being is love”, and how tedious it can be to read about it. Still, he gamely makes the attempt to put the ineffable into words. Pausing in the middle of a guided psilocybin trip to visit the lavatory, he watches himself pee: “The arc of water I sent forth was truly the most beautiful thing I had ever seen,” he writes, “a waterfall of diamonds cascading into a pool, breaking its surface into a billion clattering fractals of light.” It’s interesting to ask what psychedelics do to the brain in order to cause such effects and Pollan devotes a solid section to the neuroscience of tripping. But to wonder how neurons create these illusions, as he notes, is to begin from the assumption that they are illusions. Why assume that “normal” consciousness is the real one, while the boundless and transcendent variety is somehow fake? Almost all reports of psychedelic-induced spiritual experience share what William James called the “noetic” sense: people are convinced they’ve experienced not just some impressive mental theatre, but something more true than everyday reality. How to Change Your Mind is at its most gripping in the moments when Pollan, with a wry nod to the sceptical rationalist he always thought he was, allows himself to wonder if they might actually be right. • How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics by Michael Pollan is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The broadcaster said it was launching the inquiry because it wanted to adopt an approach to pay transparency in line with “best practice” in the public sector, in a move that could affect all BBC staff, freelancers and contractors. This year more than 200 BBC staff, including Victoria Derbyshire and Dan Snow, signed an open letter demanding the corporation adopt a policy of full pay transparency for employees as “by far the most effective way to uncover pay discrimination of all kinds, against ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, or on the basis of age or any other legally protected characteristic”. The inquiry will be led by Will Hutton, a former BBC journalist and editor of the Observer who is now principal of Hertford College at the University of Oxford. He will be tasked with listening to staff “about their views on disclosure and transparency around BBC staff pay, performance and reward”. The investigation will also consider whether there are links between pay transparency and performance, as well as how pay transparency might affect internal and external labour markets. A separate inquiry will look at the level of pay transparency required at the BBC’s commercial subsidiaries. Both will report back their findings to the BBC board. Pay inequality at the corporation hit the headlines last summer when it was forced to publish the pay bands of its high earners for the first time, revealing wild disparities among star employees earning more than £150,000 a year. Some presenters working on the same shows discovered they were earning substantially less than their colleagues, prompting accusations of sexism. This year the BBC China editor, Carrie Gracie, resigned in protest over the corporation’s pay structure. She said she could not “stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women”, pointing out that the BBC’s two male international editors earned “at least 50% more” than their two female counterparts. Updated pay disclosures for BBC employees earning more than £150,000 a year will be published this summer, providing the first sign of how the BBC has altered the income of its top earners. But many junior staff are exasperated with the focus on highly paid colleagues, rather than inequalities among the majority of the workforce on substantially lower salaries. Some BBC employees have expressed reservations about greater pay transparency. The radio presenter Simon Mayo this week raised concerns that the issue was being used by the organisation’s opponents “as a stick to hit the BBC with”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/evil-genius-review-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T04:00:32Z","webTitle":"Evil Genius review – unsettling bomb plot blows apart smalltown America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/evil-genius-review-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/evil-genius-review-netflix","fields":{"headline":"Evil Genius review – unsettling bomb plot blows apart smalltown America","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On 28 August 2003, Brian Wells walked into a bank in Pennsylvania. The pizza deliveryman was holding a note, a cane fitted with a gun and had a bomb attached around his neck. Wells approached the cashier and passed over the note, which instructed him to get $250,000. “There is only one way you can survive and that is to cooperate completely,” the note read. “This powerful, booby-trapped bomb can be removed only by following our instructions ... ACT NOW, THINK LATER OR YOU WILL DIE!” Wells had to get the money and then follow a detailed treasure hunt for a combination code that would unlock the bomb from his neck. He didn’t manage it. Wells’ death and the bizarre circumstances surrounding the attempted heist made the the Collar Bomb Heist one of the most discussed crimes in recent American history, and now it’s the latest subject of a meaty true-crime Netflix documentary, courtesy of the Duplass Brothers production company. The details of the case are still shocking and unnerving now: the meticulously crafted device, the rambling typed and traced letters, the involvement of quiet and unassuming suburbanites. But like Blue Velvet, once you put your ear to the ground, even in smalltown America, there are some very dark murmurings. The protagonists here are Wells, an articulate local handyman named Bill Rothstein and his former girlfriend Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, who had just murdered her ex-husband. Diehl-Armstrong had a string of dead husbands and boyfriends behind her, and was beautiful, highly intelligent and mentally unstable. Here was someone who was smart enough to plan the heist, but why would she go to such lengths? Unlike Making a Murderer, Serial or The Jinx, there’s little doubt who the culprits were. This is more about unpicking and retracing the steps that led to a seemingly innocuous deliveryman ending up having a bomb strapped around his neck. It’s also about how drug debt, prostitution, mental illness and domestic violence spiraled into a baroque and deadly combination. Told using re-creation, interviews and footage from the time, there’s a haunting and unsettling feel as the conspiracy starts to unravel, and the motivations that drove the people who carried out the heist – partially at least – become apparent. There’s plenty here for the true-crime crowd and for devotees of the darkness lurking in suburbia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/safe-review-michael-c-halls-odd-synthetic-british-accent-is-symptomatic-of-this-netflix-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T05:00:34Z","webTitle":"Safe review – Michael C Hall’s odd, synthetic British accent is symptomatic of this Netflix drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/safe-review-michael-c-halls-odd-synthetic-british-accent-is-symptomatic-of-this-netflix-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/11/safe-review-michael-c-halls-odd-synthetic-british-accent-is-symptomatic-of-this-netflix-drama","fields":{"headline":"Safe review – Michael C Hall’s odd, synthetic British accent is symptomatic of this Netflix drama","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s something about Michael C Hall’s British accent that doesn’t quite ring true, but I’m finding it hard to put a finger on it. It is definitely a British accent. If you heard it out of context and were asked where it was from you would say Britain. Where in Britain, though – geographically, in the social hierarchy – would be tougher to pinpoint. It’s like a generic British accent that Hall, best known for being Miami serial killer Dexter, has produced. Technically sound but synthetic, rather than living-breathing real. Hall’s accent may not be the most interesting thing about Safe, but it might be symptomatic of it, certainly of its setting; a bourgeois gated community somewhere in England. It is a good place to set a drama, and at first glance it looks like how you imagine those places would be: big kitchens with concertina doors on to nice outdoor areas, pools, Audis and Range Rovers, community barbecues, a little light adultery, precocious teenagers partying hard the moment their parents leave the gates, pills and beer-pong. But it soon becomes clear that the behaviour gets more extreme than that. When a body is discovered floating face down in the pool at the popular local princess’s house party, her parents – a comedy couple, ghastly and likable at the same time – don’t go to the police as you might expect. Instead, they opt to put the body in the chest freezer in the garage. (How did little Sia get the body out of the pool on her own, btw?) Oh, and speaking of putting a finger on it, later they defrost the dead geezer’s hand, with a hot water bottle. They do that to use his thumb to unlock his phone and post something on social media, to give the impression he isn’t dead after all. The Marshalls are master criminals and make the Corleones look like amateurs. Then Sia bonks someone else over the head with a bottle. And it’s not just the Marshalls who have things to hide. Everyone does. It’s like the bloody Killing Fields over there. So Hall’s character, Tom, a surgeon, had something to do with his wife’s death, we don’t know what. It’s something his 17-year-old daughter Jenny can’t forgive him for. Tom’s current girlfriend is local police chief Sophie (Amanda Abbington), whose husband, a drunken Irishman (whoop whoop, racial stereotype alert) lives in a caravan on the drive. New cop Emma, transferred from the big city, spends her spare time photographing Tom’s best mate Pete with a long lens. Who knows what she’s up to, but it looks like no good. And Pete was the last person to be seen with Jenny ... we’ll come to that, it’s quite important. We haven’t even mentioned the Chahals. He is the angriest man in the world, she is a French teacher accused of having an affair with an underaged pupil. Their son Chris is just chillin’ ... in the Marshall’s freezer. Not a whole lot of ringing true going on then, it’s pretty tonto. Which might not matter, but what looked at one point like it might be Netflix’s Broadchurch – the disappearance of a teenager, a parent’s anguish, the effect on a community, the police investigation – soon starts to look more like Desperate Housewives. I’m very much enjoying these people, without really caring about them. What Safe does have – by the shovel-load – is plot. As you would expect of an idea from prolific and super-successful American crime writer Harlan Coben (then brought to screen by Danny Brocklehurst), it floors it straight from the off, then twists through chicanes and hairpins to leave you hanging on for dear life. Jenny disappears from the community barbecue, she has had enough. Has she run off with love-interest Chris? No, because it’s Chris who was face down in the pool, now face up in the freezer, still Instagramming away from heaven. It was Pete who picked her up from the party. He says he’s gay, but is he? Sophie’s on the case, with dodgy Emma, but Tom doesn’t seem to trust them, even though Sophie is his girlfriend. He launches his own investigation, with his own accent, that doesn’t quite ring true. Literally everyone is a suspect. So while you might not be kept awake at night, lying in bed worrying about a parent’s grief, or how much freedom a teenager should be given, or pondering the reality – and maybe the morality – of the gated community ... Well, to be honest, you probably won’t be lying in bed at all. You’ll be up, bingeing, wolfing down the episodes, doing that thing: the midnight Net-feast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/may/10/cities-across-uk-submit-bids-to-be-second-home-of-channel-4","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T17:36:59Z","webTitle":"Cities across UK submit bids to be second home of Channel 4","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/10/cities-across-uk-submit-bids-to-be-second-home-of-channel-4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/10/cities-across-uk-submit-bids-to-be-second-home-of-channel-4","fields":{"headline":"Cities across UK submit bids to be second home of Channel 4","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than a dozen cities across the UK – including Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Birmingham – are expected to formally submit their bids on Friday to become the home of Channel 4’s second headquarters. A shortlist of contenders to host the new production hub will be announced on 30 May, with the winning city unveiled on 1 October. The contest has sparked a fierce battle between local politicians who are keen to attract hundreds of high-profile jobs to their region. Channel 4 won a drawn-out battle with the government against being privatised and forced to move its entire operation out of the capital. Instead it reached a deal that will involve transferring around 300 staff from its 800-strong Westminster headquarters to a base outside London, which will include a TV studio and host board meetings. The broadcaster has said its second base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure. Channel 4 has also pledged to build smaller regional “creative hubs” in two additional cities; spend substantially more money on programming from production companies based outside London; and co-host Channel 4 News from a studio outside the capital. Birmingham has long been seen as the leading candidate, with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, saying he was confident of bringing the broadcaster to the region. Glasgow’s bid has become a major cause for the Scottish government, with the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, backing the bid and her Scottish National party holding a debate in the Westminster parliament to make the case. The Sheffield bid, chaired by the former Labour sports minister Richard Caborn, says the city offers “unrivalled” expertise and digital knowledge, while Leeds has promised “fascinating cultures, diversity and talents that are worth being discovered and showcased”. Smaller towns and cities, ranging from Leamington to Port Talbot, have expressed an interest in applying for one of the broadcaster’s creative hubs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/10/west-brom-darren-moore-premier-league-relegation","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:09:48Z","webTitle":"The curious case of West Brom, Darren Moore and their relegation | Liam Rosenior","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/10/west-brom-darren-moore-premier-league-relegation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/10/west-brom-darren-moore-premier-league-relegation","fields":{"headline":"The curious case of West Brom, Darren Moore and their relegation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Having secured our Premier League status with the great victory against Manchester United last week, myself and the rest of our squad were much more comfortable in our hotel on Tuesday evening as we sat down to watch Swansea and Southampton in their crucial match and see the effect the result would have at the bottom end of the table. As the game progressed and produced a massive win for the Saints, it not only put Swansea in huge trouble but also consigned West Bromwich Albion to their inevitable fate regardless of their outstanding resurgence under Darren Moore. The case of West Brom and especially the superb results they have picked up recently – beating Manchester United away and a strong Tottenham team at The Hawthorns – is a curious one in terms of how a manager can affect his players’ performances so critically and how, in the bigger picture of our national game, we consider and appoint head coaches. Frankly, I’m amazed we are still in the position of discussing whether Moore is the right man for West Brom in the long term because he has gained outstanding performances and results in his short tenure and the players have shown organisation, spirit and togetherness to get close to the seemingly impossible task of survival from such a grim position in the table. As a player I hear and understand the question from supporters who pay their hard-earned money, asking how it is possible for the same group of professionals to play in the way they have under Moore, when previously under Alan Pardew and Tony Pulis (both managers with huge experience) they were losing games on a regular basis without the fight, character and belief they have been displaying recently. I agree that we as players have to be accountable for our individual performances and collective results but in football, as in any other industry, the organisation, tactical plan, culture, inspiration and day-to-day training sessions are laid down by the manager, who has a huge role in defining the confidence levels, belief and spirit within the football club. These elements can make such a big difference on the field of play where instead of players having doubts about where they are heading or even being unclear of the tactical plan, they are instead being led by someone who instils confidence and belief into them and can convey their tactics and methodology concisely and clearly on the training pitch from Monday to Friday, enabling success on a Saturday. Had Moore been appointed 10 games earlier I doubt any of us, with the benefit of hindsight, would have put money on them being relegated this season. This situation draws parallels with a club in Germany two seasons ago when Hoffenheim were in a similarly desperate position to the one West Brom found themselves in, albeit earlier in the season. Staring at relegation and needing something different and fresh, they turned to a 28-year-old coach from their youth ranks to reinvigorate the team’s performances and take them forward. If you fast-forward two years, after not only an improbable “great escape” that year but consistent improvement and qualification into the Champions League play-offs, Julian Nagelsmann is one of the hottest coaching properties in world football. His short period as a manager is recognised in Germany for being innovative, intelligent and fearless – often using young German players but still being ahead of the curve in terms of the evolution of the game. I’m not saying Moore would definitely be of the same mould and ability as Nagelsmann, but why can’t he be? If we look objectively at the recent form and performances of his players the upturn has been nothing short of spectacular and I have said before that if we want our national game to improve and stay ahead we need chances to be given to our next generation of coaches who show they can do the job. Moore has proven that for sure – and in a short space of time. The wider picture of today’s game in our country and the managerial merry-go-round that is being analysed and debated by supporters and the media needs to be challenged. We talk about the increasingly difficult pathways our young players have in making first teams while we also say aspiring coaches who want to manage at the top level should play at lower-level clubs and in under-23 roles. But the sad fact is that even with success in the lower leagues or with under-23 sides these coaches are still not given a chance at the sharp end and instead we appoint “safe, experienced” managers from these shores or big-name coaches from abroad who, not by coincidence, were given a chance to shine much earlier at a higher level by more open‑minded, forward-thinking boardrooms or technical directors. Watching the emotional celebrations at the final whistle at the Hawthorns last Saturday after a last‑gasp win against Spurs I couldn’t help but think the legend Cyrille Regis was looking down from above with pride at his club. This was a man who broke down barriers in terms of prejudice with his grace, poise and skill. I hope West Brom’s directors at least give Moore the deserved opportunity to emulate Regis, having displayed the very same qualities as his hero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/10/brexit-could-cost-uk-research-sector-billions-says-oxford-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T16:18:04Z","webTitle":"Brexit could cost UK research sector billions, says Oxford boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/10/brexit-could-cost-uk-research-sector-billions-says-oxford-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/10/brexit-could-cost-uk-research-sector-billions-says-oxford-boss","fields":{"headline":"Brexit could cost UK research sector billions, says Oxford boss","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The vice-chancellor of Oxford University has said the UK stands to miss out on billions in EU research funding under current Brexit proposals. Louise Richardson said the government’s “pay-as-you-go” proposals – under which the UK would receive grants only up to the value of what it pays in to EU funding programmes – represented an “enormous loss” and warned that the research sector was in trouble because of the severing of ties with the bloc. “The reality is that between 2007 and 2013 the UK contributed £5.4bn to the EU to support research, development and innovation while over the same period we received £8.8bn under the EU research framework programme budget,” she told the British Irish Chamber of Commerce conference on Thursday. “So post-Brexit the pay-as-you-go system as has been proposed – a system where the UK gets out only as much as it puts in to research funding – represents an enormous loss to us.” Richardson said research into everything from antidepressants to a vaccine for prostate cancer to the causes of football hooliganism could suffer. She also said post-Brexit immigration controls could have a significant impact on the quality of research and innovation. “I think we are all in trouble as a result of the referendum,” Richardson said. “We know how much our reputation depends upon our research partnerships and collaborations, in everything from artificial intelligence to zoology. Many of these partnerships, which are supported through EU research programmes, are threatened by Brexit.” Richardson argued that with finance, agriculture and other sectors likely to suffer as a result of Brexit, research and innovation would become more critical to the British economy. “I would call on the UK government to make it a priority in the Brexit negotiations that our universities continue to have the strongest possible relationship with the EU,” she said. Richardson said the UK was one of the biggest beneficiaries of EU research funding, including from the €80bn Horizon2020 scheme and separate European Research Council grants. In the last funding round the UK received 66 grants, compared with Germany’s 42 and France’s 34, she said. Oxford was the single biggest institutional beneficiary, receiving grants of about £236m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/10/pink-wine-rose-draught-uk-dire-harvest-price","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T17:53:22Z","webTitle":"Not tickled pink: wine experts warn of rosé drought for UK fans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/10/pink-wine-rose-draught-uk-dire-harvest-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/10/pink-wine-rose-draught-uk-dire-harvest-price","fields":{"headline":"Not tickled pink: wine experts warn of rosé drought for UK fans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Experts are warning of a national drought that could have a devastating impact upon the nation’s barbecue plans. The shortage, however, is of wine – not water. One of the UK’s leading winesellers has said the country’s supply of rosé – particularly from Provence – was under increasing pressure because of a dire French harvest in 2017 and British drinkers’ desire to “drink pink” all year round. “The threat to rosé supplies started in the winter of 2017-2018 with an unseasonal peak in out-of-season demand, even during the ‘beast from the east’,” said Charles Cutteridge, a wine buyer at Majestic. The record-breaking temperatures over the early May bank holiday evidently exacerbated the looming shortage, with Majestic reporting a doubling in rosé sales at its 210 stores over the long weekend. In recent years rosé has won over younger wine drinkers, a trend documented in millions of social media posts celebrating nights out washed down with glasses of millennial pink. Global wine production slumped to its lowest level in more than 50 years in 2017 after vines in the world’s top three producers – France, Spain and Italy – were ravaged by both freakishly hot and cold weather. Last month the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said global production in 2017 dropped 8.6% to 250m hectolitres. A hectolitre is the equivalent to 133 standard wine bottles so the fall in output equates to about 3bn fewer bottles. The breakdown of the global OIV figure showed that Spain was the most severely hit, with its output down by a fifth at 32.1m hectolitres. France was down 19% to 36.7m hectolitres, while Italy, the world’s largest wine producer, slumped 17% to 42.5m hectolitres. Last year the UK spent £780m on rosé, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, drinking more than 111m bottles. But Majestic says drinkers will have to be more creative if they want to avoid paying higher prices for pink. The devaluation of sterling after the Brexit vote has already pushed up the retail price of wine in the UK. The tight supply created by the harvest woes has added further upwards pressure. The research firm Neilson has so far reported French wine prices up 5.5%. Cutteridge says fans of rosé from Provence should give Portuguese pale pinks a try, or venture further afield to New Zealand Or, if things get really desperate, Majestic says its OK to stick a bottle of the lighter reds in the fridge: “Chilled red wine can be just as fab on a hot sunny afternoon as any blush.” Upmarket wine merchant Berry Bros &amp; Rudd said its rosé stock levels were stable despite 2017’s harvest problems. However, earlier this year it forecast the price of standard supermarket wines such as prosecco and pinot grigio could rise by up to 30% in the coming months as the impact of last year’s drought, frost and hailstorms is felt on the high street. Fiona Hayes, one of its wine buyers, said that while the bad weather had hit some producers she was confident “in the quantity and quality of wine” Berry Bros &amp; Rudd would have available for its customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/may/14/hmrc-spending-on-debt-collectors-up-by-more-than-500-in-three-years","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T05:01:19Z","webTitle":"HMRC spending on debt collectors up by more than 500% in three years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/14/hmrc-spending-on-debt-collectors-up-by-more-than-500-in-three-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/14/hmrc-spending-on-debt-collectors-up-by-more-than-500-in-three-years","fields":{"headline":"HMRC spending on debt collectors up by more than 500% in three years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The amount HMRC pays to private-sector debt collectors has risen by more than 500% in three years, suggesting it may be stepping up the pressure on people who cannot pay their tax bills. The figure rose to £39.1m in 2017, which was 62% higher than the £24.1m that HMRC spent on these services in 2016, according to the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, which obtained the data. The figure has increased annually for several years: it stood at £6.2m in 2014, then rose to £12.5m in 2015. Using a private debt collection agency is one of several ways HMRC chases outstanding taxes – it has a relationship with 12 different agencies that can pursue debtors on its behalf – and its strategy may be working: in October 2017, HMRC declared that unpaid tax was at a “record low” as a result of a crackdown on avoidance, evasion and noncompliance. However, the department has also come under fire for using debt collectors to pursue people whose tax credits were overpaid. UHY Hacker Young said the sharp rise in spending on private-sector debt collectors “could suggest HMRC may be stepping up the pressure on people who can’t pay their tax bills as it continues its dash for cash”. It added that the taxman had little day-to-day control over these firms, whose attitude towards debt collecting “could be seen as more aggressive than that of HMRC”. The UK’s “tax gap” – the difference between the amount of tax that should be paid and how much is actually collected – was estimated to be £34bn in 2015-16, HMRC said last October. Individual consumers accounted for £3.6bn of this. An HMRC spokesman said it had used debt collection agencies for a number of years as an “effective and efficient” way to collect tax. He added: “They operate under strict codes of conduct to pursue debt and we expect them to uphold those codes at all times. “Where someone thinks they will have problems paying the amount due, they should get in touch straight away. All requests for further time to pay an amount due are considered individually based on the facts of the case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/may/20/you-think-it-ill-say-it-curtis-sittenfeld-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T09:00:52Z","webTitle":"You Think It, I’ll Say It By Curtis Sittenfeld review – the good, bad and ugly of female lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/you-think-it-ill-say-it-curtis-sittenfeld-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/20/you-think-it-ill-say-it-curtis-sittenfeld-review","fields":{"headline":"You Think It, I’ll Say It By Curtis Sittenfeld review – the good, bad and ugly of female lives","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Curtis Sittenfeld revealed in a recent interview in the New Review that she has on multiple occasions resisted offers to translate into fiction the life of Melania Trump. Her most obvious credential is that a decade ago her novel American Wife imagined a 21st-century first lady, but her new collection of stories provides impressive supporting evidence. Sittenfeld is fascinated by our fascination – and our unease – with women: powerful women, powerless women, women we are attracted to and repulsed by, women who push themselves to the centre of the stage and women who erase themselves from the story. If, perhaps from a sense of scrupulousness or decency, she passed up the chance to portray Mrs Trump, Sittenfeld acquiesced when commissioned to write a story from the perspective of Hillary Clinton. The Nominee opens this collection, as an unnamed but highly familiar Democrat contemplates her forthcoming candidature (“anticlimactic”, she decides). Her mirror is not her opponent, but the female journalist who has repeatedly interviewed her throughout her career; the device allows her to reflect on woman-on-woman sexism – nobody else asks her about her pantsuits, including men – and on the peculiar relationship that exists between the professional interrogator and their subject. But it is also a story that exists in the before; its primary concerns belong to a political prehistory. Her possible defeat, asserts the nominee, would be “catastrophic”; but no matter, because it won’t happen. That confidence – more, one senses, rooted in the impossible vacuity of the Republican candidate than personal arrogance – stands as a form of ironic rebuke to the story, and to those that follow. After all, who can worry about pantsuits at a time like this? And yet, naturally, we do: pantsuits, partners, past lives, missed turns, future opportunities. One of the most chilling stories here, The World Has Many Butterflies, concerns that most terrifying of things: intimacy misconstrued, or at least revoked. A married woman forms a conspiratorial bond with her husband’s colleague, based on his habit of sidling up to her at dull social occasions with the instruction: “I’ll think it, you say it” and a nod to another guest. Julie’s task is to construct a vignette – part gossip, part mildly derisive characterisation – for Graham’s amusement. The rules of the game are never made explicit; the pair’s roles are never reversed. Julie’s willing participation, she explains, exists because the game returns her to a previous version of herself: “big-boobed, curly-haired, high-spirited, and Jewish”. But when her enjoyment suddenly mutates into romantic and erotic attraction, Graham pulls the rug from under her feet; whether cruelty or carelessness is the spur to his response, the idea that another might not only withdraw complicity but deny its existence is horrifying. One of the occasional failures of the kind of contemporary fiction based on the dynamics and currents of social and domestic relationships is that the characters, figuratively speaking, all sound the same. They are of a type, cut from the same piece of cloth – not genuinely reflective of that real frisson of weirdness and fear that can ensue when you realise you have no comprehension either of what someone else is thinking or what they are capable of thinking. Sittenfeld’s tableaux and their inhabitants don’t feel like that: they are much less tidy and, consequently, riskier. They explore what are frequently unresolvable tensions, especially between women: the journalist (another) who leaves her breastfeeding baby with a sitter in order to interview an actress, only for the interviewee to reveal her traumatic miscarriage. The tragicomic setup – the writer conceals her motherhood but is then exposed by her leaking breasts and the sitter’s panicked calls – leads to an impossible complex of competing empathies and sympathies. Similarly, a successful lawyer on her honeymoon is appalled when she discovers a high school frenemy also honeymooning at the same resort: but how much satisfaction can exacting a covert revenge on her provide? And what does it matter, anyhow, if her own husband is a money-grabber who orders her to buy her own diamond ring if she wants one so much? Elsewhere, the extent of our disapproval for a judgmental and combative charity volunteer is limited when her behaviour seems to suggest mental health problems and social isolation. And how are we to rate the ethical conduct of a travelling academic, in a story entitled Gender Studies, who falls into bed with a Trump-supporting shuttle van driver just because she can, but also because her partner has just left her for his graduate student? Alongside this knotty subject matter are more straightforwardly light moments. A mother-and-baby group that features its leader “reading aloud a poem that rhymed lactation with revelation” culminates triumphantly when two of the gathering break free and form a friendship. Despite its foreboding title – Bad Latch – it’s a story fuelled by the acceptance of imperfection and, tellingly, it ends with one woman telling another her name. • You Think It, I’ll Say It by Curtis Sittenfeld is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

Baseball’s great traditional rivals, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, played three games that each swung violently. Finally – while Britain slept on Friday morning – the Sox, having lost two, clung on breathlessly for a consolation win in the third. This was not the World Series, or anything like it. It was, in theory, a routine part of the regular fixture list barely one-fifth of the way through the season. These teams will reconvene at intervals throughout the long, customarily hot, summer. It just happens that they are currently the two most successful, as well as most resonant, teams in baseball. And, after this week’s events, they are tied for the lead in their division, the American League East, way ahead of all rivals. In the midst of this epic it was announced that the Sox and Yankees would get together again next year somewhere completely different – the London Stadium: to contest the first two major league games ever played in Europe, following previous excursions to Tokyo and Sydney. A crowd of 55,000 is expected, a full house for baseball purposes: only Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles can hold that many on the US circuit. And the matchmaking is inspired. These are the teams most likely to have expat adherents. and the ones Londoners are most likely to have heard of. Furthermore, baseball officials will be aware of British sports followers’ diminishing attention spans. And though the capacity is large, the playing area is not. This pairing – above all the Yankees’ giants from outer space, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton – is the one most likely to produce home runs. Judge positively salivated when told the stadium’s hitter-friendly dimensions. “I’ve got to see it to believe it,” he said. Baseball scores rarely reach double figures, but these could get to rugby levels, if not quite cricket. Ah, cricket. That old thing. Apparently, the cricket season is also in progress, though few have noticed. The County Championship is close to its halfway stage, the week after its old-fashioned start-of-May opening, though after Monday it will close down completely for a month and will not resume with any conviction until the swallows start considering their exit strategy in late August. What will happen in the meantime? Buggered if I know. The Cricketer magazine’s 2018 fixtures wallchart has 21 different colour codings for different kinds of events, putting it way ahead of the London Underground map. And that’s before 2020, when the inmates who have taken charge of the asylum are planning something else entirely, playing a currently non-existent form of cricket between currently non-existent teams. And before 2021, when the bonkers World Test Championship is scheduled for Lord’s. The Cricketer will have to start reinventing the Pantone colour chart. I became obsessed with cricket when I was six years old. I now find it unfathomable. And if it has lost me, what effect is it having on everyone else? Not a lot seems to be the answer. In the four months since the Ashes, cricket has gained public attention in Britain just once: for the Australian ball-tampering scandal. The issue is not about whether cricket or baseball is inherently better. Cricket is more aesthetically pleasing, and has two extra dimensions: the significance of the surface, which matters little in baseball; and the under-appreciated concept of the draw. A one-sided baseball game, like a one-sided 50-over match, can be very tedious. And, until recently, cricket had better manners. What baseball does have is a Test match level of tactical profundity collapsed into three hours. And something else, the thing that cricket administrators seem incapable of understanding. It’s the narrative, stupids. The baseball season lasts at least six months, a full seven for the two sides that contest the World Series. Teams play an average of six games a week which allows a little time for transcontinental flights. They do not complain, since the rewards are mega. There are no distractions, except a minimal half-term for the All-Star Game in July. The strategies may be complex but the storyline is simple. What that means for me is that almost every morning from April to September I wake in deepest England to a phone message giving me the result of my adopted team, the St Louis Cardinals, and a little cheer or groan to start the day (more cheers than groans so far this year, thank you). Sometimes the Cards are on a gettable TV channel, so I try not to peek and watch the game as live later. I have always done the same, depending on the technology of the time, with my birth team, Northamptonshire. Even at boarding school, one could catch the lunchtime, teatime and close of play scores on the radio; get the details from next morning’s paper, and the tables and averages twice a week. But following sport is a habit. Over-complicate the story, as cricket has done to an insane extent, and the habit withers. No one reads 21 books at once. It is not a question whether literary novels are better than thrillers or five-day cricket better than one. You can only read one thing at a time. One-day cricket was a fantastic innovation: the 65-over game introduced in 1963 had scope for almost the full range of skills but with added urgency. Since then, we have gone from 65 overs to 60 to 50 to 40, up to 45 (briefly), and of course 20 and, coming soon to a stadium quite likely nowhere near you, 16.4. Destination: vanishing point. A new working party, the umpteenth, is about to look at a new structure for English domestic cricket. I would like a single county competition to encompass the different forms of the game. It is perfectly doable and offers huge advantages. So that can be ruled out. In any case everything will now be at the mercy of a new “independent” board of directors. Apart from Colin Graves and Tom Harrison, the two officials who have spent the last three years turning mess into shambles, I have never previously heard of any of them. Will baseball take over? Historically, it has flourished in the UK only in pockets: Hull had 80 teams in the 1940s and a different version flourished in Wales. And whereas the NFL, with its limited schedule, could easily put a team in London, for baseball it is a distant aspiration that could only become real when subsonic air travel is replaced by Harry Potter’s floo powder. And I have a sense that the British are losing their taste for all bat-on-ball games. They love novelty, though, so Sox-Yanks will do fine, unless it rains. I hope to be there. Deep in my heart I still cherish the cricketing god. But I attend church less frequently and, in quiet moments, have taken to humming Losing My Religion. Cricket has been subverted by false prophets and, indeed, false profits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/marwan-koukash-bares-emotions-keeps-clothes-on-chester-cup-win-magic-circle-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:33:04Z","webTitle":"Marwan Koukash bares emotions but keep clothes on after Chester Cup win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/marwan-koukash-bares-emotions-keeps-clothes-on-chester-cup-win-magic-circle-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/marwan-koukash-bares-emotions-keeps-clothes-on-chester-cup-win-magic-circle-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Marwan Koukash bares emotions but keep clothes on after Chester Cup win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Marwan Koukash had threatened to pick up the trophy wearing only a tie if Magic Circle took the Chester Cup here on Friday. In the end, he settled for an FA Cup-style lap of the winner’s enclosure, having been warned that he would risk a lifetime ban from his favourite racecourse if he made good on his promise, but it was still clear that his fourth win in the May meeting’s most historic event meant as much to him as the first. Magic Circle was making his first start in Koukash’s colours, having been bought specifically to target the race by Ian Williams, his trainer. “This is the one race that I always want to win,” the owner said, “and now I’ve done it four times, which I don’t think has ever been done before.” Magic Circle had an excellent draw in stall six but was not able to make the most of it and was caught three wide at one stage of a race where saving ground around the inner is usually vital. Fran Berry worked his way into a much better position on the second circuit, however, and when he sent Magic Circle for home, his turn of foot took him clear in just a few strides. “I thought he was a bit cold [after 209 days off] and he had lost the advantage of a good draw, but he ended up in a good position and he finished like a storm,” Williams said. “I thought his chance had gone when he was three wide. I was gobsmacked that he could win from there.” Magic Circle could now be dropped in trip and aimed towards the Ebor Handicap at York in August, while Fun Mac, the runner-up, is likely to head for the longest race in the Flat racing calendar, the Queen Alexandra Stakes, the final race of the Royal meeting at Ascot next month. Eminent, fourth home in last year’s Derby, made his first start at four in the Huxley Stakes and set off as the 8-13 favourite, but he raced freely at the head of the field and as Forest Ranger travelled well just behind him and faded tamely as Richard Fahey’s gelding struck for home on the way to a one-and-a-quarter length win. The winner’s enclosure felt 50% smaller than it had on Thursday as Forest Ranger was led back to unsaddle afterwards, as he is an impressive physical specimen who would not look out of place in a Cheltenham Gold Cup. He is also improving steadily after a gelding operation over the winter and will now be trained for the Group One Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in early July. “He’s a big unit,” Richard Fahey, Forest Ranger’s trainer, said with a hint of understatement. “He’s become a man and he’s progressing.” Eminent was reported to have a “fibrillating heart” by Chester’s veterinary officer after a post-race examination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/grammar-schools-dont-work-tories-socially-regressive","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:31:09Z","webTitle":"Grammar schools are indefensible.

I should know – I went to one","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This morning, not for the first (or the last) time, I had to be patiently reminded not to rant and rave at the radio while taking a shower. The trigger? The government’s announcement that it was bunging an extra 50 million quid at grammar schools that wanted to expand. It’s the ultimate zombie policy. Just when you think the 11-plus is, if not finally dead and buried, then at least quarantined, it’s rising from the grave once again. What explains its survival? After all, the internet reliably informs me that there are plenty of ways to actually kill a zombie. By the same token, a quick search on Google and its pointy-headed sister site, Google Scholar, throws up decades worth of research that comprehensively debunks the claims of 11-plus fans that it improves aggregate outcomes and boosts social mobility. And this research has been replicated in more publicly accessible forums by blogs and thinktanks (even right-leaning thinktanks) and journalists, most obviously the indefatigable Chris Cook of the BBC. The only explanation is a toxic combination of nostalgia and ideology that the Tory party (and its erstwhile outside toilet, Ukip) seems unable to shake off . This is in spite of the fact that it was a Conservative education minister, Edward Boyle, who effectively gave the green light for the replacement of grammars by comprehensives and one of his successors, Margaret Thatcher, who did little (although not, to be scrupulously accurate, nothing) to turn back the tide. To realise quite how powerful the right’s faith in selective secondary education is, just think back to the last time it was seriously challenged from within. In May 2007, probably the high-water mark of David Cameron’s modernising phase as Tory leader, David (now Lord) Willetts, then the party’s shadow education secretary, tried telling it the truth in a speech to the CBI. “We must break free,” he said, “from the belief that academic selection is any longer the way to transform the life chances of bright poor kids … there is overwhelming evidence that such academic selection entrenches advantage; it does not spread it.” The reaction? The Conservative party went nuts – especially after Cameron issued “a clear and uncompromising message to those who think they can perpetuate a pointless debate about grammar schools: we will never be taken seriously by parents and convince them we are on their side and share their aspirations if we splash around in the shallow end of the education debate”. Things became even more heated when Cameron doubled down a couple of days later, declaring it was “completely delusional” to talk about building more grammars and claiming it was “a key test for our party. Does it want to be a serious force for government and change, or does it want to be a rightwing debating society muttering about what might have been?” This proved too much for Graham Brady (now the well-respected chairman of the 1922 Committee, and one of my favourite Tories, but then an opposition frontbencher), who resigned his post in protest. At this point Cameron (characteristically, some might say) plumped for appeasement rather the proverbial “clause IV moment”. More grammar schools, it transpired, could be built in areas that still used the 11-plus exam if population increases required. Oh, and Willetts was pretty soon relieved of his responsibility for the education brief. Hence where we are today, wasting yet more desperately needed cash on under 5% of the country’s secondary schools – schools that are pointlessly divisive, and which don’t do the job they are supposed to do even when it comes to social mobility. The classic comeback, of course, to any such criticism is not to dispute the research, which demonstrates this beyond reasonable doubt. Instead it is to point out that people like me, who went to grammar schools, are pulling the ladder up with them, selfishly determined to deny others the chance to experience the supposedly glorious education were once lucky enough to receive themselves. Ad hominem bullshit, of course. But, hey, what else is there when you’re defending the indefensible? • Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/fear-deportation-javid-windrush-generation-home-office","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:32:55Z","webTitle":"I lived in fear of deportation, Mr Javid.

For people who haven’t been affected, the headlines are just that. But for us, this is a real trauma; this is our lives. Sajid Javid has called for us to come forward with our personal stories so we can be assessed under his new compensation scheme. I do think that we deserve compensation. But there is no amount that can truly reflect the fear and anxiety, frustration and ill health we have suffered. It can’t fully reflect the three times I applied for and was given a job, only to be told that they were very sorry, but I couldn’t have it, because according to the government’s rules I didn’t have the right papers. I have been here since 1963. I went to primary school here and secondary school. I worked as a healthcare supervisor, a traffic warden with Camden council and the Metropolitan police. I even had vaccination documents from the jabs I was given when I arrived here. I did jury duty three times; in fact, I was asked to do it again even while I was being told I didn’t belong in this country. I had letters sent to the Home Office on my behalf by Jeremy Corbyn. I said to him, “You must be able to help; you’re the prime minister in waiting.” But he couldn’t. I didn’t have a day free of worry. I became ill. I could not pay my rent and was taken to court by Islington council. I am still paying back thousands in rent arrears. I lived in fear of the day when there would be a knock on the door from the police. I arranged things for my three children to carry on without me, as if I was about to die. How can Javid’s compensation reflect that? How do you calculate compensation for the hours I sat waiting to talk to someone in the Home Office? Or the fact that I couldn’t visit my mother when she was dying in Barbados? I still don’t even know where she is buried. My parents were of a generation that truly believed that Britain was the mother country. Yet they faced terrible racism when they arrived here. They are the ones who truly suffered trying to gain a foothold. I saw it as a child, but I was shielded from it to an extent. I remember as a child people saying: “Go back, niggers! Go back to where you came from.” I think I remember seeing Enoch Powell’s rivers of blood speech on television in black and white. I didn’t really understand it, but I knew it was bad. I thought they were going to come and kill me. I am of the generation that faced skinheads and the National Front. And now we have all this. I have watched the debates in parliament. I welcome the fact that ministers and the prime minister have had the decency to apologise. But their apologies don’t make you feel like they are really sorry. It made me feel like it was something they had to do to save face. Over all those years, I had no idea there were all these people like me suffering in silence. I don’t know why none of them spoke up. But for me it was shame. I was so embarrassed. I only told my children, not my friends. I felt ashamed to be in my 60s and going through something like this. That I was almost evicted from the home I’ve lived in for 31 years. That’s the thing with black Britons of my generation. We don’t like people to know when anything is wrong. Inside you are crying, but outside you won’t show it. I got my biometric identity card in February and when it came I was so relieved that I cried hysterically. I quickly got a job. But how do I get back all that I have lost? It will take a lot for me to trust this or any government. Our lives were torn apart. We will need so much more than words. • Judy Griffith is a healthcare worker from north London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/11/consultation-launched-unit-investigate-troubles-era-killings-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T17:01:23Z","webTitle":"May rejects Williamson criticism over Troubles-era killings consultation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/consultation-launched-unit-investigate-troubles-era-killings-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/consultation-launched-unit-investigate-troubles-era-killings-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"May rejects Williamson criticism over Troubles-era killings consultation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May faced down criticism from the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to launch a long-delayed consultation on a new unit to investigate Troubles-era killings, which sources close to the process said would leave veterans vulnerable. The four-month consultation was launched on Friday, amid a bitter cabinet rift over the omission of a statute of limitations for service personnel. May is understood to have backed her Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and pushed through the plan after getting cross-party agreement from the main Northern Irish parties, who oppose an amnesty. She informed Williamson on Thursday night. A source close to the process criticised the decision, saying the decision showed the prime minister “putting the interests of Sinn Féin and the DUP ahead of veterans”. Williamson was among several cabinet ministers who raised concerns with Bradley at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, where he reportedly argued that soldiers and police would be soft targets for new investigations because there were existing records for them, but not for IRA members. However, the prospect of a statute of limitations has been met by strong resistance by the main Northern Irish parties, including Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist party. Unionists fear it could pave the way for an amnesty for paramilitaries and the Irish government has also raised objections. The DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party instead favoured wider sweeping protections for former service personnel for all conflicts, including Iraq and Afghanistan, though the government does not believe this is a realistic possibility. Such a statute would apply when there had been an investigation that cleared the soldiers, to prevent cases being reopened when they were in retirement. On Friday at the launch of the consultation, Bradley said there was no support for a Northern Ireland-only statute of limitations and that there was strong feeling on both sides that people did not want to “draw a line in the sand”. “The people have been very clear to me in Northern Ireland: the way to address the legacy of the past, the way to address the legacy of the Troubles is for people to go through this process of understanding what happened, for victims to find out the truth and to see justice being done,” she told the Press Association. “That is what people have been clear they want ... they want to deal with it this way and that’s what I support.” Bradley formally launched the consultation on Friday to create four new institutions that the government agreed to establish as part of the Stormont House agreement. It will seek expert opinions on new mechanisms to investigate, document and uncover the truth of unsolved murders during the 30-year conflict. The government is expected to spend £150m over five years on the institutions. Bradley said she had “heard deeply moving stories about the suffering that victims and survivors have lived with for decades, and the profound and lasting impact on individuals, families and communities”. “This consultation provides the opportunity to begin a process that has the potential to provide better outcomes for victims, survivors and their families,” she said. “There is broad agreement that the current complex system does not work well for anyone and we are determined to put that right.” Bradley said the consultation was aimed at listening to victims and communities. “Now is the time for everyone with an interest in addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland’s troubled past to have their say.” The four institutions in the 2014 Stormont House agreement are: the historical investigations unit; a commission on information retrieval to allow families to privately receive information about the deaths of loved ones; an oral history archive; and an implementation and reconciliation group to promote anti-sectarianism. Speaking at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the chair of the defence select committee, Julian Lewis, asked May to ensure the option for a statute of limitations was “not excluded from that consultation exercise”. May said she wanted a solution that would protect veterans. “The only people being investigated for these issues that happened in the past are those in our armed forces, or those who served in law enforcement. That is patently unfair. Terrorists are not being investigated: they should be investigated and that is what the government wants to see.” The most recent Police Service of Northern Ireland statistics show resources are in fact being used to investigate paramilitaries, and more cases have been pursued against them than members of the armed forces or police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/may/16/loneliness-charities-voluntary-organisations-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T06:45:41Z","webTitle":"To beat loneliness, we must connect.

Charities can show how","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than half of UK adults feel it’s been a long time since they made a new friend, research has found. Almost half (49%) say their busy lives stop them from connecting with others and eight in 10 believe the UK is divided. It’s no surprise. Frequent reports of how lonely and divided we are, across all ages and nations, has dominated the news for months. As the head of the first nationwide organisation in the UK dedicated to creating social change on loneliness, I am greatly encouraged by the coverage. But what now? The emotive issues of loneliness and isolation are something we all seem to understand and are moved by. It’s why our film The Loneliness Project has had more than 75 million views across the world. So how does the voluntary sector lead the way in engaging the public to take action on loneliness? First, voluntary organisations need to recognise their power. They are often at the heart of local communities, cutting across class, race and gender divides. They are the glue of society, reaching people who are otherwise out of reach. So much of their work is about building relationships and social connections. Voluntary organisations are a huge part of the solution to loneliness. Second, the narrative on loneliness needs to start to shift. Highlighting the issue is important, but we need to start talking about the solution. We need to start talking about connections – not just loneliness. For the launch of our new movement, Be More Us, the Campaign to End Loneliness built on academic research that shows small moments of connection make a real difference to the lives of lonely people. Small moments of connection are simple, everyday things, such as saying hello to someone on the bus, or making small talk in a shop. We also held workshops and community conversations across the UK. We listened to hundreds of people from all walks of life, and learned what connection and friendship means to them. And we found that the public agrees with the research: almost nine in 10 UK adults believe that small moments of connection can make a make a big difference to someone who’s lonely. So, to inspire mass action, we are taking a different approach. It sounds counter-intuitive, but to inspire the public to tackle loneliness, we must stop talking about loneliness. Instead, we should focus on small moments of connection and what we share. Many in the voluntary sector already know this, offering groups and activities based on shared interests – arts and music, sport, nature, volunteering itself – which tackle loneliness by simply giving people the chance to connect. The message we want to communicate is that people can get tremendous value from one another – and that small moments of connection are crucial. This is something we know the voluntary sector understands better than any other sector. People might have begun volunteering to “help” – but that is soon overtaken by the genuine connections and relationships that often result. The Campaign to End Loneliness will continue to talk about loneliness and its devastating impact. But we hope that Be More Us gives us, and hundreds of other voluntary organisations, a chance to celebrate the things that bring us together.

While his previous book had the narrative of a tense thriller, this is broader, occasionally even verging on farce when it deals with Theresa May’s apparent inability to “speak human”. If it’s inevitably stronger on examining the Conservative party’s machinations, then that simply reflects Shipman’s greater contacts there – and, like all the best series, it ends on a cliffhanger, meaning that a third instalment can’t come quickly enough. House of Gold Natasha Solomons Hutchinson £14.99, pp432 Natasha Solomons’s fifth novel could loosely be described as a kind of Jewish Downton Abbey, dealing as it does with the personal and financial machinations of the wealthy and powerful Goldbaum clan, a family whose influence stretches across early 20th-century Europe. Only Greta, expected to marry her cousin, chooses to challenge convention. Solomons has a gift for constructing a well-paced narrative filled with surprises and it won’t shock you that the book is to be adapted for television. However, the workmanlike prose verges on banal, making House of Gold a high-class soap opera rather than anything more profound. Wilding Isabella Tree Picador, £20, pp384 Isabella Tree is an excellent example of nominative determinism in that her major project in life has been turning her substantial West Sussex estate, Knepp, into a kind of natural haven, after she and her husband realised that it was unsustainable as farmland. This engaging account of their work there, in which large numbers of endangered species now freely roam the land, shows how an ecological breakthrough can be made with imagination and persistence. And, thankfully, Tree’s excellent writing means that her saga never feels like a real-life version of The Good Life.

Oswald Gantois, 63, is accused of leaking information to the KGB and its successor, the SVR, that the Kremlin could have used to create false papers and identities for its agents. The case against the former consul, who worked in the US, India, Japan, Portugal and Algeria during his career, was built using undercover agents, months of observation, eavesdropping devices and house searches, a Belgian federal court in Bruges heard. Gantois was also interrogated and obliged to take a lie detector test. Ann Fransen, the federal prosecutor, said that in 1985 Gantois allowed himself to be recruited by KGB operators who worked for the so-called N-line division, specialising in the delivery of false papers and fictional lives to spies. “You need all sorts of false documents for this. The knowledge of the accused over the Belgian naturalisation legislation was obviously very useful,” Fransen said. The court heard that Gantois was wined and dined by the Russian secret services and offered money and expensive bottles of vodka for his help. “He never noted those lunches in his diary and he never filed expense reports,” Fransen told the court. “This proves that he was very aware of the clandestine character of his activities. During one of the phone calls we listened to, he said himself that he had played too much James Bond but that every diplomat must be a bit of a spy.” Gantois’s lawyer, Luc Arnou, said the investigation had failed to prove his client’s guilt, and his failure to report the meals was an oversight. “The espionage methods used [by the prosecution] were worse than those mentioned in this case,” he said. “Non-events were wrung out like a mop. But what did that yield? Nougatbollen [Flemish slang for nothing].” In defence of a “false answer” given by Gantois during the polygraph test, Arnou said: “The question appeared to be that of the TV programme Temptation Island. Of course he played on information, but never of a secret nature. Any Belgian lawyer could provide that information.” Gantois, who is suspended from work, told the court that while he may have accepted vodka, and may have had concerns about some of the questions asked of him by his Russian contact, he had been motivated only by service to Belgium during his diplomatic career. “I never accepted money … I never disclosed state secrets,” he said. “I am right with myself and that is enough. This case has destroyed my life. In the eyes of the investigators I was guilty right from the start. ‘You went over but they betrayed you’, they said. Now I want this to stop. I want to be able to close this.” A verdict is due on 13 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/11/well-earned-magic-actors-pay-tribute-to-old-vic-on-200th-birthday","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:30:03Z","webTitle":"'Well-earned magic': actors pay tribute to Old Vic on 200th birthday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/11/well-earned-magic-actors-pay-tribute-to-old-vic-on-200th-birthday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/11/well-earned-magic-actors-pay-tribute-to-old-vic-on-200th-birthday","fields":{"headline":"'Well-earned magic': actors pay tribute to Old Vic on 200th birthday","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A glittering lineup of actors including Judi Dench, Glenda Jackson and Simon Callow have paid tribute to the Old Vic as it prepared to celebrate its 200th birthday. Interviews with actors were broadcast online on Friday afternoon via Twitter in what was billed as the first global “marathon broadcast” from a theatre across a social media platform. On Saturday at noon, a 10-piece marching band was due to lead a parade from outside the National Theatre on the short journey to the Old Vic where there will be a street party and open house featuring performers, a programme of free activities and food stalls. In the evening, the auditorium will become a one-night-only cabaret space for a fundraiser harking back to the theatre’s days as a music hall in the 1880s. The Old Vic has one of the most splendid, dazzling histories of any theatre anywhere, but there have been significant downs as well as spectacular ups – not least the public disgrace of its former artistic director Kevin Spacey and the theatre’s apology last November for not creating an environment where people could raise concerns about his behaviour. It has since introduced a number of measures to try to rectify that. Among the tributes was one from Dench, who recalled having just left drama school when she was cast as Ophelia at the Old Vic. “The Vic was always my dream and it was just a miracle that it happened. I learned everything I know, really, from being here. It is very, very, very special.” Jackson, who made such a triumphant return to the stage when she played King Lear after a 25-year break, said she thought the Old Vic’s reputation was immutable. “It’s a lovely theatre to be in, it’s a lovely theatre to play in,” she said. “It has, undoubtedly, a well-earned magic which has nothing to do exclusively with longevity.” She said the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, deserved praise for his efforts to attract new audiences. “Because there isn’t going to be any theatre in the future if we don’t create the desire to go, if we don’t allow people to understand that it can be a unique experience. When it works, there’s nowhere else like it in the world.” Twitter content on Friday included the full-length production of Future Conditional, the play about UK schools that starred Rob Brydon and opened Warchus’s first season as artistic director in 2015. Interspersed were interviews with Dench, Jackson, Callow and Lesley Manville and a backstage tour of the theatre led by Daniel Ratcliffe and Joshua McGuire. Callow said it should be acknowledged that almost all the “true benefactors and creators of British theatre have been women.”. He said Emma Cons and then Lilian Baylis “created the absolute foundation of the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Sadler’s Wells … all came out of these batty women, absolutely round the bend, but absolutely wonderful, extraordinary, passionate, committed people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/talking-horses-can-ryan-moore-work-his-magic-in-chester-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T10:11:06Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: will Ryan Moore work his magic in Chester Cup?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/talking-horses-can-ryan-moore-work-his-magic-in-chester-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/talking-horses-can-ryan-moore-work-his-magic-in-chester-cup","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: will Ryan Moore work his magic in Chester Cup?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The big betting race of Chester’s May meeting is the feature event as the meeting draws to a close today, and the decision to switch the Chester Cup from the first day to the last looks like another clever move by one of the most shrewdly-run tracks in the country. The Classic trials are all well and good, but the Chester Cup offers spectacle, history and the chance to back a favourite at the sort of price that could pay for your afternoon (or week), and it feels like the right way to bring the meeting to its conclusion. There is also a theory that this is not quite as difficult a race to work out as a 17-strong field might imply, because even with two circuits of the track to sort themselves out, the draw is still highly significant. Seven of the last 10 winners have been drawn between one and five, and Fun Mac (stall five) and Magic Circle (in six) are both strong in the market this morning as a result. Despite the unique nature of the test around the tightest major track in the country, it still feels a little odd that the draw should play a role in a race staged over two-and-a-quarter miles. There is little doubt that it does, but it is a factor rather than a defining characteristic, and horses have managed to win from double-figure stalls in the fairly recent past including Trip To Paris from stall 11 in 2015. Trip To Paris won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot less than two months later, and so was probably fairly well in at Chester off a mark of 95. All the same, it shows that a classy horse can defy a high draw, and Who Dares Wins (3.35) might just be good enough to do the same today. Ryan Moore has been booked to steer Alan King’s gelding around the Roodee from stall 15, and he will need every ounce of his talent to get Who Dares Wins to the line in front. Were it not for his draw, though, Who Dares Wins would be a very plausible favourite, as he was fourth in this race last year after finding plenty of trouble in running and has been posting some excellent performances over jumps in recent weeks. He was a close third off his jumps mark of 149 in a competitive handicap hurdle at Aintree last month, which suggests that a Flat mark of 100 is still workable. If Moore can work a little magic, 10-1 is too big a price. Eminent, fourth in last year’s Derby, is odds-on to make a successful seasonal debut in the Huxley Stakes, when Oisin Murphy will be the fifth different jockey to ride Martyn Meade’s colt in as many starts. He also finished third in the Irish Champion Stakes and fifth in the Eclipse last season but he has not seen a track since Leopardstown in September and could prove vulnerable to a race-fit rival. Forest Ranger, a Group Three winner at the Craven meeting, should give him a race and is a big price at 11-2 to make his fitness edge count, while Kachy (4.05) and Dark Red (3.00) should also go close on the same card. Lamloom (6.45) and Jumira Bridge (3.25) should also go well at Nottingham and Lingfield respectively."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/11/spanish-newsreaders-wear-black-in-protest-against-political-interference","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:04:06Z","webTitle":"Spanish newsreaders wear black in protest against ‘political interference’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/spanish-newsreaders-wear-black-in-protest-against-political-interference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/11/spanish-newsreaders-wear-black-in-protest-against-political-interference","fields":{"headline":"Spanish newsreaders wear black in protest against ‘political interference’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For the third Friday in a row, journalists working for Spain’s public broadcaster have worn black on screen to protest against alleged political interference, gender bias and unequal pay. The campaign, known as viernes negro (black Friday), is intended to highlight the Spanish government’s continuing refusal to approve a transparent process to appoint an independent board at RTVE. Protesters argue that the ruling conservative People’s party (PP) meddles in media coverage and has a vested interest in appointing the RTVE chair directly. “For the third consecutive week, RTVE workers are wearing black this Friday to protest against the parliamentary impasse that is hindering the establishment of a public competition to choose the leadership team and restore RTVE’s professional judgment,” the group RTVE Women said in a statement. “This struggle, which aims to get RTVE offering diverse, quality and independent information, is one that concerns all of us – including the average citizen whose taxes pay for the production and distribution of RTVE content.” Journalists have been using the hashtag #AsiSeManipula (#ThisIsHowTheyManipulate) to share their experiences of bias and the pressure placed on them to report certain stories in certain ways. On Tuesday, an RTVE editor resigned after her TV channel failed to run a video in which a government aide was caught criticising protesting pensioners. The aide said: “How I’d love to give them the finger and tell them to go fuck themselves.” The broadcaster also made headlines in November after it used the theme music from the horror film The Exorcist to accompany a clip featuring the deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. Six years ago, a number of RTVE journalists were allegedly purged from the broadcaster for questioning PP’s austerity measures. RTVE’s current chair, José Antonio Sánchez, has been accused of pro-PP bias. RTVE Women has called on the public to join the campaign by posting photos of themselves dressed in black under the hashtag #BlackFriday3. It also urging people to use the hashtag #Don’tChangeChannel, in response to the Spanish finance minister’s recent suggestion that people could simply switch channels if they didn’t like RTVE’s coverage. Campaigners are hoping to harness the momentum generated by Spain’s recent “feminist strike”, in which about 5 million women participated, and the public outcry over a court’s decision to clear five men of the gang-rape of a teenager. Male journalists are also backing the cause. “We suffer the consequences of sexism – the glass ceiling; the pay gap – and we’re not prepared to keep working under unequal conditions,” RTVE Women said. “It’s about justice and we’re convinced that, when it comes to a job that needs to be socially responsible, our view offers a less partial view of reality.” RTVE said it would not comment on the campaign or accusations of bias."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/live/2018/may/11/joan-armatrading-webchat-not-too-far-away","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T16:07:05Z","webTitle":"'I was born to write'… Joan Armatrading on Dylan, songwriting and stage fright","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2018/may/11/joan-armatrading-webchat-not-too-far-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2018/may/11/joan-armatrading-webchat-not-too-far-away","fields":{"headline":"'I was born to write'… Joan Armatrading on Dylan, songwriting and stage fright","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"BewilderedMark says: Loved your gig on Graham Norton last week. skintman asks: R u free to do Eurovision next year?

I’m not sure I can think of another artist who has expressed such huge emotions without a trace of sentimentality. So thank you. The sentiMentalist asks: My serendipitous discovery of your incredible music only happened a few years ago with The Weakness in Me.

I don’t understand how I missed you in the 1980s and 90s, (I have a good excuse for the 70s: I wasn’t alive then) but I have since made up for those lost decades. Willow is the most beautiful and sincere expression of unconditional love. More Than One Kind of Love is another favourite of mine. Your authenticity and the effortlessness with which you invoke emotions in your listener are what I admire most about your musicianship. And you achieve this sans vocal gymnastics … What’s your reaction when you hear covers of your songs? Do you cringe? I know I do, lol.

Or feel the bite of Scotland’s four good teeth\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week my country woke to the news that the US had attacked Irn-Bru. Since Scotland doesn’t yet have an air force, we did the next best thing and scrambled into readiness our elite republican guard of journalists and media fishwives. From Wick to Gretna the sound of jerking knees was deafening and the air thrummed with the prickly indignation of talking heads. We love the smell of hyperbole in the morning. We quickly concluded that since Irn-Bru had no military or strategic value, then the object of the attack must have been to weaken our national morale. It was a bloodbath, except in a can and with lots of sugar. Irn-Bru, I should explain to anyone indifferent or blind to the sufferings of my people, is a fizzy drink of doubtful virtue. But it must be protected with our lives – or, if not lives, teeth. We have four good teeth left in Scotland, and they’re in a glass case in the Wallace Monument next to the great man’s sword and a Scottish £20 note that was turned down by a petrol pump attendant in Surbiton. Grievance is to us what depression was to Philip Larkin. This week’s inciting incident took place in the plush surroundings of Trump Turnberry, the president’s luxury Scottish golf complex. It emerged that the general manager, Ralph Porciani – don’t bother Googling, there is no Porciani tartan – has officially banned Irn-Bru because the complex has undergone an expensive upgrade and “the Bru”’, when spilled, leaves indelible orange stains on the carpet. Earlier this week Donald Trump announced the US’s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal. Being Scots, we now concluded this move to have been a crude feint intended to divert attention from the deep insult to our second national drink. But why? Like others, I was puzzled. Donald Trump trails orange tanning cream the way random spooks leave novichok on door handles. With this in mind, I randomly trolled the forum of “Cleantalk: carpet cleaning solutions and machines”, and after a painstaking search lasting a full moment found the following from a Mr Keith Smith: “I am looking for a good remover of Irn bru and fake tan. I need it for a small spill of juice and a few drops of fake tan. Any help welcome. Thanks.” Now here comes the kicker – that plea from Mr Smith is dated 4 July 2012. Six years ago, comrades! Settle yourselves, there’s more. Expert help from a Mr Matthew Martin to Mr Smith was forthcoming the same day: “Hi Keith, with the fake tan it will probably not come out as it is a dye stain…” Sensing a “however”, and with quickening heartbeat, I read on, “M Power might shift the juice or Microspotter could help.” In other words, Irn-Bru stains may be easier to remove than fake-tan stains; yet Irn-Bru, and not fake tan, has been banned from Trump Turnberry. Was this a smoking gun? The heady scent of a Pulitzer prize wooed my senses until I read this from Mr Ken Wainwright, dated 5 July, the next day: “Hi Keith. Irn Bru. This stain will require the use of bleaching agents and I would use the same guidelines [I have provided] above. Regardless, I would be doubtful of a perfect undamaged result.” Friends, as a patriot – even a Scots one – I am obliged to see things exactly as they are. At the time of writing, the Turnberry ban on Irn-Bru remains in place. Turnberry is in Ayrshire, the county of Burns. I’m sure Donald Trump is more familiar with carpet burns than Robert Burns. When he next visits us he will be assured of the red, or indeed orange, carpet treatment. Donald, be warned, a nation waits to bare its spiritual teeth. All four of them. • Ian Pattison is a playwright and novelist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/19/salley-vickers-stoke-on-trent","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T11:01:25Z","webTitle":"Salley Vickers on Stoke-on-Trent: ‘Thanks to my upbringing, my books have a tenderness for misfits'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/19/salley-vickers-stoke-on-trent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/19/salley-vickers-stoke-on-trent","fields":{"headline":"Salley Vickers on Stoke-on-Trent: ‘Thanks to my upbringing, my books have a tenderness for misfits'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was born in Liverpool, my mother’s home town. During the war she was bombed and due to her injuries while pregnant with me she was under the care of a specialist obstetrician. But my father was warden of Barlaston Hall near Stoke-on-Trent, a residential adult education college, founded by Josiah Wedgwood, and run jointly by the WEA (Workers’ Educational Association) and the TUC. At that time both my parents were committed communists. I recall some of the more famous party members coming to the college: Harry Pollitt (he gave me a huge red lollipop) but also Eric Hobsbawm, the Marxist historian who had helped pull my mother out of the fire raised by the bomb that nearly killed her. My father lectured on Arnold Bennett, Mrs Gaskell and the poetry of John Clare. All became early favourites of mine. Thanks to my early upbringing, my books have a special tenderness for underdogs and misfits. One of my three commie “god”-parents was Lily Marshall, shop steward at the Wedgwood factory. She was a jovial, sharp-witted lesbian and lived with “Auntie” Mary, her partner who ran a children’s clothes shop in Stoke. When my father was sacked for his communist beliefs and we moved to London, I often came back to stay with Lily and Mary and thought nothing of the fact they slept together in a comfy double bed where I used to snuggle in between them to be read Mary Plain (“First-class bear with a white rosette”), and My Friend Mr Leakey. The latter, by JBS Haldane, a Marxist geneticist, is about a subversive magician. Despite Haldane’s undoubted rationalism it is nonetheless a book that celebrates magic and otherworld realms (another theme of mine). I used to help in Mary’s shop, where I observed the customers and minded children while their mothers chatted and havered prudently over the best value woollies to buy. After we closed up shop and Lil came home, we would all three go to a “tea-time” club where socialist songs were sung: “I’m the man, the very fat man who waters the workers’ beer” and “Joe Hill”. Later, I went to hear Paul Robeson sing the latter at the Festival Hall and we sang it at my father’s funeral. I often went with Lil to the Wedgwood factory where I fashioned misshapen pots stamped with the Wedgwood mark. As a child I wanted first to be a potter (later a ballet dancer) and, again, my books usually have something to say about the power of art to inform and restore our inner worlds. I love the Potteries with that abiding love that children have for places where they were happy and loved. • Salley Vickers will be talking about her new novel The Librarian (Viking) at the Emma Bridgwater festival, Stoke -on-Trent, on 9 June. • This article was amended on 21 May 2018.

Decades later – 18 years after the biography and 13 since Bellow’s death – he has done just that, recalling the ups and downs of their relationship, exploring his “agonised” ambivalence about the job he did, and reflecting on the dilemmas of the life writing trade, especially when the person you’re writing about is alive. “There will be tears before bedtime,” Atlas was warned about his Bellow project, and there were. Hence the motivation for this book – part mea culpa, part self-exoneration, part memoir. Atlas dates his fascination with biography back to the two years he spent as a postgraduate in Oxford, where James Joyce’s biographer Richard Ellmann acted as his supervisor. Back in the US, he touted for reviewing work, got a lucky break or two, and – still in his early 20s – was commissioned to write a biography of the poet Delmore Schwartz, a cult figure whose reputation was then in decline. Atlas describes the transgressive thrill of reading Schwartz’s diaries – and the challenge of interviewing those who’d known him. Most were now old men and found talking about their vanished youth a painful business: “My presence couldn’t have been more unsettling if I’d worn a hooded cloak and carried a scythe.” But others seemed almost oblivious to him, happily revealing long-kept secrets. The resulting biography owed some of its success to Atlas’s close identification with Schwartz – “his unrealisable expectations, his piercing loneliness, his book hunger, his literary ambition, his dread of failure, his sense of the sadness of life”. Such empathy can easily disappear in the course of research but it’s important to have it at the outset. When Atlas agreed to write a life of Edmund Wilson, he soon realised his mistake. Juicy anecdotes aside, why devote years to an antisemitic brute who boasted of how many women he had slept with and was dismissed as “a cold fishy leprous person” by one of his four wives? Atlas returned the advance. Bellow had even more wives – five – as well as many lovers, but Atlas found nothing surprising about that. He could see how attractive Bellow was, physically and intellectually. And, as with Schwartz, he felt a strong sense of affinity – both he and Bellow had been raised in Chicago, albeit in very different neighbourhoods. He imagined the two of them becoming as companionable as Boswell and Johnson. Occasionally he chafed at the inequality: why did Bellow show no interest in him? And the way Bellow exploited others – whether in life or as fictional material – gave him pause. But for the most part he remained in thrall and willingly cast himself in the role of acolyte, hanging on to the great man’s every word and cajoling him to co-operate. It was a tricky business. Bellow was wary and quick to take offence. For all the time they spent together, Atlas never felt comfortable enough to call him Saul. Biographers, Bellow once said, are “the shadow of the tombstone in the garden”, a bon mot Atlas has adapted (and watered down) for the title of this book. Interspersed with his accounts of pursuing his two quarries are tributes to biographers ancient and modern. Artfully arranged to interrupt and add suspense to the main narrative – how are things with Bellow going to pan out? – they also allow for some terrific stories and quotes, including John Aubrey on the capacity of a biographer “to raise the dead, so that the retrieving of these forgotten Things from Oblivion in some sort resembles the Art of a Conjuror”. The tricks required can be dirty as well as magical. Reductiveness is inevitable; subjectivity too; and you can never get it right. “If a man has not supped with his subject, he cannot know him well enough to write his biography,” Dr Johnson said. Maybe so. But with Bellow, Atlas found that knowing him was “a hindrance to understanding him”. When his biography finally came out, several reviewers were struck by its ungenerous tone. Guiltily combing through the pages, Atlas marked with yellow Post-its all the sentences that he wished he had removed: the Twelve Errors, he called them, before reducing the number to six. Conversations with two of Bellow’s three sons – still smarting at their father’s neglect of them – reassured him he’d been fairer and less vengeful than critics alleged. Unimpressed by the argument that the people to whom Bellow gave pleasure, through fiction, far outnumbered those he hurt in life, Atlas speculates that Bellow needed pseudo-sons, such as James Wood and Martin Amis, whose love was unconditional. There’s something in this, though it’s trite to suggest that Amis was drawn to Bellow because his own father, Kingsley, was unappreciative and “defective”. Atlas may have written only two biographies but he has thought long and hard about the pitfalls of the genre: he likens himself to “a car mechanic, repair manual in hand, peering under the hood of a steaming engine”. His book motors smoothly along: it is well written, wide-ranging, packed with gossip and has some of the best footnotes you’ll ever come across. But it’s hard to miss the suffering underneath – the story of a life made sadder by the writing of a Life. The Shadow in the Garden: A Biographer’s Tale by James Atlas (Corsair, £30).

The charity found that the number of schools seeking professional help for students from NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) was 34,757 in 2017-18, equivalent to 183 every school day. In 2014-15, there were 25,140 referrals. More than half (55%) of referrals over the four-year period came from primary schools. In almost a third of all referrals for which data was available, the child in question was denied specialist CAMHS treatment. While, in some cases it might not have been necessary, the NSPCC believes under-resourcing is also a factor. It says community and voluntary services such as Childline are picking up the pieces in many cases and the government must plough more cash into them. Alana Ryan, the NSPCC policy officer, said: “It is worrying there are so many children being deemed as needing some kind of mental health support and whether or not that is mental health support that meets the clinical support threshold, it’s still a need.” She said even where referrals were accepted, waiting times were often long. “Mental health support shouldn’t be limited to a medical model,” said Ryan. “We need to make full use of community resources which champion early intervention.” The NSPCC sent freedom of information requests to 66 NHS trusts, to which 53 responded with at least some of the data sought. It found that 123,713 referrals had been made since 2014-15. While some of the rise since then is likely to be a result of growing awareness among teachers, it also reflects a growing mental health crisis in young people. At least 10% of children and young people are thought to suffer from anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders or other mental health conditions. Soaring numbers of under-18s have sought NHS care for such problems over the past decade but, according to Public Health England, only a quarter who need help get it. The NSPCC’s Childline service has reported a 26% increase in the number of counselling sessions with children about mental health issues over the past four years, with some saying they only received specialist support when they reach crisis point. “When children come through to us, they speak about things like exam pressures, social media and not being able to get into specialist services, asking that we intervene on their behalf,” said Ryan. The NSPCC suggests the high number of referrals from primary schools could reflect a lack of funding and services to support children in those settings. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said members had reported a surge in the number of patients with emotional and behavioural difficulties, often after being rejected by CAMHS. It said funding cuts were leaving schools “exposed and unsupported”. Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser on mental health and wellbeing for the school leaders’ union NAHT, said headteachers were concerned CAMHS was setting treatment thresholds too high. “This means that early intervention by specialist mental health staff is not happening,” she said. The government has pledged to introduce four-week maximum waiting times for CAMHS but it has been criticised because they will only apply to up to a quarter of England by 2022-23. Esther Rantzen, the Childline founder and president, said: “We must make sure that Childline is adequately funded so it isn’t left vulnerable and can be there for the children who have nowhere else to turn.” A government spokeswoman said it was investing an additional £300m to provide quicker support to children. “We know we need to do more which is why we have extended our schools and NHS link pilot to deliver training in 20 more areas of the country this year,” he said. “This will improve links between up to 1,200 schools and their local specialist mental health service.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/11/local-council-issues-tree-preservation-orders-to-stop-network-rail-felling","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T11:50:25Z","webTitle":"Local council issues tree preservation orders to stop Network Rail felling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/11/local-council-issues-tree-preservation-orders-to-stop-network-rail-felling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/11/local-council-issues-tree-preservation-orders-to-stop-network-rail-felling","fields":{"headline":"Local council issues tree preservation orders to stop Network Rail felling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A local authority has imposed preservation orders on trees growing on Network Rail land to stop them being felled by the operator. Bromley Council said on Friday it had issued two tree preservation orders (TPO) on a group of mature oaks, sycamores and ash trees which grow alongside the railway, following Guardian revelations that Network Rail had considered an “enhanced clearance” programme. Rail minister Jo Johnson called on Network Rail to suspend all current tree felling during what is the nesting season and commissioned a review into other options than felling for the rail operator. The review, which is being carried out in conjunction with the RSPB and the Tree Council, will report to Johnson in August. In order to protect its trees from action by Network Rail, Bromley council in greater London – which boasts the largest tree stock of any borough in the capital, has imposed two TPOs on a group of mature rail-side species in Ridgeway Drive. Peter Morgan, Plaistow and Sundridge ward councillor said, “Trees form part of the much-loved character of our borough, with there being reputedly more trees in our borough than other London borough and protecting the trees, for the benefit of us all is important. “I am pleased to confirm that the council has introduced a tree preservation order which protects the much-valued trees, including semi-mature oak trees, on railway land in Ridgeway Drive in Bromley.” He said the order – made in September – gave protection to all the trees which were present at the time. Morgan said: “It is important to note that this does not prevent Network Rail from carrying out necessary works in line with their statutory requirements ... it does mean that they are required to seek the council’s permission for any work.” The area where trees are now protected from felling by the rail operator covers 5,000 sq metres (5980 sq yards) worth of land alongside the railway line. The council said the species growing include a range of broad leaved trees, mainly oak, both Turkey oak and English oak, with some other trees including sycamore and ash. Network Rail has identified these species as the most problematic in terms of leaves falling on the line. A Network Rail internal document identifies 13 million trees within falling distance of the track – some on third party land and some on its own land. The document explored policy options for future tree management and identified a preferred option of ‘enhanced clearance’. Network Rail says the document is “a piece of modelling work” that was not adopted as policy. • This article was amended on 24 August 2018 following a complaint from Network Rail.

Comments are open on our series recap blog. In the beam of a car’s headlights, a woman – buried shoulder-deep and gagged with gaffer tape – is stoned to death. She is the head of Denmark’s immigration board. Some members of her staff were recently filmed cracking open a bottle of champagne to celebrate success in a deportation case involving a gay Iranian man who could face execution on his return. Henrik (Thure Lindhardt), still just about in the force, is on the case, with seriously unenlightened new partner Jonas (Mikael Birkkjær). But where the hell is Saga (Sofia Helin), The Bridge’s central pillar or keystone? She is over on the Swedish side, banged up, unjustly, for killing her mother, who set her up by staging her own, incriminating death. There is an appeal coming up. In the meantime, Saga is keeping her head down: ignoring the prison bore, avoiding the renowned cop killer, reading and doing pottery because it doesn’t require interaction. Solitary – for fighting – is easier. Jail isn’t easy with the A-Word that never speaks its name, but is ever-present. I mean the more specific A-word, the one the continues -sperger’s. Henrik visits, for sex more than chat. It seems to be allowed during Swedish prison visits. Nice to see that, in these times of rising intolerance and suspicion, some good old-fashioned Scandi-enlightenment survives. Also, they serve spaghetti carbonara in the canteen. Saga has been stripped not only of her job and her dignity, but her entire identity. That’s the key here, what looks like it’s going to be the major theme of this fourth and final series. Henrik has never really rediscovered his identity after losing his family. And here are a couple of identical twin brothers, the less successful one happy to borrow the identity of his TV reporter sibling in order to lure women into bed. It’s not yet clear how these twins fit in. Or the mother and son on the run from their dangerous violent husband/father, except that he – a taxi driver – was the last person to see the head of immigration alive. New characters – fascinating ones, The Bridge does characterisation so well – have been introduced. The strands for the series have been thrown down, apparently a knotty plotty tangle, but we know, from experience, that they are sure to be unpicked and spliced into something coherent, meaningful and beautiful. Although a new series is a new start and a new case, there is a wider, series-spanning arc as well: Saga’s past, fragments of which have emerged; her condition; the gaping hole in Henrik’s life where his children once were; the relationship between the two of them; the relationship between their countries. Yes, there have been tensions between Denmark and Sweden as well, with different attitudes to border controls emerging since the previous series of The Bridge went out. Take a step further back, and a bigger picture still comes into focus. As the skies above the Øresund strait darken (gloomier than ever it seems in this one, Nordic noir extra), the refugee crisis continues. Millions search for new lives and new identities. This in turn leads to a pandemic of paranoia, sharp rises in extremism, populism and polarisation, racism, all the isms. Homophobia, too, and a bubbly toast for a ruling to send a gay man possibly to his death, Skål! Before the toasters’ boss is stoned to her death – it’s so gruesome, that scene, it’s almost unwatchable. Meanwhile, offscreen, in another northern European country: immigrant removal targets.

Kluivert, the son of the former Barcelona and Netherlands centre-forward Patrick, has been in contract discussions with Ajax. It is understood talks have broken down because of his demand to be the highest-paid player at the club. Kluivert asked for a sizeable rise to €1.5m (£1.3m) a year and a proportion of any transfer fee to be split between him and his agent, Mino Raiola. Ajax’s policy is to pay no player more than €1m, so Kluivert demanded a significant signing-on fee. Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 league games this season and believes he deserves fresh terms to reflect his growing status. He is on the wage of his initial professional contract, signed in 2016, which ends next summer. Kluivert made his international debut in March, as a replacement in the Netherlands’ 3-0 win over Portugal. Kluivert likes to play as a wide forward and can operate on either wing. Mourinho was a coach at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Patrick Kluivert played for the club. Mourinho’s interest in Kluivert casts further doubt over the future of Anthony Martial. The 22-year-old has been unable to hold down a starting place. The United manager criticised him after last Friday’s 1-0 defeat at Brighton and he was on the bench for Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham. Mourinho said Romelu Lukaku may be fit enough for a place on the bench for next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea. The striker has missed United’s past two matches with an ankle injury and will be absent when they host Watford on Sunday. “We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.” Mourinho said Marcus Rashford and Martial would return against Watford. There will also be starts for Sergio Romero, Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and Juan Mata, and Michael Carrick will be captain in his final appearance before joining United’s coaching staff. “He is not going to finish the match because I want him to leave the pitch alone and I want him to feel what the Manchester United supporters feel about him,” the manager added of Carrick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2018/may/16/visual-guide-ecuador-julian-assange-surveillance-operation","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T11:57:41Z","webTitle":"A visual guide to Ecuador's Julian Assange spy operation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/may/16/visual-guide-ecuador-julian-assange-surveillance-operation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/may/16/visual-guide-ecuador-julian-assange-surveillance-operation","fields":{"headline":"A visual guide to Ecuador's Julian Assange spy operation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Ecuadorian government has carried out a multimillion-dollar surveillance operation designed to protect and support Julian Assange during his six years of political asylum in the country’s embassy in London, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The surveillance operation In 2012, Ecuador’s intelligence agency hired an international security company to establish the programme for a monthly cost of $55,000 (£40,000), which was paid from a “special expenses” budget. The documents describe how the company’s secret agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy in a modest basement flat costing £2,800 a month, in one of the most expensive parts of London. From a control room inside the Ecuadorian embassy, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. His guests went through a security check upon arrival, handing over their passports and mobile phones. The operatives recorded each guest’s passport number and nationality, as well as the purpose of their visit, building up a comprehensive log of everyone Assange met during his stay. According to the documents, the security company sent the confidential list of Assange’s visitors to Ecuador’s government. The logs are likely to be of interest to Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that Russia helped Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. The FBI has interviewed at least one person involved in “Operation Guest ”, which later became known as “Operation Hotel”, it is understood. Some of Assange’s “social” visits were from famous names including Pamela Anderson and Vivienne Westwood, as well as the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison . There were also “extraordinary reports” that included daily logs of Assange’s activities within the embassy, noting his general mood. Activities outside the embassy were also monitored and recorded. One report included photographs of anti-Assange protesters with signs that read “We want you out of our embassy”. It was even noted when a packet of sweets was thrown on to the balcony – seemingly a present for Assange. Inside the embassy This level of scrutiny came after the security company installed CCTV cameras in the embassy’s lobby and a conference room, and on the balcony. Initially, Assange slept in a narrow room next to the balcony, but he later came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space and sleep in a larger back room. Assange’s realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and not covered by CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, with access controlled by door codes. This surveillance did not come cheap According to documents seen by the Guardian, the Ecuadorian intelligence agency spent at least $5m on the surveillance operation. The agency’s expense reports alarmed the Ecuadorian financial controller, who asked how more than $400,000 could have been spent in the first five months of the operation without a single receipt. In March, the intelligence agency was shut down by Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, who described Assange’s continuing presence as an “inherited problem”. That same month, embassy staff cut off his internet access. Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next, making his future more uncertain than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-giant-jade-buddha-and-its-pilgrimage-from-british-columbia-to-bendigo","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"The giant Jade Buddha and its pilgrimage from British Columbia to Bendigo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-giant-jade-buddha-and-its-pilgrimage-from-british-columbia-to-bendigo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-giant-jade-buddha-and-its-pilgrimage-from-british-columbia-to-bendigo","fields":{"headline":"The giant Jade Buddha and its pilgrimage from British Columbia to Bendigo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Inside a shipping container encircled by ironbark trees, eight kilometres north-west of Bendigo in regional Victoria, there’s a special cargo: a million-dollar Buddha, carved out of jade, that has seen more cities and faces than you or I could dream of. He sits patiently in meditation pose, waiting to be unveiled amid great ceremony and carried into the gleaming white Great Stupa of Universal Compassion – the $20m Buddhist monument that rises out of the bushland next to the container. There, he will be protected by Mission Impossible-style security. The Jade Buddha might sound like an episode of a Miss Fisher Murder Mystery but it’s actually a 2.5-metre sculpture that was carved out of what’s claimed to be the world’s largest boulder of jade, discovered in Canada 18 years ago. The statue has spent the past decade on a world tour, visited by more than 11 million people. It might seem odd that its final home is in regional Victoria but since 1981 these 210 acres of land have been donated to the creation of a Buddhist centre by former advertising executive Ian Green and his family. Green was the Jade Buddha’s travelling companion across 130 countries and it’s he who bought the jewel after consulting with his teacher, Lama Zopa Rinpoche. It started in 2003, when Green received a phone call from jeweller Cheyenne Sun Hill. Sun Hill had heard about an 18-ton giant boulder, “Polar Pride”, excavated in British Columbia. Being a Buddhist himself, Sun Hill felt that this rock ought to be carved into a Buddha, rather than whittled down into bangles. He tried to convince several large Buddhist groups before cold-calling Green. “He spoke like a dude: ‘Hey man …’,” Green tells Guardian Australia. “I didn’t know what he was talking about. But there was a strange synchronicity – he was ringing from Santa Cruz and I was about to go to Santa Cruz three weeks later. So I said, ‘Why don’t we just meet for a coffee and have a chat about it?’” Upon Green’s arrival, Sun Hill took him to a nudist bar. “I’ve no idea why,” Green says now. As they took a seat among people carefully drinking lattes, Green took a look at Sun Hill’s stretched earlobes and his back, with a mythical bird, the garuda, spanning its width. “He looked a bit wild but he was a lovely guy,” Green says. “We had a vegan burger.” Maybe it was the environment, maybe it was Sun Hill’s enthusiasm but Green found himself agreeing to fly to Canada to see the boulder in person. Unpolished, it was a squat brown rock but he sat with it for a while and thought there was something special about it. “Maybe it was an energy that I could sense,” he says, almost apologetically. Green made a bid for the million-dollar jewel, to be paid in instalments and funded partly by donations and partly by selling the off-cuts as smaller statues, to pay back the mining company. Unbelievably, the journey of the Jade Buddha for Universal Peace was granted. Was the mining company chairman swayed because his surname was Makepeace, and he enjoyed the spiritual serendipity of Green/Makepeace? Only the Jade Buddha knows for sure. The statue slowly took shape in the oldest carving factory in Thailand and in 2008 it began its hectic tour. As of Friday 18 May, it can meditate in peace in the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion. While the stupa is in daily use, there are a few years of work to go. When it’s finished there will be 80 shrine rooms around its six-storey perimeter and people will ascend through them as a form of meditation. Green’s masterplan is to have a Buddhist village on site. There’s already a monastery and the Atisha Centre, which hosts meditation retreats, but last year a spanner was thrown in the works: new fire regulations mean much more land has to be cleared for building to commence and consequently the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning must be appeased with $8m to $13m worth of offset planting. Still, Green considers the stupa to be his life’s work and, he says, that work will continue after his death. Green visited his first stupa quite accidentally, in 1971. During his years at an advertising agency he had been on a fast-track to a heart attack thanks to a lifestyle of adrenalin, late-night card games and women. He had his own Eat, Pray, Love moment when he decided to take a trip to India. “I had known from a youngster that without the spiritual aspect I was an incomplete person,” he says. “In India I could see that every taxi, tree and shop had an altar. Even so, looking at all the Hindu deities, I mainly thought they were funky things to have on a T-shirt.” While in Varanasi, he took a break from the heat and noise in Deer Park, where he found himself contemplating the Great Stupa of Sarnath. “I spent a long time looking at it, thinking, is this man-made or is a volcanic plug or something?” he recalls. “But the feeling of peace overwhelmed me.” At the nearby shop he bought a book – What Is Buddhism? – and read it on the plane home. Green agrees that Buddhism tends to be the religion that high-flyers turn to in times of crisis. “Well, the Buddha was … I don’t know about rock’n’roll but he was a prince, he was a big deal before he gave the whole thing away,” he points out. “Once you go through that process of acquiring material goods you realise that it’s not going to provide you with lasting happiness. I know a lot of people in advertising who become interested in Buddhism and it’s true of lots of people in showbiz and, dare I say, journalism.” Last year, the Atisha Centre and stupa received 26,000 visitors from around the world, with 60% being Buddh-curious. “We get lots of Probus clubs visiting and they’re keen to know about karma and the Dalai Lama,” Green says. “The questions are terrific.” A new attraction is the interfaith Peace Garden, which includes a statue of St Francis of Assisi, donated by the Catholic diocese of Sandhurst, and other symbols coming from local Sikh, Hindu, Muslim, Mormon and Indigenous organisations. The garden and the stupa will be lit up during Illumin8, the annual festival of light and peace that this year also celebrates the arrival of the Jade Buddha. Thousands of lanterns and fresh flowers will garland the ground, to a backdrop of music, dancing and fireworks, all fuelled by the vegan and vegetarian food vendors. It’s a huge spectacle but presumably a doddle for a team headed by Green. In any case, he says jovially, “Nothing can go wrong with the Jade Buddha there.” • A festival celebrating the arrival of the Jade Buddha, Illumin8, takes place from 18-20 May at the Great Stupa of Universal Compassion in Bendigo"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/12/ethiopia-railway-boom-promises-turn-to-dust","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T21:09:00Z","webTitle":"In Ethiopia’s bushlands, promised riches of a railway boom turn to dust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/12/ethiopia-railway-boom-promises-turn-to-dust","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/12/ethiopia-railway-boom-promises-turn-to-dust","fields":{"headline":"In Ethiopia’s bushlands, promised riches of a railway boom turn to dust","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘They promised us we would get jobs there,” says Tadele, nodding at the grand, almost baroque edifice at the bottom of the hill. Adama’s new railway station, yellow bricks golden in the afternoon sun, is still a symbol of hope for the 43-year-old who lives in a village overlooking it. But its promise is dimmer than it was. A stint on the payroll of the Chinese firm that built Ethiopia’s new railway ended sourly. After six months he was fired, for reasons he disputes. Now, like many in his village and in small towns all along the railway from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to Djibouti, the tiny nation and synonymous Red Sea port that borders Ethiopia, he is frustrated, impatient – and unemployed. Ethiopia’s new £2.5bn, 750km (466-mile) line began commercial operations at the start of the year, making it Africa’s first fully electrified cross-border railway. Built and financed by Chinese investors and contractors, and shadowing the route of an earlier French-built track, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway lies at the heart of Ethiopia’s development aspirations. By linking the landlocked country to the sea and lowering transport costs for imports and exports, the government hopes to kickstart industrialisation and transform a poor, agricultural nation of nearly 100 million people into a middle-income one by as early as 2025. And it is much more than that. “The railway project is a transport project,” explains Dr Getachew Betru, former chief executive of the state-owned Ethiopia Railways Corporation (ERC). “But it is also a hinterland development project.” The plan is for eight railways to eventually crisscross this vast, diverse land, knitting together the relatively fertile highlands with the historically neglected lowlands that are mostly inhabited by nomadic people. New stations, some of which rise incongruously from seemingly empty expanses of barren bushland, are visualised as “transport-oriented development zones”: future temples of commerce boasting malls, hotels, and golf courses. The story of the railway is a parable of “developmentalism”, the east Asian-inspired model of top-down development championed by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which has ruled the country unchallenged for 27 years. This approach, with its flinty dedication to grand infrastructure projects such as dams, industrial parks, mass housing and railways, has delivered impressive economic growth in recent years. But it has also kindled political tensions, which, since exploding on to the streets in 2014, have threatened to topple one of the continent’s most authoritarian regimes. Since February, Ethiopia has been under a state of emergency, the second of its kind in as many years. That month the then-prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was forced to resign, leading to the appointment in late March of Abiy Ahmed, a young reformist who has lately echoed the demands of the protesters for greater democracy and an end to autocracy. The railway embodies these contradictions. “It’s the physical manifestation of the country’s politics,” says Biruk Terrefe, a graduate researcher at Oxford University who has studied the project. A journey along it eastwards from Addis Ababa takes in some of the most visible signs of Ethiopia’s recent development: new factories, irrigated sugar farms, shimmering rows of giant polytunnels with cut flowers bound for Europe and America. Electrical pylons hug the tracks all the way to the border with Djibouti while the road beside it is mostly smooth and well paved. In the shadow of some stations new towns are being built from scratch, as rural migrants arrive in the hope of work and urban speculators eagerly anticipate the coming boom. But what appears as development often looks very different to those who live near the tracks. The most deeply festering grievance is land, which in Ethiopia is all state-owned and – as one of the country’s few natural resources – a key faultline in the country’s politics. Around 300 hectares were required for each new station, according to Getachew, much of which was farmland, since the compensation costs of demolishing homes and businesses in city centres would have been too high. Most was in the region of Oromia, home to Ethiopia’s largest and lately most rebellious ethnic group, the Oromo, who have long complained of “land grabs” by other ethnicities. This put the ERC and its Chinese contractors on a collision course with farmers when construction started back in 2011. In the Oromo district of Mieso, an arid dust bowl 150km west of the major city of Dire Dawa, Yusuf Mohammed seethes as he hammers away at a small construction site. “People are really angry about the new railway. More than 300 people here lost their land, including my relatives, but they are not seeing benefits,” he says. He blames corrupt officials for unfair compensation. “People were intimidated, they were forced to give up their land almost for free.” His friend Jemal points to a vast, hulking station in the near distance. “All this area was mine,” he says. “They took three hectares but only paid me for one: 100,000 Birs (£2,700) – that’s almost worthless now!” A local official supports his allegation. “There were committees who estimated the value of the land for the farmers, and presented the price to the railway managers. I believe there was embezzlement by those committees and the managers,” he told the Observer under condition of anonymity. “One farmer’s land was estimated to be worth 250,000 Birs (£6,700) but in the end only 100,000 Birs was deposited in his bank account.” In March a parliamentary committee strongly criticised the ERC for compensation payments, with MPs reporting that thousands of “tearful” farmers had complained that they had not been treated fairly. The ERC responded that valuations were carried out by local administrations, not the corporation. Ibrahim, a 17-year-old who lives in Awash National Park, where a second railway line is currently being built by a Turkish firm, is more sanguine. “The railway benefited the people – even those who lost their land got compensation,” he says. But he adds that when construction began in early 2015 a band of furious locals tried to prevent it. “People were very angry,” he recalls. “They said: ‘Don’t do this; don’t do it on our land.’ There was a confrontation one night between the people and the contractors. People resisted, and 10 people died.” A spokesman for the ERC denied the incident took place; the local administration refused to comment. Communities along the line retain a special attachment to the old railway, opened by Ethiopia’s then-emperor, Menelik II, in 1901. Residents of Awash and Dire Dawa, in particular, look back on the previous rail era, which had drawn to a close by the end of the last century, with dewy-eyed nostalgia. Scepticism towards its 21st-century replacement is commonplace. “The new train is simply passing through,” says Teshome, a 40-year-old tradesman in Awash, pointing to the decaying courtyard of the station, which has not been replaced. “The old train had so much importance for the city. Passengers used our restaurants and hotels, all services. But this time such things won’t happen.” Biruk, the Oxford researcher, sees in this a fundamental problem for the government and the ERC. “Some locals perceive the railway as an Addis-based elite project,” he says. “A symbol of the regime.” The Chinese Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) said it hired more than 20,000 local workers in Ethiopia and 5,000 in Djibouti. But former employees complain of low wages and, like Tadele in Adama, of poor treatment by their Chinese managers. Since construction ended there have been few new jobs, in part because the rail services will be staffed by Chinese controllers, technicians and station masters for the next five years. “There is no development here yet,” says Mintesinot, a 36-year-old former soldier in Mojo, home to a new dry port – an inland point for goods transfer to a sea port. He brandishes a piece of paper, revealing he is registered as unemployed. “They told me I would get work at the dry port, in the customs office. That’s what they told us, but it hasn’t happened yet. It will never happen. Of course the railway is important for the country – but what is that importance if the youth here do not get jobs there?” There are some grounds for optimism. The new prime minister has been widely welcomed by young Ethiopians, especially in Oromia. A new land law, with higher compensation for expropriated farmers, is expected soon. Miriam Driessen, another Oxford researcher who has studied Sino-Ethiopian labour relations in the road construction sector, says that over time there has been “gradual improvement” in both wages and working conditions for Ethiopian employees. But the lesson of the railway is that development-from-above breeds special resentment when grand promises are perceived to have been broken. “I was hopeful that the railway would change my life,” says Samatra Ahmed, a 27-year-old son of a farmer in Dire Dawa. “I hoped I would be employed there – and then later start my own business. But after the government took the land, all the promises vanished.” This article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/11/jack-straw-give-evidence-role-libyan-rendition-abdel-hakim-belhaj-fatima-boudchar","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:22:33Z","webTitle":"Jack Straw faces call to give evidence over role in Libyan rendition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/jack-straw-give-evidence-role-libyan-rendition-abdel-hakim-belhaj-fatima-boudchar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/11/jack-straw-give-evidence-role-libyan-rendition-abdel-hakim-belhaj-fatima-boudchar","fields":{"headline":"Jack Straw faces call to give evidence over role in Libyan rendition","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs have called for former foreign secretary Jack Straw to give evidence before parliament about his role in the kidnap and mistreatment of two Libyan families. The demands come after the government apologised for its role in the abduction and mistreatment of Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar, who were flown from Bangkok to Tripoli in 2004 in a rendition operation involving MI6, the CIA and Muammar Gaddafi’s intelligence services. After the apology was made on Thursday in a letter from Theresa May and a statement to MPs by Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, Straw conceded publicly for the first time that he had authorised some of MI6’s actions. The year after he gave this authorisation, he told MPs that allegations of UK involvement in rendition were conspiracy theories. During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of Belhaj and Boudchar, and a second Libyan opposition figure Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. At this point Straw gave an interview in which he implied that MI6 had not informed him of its involvement. Straw has said that he is prepared to give evidence to the intelligence and security committee, the panel of MPs and peers that provides oversight of the UK’s intelligence agencies. That would be done behind closed doors, however, and some MPs believe Straw needs to be given a chance to give evidence to a parliamentary committee that sits in public. One shadow minister said: “Now this has been exposed and the government’s role admitted, there has to be an explanation from the individuals then involved – former and serving civil servants and politicians – about what they knew and when about rendition and torture. “I want to know how complicit the government was, who they were talking to and the details of their relationship with the intelligence services. We need to know how was it allowed to continue and the efforts that were subsequently made to cover it up. “Obviously, as the foreign secretary Jack Straw has many questions to answer. He must now explain what he knew, when he knew it and why his story appears to have changed.” Another shadow minister said: “Rendition has been used to outsource torture and any future Labour government should not be tainted by the actions of former Labour ministers. Straw should come forward and explain himself and get this out in the open.” A veteran Labour MP added: “Any minister who was involved in such an obvious breach of human rights should explain themselves.” Following a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that the main suspect – known to be Sir Mark Allen, then head of counter-terrorism at MI6 – had sought political authority for some but not all of his actions. Friends of Straw say that the authorisation that he gave was subsequently “twisted and expanded” by MI6. Human rights groups say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government. Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, called for an independent judicial inquiry into the Libyan renditions and other human rights abuses in the years after 9/11. “Even now, despite the perseverance and bravery of Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar in seeking an apology, we still don’t know the full facts in this deeply troubling affair,” she said. “We’ve still never had the judicial inquiry into the UK’s role in torture carried out by its partners – including the CIA’s extensive programme of rendition and illegal detention – that we were promised under David Cameron’s government. We still need to know the truth.” Jack Straw – the twists and turns 13 December 2005 To the Commons foreign affairs committee, after the Guardian had reported that CIA rendition aircraft had been refuelling at UK airports: Unless we start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States, and also let me say, we believe that Secretary Rice is lying, there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition full stop, because we have not been, and so what on earth a judicial inquiry would start to do I have no idea 5 September 2011 In an interview with the BBC, shortly after documents that detailed MI6’s involvement in the kidnap and rendition of two families emerged during the Libyan revolution: No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time 10 May 2018 In a statement issued by his lawyers, Kingsley Napley, after Prime Minister Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar that she was “profoundly sorry” for the role that MI6 and the British government played in their kidnap, rendition and torture. Although Straw described the authorisation he gave as being sought on 1 March 2004 with “great urgency”, and the couple were kidnapped by the CIA the following day, Sami al-Saadi and his wife and four young children were not kidnapped until 27 March 2004. After a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that Sir Mark Allen of MI6 had “sought political authority” for some, but not all, of his subsequent actions: On 1 March 2004 my approval was sought for some information to be shared with international partners. In almost every case such approvals were made by me in writing, on the basis of written submissions to me. However in rare cases of great urgency, oral submissions could be made and oral approvals given by me.

About 1 million customers on the firm’s standard variable tariff will be hit by a 5.3%, or £64, increase per year from 17 June, taking a typical annual dual-fuel bill to £1,230. The increase is on par with those announced by British Gas and ScottishPower, but Npower’s standard tariff was already the most expensive by a big supplier. The German-owned firm said it had not taken the decision lightly, and blamed rising wholesale prices and growing costs from government policies. Simon Stacey, the Npower managing director for domestic markets, said such costs had “unfortunately been on the rise for some time and we need to reflect these in our prices”. But the move, just months before the government’s price cap on such tariffs is expected to take effect, sparked an angry response. Claire Perry, the energy minister, said the rise was extremely disappointing, unjustified and demonstrated why the government was capping prices. She urged customers to ditch Npower: “Consumers should vote with their feet. Switching suppliers will always help consumers get the best deal.” Gillian Guy, the chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “At a time when many energy customers are struggling with their bills, this price rise will be hard to stomach for the approximately 1 million customers affected.” Comparison site Energyhelpline argued that “no one should pay such high prices for their energy”. It added that households could save hundreds of pounds by switching to smaller suppliers, pointing out that the 10 cheapest deals on the market ranged from £796 to £829, compared to Npower’s £1,230. Stephen Murray, energy expert at switching site MoneySuperMarket, said: “This is a chunky rise from Npower – all we need now is something from SSE and it’s a full house from the big six.” Npower is merging with SSE’s energy supply unit, but the deal is facing a full-scale investigation by the competition watchdog, which said that the merger could increase household energy bills. SSE is the only one of the big six energy firms not to have announced a price increase. Four of the others have increased their standard tariff, while E.ON increased bills by as much as £50 by removing discounts. One small supplier said this week that it expects wholesale prices to continue rising this summer, raising the spectre of more rises before the government price cap takes effect next winter. Challenger firm Bulb said that wholesale costs had already increased 13% since it put up prices 2.8% in February. It said that if wholesale energy prices remain high, bills may have to rise in August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/14/dipton-opencast-mine-protesters-dig-in-ahead-of-deadline-co-durham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T10:14:26Z","webTitle":"Dipton opencast mine protesters dig in ahead of deadline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/14/dipton-opencast-mine-protesters-dig-in-ahead-of-deadline-co-durham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/14/dipton-opencast-mine-protesters-dig-in-ahead-of-deadline-co-durham","fields":{"headline":"Dipton opencast mine protesters dig in ahead of deadline","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Four months after the UK government announced it was phasing out coal, campaigners are digging in to stop what they say will be the devastation of opencast mining at a beauty spot in the north-east of England. Local people and environmentalists have 16 working days left to stop the first spade going into the ground on 71 hectares of grassland, fields and woods in the Pont valley, Co Durham. Under planning permission, the mining company Banks Group has to start work by 3 June or their licence to start mining the site will expire. Campaigners say the “hit-and-run” nature of opencast mining, and the UK government’s commitment to phasing out coal, makes any new mine an anachronism. Protesters are planning a series of public demonstrations in the days leading up to the deadline. Liam Carr, who lives in the area, said: “Coal-mining is our heritage not our future. My granddad was a coal miner. We have been through all this before, we know the damage it does to the environment, and coal is the fuel of past not the future.” The site in the Pont valley off the A692 between the villages of Leadgate and Dipton, is not far from Druridge Bay in Northumberland, where the same company’s attempts to extract 3m tonnes of coal, sandstone and fireclay, was rejected by the then communities secretary Sajid Javid in March because of its potential environmental damage and the “very substantial” impact on climate change. Banks Group is appealing Javid’s decision. More than 86,000 people have signed a petition calling on Javid to revoke permission for the Pont valley mine. Javid’s successor, James Brokenshire, is now examining representations to repeal the planning permission for the Pont valley mining. A spokesperson for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: “We will make a decision in due course.” Banks Group plans to extract around 500,000 tonnes of coal in two to three years from the site and says 30 new jobs will be created. They say after mining is completed, restoration will involve a new nature reserve and parkland. Lewis Stokes, community relations manger for Banks, said: “The simple fact remains that, while the UK transitions to a low-carbon economy, we still need coal. “Government projections state that coal will continue to be an important part of the UK’s energy mix until at least 2025, while the low sulphur, high-quality coal contained within the Bradley site is vital for industrial processes such as the manufacturing of cement and steel.” He condemned what he called the “illegal activity” of those protesting at the site. “We do not believe their viewpoint reflects that of the wider local community,” he said. Campaigners say they are driven to protect the habitats already established on the site which support red kites, great crested newts, badgers, bats and barn owls, according to evidence given to the public inquiries. It is their presence that has spurred protesters on for 40 years - ever since the then National Coalboard submitted the first application to opencast mine the area. Three public inquiries later, those camped out in the Pont valley believe that as the country moves to a low-carbon economy, there is even less reason now to opencast mine than ever before. June Davison, who lives in Dipton, said: “My community has been fighting the threat of opencast coal extraction for over 30 years. In that time we’ve won three public inquiries and three inspectors have agreed that protecting the Pont valley is important. “The government have revised their energy policy and plan to phase out coal-fired power stations by 2025.

Exploiting the area would also be an “irresponsible business decision”, the group argues, as global action on climate change will reduce oil demand and mean such projects have a high risk of losing money. An accompanying letter from the indigenous Gwich’in people say it would be “deeply unethical” to destroy their homelands. The 19m-acre refuge is one of wildest places left on Earth and the largest area of publicly owned land in the US. It is home to a huge range of animals, including polar bears, snowy owls and the porcupine caribou on which the Gwich’in rely for food. In April, the Trump administration began the process of opening the ANWR for oil and gas drilling, the first such move since 1980. Significant oil and gas reserves are thought to lie under the ANWR coastal plain and Prudhoe Bay, a major oil centre, lies close to the refuge’s western boundary. The Gwich’in name for the coastal plain is “Sacred place where life begins”, as it is the breeding ground of the caribou. “Drilling in the ANWR is an exceedingly high-risk gamble that companies and investors should avoid,” said New York state comptroller, Thomas P DiNapoli, trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, one of the investors that signed the letter. “A global low-carbon economy is emerging, driven by the growing opportunities for cleaner energy. We want the companies [we invest in] to help build that future, not destroy one of America’s last truly wild places.” “There is no longer any doubt that climate change poses an acute risk not only to our collective way of life, but also to investments made in outdated and highly precarious forms of energy,” said Thibaud Clisson at BNP Paribas Asset Management, another signatory. Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in steering committee, said: “We call on oil companies and the banks that fund them to stand with the Gwich’in and leave this pristine and fragile place intact. The survival of my people depends on it.” However, Alaska’s congressional representatives, who are all Republican, strongly support the drilling plan, suggesting it could bring in $1bn to state and federal governments in the next decade. When the plan to open the ANWR for oil and gas exploitation was announced, senator Lisa Murkowski said it was “the single-most important step we can take to strengthen our long-term energy security and create new wealth”. Murkowski, also chairman of the Senate committee on energy and natural resources, said: “Responsible development is limited to just 2,000 federal acres – just one ten-thousandth of all of ANWR.” But the letter from the Gwich’in steering committee says: “This place was originally set aside by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 as a refuge, not for development. Roads, pipelines, gravel mines, airstrips and other facilities that would be developed to support exploration and development on the coastal plain would undermine the wilderness character of the Refuge, fragment habitat and displace wildlife. And oil spills, which already occur on the North Slope, would harm fish and wildlife.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/11/should-you-ask-your-babys-consent-before-changing-their-nappy-no-that-would-be-gaslighting","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:38:25Z","webTitle":"Should you ask your baby’s consent before changing their nappy?

No, that would be gaslighting","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Deanne Carson is a sexuality expert – which sounds like a title you would only ever apply to yourself – and she has pink hair, but that’s not the controversy. She’s in the news because this week she told ABC News in Australia that, in order to establish a “culture of consent” in a household, you should ask your baby for permission before you change its nappy. The language doesn’t have to be complicated: “I’m going to change your nappy now, is that OK?” will do fine. This, said Twitter and assorted moral-majority response units, is truly the endpoint of political correctness gone mad – the giddy limit of liberal bullshit, an abnegation of parental authority amounting to neglect. I disagree with Carson, too, but not for those reasons. Babies are good at signalling their lack of consent; the only problem is that you never know to what they’re not consenting. It might be the violation of their personal autonomy or it might be the dappled shading of some leaves that reminds them of the lost comfort of the dark womb. But even if you knew to what they weren’t consenting, you would ignore them anyway, so what you’re establishing is not a culture of consent, but a culture of the language of consent, masking a culture of complete dominance. You are gaslighting your baby, in other words. It’s a classic of authoritarian deceit, immortalised in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go: to impart information before its recipient is old enough to understand it, thereby heading off the questions they would ask once they were old enough. In the novel’s case, it’s that they have been bred as an underclass to have their organs harvested, whereas Carson’s idea is about the principles of physical intercourse, but the underpinning manoeuvre is the same: manipulating someone’s ignorance in order to control them and their worldview. It’s actually a bit sinister, but then so much absolutism is. Maternal love is inherently dicey and knows no consent. It starts with 18 months cuddling someone full-time when you know they can’t say “no” and it takes another couple of decades before you can process the idea that they are not still a part of your body. The least you can do, and also the most liberal thing, is admit it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/27/metoo-sexual-assault-claims-accused-men-plot-redemption-charlie-rose-mario-batali","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T13:48:09Z","webTitle":"How famous men toppled by #MeToo plot their comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/metoo-sexual-assault-claims-accused-men-plot-redemption-charlie-rose-mario-batali","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/27/metoo-sexual-assault-claims-accused-men-plot-redemption-charlie-rose-mario-batali","fields":{"headline":"How famous men toppled by #MeToo plot their comeback","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"America’s entertainment industry has been left reeling from the #MeToo movement. But that hasn’t stopped many of the high-profile men it has toppled from planning their comebacks. Talkshow host Charlie Rose was fired by CBS and PBS in November after he was accused of groping colleagues and walking around naked in front of them, allegations he denies. Last month, Page Six reported that Tina Brown was approached to produce a new atonement TV series in which Rose interviews other accused men like him. Celebrity chef Mario Batali took a leave of absence after he was accused by multiple women of inappropriate and abusive behaviour. After apologising, he has been “eyeing a second act”, according to the New York Times. Friends and associates say he is “pondering timelines” as to how he might step back into his career just months after it imploded, including by “creating a new company led by a powerful woman chief executive”. Former Today Show co-host Matt Lauer, comedian Louis CK, and former public radio host Garrison Keillor are also all reported to be looking for redemption. Keillor’s attorney told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: “The mission is to get his train back on track.” For the accused, there are people who can help them to rehabilitate their reputations – for a price. There are more than 230,000 public relations professionals in the United States, according to government figures, and business is booming for those who specialize in crisis management. “I’ve gotten more calls in the last month than I did in all of last year,” one PR guru told an industry publication in November, as the #MeToo allegations against former movie producer Harvey Weinstein and other high-profile men emerged last year. When famous people get in trouble, their first call is often to a spin doctor. These experts can advise them on how best to respond, work to protect their image and, eventually, help them plot a course towards recovery. “I don’t think we’ve ever had anything quite like this,” said Andrew Blum, the founder of AJB Communications, a PR firm specialising in crisis management. “Yes, women will have a say about whether these men will come back and what they can do, there’s no question,” Blum said. “But eventually some of these men may have something to add to society, and maybe PR has to help them.” However, the likelihood of rehabilitating a reputation depends on the severity of the alleged offence, and whether there is a pattern to accusations. “In some cases, the advice would be: ‘you need a reality check’ – there’s not going to be a comeback,” said Evan Nierman, founder of crisis PR firm Red Banyan, adding that he would advise some prospective clients to just go and enjoy their wealth on a beach somewhere. “I don’t think there’s going to be a comeback for Harvey Weinstein,” he added. In New York on Friday, Weinstein was charged with rape, a criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for alleged incidents involving two separate women. His lawyer said he would plead not guilty. Comedian Bill Cosby, who was convicted of sexual assault last month, turns 81 in July and is facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. But there are many other disgraced men whose behavior falls somewhere in the vast gray area between unacceptable and criminal. Their fates won’t be decided by a court of law, but in the court of public opinion. One of Weinstein’s lawyers says she believes that forum is in many ways the tougher one. Blair Berk, a Los Angeles-based “super lawyer” who is currently representing Weinstein, says it can be especially difficult in an environment where accusations get blasted out on social media before almost any objective investigation, and where declarations of innocence only make things worse. “Due process isn’t terribly popular at the moment,” she said. Berk would know. She represented Johnny Depp, helping him to settle divorce proceedings and an alleged domestic violence case with his former wife, Amber Heard, in 2016, before the #MeToo movement began. Berk also advised Mel Gibson, who became persona non grata in Hollywood after a sexist and antisemitic tirade in 2006, but represents arguably the best-case scenario for disgraced stars to aspire to, according to industry insiders. Ten years after the initial incident, he gave remorseful interviews, directed a successful film, Hacksaw Ridge, and was allowed back into elite Hollywood circles, even getting nominated for an Oscar. “What you’re looking for is some period of redemption to get your act together,” said Patty Glaser, another of Weinstein’s star attorneys. “The old saying is that time heals all wounds, but a good apology and some genuine behavior change can heal it a lot faster,” said Adam Dooley, a Canadian PR agency owner who has written on the topic. The accused have to show real contrition and take responsibility for bad behaviour before they can even think about re-entry into the public’s good graces, Dooley added. However, while he’s back to making movies, Gibson has never reclaimed the superstar status of his previous life, nor has he been able to shake the memory of his downfall from public consciousness. Gibson’s sin is also very different from the accusations faced by Weinstein and others. And in the era of #MeToo, the comeback playbooks are being rewritten. “People are out there throwing out PR trial balloons and these PR trial balloons don’t seem to be working,” Blum said. That seems especially true for Rose’s reported plan to attempt to use his platform to rehabilitate himself, and other accused men, en masse. “I thought it was the dumbest PR idea I’ve ever seen,” said Blum. Critics, including the feminist writer Jill Filipovic, think these men have no business plotting comebacks at all. “Instead of strategizing their returns, these famous men should think about what it truly means to make amends,” Filipovic, a Guardian contributor, wrote recently in Time. “If someone has paid penance for their wrongdoing, they do not deserve to have their lives ruined forever. But losing one’s celebrity is not ruination, nor is it penitence. By suggesting that it is, too many of the men of #MeToo show that they haven’t changed much at all.” This article was amended on 26 July 2018 to clarify that Tina Brown was pitched a show that would star Charlie Rose, and that Rose himself was not the person pitching the show."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/tottenham-leicester-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:43:06Z","webTitle":"Tottenham v Leicester: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/tottenham-leicester-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/tottenham-leicester-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham v Leicester: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leicester’s 3-1 win over Arsenal on Wednesday was welcome, not least for Claude Puel but the mutterings continue that the manager is set to be replaced.

Its window grabbed my attention whenever I was out shopping with my parents. I was a bookish boy and it must have been easy for aunts and uncles to work out what to buy for my birthday. Was there anything more empowering that you could give an eight-year-old in the late 1960s than a 10 shilling book token? And back then, there was only one place in town to spend it. The bookshop was just referred to as Wings, but it was more enticing to me than that odd store at the top of our road that sold office supplies, sweets, paraffin, fishing tackle and Airfix models. I’m not sure if the proprietor of the bookshop was actually called Mr Wing, but his image has stayed with me. He was an old man, tall with a slight stoop, thinning grey hair, wire-rimmed glasses and a pale suit. In a town where almost everyone’s dad did “dirty hands work”, he had a professorial air. And his shelves were full of wonder. With a cover price of half a crown, a 10 shilling token would buy four Ladybird books. My choices were mostly from the Adventure from History series. King Alfred the Great was a favourite: lots of helmets with horns on and battles with Vikings. Cleopatra and Ancient Egypt was beautifully illustrated and chimed with the Tutankhamun exhibition my father had taken me to see at the British Museum. And Captain Scott might well explain why I’m wearing a knitted balaclava in so many photographs from this period. Despite being a heavily industrialised east London suburb, Barking had its own adventures from history, some of which echoed the stories in my Ladybird books. The Anglo-Saxons founded an abbey on the banks of the river Roding cAD666, which was raided by Vikings and burned to the ground during the time of Alfred the Great. When the Barking bypass was built in 1928, the council named the stretch that crossed the Roding Alfred’s Way, presumably as a warning to any Viking raiders who might be contemplating a return trip. When my reading moved on to books without pictures, Alan Garner’s The Moon of Gomrath left a big impression on me, with its description of a mystical landscape existing alongside the ordinary on Alderley Edge. I recalled my father telling me that, as a child, he had seen fairy rings a few streets from our house, at the bottom of Victoria Road, on a site now buried under the concrete superstructure of a railway intersection. Of course there never were fairies down by the railway. As my father explained, what the locals called “fairy rings” were actually the faint marks of postholes that once held the wooden supports of a Celtic roundhouse. The gentle curve of Victoria Road followed the outline of the earthen ramparts of Uphall Camp, an iron age settlement that, in pre-Roman times, sat on a gravel bank that rose out of the marshland along the Roding. Around the age of 11, I started a paper round that included Victoria Road, all the way down to the railway. On dark winter mornings, when fog drifted up from the river, I hurried past every alleyway on the rampart side of the road, steeling myself not to look down each ill-lit recess, for fear of seeing some hideous Garneresque goblin staring back at me. I was a child with an overactive imagination, one that had been fed by Mr Wing and his Wonderful Bookshop.

It probably would not have changed the outcome. The referendum, as the pollsters remind us, was a cultural phenomenon linked more closely to people’s attitudes to immigration and sovereignty than to economic success – a situation that persists today. Still, it would be satisfying to rewind and show that the reason many now believe Britain must stay connected to the EU for five years or so relates to complex customs rules and how they cannot be reconciled with open borders. Parliament only took notice when MPs on the Brexit select committee damned the government’s dithering. The committee’s message was that keeping the Irish border open and at the same time installing border controls with the EU couldn’t work. Ever since their report last December, the border contradiction has travelled through Whitehall like a virus, forcing civil servants to drop what they are doing in a desperate bid to find a cure. As one senior civil servant put it, officials are too busy finding a way to put the right export stamp on a sheep’s backside to think about anything else. So far, no cure has been found and the situation is looking desperate. Foreign companies have virtually switched off the stream of investment into the UK. By the end of last year, OECD figures show foreign direct investment down by half on the average seen from 2012 to 2015 and by 90% on the bumper inflow of funds seen in 2016. That Britain has fallen off the investment agenda of most major businesses is a sad and irrefutable fact. It’s true some domestic businesses have found extra cash for investment: after all, Britain is a nation of almost 65 million people with 32 million of them in employment. It’s a big market. But the economic data remains weak and most of the spending is simply to keep abreast of digital developments. In other words, IT investments are being made just to stay in the game. Productivity has risen a little, but mainly as a result of a fall in hours worked to achieve the same outputs, rather than an increase in output from the same number of hours worked. The result has been a dramatic fall in GDP growth in the first three months of 2018. The economy could only manage a growth rate of 0.1% in the first three months of the year, and, worse than that, the measure of GDP per head saw a 0.1% decline. Even the most confident Brexiters have noticed the economy flagging under the weight of the customs union uncertainty. It’s such a quandary that last week Tory MPs were openly considering adding another three years to the transition deal just to give the brightest minds in the civil service enough time to sort it out. That would take the UK’s membership of the customs union to 2023. They recognise that any attempt to stay inside an economic zone with the EU – whether that be the “Norway option”, under the banner of the European Economic Area, or the “Swiss option”, which involves negotiating upwards of 100 separate trade agreements – comes with a demand for free movement of labour. That, as we know, is an unacceptable outcome for Leave voters. These Tory MPs support Theresa May’s attempts to cobble together a technological solution and recognise that, from a standing start, it may take until 2023 to finish the job. However, that amounts to five more years of uncertainty and five more years of being a rule-taker from Brussels without the ability to strike fresh trade deals. Some Leave agitators like the MEP Daniel Hannan can live with staying inside the EEA, but not the customs union. Like Boris Johnson, Hannan believes that “giving Brussels 100% control of our trade policy with 0% input would plainly leave us poorer and weaker than now”. The EEA allows members some influence on how the market operates. But Johnson and Hannan are not anti-immigration. They would allow free movement of labour as the price of economic security, though they both seek the have-cake-and-eat-it option of signing separate trade deals. This places them at odds with Tories facing Ukip-sympathising constituents, who put immigration at the top of their list of concerns. Most importantly, it puts them at odds with Jacob Rees-Mogg. With the government’s supporters split several ways, it is difficult to see how an agreement can be struck that takes us past 2020. One faction or the other would need to retreat from their central demands. For this reason, most large businesses have prepared for an immediate exit from the EU next year and the single market and customs union in 2020. It’s a sensible plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/17/four-year-old-white-supremacist-racism-discrimination","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"What do you say to a four-year-old white supremacist?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/four-year-old-white-supremacist-racism-discrimination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/17/four-year-old-white-supremacist-racism-discrimination","fields":{"headline":"What do you say to a four-year-old white supremacist?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I try to be sympathetic, although not accommodating, to the fact that entire generations of Americans were explicitly taught white skin is superior. But it’s difficult to be sympathetic when those beliefs are expressed by a four-year-old. It was Friday night, 22 February 2015. My friend Nuha (a Sudanese American) and I (an Egyptian American) walked into a restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi. Both of us are different shades of non-white. The scene could have taken place anywhere in America. The waitress seated us at the corner of the hibachi table, next to a white man who appeared to be in his mid-30s and his two young sons. As I reached to pull my chair away from the table, the youngest boy, the one sitting adjacent to my seat, looked at me and said: “White skin don’t marry brown skin, but it’s OK, you can sit here anyway.” I stood frozen, hand still on the chair. I looked at Nuha. “Did we just return to the 1960s?” Nuha echoed: “I think we did.” The father, too, sat frozen: fork mid-air, eyes bulging. No one else was at the table other than the five of us. We didn’t know what to do. No one teaches you this type of dinner table conversation when they teach you to pass the salt with the pepper. We stood agape, until we processed that we hadn’t hallucinated those words. Then, we did what we came to do: we sat down. ••• Just 12 days earlier, 12 miles away from where my own sister lived at that time, I had received a late night phone call. Three Muslim Americans had been murdered inside their own apartment. Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha: they were my friend’s brother, his bride of less than six weeks and the bride’s sister. Later we would find out they were murdered execution-style, through the head. They additionally had multiple bullets inside their bodies. Their murderer hated religion, and the women visibly wore their religion through their headscarves. Chapel Hill could have been anywhere in America. Out of despair, like so many fellow Muslims during that period, I wanted to retreat from human interaction for a long while. Thinking too much about the capacity of the human potential to do evil can depress anyone. Still, not wanting to give in to the power of hate-inspired ideology a group of us in Mississippi co-organized an interfaith peace vigil for the three murdered. It was on the eve of this vigil that the four-year-old boy uttered those words to me. I asked the child how old he was, and the little boy raised four fingers to illustrate. The boy looked up at his hand with pride; he had lifted the right number of fingers. Nuha asked the boy: “Who taught you that brown skin and white skin don’t marry?” The little boy looked confused, as though we had asked an unnecessary question. He then timidly looked to his right and slowly lifted his finger, pointing at his father. “You did, Dad!” He stuttered. “N-no, no I didn’t. I never taught you that. Maybe it was your mom, but I didn’t teach you that.” And so it was: instead of addressing his son’s uncensored racist commentary, the best this father could do in the moment was pass the blame on to his wife. We then asked the kid: “What’s wrong with brown skin?” Half talking to us, half talking to his son, the father stared down at his child and emphatically interjected: “There’s nothing wrong with brown skin. Absolutely nothing wrong with brown skin.” As he talked, the father never glanced up to look at us. In fact, the father finished his entire dinner and never once did his eyes look into ours. I still wonder on the nuanced conversations that must have happened with this boy, for him to (attempt to) differentiate between brown and black skin. I wonder what he would have said if we had told him both our families are from Africa. Nuha and I continued to dialogue with the boy, telling him that black, brown and white are simply “outside colors”. We both felt uncomfortable lecturing someone else’s child, especially when the father was sitting at the same table. But you cannot not speak up when someone who’s only been in this world for four years thinks he’s more valuable than you. And so we talked. We had an hour-long conversation with a four-year-old boy, while his dad sat in silence. Whatever we attempted to accomplish in that hour was merely mitigation and exposure on our part. At the end of the night, we were aware that the boys would return to a home that believed they innately deserved different things from our families. For a few days, I was angry. That night reminded me that legislation, workplace policies and institutional diversity and inclusion offices may force incremental social justice advancement, but they can’t force change of hearts and maybe not even change of minds. The belief that one group of people is superior to another – the literal meaning of white supremacy – doesn’t actually disappear. That night reminded me that the most powerful and regenerating sources of hate are the ones that people of color cannot touch, let alone fight. They’re in the conversations that you’ll never hear, because the people who have them are smart enough to not discuss them in public, or at least not fully. The Monday after that conversation, I went to work and analyzed, wrote and submitted four scientific abstracts linking race to adverse health outcomes in Mississippi. As an epidemiologist, I thought that was the most powerful thing I could do, through the power of my vocation, to speak to that Friday night. That was my translation of anger. All four of the abstracts were accepted to our country’s largest national public health conference. There, I talked to dozens of academics and practitioners about the mechanisms by which race and racism manifest themselves in health outcomes. I never mentioned that four-year old boy to anyone at that conference, even though he was the person who put me in that room. Actually, he was more important than the data. While anger took me to the conference, I left it feeling hopeless. I had realized that data could take us only so far. I could write 100 research papers linking racism to poor health and short lifespans, and I would still not be speaking to the power of that family and their social circle. Boys like the one I had met don’t roam in public health conferences. I don’t have unfiltered access into their living rooms. In fact, I don’t even know which living rooms in which they grow. This fight was not my fight. ••• There are no certain prescriptions or blueprints for how white allies should operate in the movement to protect the dignity of minority groups. But for starters, as part of the social contract in which we live, you have an obligation to at least participate. You can legislate society toward justice and make great systemic change in the distribution of resources, but you cant legislate hearts, minds and opinions. That work lives on the ground, in the streets and in homes, among everyday white Americans. The issue is not so much whether that four-year-old boy would be interested in marrying my future children of color. The issue is that the same four-year-old boy who does not think brown or black skin is marriageable will likely hold other oppressive prejudices against my children that will make their lives unjustly difficult. So, yes, affirmative action has propelled society forward, but affirmative action is not what will close the book on racial discrimination. Sacrifice the comfort of your silence to speak up in the moments where we are absent. Sacrifice your comfort, even when we are present, but still not presented. The work that will fundamentally change America’s race relations is the work that white people must commit themselves to doing among themselves. It’s not work that Nuha and I can do. Remember, I tried. It wasn’t the right living room, and I’ll never be the right person. The four and eight-year-old boys who sat with us at the hibachi table, three years ago, are now seven and 11 years old. I wonder what else they’ve learned in these three years. If you’re white, you likely know more than me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/how-to-grow-tough-plants-for-tough-spots","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"How to grow tough plants for tough spots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/how-to-grow-tough-plants-for-tough-spots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/02/how-to-grow-tough-plants-for-tough-spots","fields":{"headline":"How to grow tough plants for tough spots","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I told you so”: these plants fall into this category (bear with me). They are not restrained, they are more than rambunctious, and they are capable of being troublesome if you leave them to dictate their own party. However, they will thrive in those areas in which more gentle sorts will wither away. They are useful: they like to spread, blanketing the soil and covering up tricky spots, taking on any weeds in their wake, and even feeding neighbouring plants. But at some point, you will have to take them on, so for that future point, I did tell you so. Shady spots are limiting because of the obvious lack of sun, but plants also have to compete with the roots of trees and large shrubs. They need to be happy with the thin layer of top soil or beastly enough to muscle with the other roots. Two comfreys are able to do that: Symphytum Iberian, Iberian comfrey and S. tuberosum, tuberous comfrey. The former is a little smaller, growing up to 30cm high, and makes an impenetrable weed cover among shrubs and trees. The flowers start off burnt orange in bud and open to creamy yellow buds, though some open to pale blue and even pink. S. tuberosum has pale yellow flowers and grows taller, up to 60cm high. Both are considered mineral accumulators, feeding the plants around them with goodness mined from deep below. Shear back the leaves after flowers to encourage neat, young foliage. Another shade-tolerant type is Geranium nodosum, though it will happily tolerate full sun, too. Whatever you give its feet to wander in, it will flower all summer with lovely lilac-blue flowers sitting just above the smooth, mid-green maple-shaped leaves. It will self-seed as much as it will spread, but it’s such a pretty thing, it’s hard to mind. Persicaria amplexicaulis and its many cultivars will tolerate a wide range of soils in sun or light shade, and look wonderful with grasses. The slim, tall, dark spikes of red, or various hues of pink flowers, bloom all summer long until the frost puts a stop to them. I like ‘Rosea’, one of the gentler pink cultivars that can weave a garden together. If you are on very damp soil, try the red bistort, P. bistorta ‘Hohe Tatra’ with fat spires of pink, orchid-like flowers. Finally, for those dry, barren soils that nothing else will touch, try Euphorbia cyparissias, the Cypress spurge. It rapidly forms dense carpets of cheerful, sulphur yellow umbels in spring above blue-grey mounds of foliage and then dies off in autumn in a blaze of orange. It will also tolerate some shade; the cultivar ‘Fens Ruby’ looks particularly good next to dusky hellebores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/12/grief-dad-father-death-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Grief will let go eventually.

And then I’ll remember my dad as he was","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Grief is like wandering through a minefield, as my mother puts it: however carefully you tread, a sudden detonation can happen out of nowhere. A song played in a supermarket; an overheard phrase; someone in the distance who your mind cruelly suggests is your loved one for a fleeting moment. Grief can be a powerfully malevolent force, too, a rat gnawing at your emotional wellbeing. I reflected on that after seeing Nightfall, a new play about a family on a declining Hampshire farm both united and divided by the grief of losing their father. The grief gnaws at them all, but they don’t have the emotional tools to deal with it. But do any of us? Our culture poorly equips us to deal with grief, a combination of death being treated as a macabre taboo subject and a particularly English awkwardness with raw emotions. It’s also – and let’s be honest about it – that the expression of emotion is portrayed as weakness in a patriarchal society. The bereaved are often treated badly. There is no statutory paid bereavement leave, with the emotionally stunned often compelled to work within days of losing a loved one. A third of those who have suffered bereavement report being treated with no compassion by their employers. At the very least, surely, we need to learn to talk more about grief if we are to build a society that treats the bereaved better. I lost my father in January to advanced prostate cancer; he was the third close family member to die in six months. Grief has been difficult to avoid. And four months on, it has remained hard to escape that final week: a sudden deterioration at home, wheeling him into a taxi to the hospice for the last time, the long nights of increasingly rattling breaths, wondering when the moment would come – and then that long pause before the last gasp, the instinctive, wide-eyed panic etched on everyone’s face in a moment when time froze. A few days earlier, I was helping to lower him into a bed as he called himself “a stable genius” in mockery of the latest Donald Trump tweet; as an infusion of oxygen made him stronger, he spoke at length about George Washington (he loved American history), then four days later, he was gone. His family holding his still warm hands and telling him that they loved him in a compassionate Marie Curie hospice while Bob Dylan played: one of the best ways to die, perhaps. But I still feel trapped in that last week. The memory of his sharp decline has supplanted the man I knew and want to remember: looking sheepish as I walked into the living room while he danced to the Band’s rendition of Forever Young, and saying it was “groovy” in that way only dads can; the gruff way he, as an obsessive creature of habit, would answer the phone if he was interrupted eating his dinner or watching the news; the way his eyes would well up when he spoke about subjects he was passionate about, like an important speech in the American civil war, or how Labour and the Tories would once compete over who could build the most council housing. That whole period, the no-man’s land between life and death, of watching a parent who in your childhood appeared as an immortal deity becoming as dependent as a newborn child, of asking for a “yoggie breakfast” before slipping away – that does disappear in time, I’m told, in favour of memories of who they once were. That’s why the Jewish approach to mourning and grief seems so attractive in helping to fend off the memory of those last days. A seven-day shiva, a period of mourning when those grieving open their doors to friends and visitors, where they pray, eat and remember; then, a year later, another ceremony to place the tombstone and recite eulogies. Having some form of structure to process and manage grief collectively surely helps: as someone put it to me, grief is like a landscape without a map. Another suggested that grief makes you a stranger to yourself. Our culture doesn’t give us the vocabulary to talk to the grieving – we often admit, “I don’t know what to say” – while how well we are judged to be dealing with grief is based on how little emotion we express. It’s difficult, too, not to be angry at the continuing taboo of death. My father did not want to die, he wasn’t reconciled to it: until he was diagnosed with cancer, he hadn’t been hospitalised since he was a teenager with tonsillitis. He didn’t have to contemplate death until it was imminent, because our culture discourages us from doing so. It’s not for me to dictate how anyone deals with their own death – nothing can be more personal – but I saw what a nonsense that whole narrative of cancer as a battle is, with the implication that you either win or lose on your own steam. As the DJ Danny Baker put it after his own diagnosis, “I’m just the battlefield, science is doing the fighting and of course the wonderful docs and nurses of the brilliant NHS.” My dad was just the bewildered victim of a malign invisible force that beat him up and then killed him. His own attitude – warm, upbeat, relentlessly positive as it so happened, not that he wasn’t entitled to be miserable and angry if he chose to be – had no bearing on his fate. I have no idea if, or how, our culture will ever come to terms with death. But one of the strange things about growing older is how twee cliches begin to make sense: the notion of the dead living on in those left behind used to make me particularly cringe, but it’s true, we are, in part, the collective products of those we love. My dad saw himself as part of a historic struggle for human liberation: he met my mum canvassing for the Labour party in a snowstorm in Tooting, he helped lead strikes, and recruited miners to socialism. It was a tragedy that the cause he dedicated much of his life to only flourished in his final months alive, and he was immensely frustrated that he couldn’t be actively part of it: but it was an immense comfort that he lived to see it. And that, in time, is how I’d like to remember him. Not stricken by an illness that wages a remorseless war against the bodies of its victims: but an Evertonian book-loving socialist, full of optimism, who loved to travel and to live, who told very bad jokes. Grief does, in time, let go. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Comments will be premoderated"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/may/15/sex-education-schools-from-era-spice-girls-equality-icons","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Sex education in schools is from an era when the Spice Girls were equality icons | Laura McInerney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/15/sex-education-schools-from-era-spice-girls-equality-icons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/15/sex-education-schools-from-era-spice-girls-equality-icons","fields":{"headline":"Sex education in schools is from an era when the Spice Girls were equality icons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Each generation thinks it invented sex, so the saying goes. But perhaps each merely adds a new perspective. I recently saw the 10-year-old daughter of a colleague, nestled in a corner, diligently reading a book at a work event. Like the irritating former teacher I am, I inquired what it was about. “It’s about two friends,” she said. “One is transgender and the other is bi. But it’s mostly about school and their lives.” All very matter-of-fact. “Bi … sexual?” I checked, trying to contain my surprise. She looked at me as if I was stupid: “Errr, yes. It means you like boys AND girls.” Ten years ago, I taught sex education in inner-city London comprehensives as part of my job as a citizenship teacher. Keeping a lid on the rampant homophobia among pupils was a constant struggle. At that time, our lessons, considered super-progressive, taught sex as something “that a man and woman do when they love each other”. Other sexualities or gender identities weren’t glossed over. They were simply absent. As my encounter with the 10-year-old brought home, things have moved on. Yet English schools still labour under sex education rules written in 2000, back when the vanguard of equal rights was a Spice Girl flashing her knickers and most gay parliamentary candidates were not open about it until after they were elected. Not only are the rules hopelessly out of date, but they can also be ignored by swathes of academies, now run by charitable trusts, which are exempt from teaching it at all. Thankfully, this is to change. From September 2019, sex and relationship education becomes compulsory for all children in England. As education ministers promised to release the full details at least a year in advance, schools are now on tenterhooks. Hints so far suggest that four-year-olds will be taught about safe relationships, while older children will be taught about “online pornography” and “sexting” (those are the Department for Education’s words, not mine). The usual sop to faith schools mean they can teach “in line” with their religious views and blur out bits they don’t like – although intolerance towards LGBT communities is frowned on by the schools inspectorate. Consultants are already clamouring to help schools prepare for their new statutory obligations, and some of it seems like a box-ticking exercise. It’s like the data protection law preparations, but with genital diagrams. Approaching sex education in this way is classically British and foolish. If information transmission is the only goal, we may as well round children up once a year and take them to a cinema to all watch a video of an embarrassed science teacher explaining how to put a condom on a cucumber. The Netherlands’ approach, considered the best in the world, involves less “teaching” about sex and more simply talking about it openly from a young age to encourage more frank conversations. Teens in the Netherlands tend to have their first sexual experiences later than British teenagers, and a higher percentage of them say it was “fun and wanted”. Unfortunately there appears to be no clear plan, and no cash, for preparing teachers. The course I did, to gain an additional teaching specialism in sex education, used to train 1,700 teachers a year. Once the Conservatives cut course funding, that dropped to 170 a year – one for every 130 schools in the country. Yet without additional training not only are we likely to repeat the sins of previous generations’ sex education, but we’ll also fail to prepare teachers for the new landscape of gender fluidity and sexual diversity – one that a certain 11-year-old (by then) will be waiting to see reflected in her sex education classes next September. After all, she’s ready for the sexuality conversations but are the rest of us? •This article was amended on 14 May to correct the statement about gay parliamentary candidates"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/11/uk-has-seen-brexit-related-growth-in-racism-says-un-representative","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:16:46Z","webTitle":"UK has seen 'Brexit-related' growth in racism, says UN representative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/uk-has-seen-brexit-related-growth-in-racism-says-un-representative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/11/uk-has-seen-brexit-related-growth-in-racism-says-un-representative","fields":{"headline":"UK has seen 'Brexit-related' growth in racism, says UN representative","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brexit has contributed to an environment of increased racial discrimination and intolerance, the UN special rapporteur on racism has said, as she identified a range of institutional prejudices that plague the lives of ethnic minorities in Britain. Speaking at the end of her mission to the UK, Prof Tendayi Achiume pointed to a Brexit-related growth in “explicit racial, ethnic and religious intolerance”, including extreme views that have gained ground in mainstream political parties of the left and the right. “The environment leading up to the referendum, the environment during the referendum, and the environment after the referendum has made racial and ethnic minorities more vulnerable to racial discrimination and intolerance,” she said. Achiume, from Zambia, was appointed the UN’s special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in September 2017. A professor of law at University of California, Los Angeles, she is the first woman and the first person from southern Africa to fill the role. “The discourses on racial equality before, during and after the 2016 referendum, as well as the policies and practices upon which the Brexit debate has conferred legitimacy, raise serious issues at the core of my mandate,” she said. “Many with whom I consulted highlighted the growth in volume and acceptability of xenophobic discourses on migration, and on foreign nationals including refugees in social and print media.” Achiume spent 11 days in the UK investigating the impact of Brexit on racial equality. But she went beyond that mandate, highlighting the scandal of misapplication of “hostile environment” policies on the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants, the disproportionate criminalisation of black people, and the “sustained and pervasive” vilification of Muslims via Prevent, the government’s counter-radicalisation strategy. Achiume also expressed alarm at the stark increase in hate crimes and incidents across the UK after the referendum to leave the EU. “The harsh reality is race, ethnicity, religion gender, disability status and related categories all continue to determine the life chances and wellbeing of people in Britain in ways that are unacceptable and in many cases unlawful,” she said. Achiume called for the repeal of the policies at the “rotten core” of the hostile environment, which she said affected not just irregular immigrants, but also individuals who had regular status, “and many who are British citizens and have been entitled to this citizenship as far back as the colonial era”. Her visit, she said, came unexpectedly amid fraught and highly relevant public and political debates. “A clear example was the resignation of the home secretary, Amber Rudd,on the first day of my visit,” she said. “This resignation came amidst the still-unfolding scandal of the gross human rights violations and indignities that Afro-Caribbean British citizens popularly referred to as the ‘Windrush generation’ have had to endure as a result of the so-called ‘hostile environment’ policy introduced during prime minister Theresa May’s tenure as home secretary.” On criminal justice, Achiume pointed to the findings of the Lammy review, which showed how minority groups are a disproportionate target “at every stage in the criminal justice process”. She called for the full implementation of its recommendations. “I am shocked by the criminalisation of young people from ethnic minorities, especially young black men. They are over-represented in police stop and searches, more likely to face prosecution under the country’s joint enterprise provisions, and are over-represented in the prison system,” she said. She added: “There can be no question that a pervasive and officially tolerated culture of racial profiling is at work in certain police forces, and that racial and ethnic minority children and youth are among the most vulnerable.” Operation Prevent, the government’s counter-terrorism strategy, should be suspended, Achiume said, while officials conduct a comprehensive audit of its impact on racial equality. She criticised the way it made “teachers, professors, nurses, and doctors … the frontline agents of countering extremism,” adding: “Widespread enforcement of the Prevent duty is fuelling distrust among racial and ethnic minority communities, especially those who are Muslim.” “The concern … is the policy choice embodied in the Prevent programme, which mandates civil servants, social workers, care-givers, educators and others, to make life-altering judgments on the basis of vague criteria in a climate of national anxieties that scapegoat entire religious, racial and ethnic groups as the presumptive enemy,” she said. Achiume is due to present her full report on the findings and conclusions of her visit to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2019. A government spokesperson said: “We note that the special rapporteur commended UK legislation and policy to tackle direct and indirect racial discrimination, and that in her end of mission statement she welcomed the Race Disparity Audit as ‘a remarkable step towards transforming formal commitments to racial equality into reality’. “We have made great progress, but the prime minister is clear that if there is no rational explanation for ethnic disparities, then we – as a society – must take action to change them. That is precisely what we will do.” The government is believed to be particularly unhappy with the criticism of Prevent, with a source saying it was disappointing to see a “series of assertions that are not based on the reality of Prevent on the ground” adding that the programme was vital to tackling both Islamist and far-right terrorism and denying it targeted a particular ethnic group. The Home Office also pointed out that new home secretary Sajid Javid had made clear he would not use the term hostile environment, saying it “does not represent our values as a country.” However, it said the department was committed to a “compliant environment [which] protects the taxpayer and is based on principles of fairness.” Deborah Coles, executive director of Inquest, which gives legal assistance to families whose loved ones have died in state custody, was among those who provided evidence to Achiume. She welcomed the rapporteur’s “strong statements”. “The most extreme consequence of racial profiling is the question of disproportionate black deaths following use of force by police,” she said. “The strength of her commentary around racial profiling and the consequences from over policing, criminalisation, and deaths from the use of force is something that the UK government has to address as a matter of urgency. Her comments are a forewarning of what will continue to happen if the state doesn’t address her concerns.” Stafford Scott, of race relations charity The Monitoring Group, who also gave evidence to Achiume, welcomed comments from Achiume about how police gangs databases disproportionately skew towards identifying black young people as perpetrators of gang violence, and which he described as “part of the process that sets up our community to be viewed as a suspect community by the entire state.” “That the United Nations are talking about England needing to have a policy that lays out a comprehensive strategy for the systemic and systematic elimination of unlawful racial disparities in the 21st century is disgraceful,” Scott said. “England needs to consider how it now looks on the world stage, having voted for Brexit, and having had the UN rapporteur telling England that structural racism is still an everyday reality for black people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/racing-92-champions-cup-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T14:27:36Z","webTitle":"Racing 92 confident French core will bring home Champions Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/racing-92-champions-cup-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/racing-92-champions-cup-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Racing 92 confident French core will bring home Champions Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If England’s selection of Brad Shields and the accompanying controversy is a case study into the strained relationship between availability, eligibility and nationality in the modern game, spare a thought for the France full-back Scott Spedding. The South Africa-born Spedding has 23 caps, he holds a French passport, has played in the country for a decade and was moved to tears live on camera when learning of his first call-up four years ago. He was not registered with the French federation for five years before the age of 23, however, nor did he spend three years in an academy, and is therefore not considered a JIFF (joueurs issus des filières de formation) – effectively a French-reared player. As a result, he has been released by Clermont who did not want someone considered a foreign player – when there are ever-increasing limits on how many they can have – who, as part of France’s elite list, would be unavailable for parts of the season. It is a bonkers situation because the whole point of the JIFF ruling is to strengthen the national team. The French league (LNR) has threatened punitive measures, including docking points, for teams who do not have an average of 60% JIFFs in their match-day squad across the season, which translates as an average of 14 per match. In February the LNR announced that number would rise to 15 next season, which led Spedding to take legal action, arguing it prevented him from “finding an employer”. Thankfully for Spedding, a happy ending of sorts was announced on Thursday and he will join Castres next season. All of which brings us, in a roundabout way, to Racing 92, who contest a second Champions Cup final in three seasons on Saturday, against Leinster. They do so with Dan Carter in their squad – and it would be naive to dismiss the possibility he will seal the winning points before heading off to Japan – but Racing are no longer a destination for southern hemisphere players to arrive en masse and line their pockets. They find themselves one win away from Europe’s top prize, having averaged the most JIFFs per match in the Top 14 this season. There is obvious sympathy for Spedding’s plight but Racing’s success can be considered evidence the LNR’s commitment to slow the influx of overseas imports is paying off. Racing still have overseas players – Pat Lambie starts at fly-half, Leone Nakarawa and Donnacha Ryan make up an Irish-Fijian second row, while Finn Russell and Simon Zebo arrive next season – and it certainly helps to be bankrolled by someone as wealthy as Jacky Lorenzetti, but there has been a clear shift in attitude by their billionaire owner and les deux Laurents – Labit and Travers – their two coaches. To demonstrate, there were only six Frenchmen in the starting XV in the 2016 final against Saracens and that soon became five when Mike Phillips replaced Maxime Machenaud midway through the first half. Machenaud is again struck by misfortune – a knee injury rules him out – but Racing will attempt to claim the trophy Lorenzetti has coveted since he bought a majority stake in the club in 2006 with 12 French players in their side. Machenaud’s absence will be keenly felt but in Teddy Thomas, Camille Chat, Wenceslas Lauret and Yannick Nyanga there is a core of French players who will put to the test the theory that Ireland, both domestically and internationally, are Europe’s dominant force this season. And the benefits for the French national team are obvious. Whisper it quietly but at a time when their World Cup pool rivals are facing accusations of poaching All Black castoffs, there is a creeping sense France are belatedly getting their house in order. Victory for Racing on Saturday would only add to it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/11/trump-embarrassed-mueller-investigation-john-kelly","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T16:08:01Z","webTitle":"Trump 'embarrassed, frankly' by Mueller investigation, John Kelly says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/trump-embarrassed-mueller-investigation-john-kelly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/11/trump-embarrassed-mueller-investigation-john-kelly","fields":{"headline":"Trump 'embarrassed, frankly' by Mueller investigation, John Kelly says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has said Donald Trump is “somewhat embarrassed” by the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Kelly told National Public Radio (NPR) in a rare interview broadcast on Friday that Robert Mueller’s investigation inevitably crops up when the US president hosts his foreign counterparts. “There may not be a cloud, but certainly the president is, you know, somewhat embarrassed, frankly,” Kelly, a retired four-star marine corps general, said. “When world leaders come in, it’s kind of like you know Bibi Netanyahu [of Israel] is here and he – who’s under investigation himself – and it’s like, you know, you walk in and you know the first couple of minutes of every conversation might revolve around that kind of thing.” Kelly, who is Trump’s second chief of staff, said he spends five to eight hours a day with the president. His tenure has been the subject of recent speculation after reports that his influence is waning and that he branded the president an “idiot”. But he told NPR he thinks Trump is “a super-smart guy”. He added: “My view is to speak truth to power. I always give my opinion on everything. He always listens. Sometimes he takes the opinion, sometimes he doesn’t.” Kelly denied reports he had threatened to resign but admitted: “There’s times of great frustration, mostly because of the stories I read about myself or others that I think the world of, which is just about everybody who works at the complex, and wonder whether it’s worth it to be subjected to that.” He did not name his predecessor, Reince Priebus, but said he wishes he had been in the role sooner. “I think in some cases in terms of staffing, or serving the president, that first six months was pretty chaotic and there were people some people hired that maybe shouldn’t have. It’s not that things were a disaster that first six months, but I believe they could have been better.” Kelly also addressed the Trump administration’s efforts to combat illegal immigration. He said most people coming into the country without documentation “are not bad people”, but they will not assimilate easily. “They’re overwhelmingly rural people,” he said. “In the countries they come from, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-grade educations are kind of the norm. They don’t speak English; obviously that’s a big thing. They don’t integrate well; they don’t have skills.” Kelly was seen as a hardliner on immigration in his pre-chief of staff role as head of the Department of Homeland Security. Now questions have also been raised about the future of Kelly’s successor at the DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen. The New York Times reported that she had drafted but not submitted a resignation letter after Trump lambasted her at a meeting for failing, in his view, to secure US borders. The DHS denied the claim. Spokesman Tyler Houlton tweeted: “The NY Times article alleging that the secretary drafted a resignation letter yesterday and was close to resigning is false.” Nielsen herself issued a statement that said: “The president is rightly frustrated that existing loopholes and the lack of congressional action have prevented this administration from fully securing the border and protecting the American people. I share his frustration.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/patrick-melrose-review-brilliant-portrayal-addiction-benedict-cumberbatch","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T21:10:09Z","webTitle":"Patrick Melrose review – a brilliant portrayal of addiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/patrick-melrose-review-brilliant-portrayal-addiction-benedict-cumberbatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/patrick-melrose-review-brilliant-portrayal-addiction-benedict-cumberbatch","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Melrose review – a brilliant portrayal of addiction","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The phone rings, one of those telephones from my childhood, with a curly wire connecting the receiver. A stripy-shirted arm reaches for it tentatively. “Hello?” says a voice – deep, aristocratic, lugubrious and woozy, but unmistakably Benedict Cumberbatch (confirmed when the camera eventually looks higher). There is a delay and an echo on the line (remember that?). Sad news from New York: his father has died. Patrick Melrose, the character Cumberbatch is playing, sinks slowly towards the floor, but not in grief. He has dropped something; a syringe. There is a tell-tale blood spot on the shirt, too. After hanging up, Melrose’s face slowly – very slowly – transforms. His eyes close, he exhales through his nose, the corners of his mouth twist into a smile, because heroin is now flooding his brain cells and because of another kind of release – from the abusive relationship and trauma that was instrumental in getting him mixed up with serious drugs in the first place. “Old bastard’s only gone and died,” he says to one of the women in his life. He is thinking of giving up drugs, he tells another. Then he Concordes across the Atlantic, where he fails spectacularly to give up drugs (to heroin add amphetamines, quaaludes, valium and alcohol) and very nearly fails to pick up his father’s ashes. He only just fails to kill himself, too. The first episode of Patrick Melrose (Sky Atlantic), adapted by One Day writer David Nicholls from the autobiographical novels of Edward St Aubyn, covers two days in 1982 in New York, with flashbacks to a miserable childhood that is explored – excruciatingly and poignantly – in future episodes. It could have been ghastly – messed-up, Tennyson-quoting toff throws money at people and takes a lot of drugs in 80s New York, because his messed-up toff daddy wasn’t very nice to him. And how can the thoughtful wit and exploration – of the character and of addiction and privilege - of the books translate to the screen? It is a triumph, though. Nicholls must take some credit for managing to boil down five books into five hours of television without losing flavour. I have seen three, each of which has a distinct character that has a lot to do with where and when it is set, yet they nod to each other and belong together, like movements in a symphony. The dialogue (much of which is Melrose in conversation with himself) is sharp; this is tight, intelligent adaptation. Then there is Edward Berger’s direction. Berger, who did Deutschland 83, does excellent New York 82 as well. There are so many glorious scenes in the first episode. At the funeral parlour on Madison (“only the best or go without” Melrose’s father would have said), where Melrose goes into the wrong room, a Jewish wake, before finding the right one and unwrapping his father like a birthday present (“Is it Dad? It is! It’s just what I wanted, you shouldn’t have!”). A disastrous date with an ambitious New York socialite who doesn’t want a quaalude or even a drink. Another drink with a woman who witnessed some of Patrick’s tragic childhood. During this one, a quaalude hits and everything slows down, as if all the batteries have suddenly gone flat – Patrick’s voice, the movement of the camera … until he does a line of speed in the loo. Suddenly, everything – jerky camera movement included – is on full charge again. It is an immersive experience: not just watching Melrose, but kind of being him as well. Which brings us to the man who has thrown himself into Melrose. There are other fine performances: Sebastian Maltz, haunting as young Patrick; Hugo Weaving as his monster father; Jennifer Jason Leigh as his wasted, spaced out, waste-of-space mother. But this is the Cumberbatch show and it has come to town. He had always wanted the part, he told the Radio Times, which might have been problematic, made it a vehicle for his talents and range: look at me acting, now shower me with awards. Maybe there is a bit of that going on. But it also means he has a deep understanding of the character. He hits just the right note: hilarious, but also tragic, irritating, exasperating. It is addiction personified, sympathetic without being celebratory or glamorised. So, do look at him – it is impossible not to – and shower him with awards. He is, and it is, brilliant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-player-of-the-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T07:32:04Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2017-18 review: player of the season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-player-of-the-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-player-of-the-season","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2017-18 review: player of the season","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2017-18 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line … Mohamed Salah Now there can be no doubt: Salah is the most entertaining Egyptian to arrive in English football since Mohamed Al Fayed. Once a Chelsea cast-off, he needed one campaign to become a Liverpool icon and race within sight of the planet’s Untouchable Duo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. On his debut against Watford he won a penalty for Roberto Firmino and later helped himself to a goal; that was pretty much how the rest of his campaign panned out as he wreaked havoc on opponents across the land. Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool proved to be the perfect environment and he proved to be the perfect recruit for them, a snip at £34m. He has been thrilling to watch, somehow allying breakneck speed and sneaky feet with cold-blooded, even witty, decision-making. He made something happen nearly every time he got the ball. Usually a goal. And what a variety of goals! Slaloming between two defenders before curling the ball into the top corner against Everton; sending Ben Davies sliding in the wrong direction before bewitching Jan Vertonghen and scoring against Spurs from a tight angle; lobbing Ederson from 30 yards against Manchester City; sprinting for 60 yards to plant the ball past Petr Cech against Arsenal; blasting a volley past Jack Butland; looping a header over Asmir Begovic. Nearly everyone who faced Salah suffered. And everyone who watched him left satisfied. Kevin De Bruyne While Salah has approached comparability to Ronaldo and Messi, Manchester City’s wondrous playmaker can be ranked alongside Pythagoras and Euclid – or maybe above them, for De Bruyne is some class of geometrician-magician, wowing with the precise lines and arcs he traces with any part of his foot from any place on the pitch. The boxer Joe Louis used to warn his opponents “you can run, but you can’t hide” but De Bruyne puts a positive spin on this, sometimes literally, effectively telling his team-mates “you can run, and I will find you”. There is a beautiful efficiency in his improbable passing, and an ice-cold rage that appears to drive him. When he shoots it seems like he means to settle an argument for ever. There was certainly no way Chelsea were going to find a comeback to his peremptory strike on his return to Stamford Bridge in September. He’s brilliant. End of. David de Gea When Luke Shaw played well it was because he used José Mourinho’s brain, said Manchester United’s manager on one famous occasion. If that is true, then when Mourinho masterminded another clean sheet for United, it was usually because of De Gea’s hands. The goalkeeper was United’s most influential performer again this season, continually producing saves that defied reasonable expectation and gave an illusion of solidity to the rest of United’s backline. Raheem Sterling England’s best player had an outstanding campaign, scoring and creating prolifically, terrorising defences and really annoying people who continue to claim there’s a good reason to badmouth him. Sure, he’s not flawless – his finishing has improved dramatically but he’s still guilty of surprising misses but, then again, so is Salah – but overall he is an exhilarating player to watch and a tireless, conscientious, gifted and consistently effective team player. If Manchester City toyed with the notion of selling him last summer, they’ve surely thrown that idea in the bin, which is where some other thoughts about Sterling belong. Wilfried Zaha The top five clubs do not have all the exciting talent. There are some delightful players at lesser sides: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, for instance, looked lethal after his arrival at Arsenal; Riyad Mahrez was often a joy to watch despite the frustration of his thwarted move to Manchester City and Leicester’s sagging; Xherdan Shaqiri did some fine things at Stoke; Christopher Schindler was quietly classy at Huddersfield; but perhaps none of them were as consistently dangerous, eye-catching and influential as Zaha, who triggered panic and glee nearly every time he ran with the ball. “I was reading the programme before the match and there was a statistic that claimed Zaha had only two assists so far this season,” said Roy Hodgson after Crystal Palace’s 3-0 win at Leicester in December. “But as far as I can make out Wilf is involved in at least 80% of what we create.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-trump-swamp-tours","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T14:50:53Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on Michael Cohen: 'He's literally selling swamp tours'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-trump-swamp-tours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/11/trevor-noah-michael-cohen-trump-swamp-tours","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on Michael Cohen: 'He's literally selling swamp tours'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed the latest reports on Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen as well as Trump’s release of prisoners from North Korea. Trevor Noah: ‘He’s explicitly bragging about selling access to Trump’ On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah started by talking about Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti, who “looks exactly what a lawyer in a porno looks like”. He then spoke about the latest allegations against Cohen. “Corporations paid millions of dollars into the same shell company that Cohen then used to pay off Stormy Daniels, and right now, I can’t believe that an affair with a porn star is the least scandalous part of the story,” he said. A number of major companies paid money to Cohen who promised them access to the president, including AT&amp;T. Noah joked that, in a way, as an AT&amp;T customer he helped to pay off Daniels. “I finally understand what Stormy Hush Payment was for,” he said. “I thought it was like a hurricane thing.” He jokingly referred to Cohen as “Never Call Saul” and then spoke about how staggering Cohen’s plan was. “He’s explicitly bragging about selling access to the president,” he said. “This guy’s not just a swamp creature, he’s literally selling swamp tours.” He also referred to it as a “classic Nigerian prince scam”. Stephen Colbert: ‘There’s a lot of indoor peeing’ On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about Trump’s press conference with the three prisoners being kept in North Korea who are now back in the US. He joked that Trump attended the photocall “along with Melania, who is hoping to be freed next”. “No Trump accomplishment would be complete without a bit of bragging about ratings,” he said as Trump claimed the 3am ratings would be a record. Colbert also referred to Cohen as “Trump lawyer and man being politely asked to leave the strip club” before talking about the difficulty of finding people who are able to predict or understand Trump. “A Trump whisperer is like a dog whisperer because, well, there’s a lot of indoor peeing and hitting with rolled-up magazines,” he said. Seth Meyers: ‘The season finale of Rudy Giuliani’ On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host discussed Trump supporters pushing the president for the Nobel peace prize. Trump was asked about it and said he is more interested in victory for the world. “Victory for the world?” Meyers said. “He doesn’t sound like a Nobel laureate – he sounds like a movie president fighting an alien invasion.” Meyers continued: “If he won a Nobel, his speech would be the first in history with an NC-17 rating.” He then played footage of Trump at the NRA convention, repeatedly joking about John Kerry breaking his leg. “Trump is like the guy you went to high school with who never forgets your most embarrassing moment,” he said. Meyers also referenced another bad week for Rudy Giuliani. “Based on how things are going, I guess he has a week left in his job tops,” he said. “When he goes on Fox News, they should introduce him as ‘The season finale of Rudy Giuliani’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/12/lenovo-chinese-giant-plays-rules-loses-patents","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T15:00:35Z","webTitle":"Lenovo, the Chinese giant that plays by the rules … and loses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/12/lenovo-chinese-giant-plays-rules-loses-patents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/12/lenovo-chinese-giant-plays-rules-loses-patents","fields":{"headline":"Lenovo, the Chinese giant that plays by the rules … and loses","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The war of words between the US and China over trade has many subtexts, but treatment of intellectual property (IP) is a major factor. Donald Trump believes that the world’s second-largest economy gains an unfair advantage over its main rival due to an overly aggressive and sometimes underhand approach to IP – the patents and copyrights that underpin big tech, manufacturing and creative breakthroughs. So what happens when China plays the game fairly and buys American IP to gain a foothold in the world’s biggest economy? In the case of Lenovo, one of China’s biggest tech firms, doing so has been no guarantee of success. The Beijing-based company has bought three respected US tech businesses since 2005: IBM’s PC arm and low-cost server unit, and Motorola smartphones. None of them has worked out.Far from enabling Lenovo to trample rivals, the phone and server businesses, both acquired in October 2014, for $2.9bn and $2.3bn respectively, have turned into anchors that threaten to pull it down to a loss when it announces full-year results this month.IBM’s sale of its PC division to a then barely known Chinese company in 2005 raised eyebrows, but it made sense at the time. By 2005 IBM couldn’t make a profit in personal computers, as it was beset by far cheaper rivals. Lenovo could, though, and quickly became a contender for the world’s biggest PC maker, vying with Hewlett-Packard. It looked like the harbinger of a Chinese invasion. While the IBM PC business complemented Lenovo’s existing offerings, Motorola seemed to be the big prize. It sold the world’s first mobile phones in 1983 and in the 2000s the “Hello, Moto” slogan achieved global recognition. Google snapped it up in 2011 for $12.5bn, thwarting Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo’s chief executive. But Motorola didn’t make a profit under Google, which offered it to Yang three years later. That sale of an American icon attracted little regulatory attention. But one American technology executive expressed private outrage at Google’s decision: “it’s an American brand! It’s shameful to sell it like this,” he said. Yang was confident that adding it to Lenovo’s China-based smartphone business would create a global behemoth: the combined company was then behind only Apple and Samsung in the smartphone market. Lenovo’s presentations sounded like a company preparing for war, with phrases such as “protect PC leadership” and “attack mobile internet”. But Lenovo’s accounts show the smartphone business has lost money every quarter since the takeover – in total, nearly $2bn. Early in March, half of Motorola’s 380 engineering staff at its Chicago offices were let go. China’s Huawei, another big tech player, has raced past Lenovo to become No 3 in smartphones globally; Lenovo is almost out of the top 10, selling 17% fewer phones than in 2014 while the market has grown 15%. The problem has been a long internal struggle over which brand – Lenovo or Motorola – should drive the business, says Neil Shah at Counterpoint Research. Choosing one brand in territories where they overlapped – China, south-east Asia and India – lost business for the other, but running both meant duplication. He expects the Lenovo brand to be retired in favour of the Motorola one. Asked why the business is not profitable, Lenovo responds that “component costs continue to present challenges” but that it will try to strengthen its position in Latin America and “drive breakthrough in mature markets” along with “controlled investment in emerging markets”. Nor has the server business been a shortcut to success. Since the 2014 takeover it has lost more than $700m. Adrian O’Connell at analysis firm Gartner says the growth of cloud services from Google, Amazon and Microsoft – which allow consumers and companies to store data without the need for their own hardware – threatens all server vendors, because those big providers bypass the profitable support contracts that server companies rely on (often by manufacturing their own equipment). Security is also an issue. “In certain sectors there will also be the potential perception issue of working with a China-based supplier at the heart of their data centre, which is an unavoidable challenge for [Lenovo] now,” O’Connell adds. Even the profit engine of the PC business is struggling. Lenovo slipped from first to second place in 2017 as Hewlett-Packard regained its crown, and the PC industry is in a years-long decline, with no clear end in sight. Yang might yet have to swallow a paper loss on those 2014 acquisitions. Of the just over $5bn spent on the Motorola and IBM server businesses in 2014, $2.7bn was allocated to “goodwill” – the part of a company’s value that applies to intangible factors like brand names, customer relationships and patents. In January, a Bloomberg analysis said that Lenovo’s struggles indicated that a goodwill writedown, and potentially a full-year loss, was coming.For Lenovo, the past four years provide a salutary lesson for those seeking a trade war over IP: that even buying patents and copyrights fair and square will not give you a lead in the cut-throat global tech market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/live/2018/may/12/eurovision-song-contest-2018-live-lisbon","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T22:59:11Z","webTitle":"Israel wins the Eurovision song contest 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/may/12/eurovision-song-contest-2018-live-lisbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/live/2018/may/12/eurovision-song-contest-2018-live-lisbon","fields":{"headline":"Israel wins the Eurovision song contest 2018 – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So that’s IT for another Eurovision, and it’s goodbye from Lisbon! Thank you all for joining in and helping me hold this ship together, and a massive thanks to Alice for helping me navigate the madness. However you feel about Eurovision (and I fully expect plenty of people to share their opinions on this matter overnight), it remains one of my favourite nights of the year - you’ve all been brilliant company, so thank you for joining in. Putting on Eurovision is an absolutely epic feat - 43 countries, thousands of press and huge delegations to organise in one year. As usual the European Broadcasting Union have done the most phenomenal job, and the people of Lisbon have been an absolute joy. If you love Eurovision and get the chance to go, I can’t recommend it enough. Alice and I are on Twitter @heidistephens and @alice if you fancy saying hi; right now we’re off to the afterparty to dance the night away. Thank you so much for joining in, and I’ll see you next year! Time for another rendition of ‘Toy’ before we all go home *does chicken arms* I’m happy for Netta - she took a massive risk and it totally paid off. Eurovision bonkersness lives, and I can’t be sad about that. Cyprus have come second, which means ISRAEL have won this year’s Eurovision. A triumph for chicken madness, quirky pop and taking your Pikachu home. The UK came 24th out of 26, as predicted. Let’s never speak of this again. So it’s Israel or Cyprus. Popular voters, I love you. Only three countries left! I can’t breathe. I’m sandwiched between Israeli and Cypriot journalists here. Not gonna lie, it’s all quite tense. See this is all exciting now. One by one, countries are being eliminated from the top spot. Can Cyprus do it, or will be it be Germany or Israel? Lowest public vote goes to Australia, which is an absolute shocker. Sweden have done very badly in the public vote, we’re not going back there next year. So the scoreboard after the jury votes: Austria at the top with 271. The UK has 23. I have issues with the new numberwang voting system. But we haven’t had the public vote yet, so everything can change. STAY EXCITED PEOPLE. Israel just gave the UK 8 points. We love Israel. To be fair they’ve given Austria 12 points, so it’s all relative. Greece have given Cyprus 12 points. All is well. I CAN’T go back to Sweden, I had to take out a second mortgage after 2016. I’ll be liveblogging back in front of the telly next year at this rate. So much jury love for Germany, Austria and Sweden. This is a beige bloodbath. The UK currently has 7 points from the jury vote. For context, the country in the lead (Israel), has 158. “Is this a surprise?”, silver commentator asks Cesar. “Yes, I wasn’t expecting this”. You and me both, Cesar. Hello why do all the juries love Austria please. I mean it was fine, but still. (apologies to my Austrian boyfriend, I still love you). The UK currently has a total of 4 points. Exciting times. Apparently the stage invader was described by the Australian TV commentator as “some absolute cockhead”. Loving your work, Australia. Mel Giedroyc confirms that the UK jury 12 points go to - AUSTRIA. Austria. For crying out loud. The good news is they’re flying through the jury votes. The bad news is I can’t keep up. Right now Cyprus are at the top of the table, and we haven’t even got to the public yet. Every jury is giving their ponts to different countries. No consistency at all. It’s already feeling quite stressful. Nothing for the UK so far from the jury vote. Time for some scoring! Ukraine gives their 12 points to FRANCE. Ooh, interesting. Azerbaijan go for Albania, and Belarus go for CYPRUS. We’re in for a fun night. Time is running out to vote! Time for another recap. Here’s my summary: Ukraine: man trapped in a piano Spain: slush Slovenia: stompy banger Lithuania: Birds of a Feather Austria: plinth Estonia: singing dress Norway: Jarlsberg Portugal: bye for now UK: absolute trooper Serbia: drums German: Aldi Sheeran Albania: shouty France: deep Czech Replubic: rapping backpack Denmark: viking wizards Australia: stone cold banger Finland: dystopian circuss Bulgaria: shouty Gaga and friends Moldova: Carry On Ikea Sweden: Justine Sweber Hungary: My Ears Israel: I’m taking your Pikachu home Netherland: country Best Western Ireland: snow love is love Cyprus: FUEGO Italy: last I’ve opened another Super Bock. It’s the only way. Not fussed about this song, but am very much enjoying Salvador’s Brazilian blow dry. Salvador’s back. Last year he railed against “disposable, fast-food music without any content”, calling his win “a victory for people who make music that actually means something.” Part of me really wants him to hand the trophy to Netta at the end of this. This interval thing is a hot mess. Sweden did this so much better in 2016. Feel free to watch this instead. Wait! I forgot Czech Republic in my top five. It’s now a top 8. Look, I love pop music. Judge away, I don’t care. So I’ve done some asking round (yay journalism) and nobody in this press room has the smallest idea who is going to win this. Last year Portugal was a dead cert. How exciting is that? So my top five for tonight: Cyprus Israel Denmark Moldova Australia If I can have a bonus two, I’ll go for Finland and Slovenia. Hang on, we’ve got bonus rap and drumming. Now we’re talking. Time for the interval act! I haven’t seen this and have no idea what’s coming. First up: more Portuguese singing that sounds a lot like the earlier Portuguese singing. My mum has just posted on Facebook “that young man from Sweden can dance me off any time”. MUM. I’m back! Is this recap still going? Time for a recap! I’m going to dash to the loo. Be back soon. The voting is open! Obviously I’ll vote for the UK because I’m outside the UK and I can. SuRie deserves every vote going for that performance under pressure. So that’s it for the singing! Well done everyone, we survived the first half. Now we just have to endure the interval act and the interminable scoring before 1500 journalists start frantically booking hotels in Limassol for May 2019. According to Google Translate the title means ‘You did not do anything to me’, which just about sums up the audience response to this song. Italy are one of the Big Five, which means they automatically qualify for the final with any old guff - this year they’ve sent Simon Amstell and David Baddiel to shout about the pointlessness of war. I miss the dancing gorilla from last year. Everyone’s here is still shouting FUEGO, you’re too late. And FINALLY, it’s time for ITALY, with Ermal Meta and Fabrizio Moro singing ‘Non Mi Avete Fatto Niente’. There was probably a postcard, but I was being hugged by Cypriots. The crowd are going absolutely bonkers for this, both in the stadium and in the press room. All together now, FUEGO (drink). Eleni is an Albanian-Greek goddess in a catsuit held together by a million flaming sequins and a note from her gynaecologist. If nothing else, this will mobilise the dad vote (along with Greece and Albania, let’s face it). This is one of the hot favourites to win this year - I’ve danced my union jack socks off to this song this week. Notwithstanding Cyprus being the country where I spent my formative years, it’s also a solid gold banger with serious hairography and a chorus that’s straight out of the Avicii playbook (RIP). Next up it’s CYPRUS, with Eleni Foureira singing ‘Fuego’. In her postcard, Eleni is shopping for fruit and vegetable and making Portuguese food. DRINK. Here’s the story of the SuRie stage invasion. I cannot tell a lie, this inoffensive number didn’t exactly jump out at us in the studio version. But the staging - with a cute gay couple frolicking in the snow - has turned it into a real contender. The performance sparked a roar of support from the arena audience in the semi-final - and led to Chinese TV censors’ decision to edit Ireland out of their broadcast (along with Albania, because of performers’ tattoos). The EBU have responded with speed and class, refusing to let China show last night’s second semi-final or the final thanks to this breach of EBU values of inclusivity. Quite right too. It’s time for IRELAND, with Ryan O’Shaughnessy singing Together. In his postcard, Ryan is going diving. There are fish. It doesn’t get any more nautical than this – DRINK. What is it with the Netherlands and country music? This is basically Rock Star by Nickelback, sung by a man in a hat (DRINK). The dancing gets a bit weird, and this is very much not my favourite. Sorry Netherlands - I’m still singing O’G3NE from last year in the shower if that helps? Next up it’s THE NETHERLANDS, with Waylon singing ‘Outlaw In ‘Em’. In his postcard, Waylon is hugging a baker and making custard tarts (DRINK). I mean, that was incredible. Go Israel. Everyone in the press centre is dancing and waving rubber chickens. Happy days. So this chicken noise-aided banger is musical Marmite. But whether you love or loathe it, one thing’s for sure - no-one will forget Netta and her dancers dominating the stage. References to Pikachus and smartphones aside, you COULD say this is an exuberant celebration of girl power that’s a potential Eurovision winner for the #metoo era. OR you could say it’s Bjork-inspired neon madness. Either way, expect to see it shoot into the top five - it’s this year’s fan favourite. And if you’re going to follow Eurovision around the continent, there are much worse places than Tel Aviv. Hold on to your hats, it’s time for ISRAEL, with Netta singing ‘Toy’. In her postcard, Netta is DJ-ing on a rooftop. Go Netta, you absolute queen. My lack of rock knowledge (I once owned a Nirvana album) makes it very difficult to tell if this is any good by metal standards. It has an epic key change, however. My guess is that everyone on Twitter is making the same joke right now, and I hate to be left out. U OK #hun? I’m assuming this is Hungarian for ‘rock out like you have spiders in your hair’ because the lead singer is giving it both barrels. I know heavy rock has a huge following all over the world and I absolutely support it being represented at Eurovision, but very much not my thing. I’m worried he’s going to do himself an injury, surely that much headbanging isn’t good for you? *mum face*. Massive change of tempo right now - next up it’s HUNGARY, with AWS singing Viszlát Nyár. In their postcard, they are making something chocolately in an alleyway (DRINK). This is an absolute bop, to be fair. Sweden LOVES a wet look sparkle jacket. Dance You Off is slick, and Benjy definitely has a Bieber thing going on (Sweber?), but he’s basically making a live music video - it works on screen but leaves the arena audience with nothing to see. Not sure this is enough for the top spot this year, but I’ve been in this bubble too long and have lost all sense of what’s normal. Ah, here’s Benjy on his giant rainbow sunbed. Alice tells me this chap is Swedish pop royalty - his brother Oliver is a DJ, while his mum Pernilla Wahlgren has competed in Sweden’s Eurovision selection Melodifestivalen five times, but never won. Imagine the tension round that dinner table - hey mum, you can come to Eurovision and carry my bags. It’s time for SWEDEN, with Benjamin Ingrosso singing ‘Dance You Off’. In his postcard, Benjy is making cheese (DRINK), and charming some ladies at a picnic. Smooth. “It’s a very good chicken sir, congratulations”. I love Eurovision. I can’t stop smiling. This is SO good. This is definitely our lucky day, because DoReDos are pure bonkers brilliance. The staging takes Balkan brass oompa-disco, adds an Ikea modular shelving unit, and turns it into a three-minute farce worthy of a 1970s sitcom. It’s not subtle - but if you wanted subtle, you wouldn’t be watching Eurovision. It’s super-clever, and I absolutely love it. Who’s next? It’s MOLDOVA, with DoReDos singing ‘My Lucky Day’. I missed the postcard, sorry. BRACE YOURSELVES THIS IS AMAZING. Right, back to Bulgaria. In a smart move, the delegation have smooshed together the fanbases of five Bulgarian stars. Rumours swirling backstage suggest they’re not exactly thrilled to be stuck together, but the result is a compelling performance with strong vocals - and lots of dry ice. Does that count as on stage weather? Drink anyway, the highlight of the night is coming up. Statement from BBC about SuRie: “SuRie was offered the option to perform again by the EBU. SuRie and her team are extremely proud of her performance and have together decided there is absolutely no reason to perform the song again.” Fair enough. It’s time for BULGARIA, with Bulgarian supergroup EQUINOX (god, doesn’t just that phrase make you love Eurovision?) singing ‘Bones’. In their postcard, Equinox are on a tram. I nearly got run over by one of those yesterday. I absolutely love this , but if the ridiculous dystopian circus staging feels familiar, that’s because UK X Factor staging guru Brian Friedman is behind it. Less is more, Brian. Watch out for a moment right at the end that’ll make you drop your drink. So if Saara looks familiar, it’s because she was UK X Factor runner-up in 2016. She’s always the bridesmaid, also coming second in Finland’s The Voice, and second in the Finnish national Eurovision selection TWICE, in 2011 and 2016 (thanks Alice for being my fact queen). Next up it’s FINLAND, with Saara Alto singing ‘Monsters’. In her postcard, Saara is playing golf in deeply inappropriate footwear. Ah, lovely tribute to Lys Assia, the first ever Eurovision winner. What a legacy. OK things in the green room have got weird. One of the presenters is trying to marry all of Serbia. Loo break time! Hurry back, because Finland is next and it’s EPIC. Only ten songs to go! This vocal was better in the jury final last night, sadly. Still an absolute tune, mind. OK, here’s my tip of the day. Stop asking why Australia is in the Eurovision Song Contest and just enjoy the stone cold bangers they send every year. Jess is one of Australia’s biggest stars and her record label have stepped up with a stirring pop classic, neon production and a glittery dress I’d quite like to nick. This is a huge fan favourite (read: absolutely goes off in a gay club) and if Jess can nail the delivery of this big song it could even deliver Australia’s first winner. In which case we’re probably all off to Berlin, because rumour has it Germany have done a hosting deal. Next up it’s AUSTRALIA, with Jessica Mauboy singing We Got Love. In her postcard, Jess is making her own guitar. This is my goosebump song of the night - I’m a sucker for stomping, beardy wizards and rousing drums. It’s straight out of a Disney blockbuster and I love it. Also viking longboat sails, which are definitely a nautical reference - DRINK. It’s time for DENMARK, with Rasmussen singing ‘Higher Ground’. In their postcard, Rasmussen are exploring a rather beautiful library. I’m guessing it’s somewhere in Portugal. So rumour has it that SuRie is going to sing again at the end. I’m really pleased for her, she’s worked incredibly hard and deserves a shot without idiots invading the stage. Incidentally, the random backpack is this year’s Chekhov’s Gun; like last year’s Romanian cannons, it serves no purpose whatsoever other than to make Mikolas look like Dora The Explorer. So on paper this is dubious white rap with a Timberlake-tastic chorus, sung by a manchild who looks like Taron Egerton in Kingsman. But somehow Mikolas pulls this off with bags of charm, and I absolutely LOVE it. Next up it’s the CZECH REPUBLIC, with Mikolas Josef singing ‘Lie To Me’. I have no idea what he did in his postcard, I wasn’t watching. Don’t go ANYWHERE for the next five songs, they’re all brilliant. Much like Ukraine’s 2016 winner, this tale of a refugee has an emotive message and a lot of pre-show buzz. In the jury final last night this got one of the warmest reactions in the arena. Expect this to do very well. It’s time for FRANCE, with Madame Monsieur (oh, France, you are so relentlessly FRENCH!) singing ‘Mercy’. In their postcard, both Madame and Monsieur are riding a furnicular railway. How fun. BBC Eurovision have just tweeted to say that SuRie is OK. Will update if I hear anything else, I’ve asked the BBC team in the press room for an update. I’m not sure if Eugent Bushpepa is the name of the singer or the band, but either way it sounds like some kind of exotic vegetable and now I really want a name like Eugent Bushpepa. This starts out in a folky rock style that’s right up my street, but I’m less keen on the descent into shouty Guns and Roses. Mr Bushpepa has a great voice though, and an equally excellent beard. It’s time for ALBANIA, with Eugent Bushpepa singing ‘Mall’. In his postcard, he is in a boat, wrapped in a blanket. I think he’s OK though. Stay with me people, we’re almost half way to the half way point of this incredibly long evening. This is essentially German Mick Hucknall singing James Bay’s ‘Let It Go’. A week ago I’d have called this a perfectly serviceable ballad that wouldn’t trouble the left hand side of the scoreboard, but this has gathered some real momentum over the semi-finals, and is now one of the favourites. I absolutely blame Ed Sheeran. It’s time for GERMANY, with Michael Schulte singing ‘You Let Me Walk Alone’. In his postcard, Michael is paragliding. He looks bored out of his mind. So this is classic Eurovision, straight out of the Love Love Peace Peace playbook - old man playing a local instrument, topless hunk on the drums (DRINK), traditional beats given a banging dance remix. We’ve heard versions of this from Balkan nations a million times, but I still can’t resist. I’ve been reliably told that Balkanika are a huge group in the region, and with hardly any of their neighbours making it to the final this year they should definitely get some local votes. Next up it’s SERBIA, and Sanja Ilic &amp; Balkanika singing ‘Nova Deca’. Their postcard features a tour of a winery. Sorry, still a bit shaken by the SuRie thing. I hope she’s OK. Oh my goodness, there was a stage invasion. Did someone try to grab her? SuRie is holding this together incredibly well and just got a huge round of applause from the press room. You go girl, that must have been awful. Incidentally, I highly recommend the 7th Heaven dance remix of this song, it’s the Euro-banger the UK absolutely should have sent. They’ve even been playing it on Radio 2, which suggests the original was considered too middle of the road. Eurovision lesson #1 - when in doubt, always take the dance remix. OK, so here’s the thing. This is actually a very good song from the UK, performed by a highly competent singer with very decent staging - the UK songs have improved immeasurably in recent years and it’s clear the BBC is really trying. That said, I’m worried this will still end up in the bottom five - no fault whatsoever of SuRie’s, and nothing at all to do with political voting. The song simply isn’t going to stand out alongside 25 countries who put their heart and soul into this competition, and have bought their A-game with highly polished songs and staging. SONG NINE! *orders jug of white Sangria*. It’s time for the UNITED KINGDOM, with SuRie singing her ode to the complexity of Brexit negotiations, ‘Storm’ (DRINK). In her postcard, SuRie is picking tea, because she’s now migrant labour. Time for a short interlude - grab a drink or top up the snacks, but don’t forget to come back as the UK is next! This is a perfectly nice song, but not good enough to trouble the top ten, let alone win. I suspect the brief was “put on a decent show, but for god’s sake don’t win again”, so we might be saying ‘ate logo’ (goodbye for now) to Portugal. It’s been fun. Big cheer from the crowd, because next up it’s PORTUGAL, with Claudia Pascoal singing Did You Know Portugal Has A 900-Year Nautical Heritage? Only joking, it’s called O Jardim (The Garden). In their postcard, Claudia and co. are looking at some ships. DRINK. So in the interests of avoiding a repeat of the 2009 International Incident, I’ll be quite clear. This song is entirely terrible, from the shaky lyrics to the call-and-response scatting. It’s cheesier than a Jarlsberg fondue. BUT Alex has charisma galore and is absolutely selling this - you cannot deny he has incredible stage presence. Please don’t win, I can’t afford (affjord?) a trip to Oslo next year. HEIDI TRIGGER WARNING, it’s time for NORWAY, with Alexander Rybak singing ‘That’s How You Write a Song’. In his postcard, Alex is doing some graffiti, hopefully with permission. So I’m in two minds about this song - I’m not a huge fan of popera and I feel like I’d be snoozing off if it wasn’t for the very cleverly animated dress (which cost 65k Euros, and had to be paid for by sponsors because the Estonian government refused to cough up). Elina has an incredible voice, however (she’s singing in Italian), and is an absolute poster girl for Estonian dentistry. Not my personal cup of tea, but it’s a stand-out bit of staging and I wouldn’t be surprised if this finished up in the top five. Next up it’s ESTONIA, with Elina Nechayevai singing ‘La Forza’. In her postcard, Elina is rock climbing up to a giant palace. Could she not have used the steps? This song is perfectly fine, pleasant to listen to and VERY pleasant to watch (Cesar is quite easy on my tired eyes). But in this year’s deluge of bangers and clever staging, poor Cesar is likely to get forgotten - even with his magnificent hydraulic plinth that looks like the International Space Station. He’s my prediction for last place right now, which gives you some idea how strong the field is this year. It’s time for AUSTRIA, with Cesar Sampson singing Nobody But You. In his postcard, Cesar is mountain biking through Portugal. No Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car for him. My friend Rob just pointed out that the graphics look a bit like the title sequence to Birds Of A Feather, and now I can’t unsee this. This is a lovely song sung with real charm - her voice has a bit of Dolores O’Riordan/Cerys Matthews about it, and there’s something quite captivating and heartfelt about the whole performance. I think this will do pretty well, and I would be perfectly fine with a trip to Vilnius next year (YES I just looked it up, don’t @me). Get ready for a change of pace - next up it’s LITHUANIA, with Ieva Zasimauskaitė singing ‘When We’re Old’. In her postcard, Ieva is driving a classic car through a windfarm. Okaaay. Ooh, there’s a ‘where’s the music’ fakeout in the middle. I love a touch of mild peril. So Lea has has all kind of beef with the pressures of modern life, and is registering her protest with an anthemic stomper. It’s great, but it’s on far too early in proceedings to get the votes it deserves. It’s time for SLOVENIA, with Lea Sirk singing ‘Hvala, ne!’, which means ‘thanks, no!’. In her postcard, Lea is strolling on the beach. Portugal has an extensive coastline, in case you hadn’t noticed. It’s a nautical nation. Amaia y Alfred are the winners of a hugely popular Spanish TV talent show, and are apparently an actual couple in real life. They have undeniable chemistry (as you’d hope, ain’t no room for domestic tension at Eurovision), but this song is an unrelenting slush fest that will either charm your socks off or make you feel queasy. Probably best that we haven’t started drinking (I haven’t started drinking, I’m guessing you all started several hours ago). Next up it’s SPAIN, with Amaia y Alfred singing ‘Tu Cancion’. In their postcard, they are having a nice walk near some hot springs. There is food! DRINK. The mad piano reminds me to tell you to watch out for fun props this evening - Portugal has banned the LED backdrop from recent years, which means everyone has bought massive props in lieu of funky projections. I suspect this has been an absolute ballache for the production team (just wheel on my MASSIVE BURNING PIANO), so make the most of it - I fully expect the LED backdrop to be back next year. I quite like this - good start, Ukraine. OOH, the stairs have burst into flames (DRINK). So this is weird. Imagine an episode of Mad Men where Pete Campbell has become inexplicably trapped inside a piano, but manages to free himself in order to sing a song about the weather. I’d absolutely watch that. First up it’s UKRAINE, with Melovin singing ‘Under the Ladder’. In his postcard from Portugal, Melovin is contemplating cliffs and riding a horse. As you do. OK, let’s kick off with some singing. This year is a bit of a slow start, but bear with it. Amazing stuff is coming later. It’s time to meet our hosts! They are four women (take that, Kiev) with matching mid-atlantic accents. They are something of a mixed bag, presenting-wise, which is very much the Eurovision way. I think four was probably two more than actually required, to be honest. Every year Eurovision makes me realise how rubbish my flag knowledge is. I asked Alice yesterday if a particular flag was San Marino, and she pointed out that it was Spain. This morning I entirely failed to identify the flag of Portugal, despite currently being IN PORTUGAL. I’m so ashamed. Out come tonight’s finalists, Olympic opening ceremony-style - they are accompanied by flag-bearers in sailor suits (DRINK), who I am very much hoping will be at the afterparty later. Ooh, there are lady sailors too, one appears to be wearing thigh boots. How are you supposed to climb rigging in those? No sign of the oiled-up guy from Tonga, sadly. Hold the phones - the singers have been replaced by a couple of DJs who’ve travelled by time machine from 1997. Their DJ booth looks like a neon Pokemon. More Portu-crooning. It’s quite haunting and rather splendid, but I’m ready for my cheese course now. DRUMS! DRINK! Time for a musical intro, courtesy of some traditional Portuguese crooning by a rather fabulous woman and a man with a traditional guitarra. The lyrics translate along the lines of “as Salvador mentioned last year, Portugal only does Real Music now and we have no time whatsoever for your jiggly pop nonsense”* *might have made this up Proceedings open with an extended postcard from Lisbon, showcasing how entirely delightful this city is. After last year in Kiev and 2016 in Stockholm, Eurovision in the sunny climes of southern Europe is a concept I’m entirely behind. If you can’t decide who to vote for, just choose a warm country for my sake. Based on current odds, Cyprus is your best bet. And we’re off! ALL ABOARD!!! Alice just popped out to get some beers and bumped into Lordi having a ciggie outside, in full Lordi costume (you can see their selfie on her Twitter @alice). Welcome to Eurovision. Hard to describe what this press room is like - about 1500 people who haven’t slept in a week, flags everywhere, incredibly noisy and excitement building. Later things will get entirely mad, with groups of journalists singing along and cheering all their scores. For lots of these guys, winning will mean hosting Eurovison for the first time ever. It’s a HUGE deal. Only half an hour to go! I’M EXCITED. A small drama is playing out in the Lisbon press room right now. Some Cypriot journalists have been evicted from the seats next to me by some Germans who say they reserved the tables earlier (insert your own towel/sunbed analogy here). Germany and Cyprus are both favourites to win this evening and I feel like tensions may run high later. I’m caught in the middle and staying neutral, like Switzerland. OBVIOUSLY we need a drinking game - it wouldn’t be Eurovision without one. Dust off that christmas bottle of port, and take one modest sip (it’s a very long night, trust me on this one) for any occurence of the following: Fire Nautical references Manufactured stage weather Hats Between-song postcards featuring Portuguese food Giant drums A couple of bits of housekeeping before we start - I’ll be able to see the same TV broadcast as you, but because I’m not watching on the BBC I sadly can’t hear Graham Norton’s commentary. So feel free to share any Norton gems in the comment box for the benefit of those reading later. Also I’m reliant on the WiFi in the Lisbon press centre this evening - it’s been fine all week, but if I disappear just party on without me until I get back online. This year’s Eurovision theme (yes, this is a thing) is All Aboard!, which the Portuguese have embraced with gusto. You can’t move in Lisbon for logos featuring seaweed, plankton and molluscs, along with references to Portugal’s 900 years of nautical history. So sailor suits are optional this evening - I’ve gone for a Vasco Da Gama onesie, and Alice is wearing a novelty Ferdinand Magellan hat. Let me know in the comment box below if you’re throwing a party, watching with family, or have international snacks. In happy news, the press room has booze this year (Super Bock beer and something called Somersby cider that’s so sweet it makes your teeth ache) - as usual I’ll be observing Terry Wogan rules and not drinking until Song 9 - by coincidence, this is when the UK entry is on. All aboard the Super Bock train for that. Boa noite everyone, and welcome to this year’s Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final liveblog! I’m live from beautiful Lisbon, where I’ve been immersing myself in the Euro madness since Tuesday. I’ve watched both semi finals, the jury final, and listened to every song roughly 412 times. I’ve danced to Moldovan oompa-disco at 2am, been taught Cypriot hairography by a Danish journalist wearing a viking helmet and a fur vest, and consumed considerably more than the recommended daily amount of vinho verde and pastel de nata. As in previous years, I’m following all the Eurovision action in the Lisbon press centre this evening, just a stone’s throw from the live Grand Final in the Altice Arena. Keeping me company are 1500 members of the world’s press, along with my friend and Eurovision superfan Alice - she’ll be keeping a beady eye on the comment box and the goings on in the arena while I’m tapping away feverishly for the next (oh good lord) five and a half hours. You are very much encouraged to join us in the comment box below - feel free to add all your wit and wisdom on the presenters, the songs, the costumes and the performances. There’s some good stuff coming up tonight, so grab several bottles of Mateus Rose, a plateful of custard tarts and make yourself comfortable. Kick off is at 8pm - see you then!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/crystal-palace-west-brom-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T12:57:31Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace v West Brom: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/crystal-palace-west-brom-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/crystal-palace-west-brom-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace v West Brom: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two of the division’s form teams meet on the final day, with the occasion little more than a celebration of the two managers.

Beating LeBron could seal it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first time I met Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens was outside Butler University’s famed Hinkle Fieldhouse. It was winter 2012, less than a year after Stevens, then the coach at the tiny Indianapolis school, had led Bulldogs to their second consecutive NCAA championship game. I was with a friend who knew Stevens a little and wanted to say hello. I was surprised Stevens had agreed to meet us. Most college coaches don’t have time for such things, especially in the middle of the season with practice barely more than an hour away. But as we approached the gym door, I could see a familiar face peering through the glass. Brad Stevens? The doors were locked and he didn’t want to make us wait in the cold, he explained, as he let us inside. He took us to his office, a drab room by the opulent standards of big-time college basketball. The ceiling leaked. He sat on a couch, not a particularly plush one, and acted as if he was in heaven. As Stevens chatted, asking as much about us as we were about him, I was struck by how unpretentious he seemed. He was like no other top college coach I had come across. Here was a man who had nearly won back-to-back national championships at a school outside the sport’s major conferences and yet he was making none of our conversation about himself. Top college coaches make everything about themselves. I think about that afternoon a lot as I watch Stevens coach the Boston Celtics, who are into the Eastern Conference finals for a second straight postseason against the Cleveland Cavaliers with Game 1 of the best-of-seven-games seires tipping off on Sunday. What the 41-year-old has done in transitioning from a college coach to NBA coach is not completely unique. John Calipari and Rick Pitino both went from college to the pros with modest success. But they, like most who have tried the switch in recent decades, ran back to the safety of college. College coaches don’t make good NBA coaches. Because their world is recruiting teenagers around 30-game seasons, they are uptight. Every game is like a playoff game. They often are yelling: at their players, at their assistant coaches, at the referees. NBA players don’t listen to screaming coaches. Their seasons are too long, the wear on their body too great. The men who make the best NBA coaches are those who make everything about their players and not themselves. There is nothing that says Stevens should be a series away from the NBA finals. The Celtics went into this season with a team that had finals-caliber talent, built around high-priced free-agent signings Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Then Hayward and Irving got hurt and yet Boston is still here, led not by stars but by a backup point guard, Terry Rozier, and the dependable post man Al Horford. While so much of the talk this postseason has been about Cleveland’s LeBron James and how he has carried the Cavaliers through the first two rounds of the playoffs, Stevens and the Celtics might be the NBA’s best story right now. While James has been nothing short of jaw-dropping these last few weeks, the Celtics have been just as astounding in the way they tore apart the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round, beating a more talented team in five games. Yet more impressive than the result was the fashion in which Boston dismantled Philadelphia, holding Sixers rookie star Ben Simmons to just one point in Game 2. There were times Philadelphia, who had entered the playoffs on a 16-game winning streak, looked utterly lost. That was no accident. “I think (Stevens) observes a lot better,” former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant recently told Chris Mannix’s Fox Sports Radio show, when asked what separates Stevens from other NBA coaches. “He observes the game, the flow of the game. And the tendencies. He can look at players and their tendencies. And then you can file that away.” An example, Bryant said, was the play that won Game 3, one in which Stevens sent all the Celtics away from the basket, leaving Horford to catch a lob pass that he dropped in to turn a one-point Sixers lead into a Boston victory. “I had to laugh,” Bryant said. “He just pulled everybody up. It was prime misdirection. … He used Philly’s aggressiveness and youth against them. He knew they were going to be aggressive defensively, he knew they were going to overplay and now you have Horford on the backside. He’s able to look at the game and make adjustments on the fly. He’s a great coach, man.” It is widely accepted that the league’s top two coaches right now are San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich and Golden State’s Steve Kerr. Both are masters at building cultures that support their players, that encourage unselfishness. In Stevens’s four seasons coaching the Celtics he has slowly worked his way to that level. He might have reached it faster had he not had the misfortune of twice facing James in playoff series: the first round in 2015 and the conference finals last year. This year’s Cavaliers are not like others in recent seasons. While James is having one of the great playoff runs of all time, the rest of the team is vulnerable. If Stevens can pull this patched-together group of Celtics past James and into the finals, people will have to notice. It might be one of the greatest feats of coaching the NBA has seen in some time. The other day, while looking for something that described Stevens coaching style, I came across a podcast interview he recorded for the Positive Coaching Alliance. In the interview he was asked how he let his players know he was working as hard as them. “My goal is to simplify their lives with regard to the game of basketball,” he said. “When we enter practice I don’t want to waste their time, I want to get in and out of the gym as soon as possible. To do that you have to spend a lot of time thinking about the right way to go about your practice or the game prep … so they have the right amount of information: not too much, not too little.” A remarkable thought in a world where most coaches make everything about themselves. Stevens never has and now he is on the brink of one of the NBA’s greatest coaching jobs ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/11/formula-one-lewis-hamilton-mercedes-future-career","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:06:42Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton at a crossroads as he contemplates life beyond F1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/11/formula-one-lewis-hamilton-mercedes-future-career","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/11/formula-one-lewis-hamilton-mercedes-future-career","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton at a crossroads as he contemplates life beyond F1","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From boy to world champion, Lewis Hamilton’s journey has been strikingly singular in its course – his life dedicated to, and defined by, motor racing. He has reaped the rewards with four Formula One titles and fame and fortune, their trappings and burdens have followed, but competing has remained fundamental. Now he is contemplating the bigger picture – life beyond racing. The future looms large and long and it is unsurprising his decision on when to embrace it, the biggest of his career, is being given the same attention he devotes to driving. Hamilton is at a crossroads. He first raced karts when he was six years old, was taken on by McLaren at 13 and made his debut for them in F1 in 2007. Now at Mercedes, 33 years old and in his 12th season in the sport, the British driver knows he could go on to take more titles but could yet choose to hang up his gloves for good. Hamilton has still to sign a new contract with Mercedes. A renewal with the team on a one- or two-year basis still seems the most likely option but he was once again tight-lipped on the situation at the Spanish Grand Prix. “When it’s signed, it’s signed,” he said. His body language and his slow, considered answers to queries, indicating a reluctance to make anything public on a very personal decision. Before the season began the impression was the deal was all but done. Three months on, his future remains opaque and he has become explicit about the import of what is likely to be his final deal. “The next contract is probably the most important one in my career,” he said in Bahrain. “The decision, how long you want to commit to being in F1, is becoming more and more important to me, being that I’m in the latter end of my career. It is one not to be rushed into and I will not be rushed into it.” He has no fear of calling it a day, with well-documented interests in music and fashion he is eager to pursue, but there is still racing to be done. He stands amid exceptional company with four world championships. It is one more than his hero Ayrton Senna, equal to Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel and one fewer than Juan Manuel Fangio. After the Argentinian, only the seven-times champion Michael Schumacher has more – a record it was widely assumed would never be reached. Hamilton has insisted he does not chase statistics but he is a knowledgeable student of the sport and has admitted that equalling Fangio would be an achievement in which he would take great pleasure. He has every chance of doing so. Hamilton is leading Vettel by four points this season – one of them almost certainly will make it to five titles and the Mercedes driver opened the weekend in Barcelona well. Second fastest in first practice behind his team-mate Valtteri Bottas, he was then quickest in the afternoon session, in front of Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo with Vettel in fourth. Beyond this season looms the edifice of Schumacher’s success. Hamilton has said he has no ambition to match the German but is intelligent enough to know setting such targets can only lead to being regarded as a failure if they are not reached. If Schumacher’s record is on, Hamilton knows enough not to talk about it but it is hard to imagine he has not considered it. With a fifth title this year, that once impossible target of seven looks reachable and for a driver at the peak of his powers, absolutely achievable. Other factors over which he has little control also play their part. F1 is in the process of reinventing itself, with new rules and commercial agreements with the teams set for 2021. Hamilton has been clear that how these changes impact on the sport will be a factor in his decision. As will the performance of Mercedes. He has enjoyed remarkable success but to commit to continuing in the sport he needs to be confident he has a competitive car. However, this year Mercedes have been caught and eclipsed by Ferrari, they have yet to optimise the car’s performance and it has been frustrating for Hamilton. Which raises perhaps the most unlikely scenario but one which remains possible – to end his career with Ferrari. It is improbable Vettel would want him as a colleague or that the team would want to manage two such forceful personalities across their garage. Yet it is not out of the question and while Hamilton has said he has not spoken to any team except Mercedes he will be aware of the prestige that winning for the sport’s oldest and most famous competitor carries. The former driver Johnny Herbert closed his 12-year career in F1 after his honest assessment he was no longer enjoying racing but he believes Hamilton has more to come. “I do think he can go for Michael’s record,” he said. “He is in his prime but he is at the crossroads. For him to achieve that he has got to be in the right place and that goes to motivation. Do I have that chance? Is it realistic? That is what he will be looking at. I would be very surprised if he said: ‘Bang, I am out now’.” Hamilton is no stranger to making important decisions. Six years ago when he chose to leave McLaren for Mercedes it stunned the paddock but proved to be an inspired move. John Watson told the Guardian at the time it was “like a kid growing up and leaving home” and now Hamilton is giving the conclusion to a remarkable journey as much consideration. “It’s just my future,” he said in Barcelona. “It’s how long I want to go and what I want to do, and how long I plan to be here. That’s why I’m taking my time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/11/corbyn-condemns-eu-withdrawal-plan-as-whitehall-power-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T15:50:06Z","webTitle":"Corbyn condemns EU withdrawal plan as 'Whitehall power grab'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/corbyn-condemns-eu-withdrawal-plan-as-whitehall-power-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/corbyn-condemns-eu-withdrawal-plan-as-whitehall-power-grab","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn condemns EU withdrawal plan as 'Whitehall power grab'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has condemned as a “power grab” the UK government’s plans to share powers between Whitehall and the devolved administrations after Brexit, despite Welsh Labour agreeing to the deal two weeks ago. On a visit to Glasgow on Friday afternoon, the UK Labour leader echoed the phrase used consistently by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, during the long-running dispute over how to jointly manage areas such as genetically modified crops, fishing quotas and farm payments after Brexit. The Welsh Labour government left Sturgeon unexpectedly isolated last month after agreeing to a consultative mechanism with UK ministers, but on Friday Corbyn described the UK government’s behaviour as unacceptable. MSPs from the SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens are expected to reject the EU withdrawal bill when it comes before Holyrood on Tuesday, increasing pressure on Theresa May after she suffered a series of defeats on her Brexit plans in the House of Lords this week. Corbyn said: “I’m very happy that the Scottish Labour party will be voting against [the bill] because frankly there is a power grab going on by Whitehall on the EU withdrawal. What they’re doing is taking powers from Brussels that ought to go to Scotland, Wales and the regions and instead pooling them in Whitehall. That is unacceptable to us.” In an implicit acknowledgement of Welsh Labour’s differing position, Corbyn said: “Devolution sometimes throws up interesting answers. That is what devolution is about: people making their own decision. But as far as I am concerned there should be the maximum devolution from EU withdrawal for Scotland and Wales.” Speaking with Corbyn at a shipbuilding heritage centre in Govan, the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said that he was “quite relaxed” about the Welsh government’s position, although his own party would “almost certainly” vote to reject the EU withdrawal bill next week. The Labour leader used his trip to Glasgow to call for all navy shipbuilding contracts to remain in the UK, describing current government policy that non-combat vessels can be built overseas as “trashing” shipbuilding tradition. His visit comes as candidate selections are under way across Scotland in 20 marginal Westminster seats that will be critical to Labour’s success at the next general election. While Scottish Labour has not experienced the same level of factionalism in these selections as seen south of the border, party moderates are deeply concerned about the fate of the disability rights campaigner Pam Duncan, who came within 1,000 votes of unseating her SNP rival in Glasgow North at last year’s general election but now faces a selection challenge from Agnes Tolmie, a former chair of Unite in Scotland. Duncan, who has introduced Corbyn on previous visits to Glasgow, backed Anas Sarwar against the leftwinger Richard Leonard in last autumn’s Scottish Labour leadership contest. One senior Scottish Labour source said: “Anyone in the Labour party who believes we should oust Pam as our candidate should question if they’re in the right party. Jeremy Corbyn’s manifesto recognised there is more to do until parliament reflects the society it serves, so these manoeuvres against Pam are a betrayal of our cause.” Next Monday, nominations open for the Scottish Labour deputy leadership contest, with the expectation that moderates will avoid putting up a challenger to Corbyn ally and the shadow Scottish secretary, Lesley Laird, to avoid another public split over Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/12/crave-review-julie-cunningham-dance-sarah-kane-play-barbican-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Crave review – Julie Cunningham dances in the darkness of Sarah Kane's play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/12/crave-review-julie-cunningham-dance-sarah-kane-play-barbican-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/12/crave-review-julie-cunningham-dance-sarah-kane-play-barbican-london","fields":{"headline":"Crave review – Julie Cunningham dances in the darkness of Sarah Kane's play","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Horrors haunt the text of Crave, the 1998 play by Sarah Kane in which four individuals (named A, B, C and M) speak in fragmented voices about the traumas that have left them damaged and bereft. Rape, madness and a hint of paedophilic abuse are present in their stories. And when Julie Cunningham announced her decision to create a danced adaptation of the play, you couldn’t help but imagine its potential for physical excess. Cunningham doesn’t so much translate the text into dance as create a new element in which its words can move and breathe. Her subtle, evocative strategy is to have the four female dancers circling and mirroring the four female actors as they perform their roles. Sometimes the choreography animates the space between the performers: angular clusters of dance that curdle the atmosphere, or drawn-out balances suggestive of quiet desolation. Sometimes it echoes the cadences of the text, catching its glimmers of wit and its drifting uncertainties. On rare occasions, it becomes an active player. As Anna Martine Freeman relives A’s thwarted love affair, Cunningham butts and pummels her violently, becoming both adversary and alter ego. If there’s a flaw in this finely conceived production, it’s mostly due to issues in the text, as its final 10 minutes circle through a series of false endings, and Kane’s complex, compelling characters can feel like burdensome company. But Cunningham creates her own powerful coda as, one by one, the woman exit the space and two dancers remain – each locked in a solitary space but seeking out one last ray of light on the darkening stage.

The English title she has attached to it is “Treat Me Like Fire”. Actually, I think the simple translation “Players” is better. It’s an old-school lowlife adventure in the Paris underworld of gambling, co-written by Romain Compingt and Julien Guetta with Monge herself, clearly inspired at one level by Jacques Audiard, and further back by movies such as Melville’s Bob Le Flambeur and Godard’s Bande à Part. There’s also a classic tour-guide sequence around the illegal casino, with clued-in narrative voiceover, the camera roaming around and noticing all the scams and dodges going on, invisible to the outsider: maybe a little of Ocean’s Eleven here. Generic it might be, but Monge brings a headlong energy and gusto to this picture, siphoning off the unwholesome addictive buzz of gambling into her film. Her leads, Tahar Rahim and Stacy Martin, are on very good form. Martin is Ella, a conscientious but bored waitress working in a busy Paris restaurant owned by her dad. One night, a young guy has the effrontery to waltz into the kitchen via the staff-only entrance and start helping her carry wine-cases around. This is the fast-talking, broad-smiling Abel, played by an extremely well cast Rahim. He asks for a job, gets a trial and seems to be an experienced restaurant worker, quick to learn the ropes. Ella is pleased in spite of herself by his charm, particularly his intuitive guessing-game: figuring out what the patrons are thinking, and perhaps what she is thinking as well. Not until it’s too late does Ella realise that she has entrusted him with access to the cash register. Abel, with the boiling need of addiction inside him, wants that fistful of cash to play at the illegal gambling club. And he has another, stranger need: to seduce Ella into the same thirst, to jab the needle of gambling into her pristine arm. She goes with him, has an extraordinary streak of beginner’s luck which splits her sulky face into an ear-to-ear grin, and is lost for ever. The pair embark on a ruinous amour fou, and Abel introduces her to the third wheel of their relationship: his sweet-natured cousin Nacim (Karim Leklou). Nacim is a mechanic who facilitates Abel’s side-interest in drag-racing, and also his general wingman and enabler. Of course, the awful spectre of loss looms, along with the much-feared debt collector Diako (Jean-Michel Correia) who is to force Ella into a new, sinister racket, involving the 12-step programmes for gambling addicts, of which Ella is now very much one. Abel is a sociopath, a parasite, a bipolar character who can drink and gamble and talk and seduce all night and into the next morning on the euphoric high of winning. But then he is deeply depressed, all but unable to speak, looking terrible. There is an interesting scene showing the pair’s wide-eyed excitement after a gambling splurge, back in Ella’s kitchen, taking wodges of cash they had almost forgotten about from every pocket. (Bryce Carlson’s gambling classic Blackjack for Blood has a very similar description.) It is a kind of erotic undressing that is of course the prelude to sex. Weirdly, Martin reminded me quite a lot of Lili Taylor in Abel Ferrara’s vampire movie The Addiction. Apart from everything else, Abel is a swindler, and like all long-term conmen he is compulsive, a method-actor of self-delusion, whose duplicity controls him rather than the other way around. He does, however, have a rational sense of keeping open the option of tricking his lovers and friends out of their cash so that he can, if necessary, vanish into the Paris streets. Monge has created a satisfying drama of doomed obsession, the gambler’s thrill that staves off, for a few moments, a weariness with life. It’s a film with, as they say, something of the night about it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/15/classical-composers-unfairly-tainted-vd-venereal-disease-rumours-book","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"Classical composers unfairly tainted by STD rumours, book claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/15/classical-composers-unfairly-tainted-vd-venereal-disease-rumours-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/15/classical-composers-unfairly-tainted-vd-venereal-disease-rumours-book","fields":{"headline":"Classical composers unfairly tainted by STD rumours, book claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A retired surgeon’s research into the deaths of 70 of the best-known classical composers has led him to conclude that many of them were unfairly tainted with reputations for “venereal disease, alcoholism or sexual impropriety”. Jonathan Noble, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, has reviewed material – including letters and diaries where symptoms and ailments are detailed – relating to Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Beethoven and many others, and found that “an awful lot of them have been slighted by music critics and biographers”. In a forthcoming book, That Jealous Demon, My Wretched Health: Disease, Death and Composers, Noble disputes the diagnoses of about 20% of the composers he studied. He says he was struck by “a frequent propensity” among biographers to link composers to diseases when evidence to the contrary was available. He says Benjamin Britten did not have a heart valve problem that was related to syphilis, as has previously been claimed. “The evidence for that is scant,” Noblesays. The claim was based on hearsay and an elderly doctor who “had nothing to do with Britten’s care”. Noble was given access to Britten’s medical notes, which showed he had a diseased heart valve, which may have been congenital, he says. “The list of composers who had syphilis is short. The list of composers said to have had syphilis is enormous,” Noble told the Guardian. A former orthopaedic surgeon, Noble has treated international cricketers, Manchester United footballers and professional musicians and dancers. Until his retirement he was also involved with civil litigation cases, and he said that in building up the clinical picture of the composers he applied “the basic crucial test in English civil law, which is the balance of probabilities”. Where possible, Noble also pored over existing medical records. Having analysed the evidence forensically, he criticises music historians who have made assumptions without consulting medical professionals. He did not find serious evidence for Tchaikovsky, Schubert, Mozart, Brahms, Britten or Beethoven having been alcoholic, despite alternative claims. He says: “If you’re a true alcoholic, there’s no way you can go around composing operas, symphonies or string quartets.” Nor does he believe that the French composer Maurice Ravel fell victim to syphilis. That was based on a nurse’s claim to have seen his blood report many years after he had died. Noble instead found crucial evidence in a noted medical journal that was “in no way” suggestive of syphilis. He believes Schubert is one of only six of the major composers who had “assured cases” of syphilis. “Few, if any, others should be added on a balance of probabilities, despite alternative mythology.” He goes on to say: “We all like a little bit of the salacious now and again.” But he concludes that too many composers’ reputations have been unfairly tarnished by scandalous commentary based on flimsy evidence: “This tendency to advance the potentially salacious, especially VD or alcohol, can render an awful disservice to the reputations of great men who deserve better.” He adds: “The literature regarding the illnesses of Beethoven and the death of Mozart are enormous ... the vast majority of it is sheer nonsense.” Noting that in the cases of Mozart and Beethoven more than 100 diagnoses have previously been advanced, he criticises the “appalling” character assassination of the latter by the 20th-century musicologist Ernest Newman: “A century after Beethoven’s death, Newman declared him to have been syphilitic, a drunkard and a ruthless cheat, allegations … quoted over subsequent years. The problem is that, once a careless or inappropriate statement attaches to a personality, it sticks like proverbial mud.” Ultimately, Noble says, the great composers have done so much to enlighten people: “It’s a pity that other people have rushed around slagging them off when we actually are the custodians of their reputation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:30:10Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Nimbus-B satellite was almost a disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/16/weatherwatch-nimbus-b-satellite-was-almost-a-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Nimbus-B satellite was almost a disaster","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Weather satellites transformed forecasting in the 1960s. By watching weather systems evolve in real time, meteorologists could predict storms and save lives. But 50 years ago, a nuclear-powered weather satellite threatened disaster. The Nimbus-B, launched on 18 May 1968, was to be the third in its series. The launch went terribly wrong. An installation fault caused the control system to go haywire, and the rocket carrying Nimbus-B veered in the wrong direction. The satellite had nuclear power packs filled with radioactive plutonium; if Nimbus-B broke up in the atmosphere, it could spread contamination over a wide area. Mission control ordered the rocket to self-destruct, and the flight ended after two minutes with Nimbus-B plunging into the Pacific less than 100 miles from Los Angeles. A huge recovery operation was launched to retrieve the dangerous, and extremely valuable, nuclear power packs. Six months later, divers recovered the corroded remains of Nimbus from the sea bed. The intact nuclear power packs were refurbished and launched on Nimbus-3. Modern weather satellites rely purely on solar arrays for their electricity. While there are still occasional launch failures, there is no risk now of radioactive fallout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/may/12/how-can-i-beat-the-burglars-alarm","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T06:00:25Z","webTitle":"How can I beat the burglars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/12/how-can-i-beat-the-burglars-alarm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/12/how-can-i-beat-the-burglars-alarm","fields":{"headline":"How can I beat the burglars?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

It was never clear exactly how it could make you lose weight, but “longer” and “tauter” sounded a lot like “thinner”. Dancers did it because it was one of the only things you could do with a ton of historic injuries; those of us who had never done enough exercise to amass any injuries did it because dancers did. Reformer pilates is a little more recent, as a craze, a lot more involved, in terms of hardware, and a lot more expensive. (The class I went to, in Clapham, south London, was £21 for an hour, which would make me think twice. Or maybe I’m just tight.) The hardware is a sprung bench (no giant beach ball here). You lie on it, there are straps you can put your legs in, straps you can put your arms in, and five springs of varying strength, which determine the difficulty of each exercise. Its peculiar design enables you to do things you wouldn’t – without leg straps, a movable bench and some spring – be able to do, like a shoulder stand. There’s one piece of equipment with a frame over the top, in which you can get practically upside down and feel like an acrobat. It’s important to remember that your human strength hasn’t changed, and no self-respecting circus would employ you. I went with two friends, though luckily they were behind me, so I didn’t have to measure my failings against their success. You start off like a ballerina in stirrups, pointing your toes and flexing your legs towards different parts of the room. The instructor had a very evolved sense of direction, in which – so far as I could make out – she was alone. “Legs towards the high street! Shoulders up, legs towards the south wall.” Horizontal, and trying to move multiple limbs at once, I can just about remember which way is up. The concept of north is a world away. We were basically just watching each other and copying whoever seemed the most certain. It is all very hard on the muscles: controlled, sustained anything, if you keep at it for six minutes, will kill your hamstrings or anything else involved. About halfway through, the standing-on-the-bench commences, which seems as if it will be easier, because it looks it. One foot on the static part of the bench, one on the moving part, you slide your working foot in and out like a character in an 80s computer game of warrior bearing but limited skills. It turns out who knew? – that this is hard, too. The “reformer” element adds complexity and unexpectedness, which makes the time go faster but doesn’t make it feel any easier. I had the vague expectation of a mindfulness component, mainly because the kind of people who like pilates also like yoga. But this is not an activity in which you can drift off and connect with the true you. It requires the same level of concentration as driving on a motorway at the same time as having an argument; which is in itself is quite mentally cleansing. I’d go regularly if I had a pilates buddy; without, it’s a bit ponderous.

Perhaps Apple laid the foundations in 1997 with its famous Think Different campaign, but things have since gone up a notch: in 2010, Diesel blurted out perplexing offerings such as “Smart had one good idea and that idea was stupid”. Then came Zoopla with its “Smart knows” campaign. Now we’re informed by Ireland’s flag carrier that “Smart flies Aer Lingus”. Who are these people called Smart and how can we avoid sitting next to them on our next flight? Today’s language-mangling ad campaigns run the greasy gamut from the somewhat confusing “Live your unexpected Luxembourg” to the head-scratching “Start your impossible”. “In adland, we don’t call it language-mangling, we call it ‘Language DJing’ or ‘Langling’,” jokes Alex Myers, founder of agency Manifest. “In reality it’s just lazy creative work. Copywriting is a lost art. Ad agencies need to ‘Think more good’.” Eagle-eyed bad-ad fans can quickly notice patterns emerging: “finding” something and it being “amazing” appear with the same clockwork regularity as Love Island contestants on Instagram. See, for instance, Rightmove’s “Find your happy” and Visit Wales’s “Find your epic”. Or Lexus’s “Experience amazing” and Deliveroo’s “Eat more amazing”. Clearly these odd turns of phrase are partially derived from the language of social media, while pandering to the notion of being easily turned into hashtags. But wouldn’t your English teacher have thrown a copy of Mansfield Park at you if you showed this much disdain for adjective and noun deployment? When you see half-baked slogans – such as Hitachi’s “Inspire the next” – taking a mallet to the accepted rules of English, it can seem as if adland has taken a lesson from George’s Marvellous Medicine, and boiled a random concoction of leftover words and ideas together in a pot.

Nokes last week told Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, that she hadn’t had time to investigate revelations in the Guardian that at least 1,000 highly skilled migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain in the UK were wrongly facing deportation. Officials were citing a paragraph of the Immigration Rules designed in part to tackle terrorists and individuals judged to be a threat to national security under the controversial 322(5) section of the Immigration Act. At the committee hearing last week, Cooper asked Nokes: “Why have you not looked into what is happening, to find out how many of these cases are serious fraud cases and how many involve ‘trivial mistakes’?” Nokes replied: “Because there have been only two working days since this issue was flagged up”. However, letters written by Nokes and obtained by the Guardian appear to show she was aware of the issue in February. They also suggest that concerns about the use of 322(5) were among the first issues she was made aware of when she took up theministerial role in January. Asked to respond, the Home Office declined to comment. In the first letter, written to the Conservative MP Alok Sharma on 21 March, Nokes refers to a letter he sent her on 12 February. In the second letter, written to the Labour MP Anneliese Dodds on 13 March, Nokes refers to a letter Dodds sent her on 13 February. Both letters raised the cases of constituents facing deportation under the 322(5) section. In both of her detailed replies, Nokes demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the issue and the individual cases, stating that while she is unable to comment on particular instances, “I can set out in general terms how my officials consider these types of application”. Cooper told the Guardian it was unacceptable for Nokes to mislead the home affairs committee, which “has been given inaccurate information too many times already”. “As I made clear on Tuesday, I was already very troubled that neither a minister nor a senior Home Office official had asked for a review of these cases since I raised the issue in parliament last week. “If, in fact, ministers have known about and been discussing the problem for some time then we need some urgent clarification of the information we were given and an accurate account of what ministers agreed to,” she added. “The Home Office cannot keep providing inaccurate or incomplete information to parliament. We will be following this up to get to the facts.” John Woodcock, an independent committee member who questioned Nokes at the hearing, accused the Home Office of “shambolic incompetence” and said he thought Nokes should be recalled to explain the “glaring contradiction between what she told the committee and the evidence of these letters”. “Such a basic inaccuracy from a minister is a very serious matter whenever it occurs,” said the MP for Barrow and Furness. “But this from Caroline Nokes comes just after Amber Rudd lost her job for giving inaccurate information in what she knew [about the Windrush scandal], and after the permanent secretary was forced to defend one of his senior officials over accusations of lying to parliament alongside Amber Rudd.” He said that 12 years ago the then home secretary, John Reid, declared the Home Office not fit for purpose, “and this lack of competency at the top, which is so clearly manifested by so many individuals being failed by the system, shows that the system is still not fit for purpose”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/may/11/how-can-you-connect-grammar-schools-and-social-mobility-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T13:53:20Z","webTitle":"‘How can you connect grammar schools and social mobility?’: your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/11/how-can-you-connect-grammar-schools-and-social-mobility-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/11/how-can-you-connect-grammar-schools-and-social-mobility-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"‘How can you connect grammar schools and social mobility?’: your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"UK grammar school funding was one of the key issues getting you talking today.

I think the research would be enhanced, like Worcester sauce upon ones cheese on toast, if it included the stings from plants which also have their own virtue. Also there are levels of intent. I recall a Vespula germanica sting from a lost soul who was probably dying anyway but thought that one last sustained attack upon an unsuspecting Englishman was perhaps the honourable way to go.

I mean, who in their right mind would? It was a fun pain while I had it.

The prime minister wrote to Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, to apologise unreservedly on behalf of the government for its failings over the case and missed opportunities to end their ordeal. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, read out May’s letter in the Commons as he announced that Boudchar, who was pregnant when the couple were kidnapped, would receive £500,000 compensation for the UK’s role in her treatment. Belhaj has neither sought, nor received, a financial settlement. Boudchar and their 13-year-old son Abderrahim travelled to London and watched from the public gallery as Wright told MPs that, after mediation, the government had reached a full and final settlement with the couple, who had withdrawn their legal claim. In her letter, May admitted the UK should have done more to reduce the risk that the couple could be mistreated, and had wrongly missed opportunities to help them once they were held in the prisons of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. She acknowledged that Britain should have realised sooner that its allies were involved in unacceptable practices, implying criticism of Libya for torture and the CIA’s practice of rendition. Downing Street confirmed that parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) would have full access to all government papers on the Belhaj case for the first time for its inquiry into rendition, which is expected to report later this year. In her letter, which was handed to Belhaj in person by the British ambassador in Istanbul, May said: “It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Boudchar who was pregnant at the time. “The UK government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way. The UK government’s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. “… On behalf of Her Majesty’s government I apologise unreservedly. We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal that you both suffered and our role in it. The UK government has learned many lessons from this period.” The couple have fought for compensation and an apology for more than six years after papers came to light during the Libyan revolution that revealed the role played by British intelligence officers in their kidnapping. They were seized in Thailand in 2004 before being hooded, shackled and flown to one of Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death. He was released six years later. Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant when she was abducted. She was released shortly before giving birth. After receiving the letter, Belhaj told the Guardian: “The wording of the apology was heartfelt. There was a feeling of concern, an admission of the shortcomings, an expression of unreserved apology, lessons learned, admission of failings and an expression of disappointment towards the international partners that I was handed over to. “All of these sentiments that came through in the apology, I welcome them. This is in spite of my belief that the length of time is part of the suffering. That is because you feel that you suffered and endured and were wronged, and then you have to wait for years. But what matters is the result in the end.” He said the responses of MPs was like a balm, and he felt some realised the need for laws to prevent it happening again. “From the very first moment, I insisted that there must be an apology. I never asked for monetary compensation because I don’t want to impose on the taxpayers, and so I can put a quick end to this suffering, but what led us to the courts is the rejection of the demand for an apology. I welcome this step, the acceptance of the apology condition, and I hope this is not repeated with someone else.” Boudchar said after the attorney general’s statement: “I thank the British government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the government’s apology.” Wright told MPs: “There remains a considerable international threat to the UK and our allies and it is important that government and the security and intelligence agencies are able to respond properly so we can keep our country safe. “But it is also important that we should act in line with our values and in accordance with the rule of law. That means that when we get things wrong it is right and just that we should acknowledge it, compensate those affected and learn lessons. I believe this is such a case.” By the beginning of last year, the government had spent £750,000 defending the claim. Wright said no admission of liability had been made by any defendants, which include the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the government. Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the rendition operations, told MPs in 2005 that suggestions the UK was involved in such abuses were “conspiracy theories” and there was no truth in the claims. When documents emerged during the 2011 Libyan revolution showing MI6 had been involved in the kidnap of two of Gaddafi’s opponents, their wives and children, Straw insisted he had not been involved in any wrongdoing. Allen has also maintained his innocence. In a statement issued on Thursday, Straw said he had been responsible for authorising actions to protect national security, including sharing information with foreign governments. Usually, he said, requests such as those for rendition were put in writing and agreed in writing. On this occasion, he had given oral approval, which was permitted in rare cases of great urgency. “I took these responsibilities very seriously. As I have said on many occasions I sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.” Tony Blair was criticised in the Commons for his government’s role in rendition, with Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice spokeswoman, asking whether the case revealed part of the “dark side” of his deal in the desert with Gaddafi in 2004, and the Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh calling on him to apologise. Ken Clarke, the Conservative chairman of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition, said: “Given the fulsome nature of the apology, the question has to be asked why it has taken the government so long to settle this matter, particularly when Mr Belhaj offered to settle the case in 2013 for £3 and an apology? The delay is deeply regrettable.” Fellow Tory Andrew Mitchell called for the UK government to pass on details of the Belhaj apology to US officials examining the conduct of Gina Haspel, who is expected to be confirmed as the next director of the CIA. “It’s important that the attorney general hands his opposite number in Washington the details of this case,” Mitchell said. “The next head of the CIA is currently going through an inquiry process. She was in charge of a black site in Thailand where this poor lady [Boudchar] was held.” David Cameron announced in 2010 that there would be an independent inquiry into allegations of UK involvement in rendition and torture. A damning report was quietly published three years later, just as a jury was reaching its verdict in the Lee Rigby trial. Ministers then handed responsibility for the questions the judge-led inquiry had been unable to answer to the ISC. Sapna Malik, from the law firm Leigh Day which represented Belhaj and Bouchar, said: “Today’s candid apology from the government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal, and is warmly welcomed.” Cori Crider, the lawyer representing the Belhaj family on behalf of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said the extent of the government’s apology was unprecedented. “It’s broader and deeper and more sincere than any apology we have seen from the war on terror,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/10/the-ancient-brit-with-bags-of-grit-how-anglicised-asterix-first-came-to-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T14:23:27Z","webTitle":"T​he Ancient Brit with Bags of Grit?

How anglicised Asterix came to UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Before British readers could properly enjoy Asterix the Gaul and his sweet-natured friend Obelix they had to make do with Little Fred, the Ancient Brit with Bags of Grit, and his sidekick, Big Ed. The crude and little-known anglicisation of a French national hero is shown in an exhibition opening in London on Thursday, exploring the life and work of the writer René Goscinny. There are original artworks, scripts and storyboards, but fans of Asterix might be surprised to see pages from British comics in which the hero is a proud Brit: Little Fred in one, Beric the Bold in another. “They are essentially forgotten now,” said the curator, Joanne Rosenthal. “These were serialised versions of Asterix, which came out in the early to mid-1960s, just after Asterix, in kids’ comics like Valiant, Ranger, Look &amp; Learn.” They are a “a footnote of history” but fascinating nevertheless, particularly since the characters seem slightly different to the ones most people are familiar with. Rosenthal added: “It’s a bit coarser, it is not quite as gentle or soft as the English translations we know.” The Asterix exhibition is at the Jewish Museum and tells the story of Goscinny’s life and career and his biggest success: the creation, with cartoonist Albert Uderzo, of Asterix, the ancient Gaul who, with his friends, took on the might of Roman occupiers in 50BC. The Asterix books have sold 500m copies worldwide, been translated into 150 languages and adapted into 100 films. But the story of Goscinny himself has been underexplored, the museum believes. “Not many people know about Goscinny’s Jewish heritage and it is a very interesting story,” said Rosenthal. “We wanted to tell it.” Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926 to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents. He spent his childhood in Argentina, growing up as a French expat child, before moving to New York in 1945, hoping to make it as a cartoonist. On display is a copy of a 1948 letter to the New Yorker magazine complaining that he had still not heard anything after submitting five cartoons. He never made it in the US. His success came in France with creations including a gunslinger called Lucky Luke, a detective called Dick Dicks, and a taxi driver called Strapontin who will cheerfully go anywhere. In one story he travels to Africa, where he teams up with a gorilla who has taken an intelligence serum and can speak Latin. They go in search of the kidnapped son of Professor Petipois. Asterix was by far the biggest success, with its broad appeal to readers of all ages. It was not low brow or high brow, said Rosenthal. “The humour is very sophisticated and works on so many different levels. There is the slapstick element that younger readers might enjoy, but also the very finely tuned and nuanced cultural references that draw on national mythologies and historical incidents.” The exhibition argues that Goscinny’s Jewishness was important in his work, if not explicitly then subtly. “To a certain extent it is kind of speculation,” said Rosenthal. “But I think the sense of humour, the sense of the outsider, the underdog, the immigrant, that kind of diasporist experience he had is just everywhere in his output in a way it often is with secular Jewish artists and writers.” Asterix in Britain: the Life and Work of René Goscinny is at the Jewish Museum, London NW1, until 30 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/11/have-you-lost-benefits-due-to-surveillance-by-the-and-error-prevention-service","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T09:43:48Z","webTitle":"Have you lost benefits due to surveillance by the fraud and error prevention service?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/11/have-you-lost-benefits-due-to-surveillance-by-the-and-error-prevention-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/11/have-you-lost-benefits-due-to-surveillance-by-the-and-error-prevention-service","fields":{"headline":"Have you lost benefits due to surveillance by the fraud and error prevention service?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A 26-year-old man with multiple sclerosis has been told to pay back thousands of pounds after being deemed not disabled after being under surveillance by the Department for Work and Pensions, despite medical confirmation of his diagnosis. The Fraud and Error Prevention Service, part of the DWP, secretly followed Michael Forsyth in Lanark and concluded he “deliberately misrepresented his needs” after looking through his Facebook account and recording him walking his dog. Forsyth was diagnosed with MS at the age of 20 and was in a wheelchair for his PIP assessment in 2015. “The nature of the illness means I can’t say what I’ll be able to do from day to day,” he says in The Sunday Post. Forsyth has appealed the decision and has a letter confirming his diagnosis from his neurologist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow which details symptoms such as: “worsening leg weakness, arm weakness, dysarthria (speech problems) and double vision”.
