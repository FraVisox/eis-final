How mainstream. Niche streaming services – especially ones that claim to “curate” their offering – are springing up. Some (such as Brown Sugar, which streams Blaxploitation films and films and TV shows aimed at a black audience) are available only in the US, while others (such as the comedy streaming service Seeso) are already closing down. Here are just a few of those on offer. Shudder (£4.99 a month; available in the UK, Ireland, the US and Canada) Live your life in a permanent state of shock, with as much horror – schlocky, classic, comic, international – as you can take. Hayu (£3.99 a month; UK, Ireland and Australia) This reality-TV streaming service features the Kardashians, obviously, plus every flavour of Real Housewife. More niche programmes include Shahs of Sunset and the cosmetic-surgery-gone-wrong show Botched. Mubi (£5.99 a month; worldwide) Every day, an expert-selected movie is added to this service (think classic, independent, global cinema) and another removed. You have 30 days to watch each title, the idea being that you don’t get the same paralysis of choice as you do with the all-you-can-watch services, plus your film-watching life is curated by someone who knows more than you do. (Also consider the British Film Institute’s streaming service, BFI Player.) Yaddo (£3.99 a month; worldwide) An all-documentary network that can be viewed anywhere in the world. It is run by Nick Fraser, formerly the head of the BBC’s Storyville strand. Walter Presents (free; UK) Walter Iuzzolino is that insufferable friend who grew up watching Fellini when you were slackjawed in front of Postman Pat. Admittedly, this makes him a good curator of foreign-language TV and films for this streaming service for lovers of subtitles from Channel 4. Section II (pay as you watch; worldwide) A small but growing site showcasing lesbian drama from around the world, with films available to rent or buy on the site, plus one original series (so far). It also functions as a library of lesbian and queer female films, with links to where to watch them. Dekkoo ($11.99 a month; worldwide) Dedicated to showcasing cinema and TV aimed at gay men, Dekkoo has also moved into original programming via the series Feral, which is set in the US bible belt. Crunchyroll (some free content, premium subscriptions from £4.99 a month; worldwide) Head here for anime, manga and some (mostly Japanese) live-action films. It is also a community, with some lively forums. Spuul (free with ads or $4.99 a month; worldwide) For all the Bollywood you can take, with thousands of hours of films in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil and other regional languages. The Netflix-style site makes it easy to find films by category."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/19/philip-pullman-launches-la-belle-sauvage-sequel-the-book-of-dust-his-dark-materials","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T23:01:07Z","webTitle":"Philip Pullman launches La Belle Sauvage and says sequel is finished","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/19/philip-pullman-launches-la-belle-sauvage-sequel-the-book-of-dust-his-dark-materials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/19/philip-pullman-launches-la-belle-sauvage-sequel-the-book-of-dust-his-dark-materials","fields":{"headline":"Philip Pullman launches La Belle Sauvage and says sequel is finished","bodyText":"After waiting 17 years for his follow-up to the His Dark Materials trilogy, fans of Philip Pullman won’t have to wait as long next time, he revealed on Wednesday. He was speaking ahead of Thursday’s midnight launch of La Belle Sauvage, the first volume in a new trilogy, The Book of Dust, where he told press the second volume was already complete. Speaking in the Oxford’s 17th-century Bodleian library, which itself features in his hugely anticipated – and heavily embargoed – novel, Pullman also told press that La Belle Sauvage is a darker book than its predecessors. Quipping that novel, the first in The Book of Dust trilogy, should be called “His Darker Materials”, Pullman said that as an author, “I’ve got older and perhaps more cynical, closer to despair”. “It is a darker book, I don’t deny that, but that’s the story that came to me and wanted to be told.”La Belle Sauvage’s publication is being marked with special late openings, parties, signings and read-alongs in bookshops around the UK. It is expected to be one of the year’s biggest sellers, after it topped Amazon’s charts when it was announced in February and been tipped by booksellers to head the bestseller lists this Christmas. The novel – which tells the story of how his heroine Lyra came to be living at Oxford’s fictional Jordan College in Northern Lights – has been awaited by fans since The Amber Spyglass was published in 2000. As well as the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead, his daemon Asta and his canoe, La Belle Sauvage, who become Lyra’s protectors after a huge flood, Pullman also introduces a range of new characters to the story, including alethiometer specialist Dr Hannah Relf and the villainous Gerard Bonneville. Returning old favourites include Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon, her father Lord Asriel and mother Mrs Coulter, and Farder Coram. “Lyra is a baby, and being a baby, she is not able to speak or walk, she hasn’t got very much agency, but she’s certainly at the centre of the action. Her very existence forms one of the central McGuffins of the plot,” said Pullman. The author has described the novel as an “equel”, rather than a sequel or prequel, saying that it “doesn’t stand before or after His Dark Materials, but beside it”. On Wednesday, Pullman said that the story would take a step into the future in the next two novels of The Book of Dust trilogy, as well as sharing that he has already finished writing the second, as-yet unnamed instalment. “It continues with a big leap of time, a leap of over 20 years, so in the second we see Lyra as a 20-year-old undergraduate. In the second and third books the characters are adults, so it’s probably natural that it has a bit more of an adult tone,” he said. Asked by a reporter from the Daily Mail how many instances of swearing there were in La Belle Sauvage, Pullman replied wryly that he didn’t know, but “perhaps we ought to have a little insert in the front saying ‘swearwords on page 456, watch out, swear word approaching next page, turn it over very quickly’”. He was clear that, swearwords or not, the novels were open to all comers: “I don’t specify my audience. I have never wanted to do that. I’m grateful to have any audience at all,” he said, adding that he would never give an age range for readers. “I’d much rather launch it on the flood and see what happens to it.” Pullman revealed that the book continues to tackle the question of “that mysterious and troubling substance”, dust, with the trilogy hanging on “the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organisation, which wants to stifle speculation and enquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free”. “It’s the question of consciousness, perhaps the oldest philosophical question of all: are we matter? Or are we spirit and matter? What is consciousness if there is no spirit? Questions like that are of perennial fascination and they haven’t been solved yet, thank goodness,” he said. “I’m still very grateful that scientists have not discovered what dark matter is. I was holding my breath and crossing my fingers they wouldn’t while I was writing His Dark Materials. They still don’t know and I’m very happy about that.” As he began to tell Lyra and Malcolm’s story, Pullman said he drew from his own experiences walking Oxford’s rivers and canals, as well as “looking at maps of the city, which is laced through and through with water”. Malcolm, who is the son of an innkeeper and set to leave school at 13, is introduced to literature by Dr Relf. “She does for him what somebody did for me, when I was 10,” said Pullman. “An old lady in the village took an interest in me and invited me to borrow books from her library. I read HG Wells and Tarzan. That was a very generous thing to do and I thought of her when I was writing about Hannah.” The League of St Alexander he said, which recruits children to spy on their parents, neighbours and friends, draws from Soviet Russia, where children were encouraged to do the same, while Oakley Street, his version of the secret service, has a more literary source. “All I know about the secret service, I got from John le Carré – I’ve stolen it from him.” He revealed he had particularly enjoyed writing the villainous Bonneville. “Is he a psychopath? He’s a nasty piece of work. I enjoyed him very much. There’s nothing more fun than writing about villains. I loved writing Mrs Coulter in His Dark Materials and greatly enjoyed him in this,” he said. Just like Lyra, said Pullman, Malcolm is an ordinary child. “There’s nothing divinely gifted about them. They’re not special children. When I was a teacher, there was a Malcolm in every class and a Lyra in every class. I didn’t base them on actual children, but I based them on the notion of children that I formed during that period. Children are capable of extraordinary feats of courage, of affection and determination and I was glad to discover Malcolm wandering in my mind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/20/lab-notes-neutron-stars-collide-sexism-and-syphilis-the-week-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T11:30:07Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: neutron stars collide; sexism and syphilis – the week in science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/20/lab-notes-neutron-stars-collide-sexism-and-syphilis-the-week-in-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/20/lab-notes-neutron-stars-collide-sexism-and-syphilis-the-week-in-science","fields":{"headline":"Lab notes: neutron stars collide; sexism and syphilis – the week in science","bodyText":"This week’s biggest stories A new frontier for science opened on Monday, when astronomers around the world witnessed neutron stars colliding – and resolved the debate about where gold and platinum come from.

The gimmicky cosmetic lenses should only be sold by a registered optician or doctor who is qualified to provide after-care advice, but are increasingly sold cheaply and illegally online, in shops and on market stalls. Optical experts said wearers could suffer infection or even permanent sight loss from the lenses, with an even higher risk of “devastating effects” for those who share them with friends, wear the same pair year after year, or store them in water. They are often referred to as zero-powered lenses, as unlike standard contact lenses they do not correct the wearer’s vision. A recent Omnibus survey reveals that 7% of the general public have worn zero-powered contact lenses, but the proportion is significantly higher (21%) among those aged 25- to 34-years-old. The decorative lenses have led to a worrying spike in admissions to A&amp;E units in the UK around the Halloween period. “Each year we treat patients, including children under 16, who have developed eye conditions after wearing cosmetic contact lenses,” said Badrul Hussain, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields eye hospital. “Not knowing the basics of using contact lenses safely can put you at higher risk of developing painful eye injuries, infections and, in the worst cases, risk of permanent sight loss.” Hussain said the cornea – the clear window at the front of the eye – is delicate and can be scratched easily by inexperienced contact lens wearers. This can expose the eye to organisms that can cause nasty infections, which in extreme cases can result in permanently impaired, or loss of, vision. Vicky McDermott, chief executive of the General Optical Council, said: “When worn safely, the risks associated with cosmetic contact lenses are low. However, when lenses are sold illegally, wearers are denied important safety checks and advice, putting them at risk of serious damage to their eyes. Partygoers can better protect their sight by buying their lenses from a qualified professional.” In parts of Wales, trading standards officers have been working with retailers to improve legal compliance around decorative contact lens sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/19/mushroom-end-world-anna-lowenhaupt-tsing-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T09:30:02Z","webTitle":"The Mushroom at the End of the World review – life in capitalist ruins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/19/mushroom-end-world-anna-lowenhaupt-tsing-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/19/mushroom-end-world-anna-lowenhaupt-tsing-review","fields":{"headline":"The Mushroom at the End of the World review – life in capitalist ruins","bodyText":"Written in “a riot” of short chapters, “like the flushes of mushrooms that come up after rain”, Anna Tsing’s highly original study explores ruined industrial landscapes and precarious livelihoods in this age of economic decline and globalisation. She travels the world in search of matsutake mushrooms and the people who forage for them in the forests of Oregon, Yunnan, Lapland and Japan, where they have become “the most valuable mushrooms on earth”, prized as gourmet treats and exclusive gifts. It’s said that after Hiroshima was obliterated by an atomic bomb, “the first living thing to emerge from the blasted landscape was a matsutake mushroom”. They only grow in forests disturbed by humans and were first mentioned in an eighth-century Japanese poem celebrating “the wonder of autumn aroma”. The smell is unique, though Tsing admits most Europeans can’t stand it: “It’s not an easy smell. It’s disturbing.” This book brilliantly turns the commerce and ecology of this most rare mushroom into a modern parable of post-industrial survival and environmental renewal. • The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins is published by Princeton.

The latest additions to its catalogue are this 20-year-old recording of Feldman’s Trio for piano, violin, and viola from 1980, as well as a disc devoted to two of the late piano works, Triadic Memories and Piano, played by John Snijders, who is also the pianist in the Ives Ensemble. Even though it is relatively short by the norms of late Feldman, the Trio is one of the less frequently recorded of his final works. Clocking in at 76 minutes, the Ives performance is relatively swift – a version on the Mode label, released seven years ago, lasts almost half as long again – but that only reinforces the sense of unease underpinning the whole work, with its unstable rhythms, constant dissonances, and repeatedly thwarted cadences. It demonstrates what a mysterious, unsettling piece the Trio is, with moments of rapt beauty alongside music that either obsesses on a single chord or comes close to disintegrating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/20/cbi-calls-for-commission-impact-artificial-intelligence-jobs-business-productivity-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T05:01:45Z","webTitle":"Artificial intelligence commission needed to predict impact, says CBI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/20/cbi-calls-for-commission-impact-artificial-intelligence-jobs-business-productivity-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/20/cbi-calls-for-commission-impact-artificial-intelligence-jobs-business-productivity-growth","fields":{"headline":"Artificial intelligence commission needed to predict impact, says CBI","bodyText":"Britain’s biggest employers are calling for a commission to examine the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs. Amid predictions of a workplace revolution threatening one in five jobs across the UK, the CBI is urging Theresa May to launch the commission from early 2018. It said companies and trade unions should be involved and the commission should help to set out ways to increase productivity and economic growth as well looking into the impact of AI. The business lobby group said almost half of firms were planning to devote resources to AI, while one in five had already invested in the technology in the past year. Companies are increasingly using computers to scour vast datasets in order to spot inefficiencies, while they are also employing machines to control the flow of activity in warehouses and factories and to take meter readings. Accountancy firm PwC warned in March that more than 10 million workers may be at risk of being replaced by automation. While robots could lead to job losses, they could also present opportunities for workers to move into more fulfilling and productive roles. The TUC has been urging the government to use the productivity gains from automation to benefit workers, calling for the reversal of planned changes to the state pension age and more investment in training for employees. The CBI suggests innovative firms grow twice as fast – both in terms of employment and sales – and that adopting new technology can get the best out of workers. As much as 50% of labour productivity can be driven by innovation, according to the CBI. Investment in technology could help bolster Britain’s sputtering record on labour productivity, which is among the worst in the G7 and is failing to improve in line with expectations since the financial crisis. The Office for Budget Responsibility was forced to downgrade its estimates for labour productivity growth last week, wiping out about two-thirds of the government’s £26bn budget surplus from 2017 to 2021. The development will come as a blow to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as it will remove headroom for his public spending plans before the budget next month. Despite the potential for technology to increase productivity, firms are cautious about investing owing to uncertainty over Brexit. Growth in business investment was flat in the three months to June, the latest official figures show."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/saudi-scholars-to-vet-teaching-of-prophet-muhammad-to-curb-extremism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T14:38:53Z","webTitle":"Saudi scholars to vet teaching of prophet Muhammad to curb extremism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/saudi-scholars-to-vet-teaching-of-prophet-muhammad-to-curb-extremism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/18/saudi-scholars-to-vet-teaching-of-prophet-muhammad-to-curb-extremism","fields":{"headline":"Saudi scholars to vet teaching of prophet Muhammad to curb extremism","bodyText":"Saudi authorities have taken an “unprecedented” step to tackle Islamic extremism by setting up a council of scholars to vet religious teachings around the world. A royal order issued this week by King Salman established a global body of elite scholars based in the holy city of Medina to root out and “eliminate fake and extremist texts”. The King Salman Complex will become a “trusted source of the correct and authenticate [sic] hadith”, said an announcement from the Saudi ministry of culture and information. It described the move as an “unprecedented initiative”. Hadith are sayings, actions and pronouncements of the prophet Muhammad that are additional and complementary to the Qur’an, and a source of guidance for Muslims. The scholars would study hadith “with the purpose of eliminating fake and extremist texts and any texts that contradict the teachings of Islam and justify the committing of crimes, murders and terrorist acts which have no place in Islam, the religion of peace,” said the ministry’s announcement. King Salman, the custodian of the two holy mosques in the cities of Mecca and Medina, appointed Sheikh Mohammed bin Hassan al-Sheikh, a member of the senior scholars council, as chairman of the complex’s scientific council. Members are to be appointed by royal decree. The Saudi authorities have been worried about extremism, both as a domestic threat and as a strain on its relations with the west, since 9/11, said Jane Kinninmont, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. “They would say the accusations are out of date, but they know this issue is their achilles heel in the west. The new leadership in Saudi cares much more about its image and PR than before and is genuinely trying to get to grips with extremism,” she said. Saudi Arabia was also facing international pressure over Yemen, she added. Last month, the UN agreed to set up an independent investigation into alleged abuses of human rights in Yemen by all sides in the three-year civil war. Saudi Arabia is backing Yemen’s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been accused of conducting unlawful airstrikes in Yemen that have killed thousands of civilians and hit schools, hospitals, markets and homes in the neighbouring country’s civil war. Earlier this year, a report from the conservative Henry Jackson Society claimed that Saudi Arabia was promoting and funding extremism in the UK. It said: “Saudi Arabia has, since the 1960s, sponsored a multimillion-dollar effort to export Wahhabi Islam across the Islamic world, including to Muslim communities in the west. “In the UK, this funding has primarily taken the form of endowments to mosques and Islamic educational institutions, which have in turn played host to extremist preachers and the distribution of extremist literature. Influence has also been exerted through the training of British Muslim religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, as well as the use of Saudi textbooks in a number of the UK’s independent Islamic schools.” The Saudi embassy in London said the claims were “categorically false”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-maltese-journalist-media","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T11:05:16Z","webTitle":"Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder shows why hatred of the media is wrong | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-maltese-journalist-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/daphne-caruana-galizia-maltese-journalist-media","fields":{"headline":"Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder shows why hatred of the media is wrong","bodyText":"In the roll-call of unfashionable causes, defence of the MSM – the hated “mainstream media” – surely ranks close to the top. Bashing the press is now a guaranteed applause line on both the right and left. Donald Trump, who last week said it was “frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever they want”, and called for NBC to be stripped of its (nonexistent) broadcasting licence, is only the most obvious example. Before him came Sarah Palin and her diatribes against “the lamestream media”. But the MSM is a favourite target of the left too: witness the Corbynite attacks on the BBC and its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, who famously required the protection of a bodyguard to attend the Labour party conference. This week we have had a brutal reminder of what the mainstream media does – and why we need it. On Monday Malta’s most prominent investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, was murdered when the car she was driving was blown sky high, scattering her body parts across a field. She has been widely described as a blogger, and she did indeed break some of her biggest stories that way. But she was also a columnist for the Malta Independent and its Sunday sister title (her last column appeared on Sunday, opposing the legalisation of cannabis). She was fiercely independent, even a maverick. But she was also part of the mainstream media. Indeed, her most important story, the Panama Papers and its Maltese dimension, came about through the combined heft of a network of mainstream news organisations, including the Guardian. Her murder – motivated, of course, not by some generalised opposition to the media but by the apparent desire of criminals to silence a reporter whose revelations threatened their interests – is a timely and unwanted reminder of the risks journalists like Caruana Galizia take to do their job. As the Guardian notes in its editorial on the killing, the Maltese reporter is the 10th journalist to die this year. The New York Times rightly records that journalists have been jailed in Turkey, and murdered in Russia, India and the Philippines. In the US they are daily denounced as purveyors of “fake news.” But if Caruana Galizia’s death is a reminder of the risks such reporters take, her life is a reminder of the value of their work. She performed an extraordinary service, ferreting out evidence that Malta had become an island mafia state, its elite riddled with corruption, money-laundering, kickbacks and gang violence. Her counterparts provide an equally essential service in their own societies. Think, for example, of the reporting of David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post who has been forensically combing his way through the Trump finances. It was Fahrenthold who established that when the president says he’s given money to charity, it’s best not to take his word for it. Fahrenthold is part of the reviled mainstream media, just as Caruana Galizia was. That’s worth remembering next time an activist site of the far right or far left – dishing out stories that are unchecked, unsourced and, in a word, fake – slams the MSM.

So it’s alarming to learn, as the New York Times reported recently, that smartphones, PCs and computer-controlled machinery are increasingly part of the community’s daily life. There are Amish bakeries that take credit cards. So much for your fantasy – OK, my fantasy – of escaping the hyper-connected world and retreating to a simpler era. If clicking and swiping have got even the Amish addicted, what hope for the rest of us? Except, as Kevin Kelly points out in his book What Technology Wants, the Amish have never been unequivocal shunners of modernity. “Amish lives are anything but anti-technological,” he writes. Visiting Amish communities, he found battery-powered radios, computer-controlled milling machines, solar panels, chemical fertilisers and GM crops. What distinguishes the Amish stance toward any given invention isn’t that they reject it outright; it’s that they start by assuming they don’t want or need it, then adopt it only if they decide it’s in line with their values. Generally, these days, “our default is set to say ‘yes’ to new things,” Kelly notes, whereas for the Amish “the default is set to ‘no’”. Thus cars don’t make the cut, because they encourage people to wander far away, instead of building community close to home. But laptops and smartphones are fine, for some Amish, in certain workplace contexts – though never at home – because the benefits are deemed to outweigh the downsides. I’m not going to argue that we should adopt Amish values, which are largely illiberal, let alone copy their system for determining which technologies are allowed, which essentially means doing whatever the bishops decide. But I agree with Cal Newport, who highlighted Kelly’s work on his blog the other day: isn’t it alarming that the basic Amish logic – adopt a new technology only if it helps you do what you deem important – feels so alien to us? “The Amish are clear about what they value,” he writes, “and new technologies are evaluated by their impact on these values.” It’s not rocket science. (I’m not sure where the Amish stand on rocket science.) Yet most of us are deeply enmeshed in the opposite: we end up gradually adopting new things simply because they’re there. To implement Newport’s philosophy, you might take an inventory of the tech you use and evaluate each item for its real usefulness, working on the assumption that if something can’t justify itself, it’s out. I’ve started that process: I left a bunch of social networks I was barely on, and deleted all but 30 (!) apps from my phone, including email. (I almost never replied via phone anyway.) Yes, it’s only a start. On the other hand, I don’t own a car, so I’m already Amish-ish in that respect. Time to start shopping for a horse and cart. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"inequality/2017/oct/20/ive-been-followed-attacked-spat-on-women-on-feeling-scared-to-walk-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘I’ve been followed, attacked, spat on': women on feeling scared to walk alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/20/ive-been-followed-attacked-spat-on-women-on-feeling-scared-to-walk-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/oct/20/ive-been-followed-attacked-spat-on-women-on-feeling-scared-to-walk-alone","fields":{"headline":"‘I’ve been followed, attacked, spat on': women on feeling scared to walk alone","bodyText":"A Stanford University study of smartphone data has showed that in almost every country in the world, women walk disproportionately fewer steps each day than men. Intrigued by the findings, Talia Shadwell spoke to women about their walking habits. In those conversations, one issue arose again and again: personal safety. Women felt they could not walk as much as they would freely choose to because of concerns that they would be harassed or worse by men. In response to Talia’s piece, women from around the world contacted the Guardian to share their stories: the experiences that led them to think twice about walking alone in the neighbourhoods where they live and work. ‘He grabbed my breast … it infuriates me that it stays with me’ Some 30 years ago I was walking with my dog one morning in woods near my home, within a few hundred yards of a main road. A man came up and asked directions to a nearby village. I began to explain to him when he grabbed one of my breasts, clutching it painfully. My reaction was to shout at him loudly and my dog jumped up at him, at which he fled. I noticed as he fled that he had a large stick with him. All these years later, even with my current dogs, I can’t walk in woods alone. That infuriates me: that the incident stays with me in that way, when it almost certainly doesn’t with my assailant. Sarah, Essex ‘I’ve been followed, attacked, spat on since school days’ I don’t think most men realise how common street harassment is in this country. I’ve been followed home, attacked, spat on, told to smile by men I don’t know, since school days. It’s pretty wearying feeling like you have to be constantly alert. Guardian commenter ‘I saw he was staring straight at me’ It was a beautiful July evening and I decided to go for a walk along the river. I was apprehensive about walking alone but it was still light out and I knew the pedestrian paths would be busy with cyclists, joggers and dog walkers. I hadn’t been walking more than five minutes when I saw a teenage boy sitting on a bench ahead of me. Once I got ahead of him, I turned my head slightly so that he was in my peripheral vision, which is a trick I can only assume women all over the world use. I watched him get on his bike and pedal after me. He went to the left, following the path up a small hill, and then riding his bike parallel to me through a few scattered trees. Then I could see he had gotten off his bike and as I came around the other side of a tree I saw he was staring straight at me and had started to masturbate. Disgusted and furious, I turned around. He was already getting on his bike when I pulled out my phone to call 911. I have always felt anxious while walking alone. I would love to be able to shake this fear that the night is not safe for me. It feels irrational because most of the time everything is fine. The problem is, everything is fine until it’s not. Lauren, Ontario ‘In Cairo, harassment is a normal occurrence’ I live in Cairo where harassment is a normal occurrence for the majority of women. That has unfortunately kept me from walking in the streets and instead I always have to use my car or a taxi. I like to keep active and healthy; I even got a bicycle in hopes that it would be better than being on foot. But the harassment was actually worse. Trying to remove women from public space has a huge impact on where they stand in society: if they’re literally not visible out on the streets then it’s easier to ignore them in other places like the workplace or in politics. I took part in a protest for women’s rights shortly after the revolution took place in Egypt, and we were yelled at, harassed and kicked off the square by a group of men who didn’t want us to be visible. Unfortunately this type of systematic removal of women from public space still exists today in different forms. Passant, Cairo ‘Being accosted by a man with a knife scared me off the streets’ I live only 1km from where I work, but being accosted by a man with a knife has scared me off the streets. I drive instead. I love walking, but will only walk with someone else and even then I keep vigilant. But I’m one of the “lucky” ones; many women in my town have no alternative but to walk, at least part of the way, to their place of work, shops, church, classes or gym. It is a horrible thing to live with fear every moment on the street. Janet, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa ‘I was attacked walking home … the trust is gone’ Many years ago, in Darwin, I was attacked walking home from work, from behind, but fortunately I was a very strong girl and, after I got him off balance, he ended up on the ground and kicked in the jaw. That was just over 30 years ago but that altered my life – even today on a quiet street if a man approaches I cross the street until we have passed (sad, as the man is probably the nicest fellow). But the trust is gone. I don’t run or walk alone, I choose water sports for exercise and always have a very large, devoted dog with me. Guardian commenter ‘I was followed by a man old enough to be my dad’ I was followed when I was about 19 by a man old enough to be my dad. I’d seen him watching everyone go their separate ways after the pubs and nightclub shut. He stalked me for about 10 minutes while I tried and failed to keep sight of a group of strangers up ahead. I’m lucky that all he did was grab me around the waist – when I panicked and started to shout he must have realised I wasn’t as drunk as he had hoped, and ran off. But the thought of what could have happened has stayed with me for years, and I’ve never walked anywhere alone at night since. Eilidh, Glasgow ‘Every woman I know worries about this’ Every woman I know knows the litany, earnestly passed from mothers to daughters, aunts to nieces, big sisters to little sisters, postgrads to undergrads. How are you getting home? Do you have a plan? Take an extra tenner for a taxi. Who are you leaving with? Can someone walk you home? Let me know when you’re in the door home! Every woman I know sends the texts. “I’m in a black Merc 07 reg” “I’m leaving from O’Neills bar now, should be home by midnight” “Are you home?” “I’m home!” Every woman I know thinks about this, talks about this, worries about this. Not many men do. Some men know enough to say: “Will I walk you home?”, although some of them think it’s just one of those quirky cultural holdovers, like holding a door or pouring women’s wine first. A genteel, optional politeness. They don’t feel the terror scraping their bones as they grip their keys and wait for a taxi. We don’t walk home unless we walk together. We don’t walk home unless it’s only a few steps. We don’t walk home without texting our friend before, during, and after, like a prayer to safety. We don’t get to walk home. Emer Emily, Dublin ‘I have to assess what I look like’ I got a job in downtown Denver. My male co-worker told me there is free parking six blocks away from our building. That blew my mind because the couple of blocks I walk from the $11-a-day parking lot to my building is already mentally exhausting for me. I have to assess what I look like today, how loud my heels are, how many men are on the sidewalk between me and my destination. I’ve been cat-called so many times while wearing (sometimes quite ugly) business-casual outfits that I even worry about walking across the street for lunch. Bre, Denver ‘I still wind my keys around my fingers’ I used to walk the 50 metres from the tube to my flat in London with my keys wrapped around my fingers when I was younger, rushing and looking all around me every 30 seconds. When I got to the flat, I’d slam the door fast in case someone had been behind me and forced their way in. Now that I’ve got kids, I feel even less at ease … I’ll get a cab home rather than face a five-minute walk from the tube or bus stop. When I have to take the dog to the park at the end of our road before bed, I still wind my keys around my fingers and wait just outside under a streetlight, as I’m too terrified to go into it. I don’t remember there ever being a time in my life when I felt totally comfortable walking around alone after dark. Juliet, London ‘No walks at dusk to see a beautiful sunset’ I am so very careful about where I go after dark. No gas stations, no banks. No walks at dusk to see a beautiful sunset – unless my husband is with me. I’m 60 now, and afraid of being perceived as weak and attackable. It doesn’t matter how innocuous the men seem to think the catcalls and name-calling are. It feels threatening to women, and causes intense anxiety. Everywhere. Anonymous, South Carolina ‘Once women get past the age of 40, they become invisible to men’ When I was a teenager a man put his arms around me and lifted me off my feet, which was quite alarming (I hit him on the head with my handbag and he dropped me). Now I’m in my 60s, I do walk around the city where I live late at night sometimes and I’m never approached or spoken to and don’t feel unsafe. Once women get past the age of 40 or thereabouts they become invisible to most men! However, I love walking in the countryside but would never do this alone, which limits the times I can do it.

Labour has called for an immediate suspension of the use of the controversial implants, which are used to treat incontinence and prolapse, with the shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, arguing that thousands of women have been exposed to unacceptable health risks. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP and chair of the health select committee, said “an absence of data and cavalier practice” had exposed women to unacceptable risks and meant it had taken a decade for problems with mesh to be acknowledged. Labour MP Emma Hardy, who called the debate, told MPs that the trials conducted before the introduction of mesh implants had been inadequate, and that pending a review of the evidence their use should be suspended. Hardy urged the government to launch an independent inquiry into the “ongoing public health scandal” of serious complications suffered by many women who have been treated for urinary incontinence and pelvic prolapse. More than a dozen MPs relayed harrowing stories of constituents who had suffered life-changing complications linked to mesh, including perforated organs, chronic pain and loss of sex lives. Responding to the concerns, the health minister Jackie Doyle-Price announced that the publication of new guidance on the use of mesh by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) would be brought forward from 2019 to later this year. Doyle-Price said she had been “horrified” to hear that women had been given implants without being made aware of the risks. But she dismissed the need for an inquiry and said the health regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, advised mesh was “still the best device for treating stress incontinence”. “The issue is not the product, but clinical practice,” she said . “That’s what’s going wrong.” Earlier in the debate, other Conservative and DUP politicians had joined calls for tougher regulations on the use of the devices. The Scottish Conservative politician, Paul Masterton, rejected the suggestion that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the reclassification of mesh as a higher risk device, pointing to “women who have lost their careers, their husbands, their homes, their dignity and their lives, who are forced to spend day after day and night after night in agony”. “They are the evidence,” he said. Wollastonsaid she did not support a ban on mesh procedures, but argued these operations should be performed at specialist centres and highlighted “appalling failings” in the consent process and the lack of evidence. “These products were marketed aggressively without adequate clinical trials,” she said. “We need to ensure there are proper clinical trials just as we would expect for medicine.” Owen Smith, a Labour shadow cabinet minister, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on surgical mesh implants, said mesh injury was “one of the worst medical issues” he had come across as an MP, and had sprung from a failure to test devices before launching them on to the market. “This story is quite simple... If this was a medicine that was leading in one out of 10 cases to sexual dysfunction or losing the ability to walk or work, it wouldn’t be on the market,” he said. “That’s how we need to look at it.” NHS England said in a report in July that the treatment for urinary incontinence and prolapse was “a safe option for women”. However, since then further evidence has emerged about apparently high rates of complications. The Guardian revealed in August that thousands of women have undergone surgery to have vaginal mesh implants removed during the past decade, suggesting that about one in 15 women fitted with the most common type of mesh support later require surgery to have it extracted due to complications. MPs also heard that there are more than 100 devices currently on the market in the UK, most of which have never undergone extensive clinical testing, and which companies have withdrawn without warning. Kath Sansom, a campaigner at Sling The Mesh, said: “People are waking up to the global scandal that is surgical mesh implants and at last it is on the political agenda at Westminster.” Sohier Elneil, a consultant urogynaecological surgeon at University College Hospital, London, is calling for the use of mesh procedures for incontinence and prolapse to be stopped for two years. “The time has come for us to truly revisit everything we know about both these clinical states,” she said. “Clearly, the knowledge we have had to date has been limited both in scope and relevance. A change needs to happen now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/18/hofmeister-bavarian-craft-lager-win-beer-award-iwsc","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T13:32:30Z","webTitle":"Hofmeister redux as real Bavarian craft lager wins global beer award","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/hofmeister-bavarian-craft-lager-win-beer-award-iwsc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/18/hofmeister-bavarian-craft-lager-win-beer-award-iwsc","fields":{"headline":"Hofmeister redux as real Bavarian craft lager wins global beer award","bodyText":"Hofmeister, the lager that became a byword for bad beer in the 1980s, has won a global drinks competition after it was relaunched with a new recipe. The beer, a Bavarian “Helles”, won best lager of 2017 at the International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition (IWSC), cementing its return after a 13-year absence from the market. Hofmeister won notoriety in the 1980s and 90s thanks to its “Follow the bear” TV advertising campaign, fronted by George, a laddish fur ball who claimed Bavarian heritage despite having no links to the southern German region. The brand was eventually retired in 2003 as its reputation and popularity plummeted and it struggled to compete with imported European lagers. Hofmeister was revived last year by two entrepreneurs hoping to capitalise on British drinkers’ familiarity with the name, while abandoning its “Eurofizz” reputation and recipe. Drinks industry veterans Richard Longhurst and Spencer Chambers sourced the new brew from the award-winning fourth-generation Bavarian brewery Schweiger, on the edge of the Ebersberger forest, which uses local Hallertau hops, natural spring water and barley from nearby farms. The new incarnation of Hofmeister is brewed according to the the Reinheitsgebot, a 1516 purity law that restricts permitted ingredients of beer to water, hops and barley. Tim Hampson, an IWSC judge and chairman of the Beer Writers Guild said Hofmeister, the first lager to be given five stars at the awards was “a gentle, highly complex beer”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/22/jessie-ware-glasshouse-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Jessie Ware: Glasshouse review – on safe ground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/22/jessie-ware-glasshouse-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/22/jessie-ware-glasshouse-review","fields":{"headline":"Jessie Ware: Glasshouse review – on safe ground","bodyText":"Following two albums of understated soul-pop that tickled the Top 10, Glasshouse feels like a pivotal release for Jessie Ware.

But perhaps what most caught people’s attention Eniola Aluko saying that it was “bordering on blackmail” that Martin Glenn, the FA’s chief executive, allegedly intimated to her that she would only receive the second part of her settlement payment if she agreed to release a statement saying the FA was not institutionally racist. Asked by the committee, Glenn denied making that claim. The FA did, however, begin the afternoon by apologising to Aluko and Drew Spence after the reopened investigation into the Mark Sampson affair concluded that the now-deposed England Women’s manager did make discriminatory remarks to two of his players. Greg Clarke, the FA’s chairman, then went on to defend himself for a 14-word reply to an email from the PFA, an organisation he later criticised, about an inquiry it called a “sham”. Near the end, it also emerged that Mark Sampson is considering a wrongful dismissal claim by the FA. All in all, it’s unlikely it’s the last we’ve heard of this story. But that’s all from me for now. We’ll have reports and analysis up on the site soon. Thanks for reading. Bye. That brings an end to the inquiry. Lasting a good four hours, that was one intense grilling. Why was the settlement to Eni Aluko in two payments? Martin Glenn said the FA wanted no distractions from the case during Euro 2017. He repeats that the contract was broken by Aluko’s tweet on 30 August. That leads to questions about whether the FA wanted to keep Aluko quiet between the two payments. Glenn denies this. Speaking about the FA’s drive for greater inclusivity in football, Greg Clarke says that he has met someone who told him that he could introduce him to a gay Premier League footballer. The FA has admitted that it has never heard about a previous discrimination case in football: Lucy Ward’s sacking by Leeds United. The club was ordered to pay its former academy welfare officer £290,000 following her employment tribunal victory against the club. Ward successfully pursued an unfair dismissal and sex discrimination case against Leeds in April after arguing that the reason she had been sacked in 2015 by the club’s owner Massimo Cellino was because she was the partner of former manager Neil Redfearn. “When did this happen?” says an incredulous Greg Clarke. Mark Sampson’s lawyers have told the FA that he is considering a claim of wrongful dismissal. It is put to Greg Clarke that his explanation over his 14-word reply to the email from the PFA about this case was iffy. Clarke insists it’s the truth and points out that the exchange happened last November - when the FA was mired in the abuse scandal. Greg Clarke says the FA took too long to reach an answer because its grievance procedure was not good enough. He says that he will be apologising to Eniola Aluko. It’s pointed out that she’s sitting behind him and he could do so now. Clarke insists he will properly apologise to Aluko and engage with her. Martin Glenn is reminded that he chose not to apologise to Eniola Aluko for the FA’s handling of this case. Damian Collins sweeps past him. Greg Clarke admits that mistakes have been made and says the process was too slow. Damian Collins tells Martin Glenn that the FA should have apologised for “failures in process”. Glenn responds that that’s an “unfair characterisation”. Martin Glenn: “We do not exist only to conduct internal reviews.” He says it’s actually to the FA’s credit that they eventually brought in an independent barrister. He insists that the FA was trying to find the truth. He says that the FA didn’t need to bring in Katherine Newton. Dan Ashworth: “I was trying to put in a measured and balanced view.” He’s told that praising the atmosphere the atmosphere under Mark Sampson risked pre-judging the FA’s own inquiry. Damian Collins says the FA’s investigation “falls a long way short of what people expect.” Damian Collins says he finds it strange that Dan Ashworth could be allowed to say that he thought Mark Sampson was doing a good job as England manager. “I’m not an HR expert,” Ashworth says. Rachel Brace insists that Dan Ashworth gave “a point of view” rather than evidence at the FA’s initial internal investigation. The FA’s HR director says she had many conversations with Ashworth about this and wouldn’t have let him give evidence. Damian Collins tells Martin Glenn that he doesn’t think the FA understand the criticisms that have been made of its internal investigation. It’s getting quite heated in the room. Greg Clarke adds that the FA is trying to become more transparent. He apologises to Eni Aluko because “I need to set an example”. The FA is asked about press leaks. Is the FA scared of the press finding out things about the organisation? “I don’t feel there’s fear of the press,” Dan Ashworth says. “There’s merit in your argument,” says Greg Clarke. “The FA sometimes behaves like a whipped dog. When I was shortlisted as one of two people interested in this job, people asked if I was mad ... that introduces a defensive mentality and a propensity not to make decisions. What I will say is the management team Martin has put in place is the best I’ve seen in a 40-year category.” How could Mark Sampson not be happy with Eniola Aluko, an 102 cap player? “You’re right, Mark isn’t here to answer those questions. What I would say is in Eni’s previous 13 games for England she had scored one goal.” Ashworth maintains it was a coincidence that Aluko was dropped after contributing to the review. Dan Ashworth is told it’s too much of a coincidence that Eniola Aluko has not been picked for England since the cultural review. “I did not know who was in the review. As the technical director, the head coach picks the team, not me. Mark had been disappointed with some of the recent performances and he made some changes. One of the players dropped.” Rachel Brace says she thinks the initial investigation was “adequate”. She admits there were things she would do differently, though, such as making sure people feel confident about coming forward to speak and that confidentiality is stronger. Does Martin Glenn think the FA has failed in its duty of care? “Yes, in this case, there’s clearly been mistakes.” So you’ve failed? “There have clearly been mistakes.” He refuses to categorically say the FA has failed in its duty of care, leading to stinging criticism from the committee. The committee tells Greg Clarke the FA should pay Aluko the rest of the money. “Sure,” he says. Greg Clarke is now apologising for referring to institutional racism claims as “fluff”. Oh Greg! Martin Glenn: “The concern about Mark Sampson was raised in April 2014. Had I been chief executive at the time, I started in 2015, I would have spoken to the chairman. Senior people knew it, but the board weren’t informed. There was a lack of knowledge.” He says the handover of information was not good enough and left current senior FA figures like Rachel Brace in the dark. It is said that it is “extraordinary” that the FA’s chief executive did not read a safeguarding report into the England manager. The buck stops with Martin Glenn. “It does, it does,” says Greg Clarke. Oh! Dan Ashworth is asked if, as Mark Sampson’s line manager, the initial safeguarding report in March 2015 should have related to his continued employment. He tries to bat it away. But he’s asked what changed between March 2015 and September 2017. “I wasn’t aware of the details of the report.” Rachel Brace says she started as HR director in 2016 and that the information was not given to her when she got the job. She said she finally received the report last month. “When I read the report I had some concerns.” The committee is asking Martin Glenn if Mark Sampson would have fallen foul of the FA’s current safeguarding rules. The reply is that his sacking was down to a “conduct issue”. Knowing what you now was Mark Sampson in breach of the FA’s safeguarding rules? “The FA has a big involvement in safeguarding and the job of the safeguarding team is to judge if someone poses a risk. The issue we have had with Mark Sampson as a football participant and an FA employee.” He adds that Sampson was sacked not because he was a safeguarding risk but because he conducted behaviour not appropriate for an FA employee. Dan Ashworth says that Mark Sampson was sacked because of “the detail” in the report rather than the alleged offence within it. He says he found out about it at the same time as Rachel Brace and Martin Glenn, adding that they had been previously been told that Sampson posed no risk. Dan Ashworth is asked whether he was told about the allegations into Mark Sampson’s conduct at Bristol City. He says he was. Greg Clarke admits that, outside of assessing his footballing ability, due diligence into Mark Sampson was not conducted by the FA when he got the England job. “You don’t pry into the Chinese wall of safeguarding,” he adds. Dan Ashworth says it was his job to check if Mark Sampson was good enough to manage the England football team. He adds that it was up to HR to look into referencing of Sampson and adds that he had never met Sampson before his first job interview. Greg Clarke repeats that none of the allegations in the safeguarding report about Mark Sampson were illegal. “They crossed the boundaries in acceptable behaviour from a coach.” He says that left the FA to conclude Sampson was not suitable to manage the England women’s team. However he says safeguarding reports merely say whether he is a risk rather than if someone is an appropriate candidate for a management job. It is put to the FA that it is staggering it sat on a safeguarding report that eventually led to an employee being dismissed. “The miss in the FA was a failure to consider some of the wider conduct issues and therefore employment issues emanating from that should have been,” Martin Glenn says. He adds that the FA is starting to take a different approach to safeguarding. He says that people within in the FA knew about the report back in 2015, but that he and Rachel Brace chose to act in September of this year when they were made aware of its contents. Dan Ashworth is asked if Eniola Aluko was dropped from the England team because of what she said in the cultural report. “I can categorically confirm that did not happen.” Dan Ashworth says that the only names in the cultural report were those who gave Owen Eastwood permission to use them. He says other names are redacted. Dan Ashworth is finally asked a question. He explains the thinking behind instigating a cultural review. He brought in Owen Eastwood with the view to spreading uniformity across the board for England’s 16 teams. Greg Clarke admits that he can’t feel good while Eniola Aluko, an 102-cap player, feels that she has not been protected by the FA. “How can I feel good?” Dan Ashworth has not been asked any questions yet. Time’s running out. Will the FA make the rest of the payment to Aluko? Martin Glenn: “We will reflect on it.” He’s told it’s a yes or no question. “We will reflect on it.” He denies asking Aluko to make a statement saying the FA was not institutionally racist. Martin Glenn says the FA tried to get Aluko to correct and change the wording of her tweet. Eniola Aluko did not think her tweet was defamatory; the FA does. Martin Glenn is asked about the agreement of the settlement the FA reached with Eniola Aluko. He says the conditions were that neither party spoke about or made defamatory comments about the other. He says that a tweet sent by Aluko on 30 August contravened the agreement. Given the floor, Greg Clarke tells the story of meeting a weeping former player who he claims the PFA wouldn’t help. He says he lost respect for the organisation. Greg Clarke says he is going be “very frank” about the PFA. He says he is pro-union. He says there are some very good executives and foot soldiers at the PFA - he references the work the FA did with the organisation about the Rooney Rule. But he says he has a number of problems with governance at the top of the PFA. It gets heated. The committee tries to stop him as this is an inquiry into the FA. But he’s given the floor... Greg Clarke says that the committee should speak to Sport England about devising new governance procedures that can be shared with various national associations. Greg Clarke is asked if he has considered his position. Of course not. He says the job is “career death” and that he wants to make the situation better. Greg Clarke says the recruitment process has not been up to scratch in the past: “There is very little evidence of proper referencing at the time.” He says there were systemic historic failings that “have contributed to this mess. “This is not the FA’s finest hour.” But he believes the current team is making things better. Martin Glenn says Mark Sampson’s conduct rather than his safeguarding at Bristol City was not appropriate. He says if he’d seen the original report at the time, he would have taken action sooner. Martin Glenn: “Mark Sampson did not break any law.” Martin Glenn is now being asked about safeguarding within the FA... He says investigators presented their findings to the FA in March 2017. He says there were recommendations for Mark Sampson to receive mentoring in order for him to be suitable to work in football. He says he did not hear about this until a later date. It is being put to Martin Glenn that he is retracting his comments about the independent barrister because he realised it would have been illegal under employment law. Again he apologises if the comment came out incorrectly. Martin Glenn: “I was pleased with the appointment of Katherine Newton.” Martin Glenn says he made the comment “at the end of a long day”. He apologises if it came out badly. Greg Clarke says his reply was not directed at Eniola Aluko but at the PFA. His responses on the issue have been bullish. Greg Clarke says that his fourth reply was “abrupt”. He asks why he didn’t explain to the PFA that his hands were tied - he says he did. He is told that his response looked passive aggressive. He says seeing the evidence would restrict his governance role. Greg Clarke says the PFA was “trying to suck him in”. But he adds that he doesn’t blame them for that. “However in a national governing body it is different.” Again he brings up the Sport England code which shows he is mandated to behave in that way. He feels he has been made to look “oafish” and he is “disappointed”. He feels the irony is that the people doing that have some “really, really bad governance”. Greg Clarke continues to say that there were constant attempts to drag him into the issue. He says his hands were tied. Does that mean the whole FA process is flawed? “I have chaired a number of public companies. There must be a clear delineation between governance and management.” Why did Greg Clarke ask to be “enlightened” about why the PFA put the allegations to him? He says he explained three times to the PFA chief executive three times at matches that his hands were tied by the Sport England code. He says if he was involved he would have had to recuse himself. “I’ve tried to stay in my governance box.” It’s Greg Clarke’s turn. He’s asked about that 14-word email. He has a brochure. “I was mandated and directed by the Sport England code not to get involved.” Does Rachel Brace agree the FA’s own investigation was inadequate? She says she doesn’t and that nor does the barrister. Did you accepted that what Eni had said was true? “I accepted Eni had heard something that Drew had said.” Which witness did you speak to? “We couldn’t speak to Drew Spence. We watched the video. There was no evidence on the video of anything untoward happening.” The committee is telling Rachel Brace that the FA did not investigate a serious investigation satisfactorily. Rachel Brace says she spoke to Lianne Sanderson and Anita Asante. Rachel Brace says there were no stones unturned in Katherine Newton’s investigation. However the committee is saying that the FA did not do enough to interview key witnesses. Rachel Brace agrees that none of the 16 players put forward to Katherine Newton by Dan Ashworth were in the meeting relating to issues about Drew Spence. She is being grilled about whether it’s right none of the eye-witnesses were interviewed. Did the FA steer the barrister away from the right witnesses? “You can only speak to players who want to come forward.” Rachel Brace says she did not instruct Katherine Newton to do anything as that would be inappropriate. She says the names of players were put forward as witnesses. She is asked if any of them were in the relevant meeting. She says they were players who were happy to come forward. Rachel Brace: “These were really serious allegations and it was my understanding from the first meeting that this was very sensitive. It needed to be kept tight. It needed to be done with absolute privacy. Eniola gave us the name of two witnesses she wanted us to speak to. We recognised that the internal process had not got where Eniola wanted it to.” Rachel Brace is defending the FA against suggestions that it did not speak to Drew Spence. She says that Spence said in a meeting at Chelsea that she did not want to be involved in the investigation. Rachel Brace: “We had a second meeting with Eniola and the PFA and we admitted that we hadn’t seen the video. We admitted that was an oversight.” Is it right that Aluko’s specific complaints were not answered by the FA? “We did not ask her to do that,” Rachel Brace says. Martin Glenn says Eni Aluko received “a fulsome response” to her grievances. The committee is taking issue with the level of the response Aluko received. “I wont admit she didn’t get a response,” Glenn says. Martin Glenn is asked whether it was right that Dan Ashworth was a witness in the FA’s own inquiry. “I have a different opinion. We took the concerns and the complaints seriously. We followed them in the way that was typical of most organisations, an internal review, and then when that fell short for the complainant, we looked outside.” Martin Glenn is told that Katherine Newton was critical of the FA’s own inquiry. He defends the FA’s approach and tries to bring in Rachel Brace at this point. The focus, however, stays on him. Martin Glenn: “I believe the subjects were dealt with honestly and diligently.” Martin Glenn is asked if he should apologise for the FA’s handling of the affair. “I want to reiterate the apology to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence. It’s not right an FA employee should behave that way. We have a grievance procedure, but it’s clearly fallen short in respect to the pressures elite players have.” Glenn says he believes the FA have acted with “decency and openness”. He says opening an independent inquiry shows the FA took grievances seriously. He references “inappropriate banter.” Lianne Sanderson has finished giving evidence. The FA suits, Greg Clarke, Martin Glenn, Dan Ashworth and Rachel Brace, have arrived. Lianne Sanderson’s evidence is starting to wind down. Next up will be Martin Glenn, the FA’s chief executive. Eni Aluko earlier said that Glenn intimated to her that if she released a statement saying that the FA is not institutionally racist then she would receive the rest of her settlement money. She refused. “I felt that was bordering on blackmail,” she said. Lianne Sanderson: “I wasn’t asked to be part of the culture review.” She says that when Rachel Brace contacted her about the inquiry she was perplexed not to be told in advance what it was about. Lianne Sanderson: “I would have expected a phone call as opposed to finding out on Twitter that I hadn’t been selected for the squad. There was preferential treatment to certain players.” Lianne Sanderson says more publicity for the team means there must be more professionalism off the field. Lianne Sanderson is asked about changes to grievance procedures at the FA. “It has to happen naturally. We don’t want things to happen just to tick a box. It doesn’t mean you lose your England career just because you’re sitting here today.” Lianne Sanderson says that Mark Sampson’s sacking doesn’t solve everything. She says there are deeper issues. Is the treatment of Aluko and Sanderson an encouragement for women to enter sport? “We want change,” Sanderson says. Having been dropped by Hope Powell after a fall-out with the former England manager, Lianne Sanderson says she returned to the England set-up in 2015 because of Mark Sampson. She says past experiences with England had left her vulnerable and she felt Sampson knew that. Lianne Sanderson: “The way they treated Eni in the first place was different to other people on the team.” Lianne Sanderson: “As Eni’s friend, I’ve seen it’s been a torrid time for her.” Lianne Sanderson: “From that moment, I felt I was forced out. When I reached out to the team psychologist to ask why I wasn’t involved in team activities, he said he’d been told I wasn’t available.” She adds that she once found out on Twitter that she hadn’t been included in a squad last year. Lianne Sanderson feels that she has been ostracised ever since her 50th cap was forgotten about in England. She says she has received no contact from the FA while she has been injured, for instance. Lianne Sanderson mentions an occasion when Mark Sampson told her she wasn’t included in a squad as only four strikers were being named for a game England expected to win. When the squad was named, there were eight strikers. Lianne Sanderson says she raised the issue with Mark Sampson. He asked if she was sure it was her 50th cap, which she found insulting given her love of playing for England. Lianne Sanderson: “To this day, I haven’t been told I’m not good enough for England.” She says things started to change after her first year under Sampson. She pinpoints the moment when nothing was made of her 50th cap in China. Instead nothing happened, which she says is out of the ordinary. “This had never happened before. No other player had ever been forgotten about before.” She says other players were made a fuss of after their 99th cap and wondered why she had been left out. Did the culture change under Mark Sampson. “I had a great time in the first year under Mark Sampson.” But she adds that she noticed problems with Aluko. In reference to the video analysis, in which derogatory comments were made about Aluko and heard by the entire squad, she says that this is usually mute. Have other players been speaking about this case. Sanderson: “I think so, but it’s more older players from 15 years ago who have raised a few things. I have always maintained that as long as Mark Sampson was in place no one was going to speak out. The consequences are quite harsh. I don’t blame the girls. It’s not easy being here. It’s not easy being called a liar. I was always going to stand by Eni. She was telling the truth.” Sanderson is asked if she agrees with Aluko’s comments on the FA’s grievance procedures. “There definitely needs to be something in place so this doesn’t happen to other players in the future.” Eni Aluko has made way for Lianne Sanderson. We are expecting to hear from Martin Glenn at 4pm. Eni Aluko closes by saying: “One of the core purposes of me coming to speak today was so to enact change in grievance procedures. I’ve given my experiences, but that was well documented, so I would hope there are changes in that area. If players have any issues, I would encourage them to speak to the PFA.” Some banter: Aluko is asked if she has any Scottish roots. There is laughter. Eni Aluko continues: “I won the Golden Boot in September 2016, but by this time we were six months into this case. The timing of why I wasn’t picked at this time, even winning the Golden Boot wasn’t enough.” Eni Aluko asks why any player would ever come forward with issues again after seeing what’s happened to her. She’s asked if it’s normal for the Golden Boot winner not to be in the England squad. “I don’t think so. Hypothetically would Harry Kane not be picked if he won the Golden Boot? I don’t think so.” Aluko says that her issue isn’t necessarily not being picked, but how she was treated while she was in the team. But she believes she wouldn’t be picked by Mark Sampson since May 2016. Eni Aluko: “I have been available for selection since May 2016, but I haven’t been selected.” Will Aluko take legal action to get the rest of her settlement money? “I haven’t thought about.” Eni Aluko says that the second part of her settlement money was supposed to be paid on 31 August. Are there any attempts to mend fences? “Quite the contrary,” Aluko says. “I feel the FA’s sole agenda has been to protect its own reputation while making insinuations that I am lying, whilst leaking reports to media journalists about things I hadn’t had the opportunity to see. So no, there has been no attempt to build bridges or to show me a duty of care as a centrally contracted player. That has compounded the sense of isolation I felt.” She says the FA has been very defensive. She says that she is worried about what would happen if another player made a complaint tomorrow. What would be the process, Aluko wonders? She wonders why it has come to this - while she is grateful to be given an opportunity to speak, how is it reached the stage where she is doing so at a parliamentary inquiry? Has the FA contacted Aluko about changes they might be making? “No.” Eni Aluko: “To this day I don’t know if my evidence was compromised. Dan Ashworth has said my participation in the cultural review and me being dropped were not linked. But I think Mark Sampson was aware. He may have felt I was going to say something. It’s that nudge and wink culture - get rid of her before she says something.” She reiterates that attempts to set up meetings with Ashworth about her misgivings never came to fruition. Eni Aluko says that Lee Kendall might have been trying to speak to her in a fake Caribbean accent in an effort to endear himself to her. But she after a while it began to grate. “I’m not Caribbean, I’m of African descent. It’s not necessarily offensive, but I found it ignorant.” Eni Aluko thinks that there were pre-conceived ideas of her being lazy. She says that Mark Sampson tried to defend England women’s goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall, who was making derogatory comments about her performance and who she says also spoke to her in a fake Caribbean accent. “It didn’t give me comfort. It’s almost like a staffroom comment.” Eni Aluko says that negative comments about her performance in a particular England game were only made about her. She is clearly troubled by this. Eni Aluko: “Nobody ever said to me ‘how much money can we pay you to keep quiet’?” She says the settlement was based on loss of future earnings, something she might have received at an employment tribunal. Eni Aluko: “I felt I would never play for Mark Sampson again. My position in the team was untenable.” Eni Aluko adds she doesn’t know why certain things from initial investigations weren’t followed up but is now pleased with the findings. Eni Aluko: “I respect Katherine Newton’s findings.” Is Greg Clarke guilty of bullying you with his 14-word email? “Wow, I’ve not had a chance to think of that. I don’t know if I would go that far, but it is an incredibly dismissive attitude. It is really disappointing. I thought it would get better the higher up the chain it went, but actually it said it could worse. Would that happen to a male player with 102 caps for their country and 11 years of playing?” Eni Aluko is asked about whether the terms of the settlement agreement was to secure ‘good behaviour’ from her while she was working for Channel 4 during Euro 2017: “I can’t speak for the FA in terms of why they suggested the two tranches should be paid separately, but I think they assumed I wouldn’t keep my mouth shut at the Euros and I could have said something on Channel 4 or on air. I agreed it as it wasn’t in my mind, I wanted to support the team.” Eni Aluko says that her issues are not with the FA as an organisation but with certain individuals: Dan Ashworth, Greg Clarke, Martin Glenn and Rachel Brace. She says she has been careful to separate the issues. Eni Aluko says more about Martin Glenn: “For Martin Glenn to effectively suggest that I should say the FA was not institutionally racist [when I had a legal agreement], I think it is a suggestion that the case has been handled appallingly. I don’t know what the legal definition of blackmail is but I think I was being asked to do something I hadn’t ordinarily have done to receive the rest of my payment.” Aluko says that Martin Glenn intimated to her that if she released a statement saying that the FA is not institutionally racist then she would receive the rest of her settlement money. She refused. Have you been paid the full amount of your settlement by the FA? “I have not,” Aluko says. Why not? “They were agreed in two tranches. The FA have claimed I was defamatory in a tweet I have sent and on that basis they feel they were legally entitled to withold the payment. I disagree with that. I think when the initial Daily Mail article came out I was very brief. I wanted people to still support the England team. It was only after that when a lot of misleading stories came out and I felt I needed to speak out. The FA were keen for me to be very clear. I have given two interviews.” Eni Aluko is asked about Greg Clarke’s 14-word email. “I was astonished. By the time in November 2016 when the full report was sent, I actually felt at the time that sending it to the FA chairman would lead to a better process - if he looks at this it is going to improve. But actually it was the opposite. Because if it’s the FA chairman disrespectfully dismissing the complaint, I have nowhere to go. The last resort is to go the employment tribunal. The PFA was responded. A male player with 102 caps, Wayne Rooney, if they were to send a complaint like that, would he respond like that? This is a separate issue. Are the issues of female players in this country taken seriously enough at all levels of the FA? I would suggest that email says they’re not.” Did the FA fail to give you a specific response to your allegations? “They were very keen to say there was no wrongdoing without looking at the video evidence from the China Cup. They hadn’t spoken to Lianne Sanderson at that point even though I had made it clear Lianne had issues in the team. They were dismissive straight away in the first meeting. We didn’t speak about specific itemised issues.” Eni Aluko continues: “I categorically did not say that Drew Spence refused to be interviewed in any investigations. Let’s say I had - is it not prudent to pick up the phone and confirm that [with her]? I think that’s quite basic. That could have happened in the internal investigation and in Katherine Newton’s investigation. But I understand that Katherine Newton had to act on instructions and was told Drew Spence did not want to investigate and that was not the case.” Eni Aluko says of the FA’s technical director: “I felt I was ignored by Dan Ashworth. He ignored my email.” Aluko says: “I couldn’t tell you what the whistleblowing procedure is at the FA.” She says that she wanted to speak to Dan Ashworth about the problems she was experiencing and says the FA’s technical director wasn’t in the meeting. Why did Aluko’s lawyer believe the investigation would not carry weight? “Because it wouldn’t have been tested before a high court judge. The legal process wouldn’t have been what would have happened in court. That’s the nutshell of the advice he gave to me. I didn’t feel confident in any case about taking part in an FA investigation I felt already had a lot of flaws in it.” Eni Aluko says: “I didn’t receive any advice about whether I should participate in Katherine Newton’s investigation by the FA.” She adds her lawyer didn’t feel it would be wise for her to take part in the investigation - he told her that it wouldn’t be taken seriously in a court of law. Eni Aluko is now speaking at the inquiry. “I did feel isolated in terms of the process. I didn’t want it to be as adversary as it has become, in terms of the Football Association versus Eni Aluko. I haven’t spoken to many individuals that I used to speak to at the FA. But in terms of the PFA, I feel I have had unwavering support. Without their support I wouldn’t be sat here. In terms of friends, in life you realise your strongest friends are and who some aren’t. Lianne Sanderson has been a very good friend of mine and a team-mate. I cannot say I have been completely isolated. It’s been difficult, but I’ve been supported in some areas” In his statement, Glenn says that Sampson’s comments were ill-judged attempts at humour and that Newton found that the deposed England manager is not racist. The FA’s chief executive has apologised to the two England players for Mark Sampson’s racial remarks. A third inquiry, conducted by the barrister Katharine Newton, has found that Sampson did tell Aluko to be careful her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to Wembley and also upset Spence, a mixed-raced player, by asking her how many times she had been arrested. Daniel Taylor has the full story and here’s what Glenn had to say: On behalf of The Football Association I would like to sincerely apologise to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence,” Glenn said in a statement. “Based on new evidence submitted to independent barrister Katharine Newton, she has now found that they were both subject to discriminatory remarks made by an FA employee. This is not acceptable. “She also concluded that there was no evidence to support the allegations that Eniola Aluko was subjected to ‘a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct’ by Mark Sampson. “Our ambition has always been to find the truth and take swift and appropriate action if needed. It was our decision to have the original, second and final investigation to ensure that due diligence was taken. It is regrettable that Eniola did not participate in the first external investigation as this would have enabled Katharine Newton to conduct and complete her investigation sooner. We will fully support the recommendations from the report.” So here we are, in front of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, waiting to find out more about the Mark Sampson affair and the Football Association’s handling of a case that has cast a shadow over the women’s game in England. It has been almost a month since Sampson lost his job as the manager of the England women’s team amid reports that the FA was guilty of a cover-up over racism allegations made by players in his squad. Top FA executives are set to be grilled about the apparent failure to deal satisfactorily with the seriousness of the issues relating to Eni Aluko and Drew Spence. Aluko has been invited to speak, along with Lianne Sanderson, another player involved in the story. The players will be going first.This is a story that snowballed after Aluko, who holds 102 England caps, gave an interview on 21 August to the Guardian in which she alleged that Sampson had told her not to let her Nigerian relatives to bring the ebola virus to a game at Wembley. Much has happened since then, but to fast-forward to the latest developments, this week the Guardian exclusively reported that Greg Clarke, the FA chairman, responded with a 14-word email - “I’ve no idea why you’re sending me this. Perhaps you could enlighten me?” - after a six-page letter from the Professional Footballers’ Association detailing complaints against Sampson and another member of staff. As Daniel Taylor, our chief football writer, says, Clarke is likely to face some difficult questions this afternoon: Clarke was one of four FA executives to be sent a letter from the PFA alleging that the governing body’s technical director, Dan Ashworth, and the director of human resources, Rachel Brace, had overseen a ‘sham’ internal review that was ‘not a genuine search for the truth’ and ‘designed to close down the complaint and absolve Mark Sampson’ The letter was sent in November 2016 and accused the FA of deliberately sabotaging Aluko’s 11-year international career to protect Sampson as well as setting out a series of grievances detailing “the incontrovertible evidence that makes it clear the purported investigation was a sham”. It was the first time the FA had been informed of a previously unreported allegation that Sampson – already accused of offending Spence, a mixed-raced player, by asking how many times she had been arrested – had also made an allegedly racial remark involving Aluko’s Nigerian relatives and the Ebola virus. Sampson, who was sacked last month, with the FA citing an old safeguarding report, denies all the allegations and has been cleared by the previous two inquiries – one staged by the FA and another, independently, by the barrister Katharine Newton. The second investigation was reopened a few weeks ago amid criticism of Newton’s work and the revised findings are likely to be revealed during Wednesday’s hearing.” The session is due to begin at 2.30pm BST and we’ll be getting updates along the way from our chief football writer Daniel Taylor and our chief sports correspondent Martha Kelner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/juan-diego-florez-mozart-cd-review-orchestra-la-scintilla-minasi","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T15:00:04Z","webTitle":"Juan Diego Flórez: Mozart CD review – riproaring Mozart with a swagger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/juan-diego-florez-mozart-cd-review-orchestra-la-scintilla-minasi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/juan-diego-florez-mozart-cd-review-orchestra-la-scintilla-minasi","fields":{"headline":"Juan Diego Flórez: Mozart CD review – riproaring Mozart with a swagger","bodyText":"Mozart hasn’t featured much in the stellar career of tenor Juan Diego Flórez, but this disc suggests that some roles at least could suit him very nicely.

Mozart’s monarchs, however, are a different story. Alexander the Great’s aria from Il Re Pastore sounds unassailably heroic; two arias for the titular emperor of La Clemenza di Tito find Flórez shaping smooth, firm lines, sounding imperial yet not imperious; King Idomeneo’s Fuor del Mar goes with a swagger, and a riproaring top D at the end.

They both have autism. It is a beautifully shot, coolly composed movie, in which the principals emerge as intensely likable and intelligent. The film avoids obvious cliches taken from, say, Diane Arbus or Grey Gardens, although the influence of both is plain. Weirdly, this could almost be a scripted, fictional drama; I can imagine a shot-for-shot, line-for-line remake starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader. It also feels sometimes like a classy arthouse reality show: directors Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini interestingly include a moment in which Dina ponders how reality shows are made. And the emotional mule kick in this film is that Dina was abused and seriously assaulted by a previous partner, but the full details are teasingly withheld until almost the very end, when we hear the 911 recording. But even that doesn’t tell us the whole story. I wanted to know more; I wanted someone to ask Dina directly and more searchingly all about it and how she feels. Again, the mystery of Dina’s trauma, and the placing of its semi-revelation in the edit, might be more satisfying as part of a fiction.

That’s the message from the latest monthly snapshot of the labour market showing that earnings growth is stubbornly low despite the lowest jobless rate since the mid-1970s. Back then, any pick up in the cost of living would lead to a demand for higher pay, prompting an upward wage-price spiral. But this model is dead. Three things are worthy of note. Firstly, it is clear that the economy is great at creating jobs but hopeless at generating pay rises. Employment is up by more than 300,000 over the past year but average earnings growth at 2.2% is slightly lower than it was in the summer of 2016. Secondly, while employment has been a lot stronger than was feared in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, the pace of growth eased in the three months ending in August. Finally, there is no immediate end in sight for the fall in real (inflation-adjusted) wages which have now fallen for a sixth successive month. The Resolution Foundation notes that real average earnings are no higher now than they were in 2016. It will be well into 2018 before pay growth overtakes inflation – and this relentless squeeze on living standards will have retailers nervous as the key Christmas period nears. Consumers face a choice: tighten their belts or get deeper into debt. An added complication is that the Bank of England appears to be gearing up for an interest-rate rise at the November meeting of its monetary policy committee. The feeling in the City is that a failure to raise rates will damage the Bank’s credibility and lead to a further fall in sterling. But the pound could well weaken even if the MPC does go ahead with the rate rise because it will be doing so when – judging by the labour market and other recent economic data – there is no justification for one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/rudresh-mahanthappas-indo-pak-coalition-agrima-review-flexing-indian-rhythms-and-jazz-with-swagger-and-wit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rudresh Mahanthappa's Indo-Pak Coalition: Agrima review – flexing Indian rhythms and jazz with swagger and wit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/rudresh-mahanthappas-indo-pak-coalition-agrima-review-flexing-indian-rhythms-and-jazz-with-swagger-and-wit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/rudresh-mahanthappas-indo-pak-coalition-agrima-review-flexing-indian-rhythms-and-jazz-with-swagger-and-wit","fields":{"headline":"Rudresh Mahanthappa's Indo-Pak Coalition: Agrima review – flexing Indian rhythms and jazz with swagger and wit","bodyText":"Jazz musicians have been integrating Indian ragas into their improvisations for more than half a century, but few do so as comfortably as New York-based alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa.

Rumbling away throughout is witty drummer Dan Weiss, who lurches between tablas, cymbals and full-on thrash rock kit-bashing, but the breakout star is guitarist Rez Abbasi. He’s like a dozen players in one: on Snap he’s echoing Keith Levene’s postpunk textures, on Showcase he’s Jimmy Page; on the title track he’s John McLaughlin; on Take-Turns he’s Wes Montgomery. As with most Indian classical music the majority of the tracks use just one chord, but Abbasi’s inventive rhythm playing and countermelodies take us on a harmonic voyage that never sounds static."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/laura-cannell-hunter-huntress-hawker-review-brutally-alive-roaring-folk-improv","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:30:31Z","webTitle":"Laura Cannell: Hunter, Huntress, Hawker review – brutally alive, roaring folk improv","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/laura-cannell-hunter-huntress-hawker-review-brutally-alive-roaring-folk-improv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/laura-cannell-hunter-huntress-hawker-review-brutally-alive-roaring-folk-improv","fields":{"headline":"Laura Cannell: Hunter, Huntress, Hawker review – brutally alive, roaring folk improv","bodyText":"On the dark edges of folk music lingers Laura Cannell, a violinist and recorder player who uses traditional instruments to evoke unearthly, ageless narratives. Her fourth album is a series of improvisations recorded in a church on the crumbling coast of Covehithe in Suffolk, roaring into life under her fiddle’s curved, baroque bow. This technique involves the four strings being played simultaneously and the effect is aggressive, unsettling, but also primordially beautiful, the harmonies of the drones often clashing cruelly before resolving themselves. Many moments are also unapologetically, uncompromisingly difficult. The harsh, stabbing playing in Blacksmith is like a metalworker’s studio in sound, while Air Splinters Through feels freshly torn from a horror soundtrack. It’s not a record for early mornings.

At the time of writing: Chief suit Martin Glenn issues a full apology to Eni Aluko and Drew Spence after a reopened investigation into the Mark Sampson affair concludes the now-deposed England Women’s manager did make discriminatory remarks to two of his players. “In her final report [barrister] Katharine Newton concluded that on two separate occasions Mark Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour,” says Glenn. Newton writes in her report: “I have concluded that on two separate occasions MS has made ill-judged attempts at humour which, as a matter of law, were discriminatory on grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010 … I consider it fundamentally important to emphasise that I have not concluded MS is a racist.” Aluko says Glenn intimated to her that if she released a statement saying that the FA is not institutionally racist then she would receive the rest of her settlement money. She refused. “I felt that was bordering on blackmail,” she said. Aluko reveals that England women’s goalkeeping coach Lee Kendall used to speak to her in a fake Caribbean accent: “I’m not [from the] Caribbean, I’m of African descent. It’s not necessarily offensive, but I found it ignorant.” Get all the latest with Jacob Steinberg here. EYE-OFFENDING BRINE FOR SUBS EVERYWHERE Alas Po’ Craig Shakespeare, we didn’t really know him well. He seemed a cheery enough kind of bloke, the type who would smile and point Weird Uncle Fiver in the right direction if he emerged from a bush asking where the hospital was. But beyond that, nope. It’s hard to know what he was. Some Leicester City fans will tell you he was the real architect behind everything good the club has done. Others will say he was a great No2, another Peter Taylor who was at his best in the background playing percussion but not suited to up-front warbling and sweaty stage dives. It was a curious sacking – and one that no one expected, least of all Shakespeare, who had spent Tuesday morning digesting his breakfast while watching a game between a Leicester Bits and Bobs XI and Nottingham Forest before being told not to bother coming in any day soon. The Fiver’s initial reaction was to see what everyone else’s reaction was. It turns out we were outraged. And especially with chief suit, Scrabble’s Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. In fact, so righteously indignant were we on Shakespeare’s behalf that we looked at some facts, which are these: Nigel Pearson was told to do one after helping the club stay in the top flight. Outrage followed, then Claudio Ranieri was appointed and Leicester won the Premier League. He was was then sent scuttling down Filbert Way with Leicester fourth bottom. Outrage followed, then Leicester appointed Shakespeare as caretaker, finished 12th and got to Big Cup quarter-finals. We piped down a bit, what with Srivaddhanaprabha’s every decision having had a positive, galvanising effect on the club. It may turn out this is his first duff call since buying 30,000 Jamie Vardy face masks to protest against a red card for a two-footed tackle. Perhaps Srivaddhanaprabha’s expectations are unrealistic but isn’t that just the same as every fan’s in a game full of chancers, dreamers and folk who put money on a team to win the league at odds of 5,000-1? Shakespeare certainly has the right to feel fresh and funky after being told to do one after eight games in which four were against Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. He also lost Danny Drinkwater to Stamford Bridge and has had to put up with Riyad Mahrez functioning in hologram mode. And thanks to some top, top paperwork-bungling, he was denied the use of Adrien Silva until January. But at least he’ll always have that Shakespeare-Pulis half-and-half scarf. With the club third bottom, Michael Appleton has been put in temporary charge, chiefly because he looks like he could punch a hole through a dressing room wall to get a reaction out of the players. And there’s no sign that Leicester have sounded anyone else out as a replacement yet, with everyone whoever existed, including Sam Allardyce, Sean Dyche, Timmy Mallett, Carlo Ancelotti, Granny Fiver and Romeo Challenger from Showaddywaddy being tipped for the King Power hot seat.

Put this one in the bank until you know what to do with it” – Philip Jones. “So, if moaning about Claudio Ranieri’s sacking was viewed as ‘knee-jerk’ when Craig Shakespeare had Leicester initially playing better, is Shakespeare’s sacking now another ‘knee-jerk’ reaction, or does it in fact prove that the initial ‘knee-jerk’ reaction was not in fact a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction? Is there jerking going on or not, that’s all I want to know” – Paul Dixon. “How sad that yesterday’s Fiver, while featuring a rare mention of Shrewsbury Town, could not also find time to mention the fact that the Shrews – pre-season favourites for relegation – remain unbeaten in their first 13 league games of the season, making them – at the time of writing – more than a third as invincible as Arsène Wenger’s unbeatables, back before everyone who could defend and score left, and The Unpleasantness began. What’s even more remarkable is that you made no mention of the clear evidence of collusion between Cardiff City, the Shrews and Exeter City. At the start of play on Saturday, all three teams were top of their respective divisions. Exactly a year before, they had all been 23rd in their respective divisions. By the end of Saturday’s games, they were all second in their respective divisions. It seems likely to me that George Graham has been furtively roping the three clubs together to ensure they move up and down in unison, like his Arsenal defence. Of course, by the time you actually read this, both Shrewsbury and Exeter will have played another game each, and their league positions may have changed [yup, Shrews still unbeaten, now top, Exeter third – Fiver Ed].

On Tuesday, Tim Loughton MP, the co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on mindfulness, told a conference of international parliamentarians that he meditates in the bath every morning and commented that his contemplative habit was “not cheap”. “I spend up to an hour in the bath every morning, just thinking about things,” he said. He was trying to illustrate how meditation practice, which MPs are campaigning to promote in health, education and the criminal justice sectors, can take place almost anywhere. But what was not clear was that the bill was being paid for by the taxpayer. Bills submitted under his parliamentary expenses show the elected representative for East Worthing and Shoreham has been spending close to £50 a month at times on Thames Water supply for his rented London flat. “Tim’s not going to comment, but it’s a normal expense on the flat,” said an aide on Wednesday evening. “If you look up all the MPs who have power showers rather than baths, he may spend less.” Earlier, Loughton had responded to press interest in his bath habit saying: “MP takes bath is apparently hot news in Westminster at the moment. However the real story was a conference I co-hosted at Westminster yesterday which brought together 20 MPs from over 15 countries to promote mindfulness as one of the ways we can help tackle the epidemic of mental illness. “Mindfulness is not a universal panacea but it certainly can help in the fight against the epidemic of mental illness.” He added: “I tend to get up early and plunge myself into my bath soon after 6am where I spend up to an hour reading through papers and articles for meetings coming up in the day ahead, but I also reserve a little part of my ablution time for some mindfulness meditation.” Speaking earlier at the same conference, the sports minister Tracey Crouch has revealed that mindfulness, a practice derived from Buddhist meditation, has become a regular feature of working life in her Whitehall department and claimed it is now “very important in terms of policy development”. The Tory minister told a Westminster conference exploring how the practice can be introduced into public life and politics internationally that since taking up the practice in an effort to come off antidepressants, she is now “a major advocate of what mindfulness does, not just to you as a person but also how we can use it professionally”. 145 MPs have already undergone eight-week courses in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which is prescribed elsewhere on the NHS as a treatment for the prevention of relapse of depression. The cost of the courses is covered by the Oxford Mindfulness Centre. Through meditation, it encourages participants to focus on the current moment and observe thoughts, feelings and judgments as things that come and go and to notice how the human mind gets easily caught up in thoughts that are not necessarily facts. People with recurrent depression who have taken an eight-week course are 31% less likely to relapse, according to analysis of nine trials involving 1,329 people. But there is growing interest in how the practice can affect the quality of political debate and decision making not just in the UK, but also in the US, where the Democratic congressman and potential 2020 presidential candidate Tim Ryan has written a book on the subject: A Mindful Nation. Anthony Seldon, the historian and teacher who has written histories of the premierships of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, told the meeting: “The one quality that is missing from the heart of No 10 is stillness and mindfulness. Decisions such as the Iraq war, the way the Brexit vote was handled, the reaction to Grenfell Tower: the quality of mindfulness and heartfulness is missing. How do we get them to listen? You know what they will say. They will say they are too busy.” Mindfulness meditation is a central part of Buddhist practice, but it was repackaged in a secular form in 1979 by the US academic Jon Kabat-Zinn as a treatment for pain and stress reduction for sufferers of chronic illness. “I have become a major advocate of what mindfulness does, not just to you as a person but also how we can use it professionally,” said Crouch. “As minister in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport we have been very passionate about mindfulness. We do practice it regularly in the department.” She gave the example of how the practice can improve focus in meetings, especially in the hectic environment of parliament. “I discovered if I was being very mindful in those meetings, not only would a half-an-hour meeting be done in 20 minutes but I felt that both parties were getting more out of it. I also think it is very important in terms of policy development. I am pleased to say it is really beginning to catch on, particularly in education.” Crouch told how she has used mindfulness as an alternative to medication to handle her anxiety and depression. “After the second and third session I got it. It just clicked,” she said. “This was helping me: the breathing exercises, the understanding of who you are and how you can cope and the whole mechanism of what mindfulness is teaching you, how it teaches you to be in the present moment and not to be beating yourself up. I realised I had spent my entire time doing this professionally and personally.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/18/albion-review-mike-bartlett-almeida-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T09:49:22Z","webTitle":"Albion review – Mike Bartlett captures nation’s neurotic divisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/18/albion-review-mike-bartlett-almeida-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/18/albion-review-mike-bartlett-almeida-london","fields":{"headline":"Albion review – Mike Bartlett captures nation’s neurotic divisions","bodyText":"Gardens often acquire a symbolic value in drama. Since the one in Mike Bartlett’s fascinating, complex new play is called Albion, and is attached to a rambling Oxfordshire house, it is pretty clear we are watching is state-of-the-nation stuff. But what makes the play so enormously intriguing is that, as in his King Charles III, Bartlett shows us as a deeply divided people torn between the urge to preserve the past and to radically reform it. Bartlett focuses on a woman called Audrey who embodies the play’s contradictions and who is superlatively performed by Victoria Hamilton. Audrey is a mover and shaker in her mid-50s who sells up in London to live in a seven-bedroom rustic pile she knew as a child. Its prize feature is a famous garden that represents “the chaos of nature in a formal setting”, and Audrey’s big dream is to restore it to its former glory and to use it to memorialise the son she recently lost in a pointless foreign war. In the process Audrey alienates her daughter, her son’s lover, her oldest friend and the entire village. In her mixture of romanticism about the past and restless hunger for change, she seems to epitomise the nation’s neurotic divisions. Like most dramatists who adopt rural settings, Bartlett can’t keep Chekhov out of the picture. The fourth act palpably evokes The Cherry Orchard, and with Audrey’s daughter an aspiring writer who falls for a famous novelist and harshly jettisons another would-be scribe, the echoes of The Seagull’s triangle of Nina, Trigorin and Konstantin are thunderous. Yet for all its Russian reverberations, Bartlett’s play accurately pins down a peculiarly English confusion. This is a world where Audrey’s historical vision is juxtaposed with a creeping contemporary fascism, where a building’s national character is restored with the aid of Polish efficiency and where privileged country-house parties are contrasted with raucous, rock-driven village revels. Bartlett throws almost too much into the mix and some of the relationships are not entirely convincing: although they are old college chums, I could never quite believe that Audrey and the now-celebrated novelist would have kept in touch. But Rupert Goold’s production orchestrates the action perfectly, Miriam Buether’s design creates a garden that blossoms before our eyes and Hamilton, too long absent from the stage, is breathtaking. She shows us exactly why Audrey is a success in business yet a failure in her personal relations. Hamilton strides into the garden as if nature and people can be brought to order, yet she also seems quietly tragic in her incuriosity and lack of empathy. In short, she gives us every facet of Bartlett’s multi-layered character. There is outstanding support from Helen Schlesinger as the rueful novelist, Charlotte Hope as her adoring acolyte, Vinette Robinson as the dead son’s obsessive lover and Margot Leicester as a mutinously resentful cleaner. Among the men Nicholas Rowe is striking as Audrey’s complaisant husband. It all makes for a long evening, but a rich one: a modern equivalent of Shaw’s Heartbreak House. But, as well as analysing England’s current identity complex, it also suggests, along with The Ferryman, Girl from the North Country, Ink and Labour of Love, that this is turning into a vintage year for new writing.

Others a 21st-century Mao. On Wednesday morning he was China’s Hugo Chávez, testing his comrades’ eyelids – and their bladders – with a three-and-a-half hour, 65-page sermon in which he outlined his brave new vision for the Communist party, and the world. “The Chinese dream is a dream about history, the present and the future,” Xi declared towards the end of his unexpectedly long-winded address to the opening of China’s 19th party congress. By the conclusion of this eastern answer to Aló Presidente! more than a few of Xi’s audience appeared to have entered a dreamlike state. Xi’s soliloquy began shortly after 9am in the Great Hall of the People, a vast scarlet-carpeted theatre in Tiananmen Square that is the ceremonial heart of Communist party rule. The party’s 64-year-old general secretary, who is celebrating the end of his first five-year term, strolled calmly out on to the dais, followed by a cluster of besuited party elders, and took his place at a wooden lectern beneath a giant golden hammer and sickle. “Comrades,” Xi began. “On behalf of the 18th central committee of the Communist party of China, I will now deliver a report to the 19th national congress.” Over the next 203 minutes Xi waxed lyrical on a miscellany of themes, from housing to Hong Kong independence; soil erosion to the South China Sea; rural poverty to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; cyber-security to corruption; Marxism to military modernisation; global governance to global warming. One moment Xi was an environmental evangelist. “Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,” he said. “We should be good friends to the environment … for the sake of human survival.” The next he was a theoretician: “Everyone in the party should develop a good grasp of the essence and rich implications of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and fully and faithfully apply it in our our work,” Xi said. “Our revolutionary ideals soar beyond the skies.” Finally, after more than three hours, Xi became a moral beacon. “We must foster values like loyalty, honesty, impartiality,” he pronounced. Double-dealing and “unprincipled nice-guyism” were out. Five years ago, at the opening of China’s last such congress, Xi’s dour predecessor, Hu Jintao, gave a 90-minute lecture in which he poured cold water on any hopes of political reform and warned that corruption could put an end to Communist party rule. But after 90 minutes of Xi’s talkathon, the end was nowhere in sight and through binoculars it was possible to see party officials beginning to flag. Jiang Zemin, who was general secretary until 2002 and is now 91, yawned, dozed and occasionally grappled with a large white magnifying glass in an apparent effort to stay awake. Every so often he peeled back his left sleeve to check a wristwatch before turning his gaze back towards Xi and pouting. To Jiang’s left, one of the party’s few female leaders, Liu Yandong, scribbled furiously on to her copy of Xi’s tract with a red pencil. As the minutes, and then hours went by, a succession of senior leaders wandered off stage through a golden curtain, as biological necessities began to speak louder than political loyalty. Up in the press gallery there was fidgeting too. Black-clad security guards amused themselves by posing for photographs. At the two-hour 15 mark, a text message flashed up on the Guardian’s mobile phone from another spectator: “Jinping Castro,” it said. However, as delegates streamed out of Xi’s far-reaching declamation there was nothing but admiration for the thoughts of a man increasingly seen as China’s most powerful – and feared – leader since Mao. “It wasn’t long, it wasn’t long – it was absolutely wonderful,” beamed Wang Wenxia, a teacher from Hebei province, one of the 2,280 Communist party delegates attending this year’s congress. “What an exciting speech!” gushed Fu Chunli, a delegate from the far western region of Xinjiang. “Such a good report, written into the hearts of 1.3 billion people!” “Yes [long] – but exciting,” agreed Tang Jialing, a third emissary. “I hope all party members – like me – can turn this blueprint into reality as soon as possible.” Liu Jianhua, a delegate from the ministry of finance, concurred: “When Xi talked about ‘standing tall and firm in the east’, it made my blood stir.” There was foreign applause too. Robert Kuhn, an American writer and investment banker who is reporting on the event for the party’s English-language channel, said he had been struck by the scope of Xi’s vision. “The ambition was enormous,” said Kuhn, the author of How China’s Leaders Think, as he stepped out of the Great Hall into the lunchtime drizzle. Might Xi’s address have been too long? “I think he just read it a little bit slower,” Kuhn replied, diplomatically. “And in a very confident way.” Others found themselves literally unable to react to Xi’s mammoth monologue. “I can’t hold it any more,” one female delegate confessed, declining an interview request as she made a dash for the toilets outside the hall’s main auditorium. “I really need to go to the loo!” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/oct/18/uk-unemployment-report-pay-inflation-rio-tinto-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T13:00:23Z","webTitle":"UK wage squeeze continues, as jobless rate remains at 42-year low – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/oct/18/uk-unemployment-report-pay-inflation-rio-tinto-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/oct/18/uk-unemployment-report-pay-inflation-rio-tinto-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK wage squeeze continues, as jobless rate remains at 42-year low – as it happened","bodyText":"And finally.... here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today’s labour market report: Firstly, it is clear that the economy is great at creating jobs but hopeless at generating pay rises. Employment is up by more than 300,000 over the past year but average earnings growth at 2.2% is slightly lower than it was in the summer of 2016. Secondly, while employment has been a lot stronger than was feared in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, the pace of growth eased in the three months ending in August. Finally, there is no immediate end in sight for the fall in real (inflation-adjusted) wages which have now fallen for a sixth successive month. The Resolution Foundation notes that real average earnings are no higher now than they were in 2016. Larry adds: It will be well into 2018 before pay growth overtakes inflation – and this relentless squeeze on living standards will have retailers nervous as the key Christmas period nears. Consumers face a choice: tighten their belts or get deeper into debt. Here’s his full analysis: That’s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The pound has dropped against the US dollar since today’s jobs and earnings figures were released. Sterling has dropped by 0.2% to $1.3166, and is a little lower against the euro at €1.119. That’s quite a muted reaction -- reflecting the fact that nothing’s really changed in the UK today. The economy is still creating jobs, and people still aren’t getting pay increases that keep pace with inflation. So the Bank of England still has to decide whether it should raised interest rates next month, or leave borrowing costs at their record low a bit longer. Last month, it suggested that rates could rise in November; this sparked a sterling rally, which has faded in recent days. Chris Bailey, European strategist at wealth manager Raymond James, says the BoE faces a tough dilemma: “Stronger inflation figures would normally point towards a potential interest rate hike which we know is not too far around the corner. But wage growth is an ongoing concern and an interest rate rise would put pressure on the consumer who is already having their earnings eaten away by inflation. “Given these factors I believe it is likely that we will see a minor tweak up in interest rates in November but it is not something that I would vote for if I was sitting on the Committee. Concerns around ongoing Brexit discussions and its prevailing uncertainties have only been deepened by today’s disappointing wage growth figures.” Here’s our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, on today’s labour market report: The lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-70s are still failing to boost the bargaining power of workers in the UK, as official figures show a sixth month of negative real earnings. Average earnings increased by 2.2% in the three months to August, the same level recorded in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier figures, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had forecast growth of 2.1%. When taking account of inflation, the ONS said real wages fell by 0.4% on the previous year, despite the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.3% – the joint lowest level since 1975. The figures will perplex the Bank of England as it prepares for the first interest rate hike in a decade from as early as next month. The central bank has been looking for signs of pay growth as it seeks to balance a trade-off between supporting jobs and the economy with low rates and cutting the growth in prices. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the data “fails to provide a decisive case” for the Bank to increase the cost of borrowing from 0.25%. “The squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, with obvious negative implications for personal expenditure,” he said. The latest fall in real pay means that average earnings are no higher than they were in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4% bigger per person than at that time, according to the Resolution Foundation. More here: Over in parliament, prime minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have sparred over today’s labour market figures. Corbyn welcomed the drop in unemployment (‘a first’, according to May), before arguing that the fall in real wages shows the economy is weak. What’s the government going to do about it? May says the government have cut taxes from basic taxpayers (due to the rise in the tax-free allowance, I think), the Living wage, and the doubling of free childcare. This prompted Corbyn to suggest May breaks her own duck and answers his question... Here’s a clip: Andy Sparrow’s liveblog has full details of what many commentators are calling a win for the member for Islington North. Britain’s youth unemployment rate has fallen to 11.9% over the last year, from 13.7%. That’s because fewer 16-24 year olds are looking for work, and more are in full-time education (or economically inactive for other reasons). But the real wage squeeze is hurting young people who are in work (earlier this week, we learned that many are having to borrow to pay for basics) Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust, says young mothers are finding it particularly tough: “We have a youth debt epidemic and, as prices rise and wages remain low, this is only set to worsen. It’s time for action. “Young women in particular are getting stuck on low pay, falling into debt and using foodbanks to put food on the table. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, low pay means an hour’s childcare can cost more than an hour’s wages. Estate agents and hairdressers are suffering some of the tightest wage squeezes, today’s report shows. City workers, administrators and IT staff, though, are getting inflation-beating pay packets: (this shows real wages - so pay minus inflation) Britain’s employment rate has fallen back from its record high. The proportion of 16-64 year olds in work dipped to 75.1% in the three months to August, down from 75.3% a month ago. The employment rate had been rising steadily since the end of 2011, as Britain clawed its way back from the financial crisis. Now, it’s very plausible that last month’s small fall is only a blip. But, it could be a sign that the labour market has peaked..... Sarah O’Connor, the FT’s employment correspondent, tweets: Here are more figures from the Resolution Foundation, showing how the wage squeeze will intensify in the run-up to Christmas. A handy breakdown of the UK labour market: This graph shows how UK unemployment fell to 4.3% in the last quarter. There are now 1.44 million unemployed people in the UK, down 215,000 in the last year. The jobless rate hasn’t been lower since since Harold Wilson was prime minister. This chart shows how wage growth slowed at the start of this year, and hasn’t recovered strongly since. An extra 420,000 jobs have been created in the last year -- this chart shows the key changes: Britain’s bosses (the men and women with their hands on the purse strings) argue that productivity needs to rise so they can deliver wage increases. Matthew Percival, CBI Head of Employment, says the government can, and must, help: “Persistently weak productivity, coupled with falling real wages, continues to hit living standards, underlining the need for the Chancellor to bold in his Budget. “Delivering urgent progress on large and small infrastructure projects, addressing underfunding in education and providing practical support for innovators are all steps the Government can take as part of a meaningful Industrial Strategy to boost productivity, the only sustainable route to improving people’s pay.” The Resolution Foundation have spotted that average earnings (adjusted for inflation) are no higher than they were back in February 2006, thanks to this latest slump in real wages. Stephen Clarke, their economic analyst, explains: “Today’s figures confirm the big picture trend that the UK labour market is great at creating jobs, but terrible at raising people’s pay. “The scale of the pay squeeze over the last decade is so vast that people today are earning no more than they did back in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4 per cent bigger per person since then.” Britons would need a £15 per week pay rise to get back to the levels before the financial crisis. Geraint Johnes, professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has spotted that workers in the financial sector are getting decent enough pay rises.... The 3 month average measure of total pay growth indicates that earnings have risen by 2.2% over the last year. This represents no change on the previous month. There has been some acceleration in pay in the financial and business services (where pay growth is now 2.7%, or, on the less reliable single-month measure, 3.1%). But in many industries – including the public sector, manufacturing, construction and distribution – pay growth is still below 2%. This does not suggest that it is yet time for the Bank of England to be hiking interest rates.” Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, fears that UK unemployment will soon start to rise. He argues that the wage squeeze means consumers will spend less in the shops, hitting profits and forcing firms to lay off staff (creating something of a vicious circle...) He writes: “The story of the labour market remains the same: more people earning weaker wages. These figures do nothing to change our belief that a lack of real wage gains are going to continue to impinge on the ability of consumers to remain the driving force of UK growth. “The pace of price increases is at a near-term high and the next few months may also mark the peak of employment. UK businesses, particularly those who import from abroad or are part of global supply chains, have laboured under a slowing economy and higher costs courtesy of the falling pound. Should neither consumption or investment provide these companies – particularly retailers - with a strong Christmas, then we would expect to see the ‘good’ news of falling unemployment start to reverse as businesses react to lost margins cutting into the corporate bone.” Real wages will probably keep shrinking for many more months, warns James Smith of ING: Crunching the numbers, we don’t expect wage growth to go much above 2.1% or 2.2% before next summer. So whilst we expect headline inflation to peak at 3.1% next month, the gap between CPI and wage growth is likely to stay fairly wide for some time to come. Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, says the rise of the ‘gig’ economy, and the government’s public sector pay cap, are partly to blame for the wage squeeze. “Another month, another fall in real household incomes. Today’s wage growth figures show our total earnings including bonuses grew at just 2.2% in the three months to August . With yesterday’s CPI figures showing inflation spiking to an eye watering 3%, the gap between our pay packets and the cost of goods and services continues to remain vast - our wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of living. “The absence of wage growth remains the missing piece of the puzzle in the UK’s slow road to recovery - high employment should be the worker’s best friend because that’s what pushes up wages. With UK unemployment at a 45-year low, one would think that workers’ bargaining power at the wage negotiation table would improve, yet earnings growth remains elusive and the UK’s workforce is getting poorer. There are many potential reasons for this ranging from poor productivity to the squeeze on public sector pay and the rise of self-employment in the so-called ‘gig economy’. The employment minister, Damian Hinds, has welcomed the news that Britain’s unemployment rate remains at a 42-year low, with 32.10 million people in work (up 317,000 in the last year.). Hinds says: “Our economy is helping to create full time, permanent jobs which are giving people across the UK the chance of securing a reliable income. “We’ve boosted the income for people on the lowest pay by increasing the National Living Wage and delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years. “That’s great progress and we’re determined to help more people flourish in the world of work. “For example we’ve launched our new returnship programme to help more women get into good jobs after taking time out, and to keep their career progressing.” Andy Bruce of Reuters has spotted that workers in the hospitality industry are suffering a sharp pay squeeze: British workers have now suffered six months of falling real wages, as this chart shows: With inflation now at 3%, a 2.1% per year pay rise simply isn’t enough, says the TUC’s general secretary Frances O’Grady: “Pay packets are taking a hammering. This is the sixth month in a row that prices have risen faster than wages. “Britain desperately needs a pay rise. Working people are earning less today (in real-terms) than a decade ago. “The Chancellor must help struggling families when he gives his Budget next month. This means ditching the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And investing in jobs that people can live on.” Breaking! Wage growth across the UK is still lagging behind inflation, even though the unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in 42-years. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.1% per year in the three months to August. That’s down from 2.2% a month ago. Including bonuses, wages rose by 2.2% - matching last month’s figures. That means that real wages are still shrinking -- inflation was 2.6% in July (the mid-point of the quarter), and jumped to 3% in September. The Office for National Statistics also reports that Britain’s unemployment rate remained at 4.3%, the lowest since 1975, thanks to another drop in the number of people out of work. Here are the key points from today’s Labour Market report: The unemployment rate was 4.3% in the three months to August 2017, the joint lowest since 1975. There were 94,000 more people in work compared with the three months to May 2017, out of which 78,000 were women. The inactivity rate was 21.4%, down slightly when compared with the previous three months. In real terms, average weekly earnings fell by 0.4% on the previous year (excluding bonuses) and by 0.3% (including bonuses). In the three months to June 2017 (the latest available period), the probability of remaining in employment, for those in work, was 97.3%, the highest comparable rate since 1997. More to follow! Over in Frankfurt, ECB president Mario Draghi is making another push for ‘structural reforms’ in the eurozone. Draghi’s arguing (once again) that political leaders have a ‘window of opportunity’ to reform their economies, thanks to the eurozone’s current record low interest rates and QE programme. Usually, these talks focus on labour market reforms - which can be code for making it easier to hire and fire staff. Draghi, though, is arguing for wider reforms to the way businesses work -- and blasting ‘vested interests’ who are holding things back. Unlike what happened in the years even before the crisis, labour market reforms must be preceded – or least accompanied by – product market reforms, otherwise wage adjustments will not be fully passed on to prices. Instead, profit mark-ups will rise and the purchasing power of households will fall, thereby worsening the economic conditions of consumers and aggravating any recession. During the crisis, because of powerful vested interests, labour market reforms were not accompanied by product market reforms in some countries, and so wages fell and prices did not adjust in tandem. We have fresh evidence that London’s property market is cooling, from estate agent Foxtons. Foxtons has told the City that conditions remained “challenging’ in the last quarter Sales in July to September dropped to £10.3m, from £12.3m a year ago. Rob Holdsworth of the Resolution Foundation tweets: Today’s average weekly earnings figures will be ‘key’ for the markets today, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services: No change is seen in headline terms at a still very lowly 2.1% y/y, while the ‘core’ ex-Bonus measure is forecast to dip to 2.0% from 2.1%. This will leave real earnings deep in negative territory, leaving plenty of room for doubt on whether wages are turning or have turned a corner as some MPC members have claimed, and certainly beg the question on the need for, or the wisdom of a rate hike. This chart from economist Rupert Seggins shows how UK real wages have been shrinking for several months. Today’s earnings data will show show that trend continuing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we’ll be looking at Britain’s jobs market, and asking why people aren’t being paid more when employment is at record levels. The latest labour market statistics, due this morning, will probably confirm that headline employment is at record levels, but that pay is still not keeping up with inflation. City experts predict that that headline unemployment rate remained at just 4.3% in the three months to August. That would be the joint-lowest in 42 years, as the labour market holds up well in the face of Brexit uncertainty. But wage growth will probably remain worryingly weak, at around 2.1% (possibly falling to 2.0% per year if you strip out bonuses). That would mean another fall in real wages, as inflation jumped to 3% yesterday. This is puzzling economists (in theory, you’d expect wages to rise once labour becomes scarce). But in the world of the Gig Economy, many workers are actually facing uncertain hours, poor conditions and weak wage growth. It all feeds into the wider conundrum of Britain’s weak productivity, and whether the country can actually handle a rise in interest rates. Today’s figures will be closely monitored by economists, business leaders, and investors. Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA, says: Once again though, the unemployment data is expected to paint one picture with the rate remaining at 4.3% while average earnings paints an entirely different one, as wages rise by only 2.1%. Negative earnings growth is one of the factors that is likely to weigh on the economy going forward and makes the BoE’s decision on interest rates all the more difficult. Also coming up today Consumer good giant Reckitt Benckiser, chemicals and paint maker Akzo Nobel, and London estate agent Foxtons are reporting results. Mining giant Rio Tinto is in the spotlight today. Former CEO Tom Albanese and ex-CFO Guy Elliott have been charged with fraud by US officials, over coal assets in Mozambique which were bought for $3.7bn and later sold for just $50m. Albanese and Elliott are accused of inflating the value of the assets. Both men deny any wrongdoing. More on this shortly.... Investors will be keeping an eye on China, as the Chinese party congress begins. President Xi got the ball rolling by hailing the dawn of a “new era” of Chinese politics and power.

It brought into sharp relief how talk about the need to cut company tax rates is based on a pretty simplistic view of why our investment has fallen and what we can do to improve it. I think we sometimes forget just how massive the mining investment boom was. From the depth of the 1990s recession to 2004, mining investment grew by an average of 8.7% each year; but from 2005 through to the end of 2012 it grew by 32.4% each year: Such was the size of the boom that even with the recent falls, total new capital expenditure has us still tracking above where we would have expected to be, had the trend from 1992 to 2004 held: The boom was so large the iron ore industry grew from an equivalent of 0.75% of Australia’s GDP to 2.7%: And while various governments like to take the credit and pass the blame for the boom and its end, overwhelmingly it occurred because of factors outside our control – namely China’s entry into the world economy at the end of 2001 and the subsequent surge in iron ore prices. So it actually should not be that surprising to hear Ellis on Tuesday tell the Citi Australia and New Zealand Investment Conference that the level of the company tax rate was not as important a driver of investment as was argued by the head of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, on the same panel. Ellis said about the 10-year phase of the “incredible” investment mining boom: “Guess what – multinational resource companies are not going to put that investment in a country which doesn’t have those resources just because they have a lower tax rate.” She noted that they “will invest where the LNG and the iron ore and the coal and – as it turns out – the lithium actually are”. Ellis concluded that “the real reason we attract foreign capital rather than rely on foreign capital is precisely because we have these resources that are available and they aren’t going anywhere.” This of course is in stark opposition to the position put forward by the Business Council of Australia and the government, which remains determined to cut the company tax rate from 30% to 25% – citing moves by other nations and proposals by Donald Trump to cut the US company tax rate. The issue is that the 30% rate is one of the highest in the OECD – only the US, France, Belgium and Germany have higher rates than our 30%. And yet as Ellis and other commentators such as the ABC’s Ian Verrender have noted, would that it were so easy to just think cutting the tax rate will spur investment. The most obvious problem is that given our dividend imputation system, changing the company tax rate doesn’t have much of an impact for Australian investors as Australians get a credit against the amount of company tax they pay. As Ellis noted, this means from the perspective of the domestic investor “the corporate tax rate is irrelevant”. It also means any benefit from lowering the company tax rate effectively goes to foreign investors. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing – but it depends on the type of investment that is being driven and also whether a lower tax rate would actually do much except lower the amount of revenue collected by the government. Ellis had broached this topic in February before the parliamentary economics committee. She told the committee then that what we need to think about is “what is the nature of the investment that we are getting from foreign investors and how much of it is foreign direct investment, which builds new things versus, say, purchasing of existing securities or purchasing of existing assets?” So even if we assume that a lower company tax rate will bring in foreign investment we can’t just assume the type of investment is going to automatically drive economic growth and employment. Foreign direct investment is the type we are really after – where a foreign company sets up shop in Australia, employs people, builds factories and invests in equipment. But the company tax rate is just one of very many other considerations that drive that investment – considerations that include location of resources (both natural and people), regulatory framework, security of investment, skills, macroeconomic conditions and stability of policy. On this front, having a long-term energy policy would be potentially more important than a possible lowering of the tax rate. And it is worth noting that just looking at the tax rate is a bit of a simplistic way of comparing taxation. This March the Congressional Budget Office, in response to Trump’s proposal to slash the US tax rate, compared the corporate tax rates of the G20 nations. But instead of just looking at the nominal rate, it also looked at the average rate paid and the effective rate, which measures a corporation’s tax burden on returns from an investment that is expected to earn just enough, after taxes, to attract investors. And on this score, against the biggest economies in the world, Australia is nowhere near the top: The desire to cut the company tax rate is founded on the belief that we are uncompetitive with other nations and that we need to do something to arrest the fall in investment. And yet when looking at the actualities of our company tax system, we are not a high-taxing nation, and overwhelmingly the fall in investment is due to the end of the mining boom, not because other nations have lowered their tax rates and taken investment away. As Ellis noted, “I’m not sure I buy the idea that we have a great drought of non-mining investment”. Indeed the latest GDP figures have seen the third consecutive growth of new business investment, and Ellis saw “some synergies” with a pick-up in public infrastructure investment. But while we may not actually have as high a corporate tax rate as business groups might argue, we are much more reliant upon company tax revenue than other nations: This means that if we cut company tax, then we need to get that revenue from somewhere, or we need to cut spending to balance it out. And that’s the ultimate problem of the desire to cut company tax rate – it is unlikely to lead to the benefits those proposing it insist will occur but it will reduce revenue – and that will need to be paid by someone. And as the Parliamentary Budget Office showed last week, right now that someone is people on middle incomes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/18/lisa-wilkinson-channel-nine-ceo-denies-row-is-over-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T06:19:50Z","webTitle":"Lisa Wilkinson ‘wanted $2.3m’: Channel Nine denies row is over gender pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/18/lisa-wilkinson-channel-nine-ceo-denies-row-is-over-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/18/lisa-wilkinson-channel-nine-ceo-denies-row-is-over-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"Lisa Wilkinson ‘wanted $2.3m’: Channel Nine denies row is over gender pay gap","bodyText":"TV breakfast host Lisa Wilkinson was asking for $500,000 above the $1.8m she was offered to co-host Nine’s Today, the chief executive of the Nine Entertainment Co Hugh Marks has said. Marks said when he refused to agree to the $2.3m package demanded by her agent, Nick Fordham, her contract with Nine was terminated. Wilkinson’s co-host for 10 years, Karl Stefanovic, is on a $2m package and in 2017 Wilkinson was on $1.1m but was offered an additional $700,000 in 2018. “I went to an incredible amount of trouble to build that [$1.8m] package for her,” Marks said. “She wanted $2.3m. It wasn’t a $200,000 shortfall to [Stefanovic’s] $2m magic number. It was $500,000.” On day three of the highly public fallout from the breakdown between Channel Nine and Wilkinson, Marks went on the record to deny that she was a victim of gender pay disparity after Nine was pilloried in the media for paying Stefanovic more than Wilkinson. Marks said Stefanovic was paid more because he had more responsibilities at the network including a hit prime-time show and because Wilkinson had multiple commercial agreements outside Nine. “The reason we walked away from Lisa is because we are not able to secure those [other] rights with her,” Marks said. “She has a number of commercial rights with other parties. Her arrangement with the Huffington Post restricts our ability to engage with her digitally – we are restricted from engaging with her also on social media. “I hate the fact we have to compare her with Karl, but with him we have all those rights. With Lisa we do not.” Wilkinson was criticised by ABC TV’s Media Watch last month for risking her editorial credibility by fronting a campaign for Nutra-Life Kyolic Aged Garlic extract which she said “may help to support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels”. Marks said he refused to cough up another $500,000 for the star because it would pay for another 10 producer jobs. Tim Burrowes, the founder of the media and marketing industry website Mumbrella, said the gender disparity argument had been overplayed in this case. “There’s plenty of evidence of a gender disparity in pay for people working in the media and wider communications industry,” Burrowes told Guardian Australia. “But Lisa Wilkinson’s battle with Nine isn’t a great example of it. “She works for multiple employers including writing for the Huffington Post and doing work for brands, while Stefanovic works exclusively for Nine, and does other shows including 60 Minutes and This Time Next Year which was a prime-time hit. “This feels like a negotiation that broke down and some sophisticated spinning, rather than a big matter of principle.” The editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Australia, Tory Maguire, confirmed she had signed Wilkinson as editor-at-large for 2018. Some media outlets are claiming that Wilkinson, who will host the Walkley awards in Brisbane next month, is getting paid more than $2m by the Ten network for a still unspecified role which includes hosting The Sunday Project. But industry sources say this is highly unlikely given Ten’s record of paying its personalities far less and its parlous financial state. The Ten network has already had to deny that Project co-host Carrie Bickmore will be replaced by Wilkinson. “Lisa will be hosting our new Sunday edition of the show and joining the program during the week to share her expertise and insights with Carrie, Waleed and Pete,” the executive producer, Craig Campbell, told Fairfax. “I believe our trio is already the best on TV and they are excited to have the chance to play alongside Lisa.

And yet they’re blamed for their unemployment,” Manderson said. “We’re blaming people for their circumstances, and I think we do it to avoid blaming ourselves.” Anglicare released its jobs availability snapshot on Thursday, which examined jobs advertised and unemployment figures from the sample month, May 2017. It found there were 124,000 jobseekers who were only qualified for entry-level jobs. Those jobseekers were competing for 25,979 entry-level jobs advertised, the report found. The number of entry-level jobs was also falling. In 2006 about 22% of advertised jobs were entry-level. This year, it was 15%. Anglicare’s report also warned of the worsening security of work. The number of underemployed Australians rose from 875,200 last year to 1.1 million this year. More broadly, there were 711,900 unemployed competing for a total of 171,544 advertised jobs in May. The report comes as the government pushes ahead with significant changes to the welfare system. The changes includes drug testing of welfare recipients, a new demerit point system for the failure to meet mutual obligations, and cuts to a bereavement allowance that could leave families $1,300 worse off. Wife pension payments will also be abolished for about 200 women living overseas and the government plans to remove “intent to claim provisions”, which protect people who are entitled to welfare but are unable to lodge a full claim due to personal circumstances. The Anglicare report recommended raising Newstart and Youth Allowance rates, dismantling the “rigid” system of mutual obligation and punishment, and identifying and supporting industries with entry-level jobs that are expected to expand, such as aged care and disability. Anglicare’s executive director, Kasy Chambers, said the job snapshot showed punishing welfare recipients was ineffective. “This shows that cracking down on welfare and forcing people to jump through hoops simply hasn’t worked,” she said. “Instead of helping people find work, they are forced to compete for jobs that simply aren’t there. “But there is hope, and opportunity. With the disability and aged-care sectors set to grow across Australia, we can create stable jobs and career pathways for those who need them. We can offer tailored support and training for those who need it. And we can redesign the support system so that it’s a safety net – not a poverty trap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T16:20:02Z","webTitle":"Robin Ling obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Robin Ling obituary","bodyText":"Robin Ling, who has died aged 90, was an orthopaedic surgeon at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic hospital in Exeter whose contribution to hip surgery resulted in an improved quality of life for millions of people. His research and teaching had a profound influence on the development of hip replacement operations and of revision (re-do) hip surgery. He was responsible for establishing many of today’s surgical techniques. His research built on the work of Sir John Charnley, who pioneered the total hip replacement in the early 1960s. With Clive Lee, an engineer at Exeter University, Robin designed a tapered implant shape that he thought would help the stem remain firmly attached to the skeleton in the long-term. Their implant was first inserted in 1970 and is still used today, with some minor alterations. The “Exeter stem” has been shown to work well in patients of all ages, no matter the shape of their anatomy or the cause of their arthritic hip. Robin’s observations of how the implant functioned in patients led to extensive laboratory studies in Exeter. Robin and Lee proved that bone cement, the polymer used to anchor an implant, can over time undergo “cold flow” and behave as a viscous liquid. This phenomenon (known as “creep”) is valuable in transmitting weight through the joint to the skeleton and allows patients to remain active for decades without pain. This explanation of how “taper-slip” cemented stems function has become part of mainstream orthopaedic teaching around the world. The outstanding performance of the Exeter stem, designed by Robin, has led all the main manufacturers of artificial hips to market a copy. It is the most implanted cemented stem internationally and the most popular implant in the UK: more than 100,000 hip stems are now used each year. More than 1m operations had been undertaken by the end of 2010 and, such is the success of the implant, it is likely that by the 50th anniversary of its inception more than 2m stems will have been inserted. Robin demonstrated that the quality of the surgery carried out would often define how long the hip survived in patients and he developed sophisticated cementing techniques that continue to be taught around the world. The success rate of the original stem for not loosening is more than 93% at 33 years; using the new cementing techniques, stems inserted today have even better results. His contribution to revision surgery resulted from a close relationship with Professor Tom Slooff from Nijmegen in the Netherlands. They developed a technique for repairing the damage to surrounding bones that can result from the loosening of an implant. Although it has become established around the world, the technique is used less now, principally because of the excellent long-term results of the primary taper-slip stem, which rarely loosens. Robin grew up in Keighley, which was then a wool town in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his parents and grandfather were doctors. His grandfather, known as “old Dr Ling”, covered the more affluent part of town. His father, known as “Dr Billy”, treated the less wealthy part. His mother, Mona, ran the medical practice during the second world war. Robin was born in London, however, a precaution dictated by a breech birth and deplored by his father, who feared this might prevent his son from playing cricket for Yorkshire. During the second world war Robin was sent to British Columbia, and afterwards he studied medicine at Magdalen College, Oxford, and St Mary’s hospital, London. After he passed his surgical fellowship, he returned to Canada as medical director of the emergency department at Vancouver General hospital but came back to the UK to complete his orthopaedic training in Edinburgh. His first consultant appointment was at Princess Margaret Rose hospital and the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, but he went to Devon for his definitive consultant post in Exeter in 1963. His intellect was recognised by Charnley himself, who came to Exeter to observe surgery. Robin’s scientific work and teaching did not prevent him from contributing in all areas of professional life. He sat on numerous editorial boards, chaired regional and national committees, headed national and international professional bodies and was honorary professor of bioengineering in the school of engineering at Exeter University. He was appointed OBE in 1992. He was generous with his time to all the surgeons from around the world who travelled to Exeter to benefit from his knowledge. His personal warmth and modesty were the stuff of legend. Robin was supported throughout his life by his wife, Mary (nee Steedman), whom he met at St Mary’s hospital and married in 1955. She survives him, along with their two daughters and four grandchildren. • Robin Sydney Mackwood Ling, orthopaedic surgeon, born 7 September 1927; died 9 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/21/rent-property-letting-agent-fees-government-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Tenants in England still waiting for a ban on letting agents’ fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/21/rent-property-letting-agent-fees-government-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/21/rent-property-letting-agent-fees-government-ban","fields":{"headline":"Tenants in England still waiting for a ban on letting agents’ fees","bodyText":"It was in November last year that the government announced plans to ban letting agent fees paid by tenants. Almost a year on, there is still no date for when it is coming into effect – so how long are we going to have to wait? The eye-catching move was announced by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his 2016 autumn statement, and an official consultation took place between April and June this year. It means tenants in England will no longer have to pay anything other than rent and a refundable deposit. The Department for Communities and Local Government says it means tenants will be able to see at a glance what a property will cost them in terms of rent, “without any additional hidden costs”. There will also be a ban on letting fees being charged by landlords or other third parties, in order to prevent tenants having to pay “through the back door”. But a DCLG spokesman could not give a specific date for the introduction of the ban. He said: “Our tenants fee bill will be first published in draft to ensure full scrutiny of our proposals by parliament and stakeholders before introducing the legislation formally. We shall publish the outcome of the public consultation on our proposals shortly.” Renters pay an average £200-£300 in letting fees per tenancy, though for many it is significantly more, says the government. Campaign group Generation Rent found that the typical two-adult household is paying an average of £404 every time they move, with fees ranging from £40 to £813. Meanwhile, Shelter found that one in seven tenants pay more than £500. However, there is some concern that the ban will simply push up rents. This week, Newham council in London launched what it says is the UK’s first ratings scheme for letting agents. It has published a zero to five star rating for each agent registered in the borough.

Some of you may recall the faintly excruciating anecdote in her inspiration-tome-cum-memoir where the future first daughter set up a lemonade stand. Alas, the Trump estate in Connecticut was so vast that it was bereft of anything that might constitute passing trade. “We had no such advantages,” Ivanka laments, and consequently her father’s servants are required to make up the footfall and spend their own money on the wares. The moral of this, apparently, is that “the kids made the best of a bad situation”. Ivanka’s latest tin-eared attempt at winsome reminiscence comes in Raising Trump, a book tenuously curated by her mother, Ivana. Raising Trump is about parenting (although its title clearly nods toward the 15-year toddler-wrangle that was Ivana’s marriage to the future president), and our business today is with a contribution from Ivanka relating to her teenage years. In it, the first daughter reveals an obsession with Kurt Cobain, which, in a confusion of genres, she seems to elide with a punk phase. “One day after school,” recounts Ivanka, “I dyed my hair blue. Mom wasn’t a fan of this decision. She took one look at me and immediately went out to the nearest drugstore to buy a $10 box of Nice’n Easy. That night, she forced me to dye my hair back to blond. The colour she picked out was actually three shades lighter than my natural colour … and I have never looked back!” Mmmm. I’m afraid the shade name for this anecdote is Golden Guff. For those of us who’ve forgotten more about hair dye than even the Trump ladies have ever known, its fatal weakness is clear. You simply cannot override blue hair with blonde Nice’n Easy. You can maybe turn it green, but that’s it. Still, who wants to read some dreary relatable memory of her mother closing the Trump Tower hair salon for the day and ordering the staff to fix it? I far prefer the fantasy of 1990s Ivana Trump tottering off to Duane Reade in her pink satin couture Versace suit (though I think even her helps had lesser helps to go to the chemist for them at that point)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/19/harvey-weinstein-loses-bfi-fellowship-oscars-baftas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T15:24:36Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein has BFI fellowship removed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/harvey-weinstein-loses-bfi-fellowship-oscars-baftas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/19/harvey-weinstein-loses-bfi-fellowship-oscars-baftas","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein has BFI fellowship removed","bodyText":"The British Film Institute has announced it will remove its prestigious fellowship from disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein.

In a statement, the BFI said that its “highest honour” had been withdrawn and that “the serious and widespread allegations about Harvey Weinstein’s appalling conduct are in direct opposition to the BFI’s values.” The Fellowship has been awarded regularly since 1983, with such luminaries as David Lean, Vanessa Redgrave and Clint Eastwood among its recipients.

On Monday the Producers Guild voted to expel him. More than 40 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment following the publication of investigations by the New York Times and the New Yorker. Following the revelations, Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company.

Learn from Lenin","bodyText":"As the centenary of the Russian Revolution comes knocking on the portals of the Kremlin, the Russian government does not know what to do. The wave of post-Soviet popular revolts, from the Georgian Rose Revolution of 2003 to the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 in Ukraine, made Moscow worry about a possible revolution in Russia itself. As the young followers of Alexei Navalny, a populist critic of the regime and its corruption, take their protests into the streets of Moscow and other major cities, the Russian authorities are hardly in the mood to celebrate. While the mausoleum of Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution, remains in place on Red Square, with plans to bury his body being long shelved, the country’s leadership has found a more appealing hero in Saint Vladimir, the medieval ruler of Kiev, now the capital of Ukraine, where he is known as Volodymyr the Great. In November last year, on Russia’s National Unity Day, Vladimir Putin presided over the unveiling of an 18-metre monument to the Kievan prince in the very heart of Moscow, across from the Borovitsky Gate of the Kremlin. Prince Vladimir is depicted with a sword in one hand and a cross in the other. In his remarks, Putin praised the Christianiser of Kievan Rus – the medieval realm to which Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians trace their origins – as the “gatherer and protector of Russian lands” whose baptism of the realm made it the “joint spiritual source for the peoples of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine”. The cornerstone of the monument was brought to Moscow from the recently annexed Crimea, where Prince Vladimir was baptised, according to the Kievan chroniclers. The monument to the president’s namesake thus also became a symbol of Russia’s claim to parts of Ukraine’s history and territory, as did the blockbuster movie Viking, a film about Prince Vladimir released in 2016 and praised by Putin. The Russian volunteers who flooded Crimea and then the Donbas region at the peak of the “Russian spring” in 2014 crossed the border into neighbouring Ukraine allegedly in defence of the Russian language, culture and Orthodox belief, against the advance of Ukrainian fascism and corrupt European values. Some of the key actors of that onslaught, such as the commander of pro-Russian forces in the Donbas, Igor Strelkov (real name: Girkin), and the apostle of the “Crimea is ours” campaign, Natalia Poklonskaya, are now leading the nationalist and Orthodox mobilisation in Russia. Poklonskaya has emerged as a key figure in protests against the release of the film Matilda, which tells the story of the extramarital affair of the last Russian tsar (and now Orthodox saint) Nicholas II and the Russian ballerina Matilda Kschessinska. The Ukrainians pulled down all their remaining statues of Lenin in the wake of the 2014 Maidan protests and the Revolution of Dignity. They did so because they saw in Lenin an important tie not only to Soviet times but also to present-day Russia and wanted to cut it. But Lenin’s legacy to Ukraine is complex. He managed to bring Ukraine back into Moscow’s fold after it declared independence in 1918, but the price he paid for doing so seems excessive to present-day Russian opinion makers. Lenin insisted on keeping the industrial Donbas region in Ukraine, and considered Russians and Ukrainians separate peoples who deserved republics of their own within the Soviet Union. With Putin asserting repeatedly, during the current Russo-Ukrainian conflict, that Russians and Ukrainians are one and the same people, Lenin’s nationality policies look incongruous. Lenin as the founding father of the Russian federation, the state now led by Putin, has been disowned as the Kremlin looks to expand the federation’s borders. While Russia and Ukraine are now in a state of undeclared war, their respective political and intellectual elites seem to be of the same mind about rejecting the communist legacy. They differ, however, on what to make of the rest of the revolutionary baggage, especially the disintegration of the Russian empire, led by the tsars for two centuries from 1721. Ukrainian academics have launched a series of conferences to celebrate the national independence attained, albeit briefly, in 1918 as a result of that disintegration. In the Russian Revolution they see first and foremost a revolution of nations. While the government in Kiev will not mark next month’s centenary, everyone expects its active participation in the celebration of the centenary of the proclamation of Ukrainian independence in January. If the Ukrainians are embracing an anti-imperial narrative, in Russia, by contrast, the imperial past is on the march, whether in the growing cult of Nicholas II or the construction of the monument to Saint Vladimir. The current imperialist vogue is based on the tsarist idea of a big nation in which Russians, Ukrainians (dubbed Little Russians) and Belarusians (White Russians) were considered branches of one Russian people. By celebrating the centennial of their national revolution, Ukrainians are stressing their difference from the Russians. These two visions clash today in the fields and mining towns of the Donbas, where, obscured by crises in other parts of the world, the undeclared war goes on, with more than 10,000 people dead on both sides to date. As the war continues, the former lands of Kievan Rus’, the “lost kingdom” of Saint Vladimir’s times, are growing further and further apart. The attempt to stop Ukraine’s drift toward Europe, initiated by Putin, served to mobilise Russian nationalism at home and abroad even as it generated anti-Russian sentiment throughout the world. With nationalism now rising on both sides of the Russo-Ukrainian border, Lenin must be turning in his mausoleum. He knew back in 1917 that Russians and Ukrainians were separate peoples, and that the only way forward for the revolution was to recognise the difference. Lenin accepted the formal independence of Ukraine. The challenge that Putin and the Russian elites face today is to accept the country’s real independence from its former imperial master. There can be no lasting peace in the region until that occurs. • Serhii Plokhy, professor of history at Harvard University, is the author of Lost Kingdom: A History of Russian Nationalism from Ivan III to Vladimir Putin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/19/model-cameron-russell-fashion-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:11:01Z","webTitle":"Model Cameron Russell calls out the fashion industry on sexual harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/19/model-cameron-russell-fashion-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/19/model-cameron-russell-fashion-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Model Cameron Russell calls out the fashion industry on sexual harassment","bodyText":"Dozens of models are banding together to share anonymous accounts of sexual harassment as the controversy over Harvey Weinstein expands to other industries. Model and activist Cameron Russell, 30, began sharing stories on her Instagram feed last week, explaining that she wanted to shine a light on abuse of young, often inexperienced models by seasoned professionals in the business. “Hearing about #harveyweinstein this week has sparked conversations about how widespread and how familiar his behavior is,” Russell wrote on her Instagram feed and has encouraged correspondents contributing their stories to publicly use the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse “so the industry can see the size and scope of this problem”. Among dozens of entries, many writers have described how, as young women often with little experience, they were left unguarded and vulnerable to predators, many of them photographers, agents, clients and bookers. One described how she was assaulted by an unnamed photographer when she was 15 years old for the sake of “making the pic look more sensual”. As the feed has gathered stories, it has received hundreds of “likes”, including some from well-known models. But Russell wrote that the Instagram accounts should not be seen as an exposé “because nothing in these stories should be a revelation for those working in our industry”. Russell’s call for the fashion industry to reform have been joined by supermodel Christy Turlington Burns. She told WWD that she felt fortunate that she had not been abused, but added: “I can say that harassment and mistreatment have always been widely known and tolerated in the industry.” Turlington, who is married to the actor and documentary maker Edward Burns, continued: “The industry is surrounded by predators who thrive on the constant rejection and loneliness so many of us have experienced at some point in our careers.” The model, who now runs a not-for-profit organization that trains midwives in Guatemala, said that there were many times early in her career when she had flown abroad for an assignment to find herself entrusted to the care of “some creepy playboy type”. “In hindsight, I fear I may have played the ‘honeypot’ that has been described in the stories about these predators who make other women feel protected. Unknowingly, but still an accomplice of sorts.” The Weinstein scandal is now placing the fashion industry in the crosshairs. Weinstein is married to a fashion designer, Georgina Chapman, and was frequently seen in the front row at his wife’s catwalk shows with senior industry executives. The couple have now separated, Chapman has announced. “Fashion is far from a feminist nirvana, but it has, historically, been an industry with great career opportunities for women,” wrote New York magazine fashion writer Amy Larocca. “But if you zoom out of the offices, fashion has a whole world of problems.” Larocca drew attention to the close parallels between becoming a famous, award-winning actor in a Weinstein-produced film and debuting as a fashion magazine cover star. “It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that Harvey Weinstein loved fashion, but what is surprising is just how much fashion loved Harvey Weinstein back. Shouldn’t everything about this leering, groping, heavy-breathing man have set off all the alarms of this female-dominated industry?” It’s a question that’s now reverberating through the business. Last week, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, added her voice, denouncing Weinstein’s behavior as “disgraceful and unacceptable”. In her Instagram feed, Russell said she believed the Weinstein scandal would be “the beginning of a power shift” for young women in the fashion business. “We are speaking to each other, we are speaking up, we are speaking to lawyers, and we are speaking to well resourced reporters.” On her own experience, Russell wrote: “On many occasions I’ve been called a feminist for reporting unwanted groping, spanking, pinching, pressure for dates, phone calls and texts of a sexual nature, lack of appropriate changing areas, etc.” More than 40 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment following the publication of investigations by the New York Times and the New Yorker. Following the revelations, Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company.

Patrick Marber’s production of David Ives’s Venus in Fur, a dark sexual comedy about an actress auditioning for a role with a misogynistic male director, has become depressingly timely as allegations of sexual assault by the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, once referred to as “God”, continue to surface. Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer gives a mesmerising performance as Vanda Jordan – skilfully seductive and with impeccable comedic timing – as she crashes into an audition with young jaded playwright/director Thomas Novachek (David Oakes), who is adapting the 19th-century sadomasochistic novel Venus in Furs for the New York stage. Although she initially appears ill-suited for the part, swearing like a sailor and cackling at her own lewd comments, as soon as she dons a ladylike white gown Dormer transforms, like a BDSM Eliza Doolittle, into the aristocratic, haughty lead the playwright is looking for. What follows is a battle of wills between the two, with shifts in the power dynamic, role reversal, characters playing characters playing characters, and a variety of amusing transatlantic accents. While Vanda charms both Novachek and the audience, his character is somewhat lost in the background, soon staring at her with the air of a lovesick teenager without putting up much of a fight. As Vanda gains more power over him, she calls out the book’s sexism and their encounter becomes a proxy gender war. The 90-minute one-act play is an entertaining tour de force, building to a thrillingly camp ending. But there’s no escaping that, for all its forward-thinking gender politics, it’s a man’s play, directed by a man, featuring a skimpily dressed woman arguably satisfying the male protagonist’s sexual desires. It’s a lot harder to laugh along with than it would have been a month ago. • At the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, until 9 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/19/cambridge-university-issues-trigger-warnings-for-shakespeare-lecture","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T14:16:24Z","webTitle":"Cambridge University issues trigger warnings for Shakespeare lecture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/19/cambridge-university-issues-trigger-warnings-for-shakespeare-lecture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/19/cambridge-university-issues-trigger-warnings-for-shakespeare-lecture","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge University issues trigger warnings for Shakespeare lecture","bodyText":"Cambridge students have been given timetables bearing “trigger warnings” to alert them that a lecture on the works of Shakespeare could be upsetting. In the English faculty’s notes on lectures document, students were warned that a lecture discussing the plays Titus Andronicus and The Comedy of Errors would include “discussions of sexual violence” and “sexual assault”. Titus Andronicus, which the Guardian’s theatre critic Michael Billington described as a “masterly study of the nature of grief”, is widely regarded as Shakespeare’s most violent work due to its bloody depictions of rape, murder and cannibalism. The discussion of the two plays, which also features Sarah Kane’s notoriously violent 1995 play Blasted, was described as addressing the question: “When do we laugh at violence, and why?” A university spokesperson said that “it is not a policy of the English faculty to have such warnings”, adding: “Some lecturers indicate that some sensitive material will be covered in a lecture by informing the English faculty admin staff, who prepare the faculty’s notes on lectures which are distributed to English students.” “This is entirely at the lecturer’s own discretion and is in no way indicative of a faculty-wide policy.” Nonetheless, some academics and theatre professionals were critical of the move. David Crilly, artistic director at the Cambridge Shakespeare festival, told the Telegraph: “If a student of English literature doesn’t know that Titus Andronicus contains scenes of violence, they shouldn’t be on the course.” “This degree of sensitivity will inevitably curtail academic freedom. If the academic staff are concerned they might say something students find uncomfortable they will avoid doing it.” Gillian Evans, emeritus professor of medieval theology and intellectual history at Cambridge University, said the decision would probably leave academics “very annoyed”. The use of trigger warnings on university courses has garnered criticisms that universities are overprotective of students’ sensibilities. While trigger warnings have become increasingly pervasive in recent years, particularly in the US, concerns have been raised over their use in a rigorous academic context. Those in favour of trigger warnings argue that they are simply designed to protect individuals who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from becoming distressed when faced with stimuli that could evoke their personal experiences of trauma. Some mental health professionals have advised against trigger warnings on the basis that exposure to potentially uncomfortable discussions is more conducive to healing than avoidance. Another lecture on “Violence” and a seminar titled “Inhibiting the Body” also reportedly bore trigger warnings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/19/ofgem-tells-energy-firms-radical-change-in-the-sector-is-inevitable","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T14:22:29Z","webTitle":"Energy firms warned by watchdog of 'radical' change ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/19/ofgem-tells-energy-firms-radical-change-in-the-sector-is-inevitable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/19/ofgem-tells-energy-firms-radical-change-in-the-sector-is-inevitable","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms warned by watchdog of 'radical' change ahead","bodyText":"Electricity and gas companies have been bluntly warned that “change is coming” by the head of the UK’s energy regulator, who indicated that Theresa May’s proposed price cap was just one of the reforms planned to help consumers with their bills. Energy suppliers were put on notice that they face a range of radical reforms, including a potential rule change that would automatically switch customers to better deals without them taking action. “Change is coming whether the industry likes it or not,” Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, told energy firms in an impassioned speech, the tone of which sometimes bordered on anger. Nolan told industry representatives there was no point challenging price caps or the other reforms he was talking about. “To those who say they feel can’t do this in a world of more price regulation, I would say think again. These kinds of reforms are overdue. I don’t think the regulator or parliament will take no for an answer. So you might as well as embrace it, because change is coming.” Price caps for millions of households were just one of the big changes ahead, Nolan said, as he revealed Ofgem was considering a shakeup of rules that would allow new entrants into the market and even enable a customer to have more than one supplier. “One way to proceed is protecting consumers through a process of collective switching,” said Nolan, of a proposal to automatically shift thousands of people at a time off poor-value tariffs. “Rather than customers having to make an active choice as with conventional collective switches, the switch could be made on their behalf without them having to do anything. It’s a bit like allowing better deals to find customers, rather than customers having to find the better deals themselves.” Ofgem is at the very early stages of exploring the idea, which it admits would require primary legislation and buy-in from consumers. A spokesperson for one energy supplier said they were bemused by the suggestion, and that there was a risk customers would be upset at being switched to a company they had never heard of. The regulator’s address to an industry conference on Thursday comes in addition to the prime minister’s price cap, which is seen as the biggest intervention in the market since privatisation. Nolan said Ofgem thought “radical” changes might be needed, and that the regulator had been considering whether the model of having energy suppliers at the heart of the market was “still fit for purpose”. He said one of the most exciting emerging areas was peer-to-peer energy trading, where a householder could buy energy directly from a local power plant or electric car company. Such technology could allow customers to bypass traditional energy suppliers and even make them obsolete, he suggested. “Will these changes make suppliers’ role as middlemen less relevant and potentially even redundant?” he asked. He also fired a shot across the bows of companies which have suggested they might not cooperate with Ofgem over a price cap for a million vulnerable customers because of May’s plans for a much wider cap. Failure to work with Ofgem on the plans would be “spectacularly ill-advised”, he said. The big-six company E.ON would not be drawn on whether it would mount a legal challenge to the wider cap. Michael Lewis, its chief executive, said he would not answer such a hypothetical question. The British Gas owner, Centrica, also repeatedly refused to tell MPs on Tuesday whether it would rule out a challenge in the courts. Lewis said there was a real possibility that a wide cap would damage competition and reduce switching so much that it could become permanent. “If prices converge, there is a real danger the cap will need to be maintained in place.” The cap would last for a maximum of five years under draft legislation published last week. One of the smaller suppliers said that if the cap was set too low, big energy companies may shift jobs overseas. “When you start looking at the unintended consequences, we may suddenly find 20,000 jobs go offshore [to maintain margins and cut costs],” said David Bird, the chief executive of Co-Operative Energy. The company’s plans to create more community-owned green energy generation could be put at risk too, he said. “If we make no money in the supply business we won’t be able to do that.” Citizen’s Advice said that it received more calls about energy companies that any other industry apart from secondhand cars firms and builders. The group said it expected a wider cap would not take effect for at least 15 to 18 months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/19/arsenal-liverpool-christmas-eve-sky","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T12:31:55Z","webTitle":"Premier League opts against Christmas Eve fixtures after backlash from fans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/19/arsenal-liverpool-christmas-eve-sky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/19/arsenal-liverpool-christmas-eve-sky","fields":{"headline":"Premier League opts against Christmas Eve fixtures after backlash from fans","bodyText":"The Premier League fixture between Arsenal and Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium will not be moved to Christmas Eve after a backlash from supporters against the Sky TV-driven proposal.

Yet a report from Morgan Stanley – not usually the type to stick the knife into a flagship government policy – lays bare how this colossal sum has been almost entirely wasted. Those billions have not helped buyers. The money has gone almost entirely into the pockets of the giant housebuilding firms, which have raised the price of developments by almost exactly the amount made available by the government. All it has meant for first-time buyers is more misery – by pushing up house prices. Help to buy works by giving aspiring homeowners an interest-free government loan worth up to 20% of a property’s value – if the buyer opts for new-build. The idea was that it would provoke a wave of new building. But the Morgan Stanley report, headlined “The help to buy premium – and its unintended consequences”, drily unpicks the data, revealing how the beneficiaries have been the major developers. Researchers compared the price of new-build houses in 2013, when the scheme began, with the price of existing or “second-hand” houses. There has always been a small premium for new-build; people will pay extra for spanking-new kitchens and bathrooms. But since 2013, that premium has rocketed. “The divergence between new-build and second-hand prices is higher than it’s been since records began,” says the report. It says that the price of new-build has outstripped second-hand by 15% since the start of help to buy. “We are now around 5% points away from the level at which new-build prices have diverged by the full amount of the government’s equity loan (20% of house price across England).” Of course, Morgan Stanley didn’t produce this report for the likes of me to make a dig at the government. Its interest is in the share prices of the major housebuilders. It worries that the big builders won’t be able to get away with charging a premium of more than 20% for new-builds, and that the super- profits may be coming to a close. Make no mistake about just how much help to buy has fuelled developers’ profits. The new-build market is increasingly reliant on help to buy, with the large builders – Barratt, Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon – suggesting that about half of their volumes are help-to-buy purchases. And what a brilliant money-making wheeze it has been. Morgan Stanley says: “Help to buy (and broader house price inflation, among other things) have helped housebuilder earnings triple since its launch.” The builders will say the scheme has, indeed, provoked some supply, but evidence is thin. Morgan Stanley says: “Though it has helped drive supply, figures provide ammunition for critics who suggest it has pushed up prices, rather than making them more affordable.” Despite this, Hammond is preparing to bung another £10bn at the developers – perhaps to “give clarity and certainty” about the scheme – which even the rightwing Adam Smith Institute says is “like throwing petrol on to a bonfire”. But George Osborne didn’t need investment banks or thinktanks to tell him this back in 2013 when he launched this madness. Guardian Money at the time spoke to the people at the sharp end: young people excluded from the property market. Duncan Stott of the PricedOut group was particularly prescient: “Help to buy should really be called ‘help to sell’, as the main winners will be developers and existing homeowners who will find it easier to sell at inflated prices. Pumping more money into a housing market with chronic undersupply has one surefire outcome: house prices will go up.” But the government chooses to listen to the developers instead. Britain’s housing market is broken, and help to buy is just making it worse. p.collinson@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/19/oxford-accused-of-social-apartheid-as-colleges-admit-no-black-students","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T20:00:34Z","webTitle":"Oxford accused of 'social apartheid' as colleges admit no black students","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/19/oxford-accused-of-social-apartheid-as-colleges-admit-no-black-students","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/19/oxford-accused-of-social-apartheid-as-colleges-admit-no-black-students","fields":{"headline":"Oxford accused of 'social apartheid' as colleges admit no black students","bodyText":"Nearly one in three Oxford colleges failed to admit a single black British A-level student in 2015, with the university accused of “social apartheid” over its admissions policies by the former education minister David Lammy. The data shows that 10 out of 32 Oxford colleges did not award a place to a black British pupil with A-levels in 2015, the first time the university has released such figures since 2010. Oriel College only offered one place to a black British A-level student in six years. Similar data released by Cambridge revealed that six colleges there failed to admit any black British A-level students in the same year. Lammy first requested the ethnicity data from Oxford and Cambridge in 2016. While Cambridge provided it immediately, Oxford finally released it on Thursday after it was informed that the Guardian was preparing a story. As part of a set of data released by the two universities that also revealed a stark regional and socio-economic divide in their intake, the figures showed that just 1.5% of all offers from the two universities to UK A-level students went to black British candidates. Lammy said the figures showed that many colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge failed to reflect the UK’s population, and called into question the universities’ claims to national standing. “This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain,” Lammy said. The figures are the first to update the embarrassing data published in 2010 – after freedom of information requests by Lammy – that revealed Merton College, Oxford had not offered a single place to a black British student for five years. While the new data represents an improvement from before 2009 – when 21 Oxbridge colleges offered no places to black students, compared to 16 in 2015 – the figures suggest that elite colleges still struggle to recruit black British school pupils, especially from state schools. A handful of black British students – an average of 3.5 each year between 2010 and 2015 – who do not have A-levels gain places at Oxford. In most cases they come from independent schools that enter their pupils for alternative exams such as the international baccalaureate. The new figures also show that some parts of the country – especially disadvantaged regions of Wales and the north-west of England – have largely missed out on efforts by the two universities to widen their admissions base and admit students from outside the south of England. Only three Oxford colleges and six Cambridge colleges made at least one offer of an undergraduate place to a black British A-level student in each of the six years between 2010 and 2015. Oriel College, Oxford, made just one offer to a black British A-level student in the same period. Data released by Oxford after the Guardian’s inquiries showed three further black students with other qualifications were offered places at Oriel. “Difficult questions have to be asked, including whether there is systematic bias inherent in the Oxbridge admissions process that is working against talented young people from ethnic minority backgrounds,” said Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham and the first black Briton to attend Harvard Law School. Lammy noted that “there are almost 400 black students getting three As at A-level or better every year,” yet few of them are attracted to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. Around 3% of the British population identified as black in the last UK census. In response, a spokesperson for Oxford said rectifying the probem would be “a long journey that requires huge, joined-up effort across society – including from leading universities like Oxford – to address serious inequalities”. Oxford said students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds made up 15.9% of its 2016 UK undergraduate intake, up from 14.5% in 2015, and that offers to black students had more than doubled since 2010. Those figures include British Asian students and other minorities. “We’re also working with organisations such as Target Oxbridge and the newly formed Oxford black alumni network, to show talented young black people that they can fit in and thrive at a university like Oxford. All of this shows real progress and is something we want to improve on further,” the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Cambridge said that its admissions decisions were made on academic considerations alone, while spending £5m a year on access measures including work with black and minority ethnic school pupils. “The greatest barrier to participation at selective universities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds is low attainment at school. We assess the achievements of these students in their full context to ensure that students with great academic potential are identified,” the spokesperson said. “Widening participation further will require government, schools, universities, charities, parents and students to work closely together. We will continue to work hard with all parties to raise aspirations and attainment to improve access to higher education.” The data emerged after a long-running tussle between Lammy and Oxford, with Oxford refusing to publish detailed breakdowns of its admissions decisions by ethnic group despite repeated requests, including a direct approach by Lammy to Oxford’s vice-chancellor. Lammy’s initial request for the ethnicity data last year was refused by Oxford, despite Cambridge supplying the breakdown of offers and applications and Oxford itself having produced the same data in 2010. The former education minister – who has campaigned for years over widening access to top universities – remained unhappy that Oxford refused to release detailed figures showing offers to British students of Caribbean and African descent. The earlier data obtained by Lammy showed that only one black Briton of Caribbean descent had been accepted as an undergraduate at Oxford in 2009. “I have been pressuring the University of Oxford to publish this data for over a year and they have only begrudgingly decided to partially publish it now,” Lammy said, calling the university’s decision “defensive” and “evasive”. “While I am pleased that Oxford has backed down to avoid further embarrassment, I am disappointed that the university has combined all black people together into one group – why should they be the only institution that doesn’t break down data properly when you need granularity to understand different ethnic groups?” Oxford responded that it had offered to publish the limited data – aggregating black students into a single category – last year. “We made an offer to Mr Lammy in September 2016 to provide data about offers made to black and white candidates by college in each year. To break the information down further would allow the specific ethnic background of some individual students to be identified,” the university said. “This is not information the Data Protection Act allows us to disclose without the consent of the student.” Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, Lammy said: “I just don’t think the universities fully understand what they’re doing. Oxford spent £10m on this and what we’ve seen over the last decade... is we’ve gone backwards on social class, we’ve made no progress on north/south divide and we’ve made little progress on race.” He went on: “We have a huge chasm between a child in Salford last year, no offers at all, a child in Middlesborough - two offers to a child in Middlesborough in six years and children in the London borough of Richmond or Barnet for whom the success rate is considerable. “Many more children coming from London and the south east, the children of bankers, judges, making their way to Oxbridge but children in our housing estates even if they get three As they’re not able to get in.” Dr Samina Khan, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford University, told the programme: “We see a very different picture. If you look at the data correctly and properly, you’ll find poor students who get three As or more are more likely to get into Oxford than if you’re a more well off student. It’s a question of proportion more than looking at the raw numbers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/26/do-no-platform-policies-threaten-free-speech-at-uni-students-share-their-views","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T09:14:32Z","webTitle":"Do 'no platform' policies threaten free speech at university?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/26/do-no-platform-policies-threaten-free-speech-at-uni-students-share-their-views","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/26/do-no-platform-policies-threaten-free-speech-at-uni-students-share-their-views","fields":{"headline":"Do 'no platform' policies threaten free speech at university?","bodyText":"The debate on campus free speech was rekindled last week as Jo Johnson, the universities minister, announced that the newly created Office for Students will be given powers to fine, suspend or register universities which do not uphold “freedom of speech” on campus. The proposal would entail a clampdown on “safe spaces” and no platform policies. But what do students think about it? ‘No platforming is only a threat to hate speech’ Lucas North studies at the University of York The announcement has been dressed in the usual language around no platforming – that this is a free speech issue. And as usual, that’s not actually the case. No platforming is not a threat to free speech, it is only a threat to hate speech. No trans person feels free to speak against a celebrity transphobe. No Muslim student feels free to speak at an event led by someone whose only claim to fame comes from Islamophobia. Free speech is not under threat in our universities – our students are. ‘No platforming limits the intellectual lives of students’ David Troy is a PhD student at the University of Bristol I agree with the spirit of the new regulations, though ideally I would prefer a relentless student movement demanding our right to free speech and the freedom to hear controversial speech on our campuses. By restricting the speech that students can hear at university via no platforming, we are being restricted from developing our moral and debating muscles that we need to argue against and defeat racist, sexist, and discriminatory views. By no platforming, universities are limiting the intellectual lives of students and patronising them, suggesting that they don’t have the intellectual and moral rigour to hear controversial ideas and be able to judge their value in the marketplace of free ideas. With the exception of incitement to violence (which I think should hold criminal sanction), I believe any problems that arise from free speech can be countered by other free speech. ‘There is no intellectual gain in platforming bigoted speakers’ Guo Sheng Liu studies Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Oxford A society with laws against defamation and discrimination should know certain kinds of speech are harmful and intolerable. There is no intellectual gain in platforming and rewarding speakers for bigotry that is already debunked. And why should the principle of free speech trump the rights of oppressed groups? Allowing bigots to freely denounce our humanity is part of the reason why we trans people, for example, suffer from high rates of depression and suicidal attempts. Our lives matter. Given the national rise in hate crimes in recent years, Jo Johnson has his priorities all wrong. There is no need to “test” ideas that encourage discrimination, nor “expose” transparent prejudices. ‘Columnists are peddling a myth that students are uniquely sensitive’ Josh Salisbury is an MA history and politics student at the University of York In the free-speech-on-campus culture wars, there are two camps. The first will deny there is a problem of censorship on campus. The second will proclaim the death of free thought at university. The truth is somewhere in the middle. No platform policies have the potential to silence speakers without good reason, and have on occasion done so. We should recognise that, and challenge it. But there certainly isn’t the rampant censorship claimed by many columnists, peddling a myth that students are uniquely sensitive. Ironically, commentators often lump together many separate issues – no platform, trigger warnings, safe spaces – as if they were all equally censorious, stifling proper debate about their place. The government has also jumped on this “snowflake students” narrative, while demanding that universities uphold debate and simultaneously asking them to undermine free speech with the Prevent agenda. We ought to defend free speech on campus – but let’s be clear about what the genuine threats are, and their scale. ‘Free speech is ephemeral’ Clare Patterson studies English literature at the University of Glasgow Enforcing this ephemeral idea of “free speech” through legislation, against the will of students, is exactly the kind of government intervention that free speech activists should seek to prevent. The furore around this topic largely comes from white, male, well-off public figures who would have been students themselves at a time when most students also fit this description. The university landscape has changed since then; movements such as no platforming largely come from LGBT+, working class, disabled and BME students asking to be treated with respect, and I suspect that those in power feel uncomfortable seeing that students from marginalised backgrounds can actually have power.

I’m not condoning school-run drug-driving. But when he’s pulled over by an unmarked police car, he finds himself confronted not only by a copper, but by Gordon effing Ramsay, too. And a camera. He pulls his hoodie over his head. But while being tested, he gets chatting. Well, it’s not every day you meet a celebrity chef in a police car “What’s made you get involved in this initiative then?” he asks. “Erm, cocaine,” says Gordon, unforthcomingly. “Yeah? What, you recovering?” “Nah.” “Trying to get some?” Ha! “Nah, nah.” “What then?” “Lost a dear friend.” “Ah, sorry mate,” says the man, sounding genuinely sorry. The friend Gordon lost was chef David Dempsey, who fell to his death in 2003 after a bad reaction to adulterated cocaine. Now Gordon has made a documentary about the drug, Gordon Ramsay on Cocaine (ITV). Which sounds like the answer to a question like, ‘What’s your worst nightmare in the kitchen?’ Jamie Oliver on speed, Heston Blumenthal on crystal meth, or Gordon Ramsay on cocaine? Ramsay says he doesn’t take cocaine, but it seems everyone else does, especially in the restaurant business, and in his own restaurants. He goes round the loos of one of them, with special wipes that turn blue on contact with coke. In the staff loos, in the customer loos, the wipes go blue, as does the air. “This is a day they shouldn’t be doing coke, it’s [beep]ing Sunday,” says Ramsay, implying that a line or two on any other day is not as bad. That’s someone else I feel sorry for – the beeper-outer. They’ve got their work cut out in this one. In fact they hadn’t quite finished in the preview version I saw; about halfway through the beeping stops and cluster F-bombs rain down. Maybe they just gave up, too much work. Anyway, Gordon’s managers do their best to look shocked by the blue wipes. Cocaine? In the restaurant business? Are you sure? Then Gordon heads to the south coast to catch drivers on cocaine, including our hoodied friend. And a man named Matthew, who admits he last did some cocaine on Sunday. Again! What’s wrong with these people, snorting on a Sunday. It’s not clear what day it is today, and in the end Matthew doesn’t have enough in his system to be prosecuted. Still, Gordon offers advice: “Matthew, get help, please.” Then it gets fun. “Any professional chef worth his salt goes to the source,” says Gordon. “So I want to know what goes into this drug.” Now he’s on a plane to Colombia, then driving into the jungle, on roads that turn into tracks, then just a path, so he has to walk. It’s made to look as if he’s on his own, trekking into the wild in search of the source. Eventually he finds it. A man named Jose shows him his covert coca plantation, then takes him to his jungle lab to show him the process, share the recipe. Roughly chop a large quantity of coca leaves, add a few cupfuls of cement, then sulphuric acid, put in a barrel, douse with petrol and leave to marinate. Then add 20cl (at last a precise quantity, up to here it was all a bit Jamie and haphazard) of battery acid, and siphon off the clear cocaine water from the bottom of the barrel. Beeping hell, the stuff that goes into it! If the death, misery and war isn’t enough to put you off, maybe the ingredients will – although I think Heston might quite enjoy the process. Finally, add a sprinkle of bicarbonate of soda, simmer gently, skimming off scum, then leave to rest. For which Jose gets about 30 quid a week as well as risking a 20-year jail term. Yeah, Gordon, this really is hell’s kitchen. Maybe you should take Jose and his family back home, give him a job at Maze. First, though, there’s another episode, in which Gordon will spend time with the Colombian police. There’ll be helicopters, cartels. It looks like next week it’s going to go proper Narcos. I think I know what’s going to happen. The temptation will be too much for Gordon – not to take cocaine, but when he sees how much money these people make he’ll want a piece of it. It’s got to be easier than running restaurants and swearing on reality TV. So he won’t come back, he’ll grow a moustache, live in a fortified palace in the jungle. They’ll call him El Cocinero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/19/care-system-looked-after-children-foster-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T15:36:15Z","webTitle":"Why are we so down on our care system?

Foster parents gave me a happy home","bodyText":"The number of children in care in England has gone up for the ninth successive year, and stood at 72,670 at the end of March, according to figures published last week. There are many reasons to feel sad and angry about this, with local authority leaders blaming rising poverty levels and singling out universal credit delays as one reason why vulnerable families are finding life increasingly difficult. But we should not assume that being taken into care means that these children’s lives are blighted for ever. We are constantly bombarded by stories and statistics that reinforce a widespread negative impression of children growing up in care. “In England, children in care are five times more likely to be cautioned or convicted of an offence than children in the general population,” asserted a Prison Reform Trust report earlier this year, while homeless charity Shelter has found that “between a quarter and a third of all people sleeping on the streets have spent time as children being ‘looked after’ by local authorities”. Half of children in care agree with the statement “People think that it is children’s fault that they are in care”, according to a recent report from Become, the charity for children in care and care leavers. So great was the stigma associated with being “in care”, that following the 1989 Children Act, professionals and others were encouraged to refer to “looked-after children” instead. Such negative images have an effect on kids in care. Kids such as me, who have never thought that they would go to prison and have always wanted to achieve highly within education. Some of the 72,670 children in local authority care have undoubtedly experienced difficulties and many will experience more. But each one of them also has enormous potential. It often feels as though the media, and by extension the public, are only interested in the system’s failures and not in young people such as me, who are thriving, with futures that look bright. Rather than focusing on the care system’s flaws, it is important to appreciate what a vital resource it is. I believe the problems of people who have grown up in care stem predominantly from their experiences before they entered the system, and from the damage done early on that cannot easily, or sometimes ever, be reversed. In particular, we should recognise the progress of recent years. Before the Children (Leaving Care) Act of 2000, care leavers frequently received inadequate support, as this was provided at local authorities’ discretion. Many young people were thrust out of the care system without financial support or emotional guidance. The 2000 act forced authorities to provide care leavers with support until the age of 21. As an 18-year-old care leaver today, this change has ensured that I continue to excel within education and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that there are people I can turn to for advice. The act has allowed me to continue to live at home with my loving foster parents, rather than being forced to live independently before I am ready. The support that the UK provides for care leavers can be appreciated further when it is compared to the support that other countries provide. In Israel there was no specific foster care law until 2016, while a 2010 study by the University of York discovered that Albanian children are expected to become completely self-sufficient from the age of 15. Another positive development in the UK is the requirement that all local authorities have a “children in care council”, meaning they must actively listen to the voices of children and young people in care, and give those who are most affected by decisions a say in decision-making. When I chaired the one in York I was involved in the recruitment and training of key professionals, and developed campaigns to combat the stigma faced by children growing up in care. Such councils serve to remind professionals of their purpose. Of course, the UK does not have a perfect care system. There is vast room for improvement. However, those of us who have grown up in care, and had good experiences, would like those experiences to be represented alongside less positive portrayals, so we no longer feel invisible. Above all, it’s worth reflecting on how far we have moved on from the care system of the past. The care system is a work in progress and more changes need to be made: for example, extending the age of support for care leavers to 25, and ensuring that kinship care is promoted and kinship carers are entitled to the same support as foster carers. The care system needs to become more standardised to ensure all children and young people in care can expect the same treatment, regardless of their local authority, rather than the current acceptance that different levels of service are offered. This could be achieved if the government were to create clear primary legislation that outlines the key principles that all local authorities must adhere to, as was the case with the Children (Leaving Care) Act. But I believe that progress is being made, in the UK and also internationally. We mustn’t believe that it is beyond our reach to build a care system that can help make up for the disadvantage faced by young people who, for whatever reason, are unable to live with their biological parents. • Amy-Jo Mook is a care leaver and former chair of York’s Children in Care council"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/30/uk-music-venues-exclude-disabled-people","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T07:25:50Z","webTitle":"UK music venues still exclude disabled performers, audience members and staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/30/uk-music-venues-exclude-disabled-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/30/uk-music-venues-exclude-disabled-people","fields":{"headline":"UK music venues still exclude disabled performers, audience members and staff","bodyText":"Talking to a talented disabled musician recently, I was struck by her struggle to even book a ticket for a concert without rounds of form filling and phone calls to get into a venue with her carer. As the chief executive of the Bristol Music Trust, a charity that delivers access to music, I hear stories like this too often. Too often, the onus is on the disabled community to fight its corner where music is concerned and this simply isn’t good enough. Why should members of the British Paraorchestra, for example, be unable to share their talent across the UK simply because their wheelchairs have prevented them from getting on stage in many venues? It’s been over a year since an Arts Council commissioned study by disabled musicians’ group Attitude is Everything (AIE) found disabled access among live music venues and festivals was severely lacking. They found that just one fifth of music venues provided disabled access information classified as good, with one third of venues shockingly having no available access information at all. These findings should be extremely concerning to a sector that likes to think of itself as open-minded and inclusive. Our trust is leading efforts to make Colston Hall in Bristol the most disability-friendly music venue in the UK for performers and guests.With funding from the government, Arts Council England, trusts, and corporate businesses, we are close to raising £48m towards the redevelopment of Colston Hall into a fully accessible venue with ramps for the audience, ramps for performers on stage and off stage and flexible seating arrangements so everyone can watch a show. Many music and festival venues have committed to improving their record on accessibility since the Arts Council report by joining AIE’s charter of best practice, but there too little emphasis on action. The groups that we work with are often isolated, so it is all the more important that we push ourselves to do things better. A lack of inclusivity is endemic throughout the music industry and not just for concertgoers and musicians. In 2016, Arts Council England reported (pdf) that just 4% of people working in the arts and museums sector are disabled, more than four times lower than the UK workforce as a whole. The figures for some of the UK’s best known venues are even lower than 4%. We welcome the government’s recent commitments to ensuring a high-quality arts sector is accessible to all. Matt Hancock, minister for digital, and Penny Mordaunt, minister for disabled people, have both been particularly vocal in their support for greater inclusivity in education and employment. But there is still a long way to go to turn these positive noises into tangible action that will make a difference to the lives of disabled musicians and music lovers.

Whether you’re LeBron James and Steph Curry or Miles Davis and Charlie Parker – any talent meeting other talent – there’s an inborn, healthy competitive nature. But black talent has a cultural specificity. We have a particular genius for improvisation, from preachers in the pulpit to pianists.” This theory became part of the thinking behind Black Mary, a short film Joseph produced for Tate Modern this year as part of the exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power. Billed as having been inspired by the photography of Roy DeCarava, who shot portraits of jazz musicians in the 40s, 50s and 60s, Joseph’s film is a five-minute-long cut of a jam session he put together mostly in Harlem this year. And like any jam session, he says, it was casual; he texted Lauryn Hill inviting her and Kelsey Lu (a friend and a “musical genius”). He also asked his wife, the producer Onye Anyanwu, to call their friend, the singer Alice Smith, whom he has seen live and been blown away by. Joseph captured the whole thing on film and cut it into two films sharing what he describes as “one narrative universe”: the first was Black Mary’s haunting reworking of Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ I Put a Spell on You for the Tate; the second was Fly Paper, a 20-minute installation that features as part of Joseph’s recently opened exhibition Shadow Play at the New Museum on the Bowery in New York. Hill’s part has been cut down to about 15 seconds in Fly Paper, showing how uninterested Joseph is with the idea of celebrity. When he was contacted by Beyoncé, for example, he wasn’t really interested. “It wasn’t until she really came at me and said: ‘I wanna collaborate with you, versus you work for me,’ then I was, like, let’s talk.” At the time, Beyoncé’s 2016 concept album Lemonade was still in the works, but she believed it was going to be “more profound” than some of her other work. Joseph agreed to collaborate on what became the 60-minute, 11-chapter film that accompanied the album. “The whole thing was my idea,” he says. “I helped her think through how to present it as a visual project and the people to cast, such as Trayvon Martin’s mom and Serena Williams.” But ask him what he thinks of the result and he is indifferent: “I don’t even know what she ended up doing. By the time it came out, I was working on something else,” he shrugs. Joseph was born in Seattle in 1981, but now lives in California. He got his start working as an intern for a post-production house in Los Angeles. “I was 18 or 19 and really inspired by music videos, big time. I never forget someone higher up asked, ‘Who do you wanna work for?’ And, because I was black, they were like, ‘Spike Lee?’” Joseph replied that who he really wanted to work for was Hype Williams, the director of some of Missy Elliott, Kanye West and Beyoncé’s most memorable videos. Not long after, Joseph landed a spot as an assistant on one of Williams’ shoots; “PA-ing is like being a gopher – you pick up the garbage. It’s a high turnover rate because no one wants to do it for ever, but that’s how I started and it’s the best thing I ever did.” When Joseph began producing his own work, it earned him industry respect (although not from Williams, whom he bumped into recently and who didn’t know he had directed Lemonade). Back in 2012, a powerful film with Flying Lotus called Until the Quiet Comes set his visual tone: a flickering and ethereal portrait of young, black LA kids drenched in sunlight, which then takes a sinister turn as a simulated shooting. The New Yorker critic Hilton Als wrote about how it restored his faith in the music video. Joseph has since directed videos for FKA Twigs’ 2014 Video Girl, had a short film inspired by Kendrick Lamar exhibit at the Infinite Mix in London, and more recently collaborated with Sampha on the experimental film Process, shot between Freetown, Sierra Leone and south London, to accompany the artist’s Mercury award-winning album of the same name. Pegging Joseph as a music video director doesn’t sit well with him, however. He identifies more with visual artists, bringing up Jean-Michel Basquiat, Warhol and Twombly in quick succession. Joseph’s journey into the art world, like Basquiat’s, didn’t happen right away, he points out. Both were untrained, both came through other mediums: “Basquiat was a graffiti artist, [but] that doesn’t mean his artworks were glorified graffiti.” It was Joseph’s late younger brother, the fine artist and curator Noah Davis, who was a catalyst in helping him realise his potential as an artist. “He saw something I was working on that was, in my mind, nowhere near art, and he said: ‘You should make this into an installation.’ I responded with such apathy, it almost felt disappointing that’s what it would have to become, like it wasn’t working as what I was trying to do.” The project in question comprised two films, a video installation Joseph was working on with Lamar for his support on Kanye’s Yeezy tour, and the film, m.A.A.d, which includes eerie footage of Compton. m.A.A.d is a two-channel short film that was first shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2015. It was a turning point for Joseph, who was able to recognise that the boundary between different forms of video was only ever self-imposed: “I was, like: ‘Wow, I feel way more full as a creative person in this space than all these other spaces I was trying to fit myself into.’ Those boxes are small. Even feature film, it has to be a certain length. But in the art space it can be 25 seconds or five hours, and that makes sense to me.” Rather than “this is a music video, this is a fashion film, this is a documentary”, Joseph says, making films for the gallery space has allowed him to see that “anything is possible now – it’s about ideas and I’m really excited by that”.

In a teasing tweet that captured growing business anxiety over the direction of talks, the US bank’s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, wrote on Thursday that he expected to be “spending a lot more time” in Frankfurt from now on. Blankfein’s comment suggested that with no clarity on a Brexit deal, the US investment bank is ready to make its contingency plans a reality. The timing of the intervention coincided with the European council summit in Brussels, where leaders of other EU countries are expected to rebuff May’s appeal for trade talks. Goldman has hitherto run much of its European business from headquarters in London, like most investment banks, but has been increasingly vocal about the need to move operations to the EU if Britain leaves the single market without a replacement trade deal in place. Two weeks ago it revealed it was leasing eight floors in a new Frankfurt tower block that could soon hold up to 1,000 staff. It currently employs 6,000 people in the UK, where it has been expanding offices on Fleet Street, versus just 200 in the German financial centre. Responding to the tweet, a Downing Street spokesman said: “We’re not going to comment on an individual statement. But let’s be clear, London is and will remain the world’s leading financial centre. “We have the breadth of talent, legal system, regulation and deep pools of capital that are simply unrivalled by centres anywhere else in Europe and we are confident of securing an ambitious economic partnership with the EU that will include financial services.” Tarnished by the banking crash, the face of Wall Street’s most controversial investment bank may still have limited political influence among voters, but Blankfein’s intervention comes amid growing signs of business drying up across Britain. A report due out on Monday from the Engineering Employers’ Federation (EEF) is expected to show that half of manufacturers are putting investment on hold as politicians increasingly talk of a “no-deal” Brexit. The annual EEF survey found a third of companies said that they were committed to current plans but awaiting a Brexit deal before investing further, with a further 13% revealing they were now holding off on all investment. More dire business warnings are expected on Friday from other employers’ groups in Britain if the EU summit fails to generate any good news on the direction of Brexit talks. But it is the sight of leading international business figures now openly mocking Britain’s position that could cause most short-term anxiety, especially given their role in steering broader investment sentiment. This month Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, warned that City firms would activate their Brexit contingency plans if there was no deal on a transition period by Christmas. Major banks including JP Morgan, Standard Chartered and Bank of America are among those to announce plans to expand operations in other European cities to deal with the aftermath of Brexit. Frankfurt is one of the frontrunners among a host of European cities hoping to attract banking and financial services jobs away from London after Brexit, as firms seek guaranteed access to the single market. Dublin, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Luxembourg are also vying for City jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/19/british-banks-trusted-nationalise-city-profits-communities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T18:12:10Z","webTitle":"British banks can’t be trusted – let’s nationalise them | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/british-banks-trusted-nationalise-city-profits-communities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/19/british-banks-trusted-nationalise-city-profits-communities","fields":{"headline":"British banks can’t be trusted – let’s nationalise them","bodyText":"Sometimes the case for a policy is as overwhelming as the level of ridicule it will get from the punditocracy. The nationalisation of Britain’s failed banking industry – the sector responsible for most of our country’s current ills – is one such example. According to a recent poll, half the electorate support nationalising the banks, despite almost no one arguing for such a policy in public life. It may well be because the banks plunged Britain into one of its worst economic crises in modern history, spawning, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, perhaps our worst squeeze in living standards since the 1750s. The fact that they have been bailed out by the taxpayer but allowed to carry on as though little happened – including more top British bankers in 2013 being gifted bonuses worth over €1m than all EU countries combined – while public services are gratuitously slashed, has rightly riled some British voters. Nationalisation of the banks is not about vengeance, though. Sure, the rip-off inefficiency of rail privatisation, or the failure of the great energy sell-off, or the fact that even the Financial Times has argued that privately run water is an indefensible debacle – all are testament to the intellectual poverty of the “private good, public bad” argument. None quite compete, however, with the matter of the banks leaving the entire western world consumed with the gravest series of crises since the second world war. Would Brexit, Donald Trump, or the gathering demands for Catalonia to secede from crisis-ridden Spain have happened without the financial collapse? Almost certainly not. It is now somewhat darkly comic to note that most commentators and politicians claimed Labour lost the 2015 election because it was too leftwing. It is notable, then, that over four in 10 voters back then believed Labour was too soft on banks and big business, compared to just over one in five who differed. Economist Laurie Macfarlane says the banks make a mockery of the nostrums of free-market capitalism. Because the banks were given state bailouts after their catastrophic failures, there is the assumption that, when another crisis hits, the same will happen again. No other industry enjoys the same protection. They are “too big to fail”, which means they benefit from an implicit subsidy – worth £6bn in 2015. The Bank of England is their lender of last resort. State-backed deposit insurance of up to £85,000 per consumer is another de facto mass public subsidy. As the New Economics Foundation says, it is commercial banks who are now responsible for creating the vast majority of money in economies like the UK, a source of vast profit. This is called “seigniorage” and – as the foundation puts it – it represents a “hidden annual subsidy” of £23bn a year, or nearly three-quarters of the banks’ after-tax profits. And banks are an essential public utility: it is almost impossible to be a citizen without a bank account, and there is no public option when it comes to making electronic payments. Even now, as Macfarlane notes, the British state technically owns a fifth of the retail banking industry because of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Repeated RBS scandals, and the aftermath of the EU referendum result, have dented the worth of the company’s shares, meaning that the state selling its stake would result in eye-watering losses. Meanwhile, small businesses have struggled to get the credit they need, and escalating household debt threatens the foundations of the stagnating British economy. But the state’s arms-length approach means RBS has failed both its customers and the broader economy. A profit-driven banking sector closed 1,150 branches in 2014 and 2015; about a third of those were owned by RBS. The bank once promised never to close the last branch in town; the pledge was broken, and 1,500 communities have been left with no bank branch. Vulnerable customers and small businesses inevitably suffer the most. By contrast, foreign publicly owned banks are self-evident successes. Take Germany: KFW, the government-owned development bank, is crucial in developing national infrastructure as well as the renewable energy revolution. On a regional level, state-owned Landesbanken are responsible for industrial strategy. Then at the most local level, there are Sparkassen: they focus on developing relationships with local businesses and consumers. They’re not beholden to shareholders – instead, they have a stakeholder model, focused on helping local economies – indeed, their capital has to remain in local communities. It is impossible to understand Britain’s current plight without examining the country’s rapid deindustrialisation in favour of a financial sector concentrated in London and the south-east. And according to New Economics Foundation, while foreign stakeholder banks lend two thirds of their assets to individuals and businesses in the real economy, that’s true with only a tiny proportion of British shareholder banks. Overwhelmingly, it goes to mortgage lending and lending to other financial institutions. Our current banking system is rigged in favour of a crisis-ridden City. The New Economics Foundation suggests transforming RBS – in which the state still has a three-quarter share – into a network of local banks. Labour’s 2017 manifesto backed a review into these plans. A management board would run the network day to day, but a board of trustees would ensure the bank was accountable to the broader economy and customers, not shareholders. A third would be elected by workers, a third by local authorities and a third by local stakeholders. The mandate of each local bank would be to promote local economies – not least their small businesses – rather than the City of London. Here is a model of democratic ownership that can, in time, be extended to the rest of the economy. Can it really be argued that private ownership of the banks is a case study of the glorious success of free market capitalism? The principle architect of Labour’s recent manifesto, Andrew Fisher, called for the nationalisation of Britain’s banking sector in his 2014 book The Failed Experiment: And How to Build an Economy That Works. He was surely right then and he is right now. As Macfarlane notes, there are different possible routes to the banks’ nationalisation: whether it be swapping corporate shares for government bonds, using quantitative easing to buy up shares, or simple nationalisation without compensation. Labour is right to call for a German-style public investment bank, backed up by similar publicly run local banks. But such proposals are not in themselves sufficient. Britain’s privately run banks have proved a disaster for everyone except their shareholders. The only good alternative is public stakeholder banks, run by workers, consumers and local authorities, with an obligation to defend the best interests of our communities. Privately owned banks have proved a catastrophic failure – for our economy, our social cohesion and our politics. There is surely no alternative to public ownership. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/19/uk-thrown-wedding-ring-eu-divorce-not-inevitable-brexit-change-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T13:20:52Z","webTitle":"Yes, we’ve thrown the wedding ring at the EU.

But divorce isn’t inevitable","bodyText":"As the storm clouds gather over Brexit, the EU withdrawal bill has been delayed a second time while the government tries to persuade backbench Tories to revoke their support for amendments that would allow MPs to block a “no deal” Brexit. The ever-sane Conservative MPs Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry have put their names to an amendment that would provide that any final deal must be approved by a separate act of parliament. This is more than parliament parking its constitutional tanks on the government’s lawn: it means that if, as seems increasingly likely, the only option on offer is a disastrous, no-deal Brexit, MPs can require the government to think again. These amendments prompt the question: haven’t we already bound ourselves to leave the EU, by triggering article 50? The answer is no, probably not. No one has ever tested exactly what article 50 means before, because no one has ever used it, so anything that a lawyer says about its reversibility is informed speculation. But most EU lawyers think that having given notification of intention to withdraw from the EU under article 50 doesn’t actually bind us to doing it. Article 50 is a provision for withdrawal from the EU, not expulsion from it. We are the petitioners here. If parliament decides that having thought it through, we would be mad to leave and wants to call it off, then there is a short window in which the court of justice of the EU would probably rule that we can. That is, we can decide to stay unilaterally, without asking the European council, or the commission, or the EU27, for permission. The frequently used divorce metaphor is helpful here. All we have done is tell the EU we are unhappy and plan to go. Our relationship has not yet reached the point of no return. True, we have thrown the wedding ring at them and said we’re off. We have instructed lawyers. We have lodged the petition. But we have not yet annulled the marriage. If the UK changes its mind before the end of the two-year notice period, then, (most lawyers think, not to mention Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50), we can simply say we have changed our minds, and we want to stay. EU law means never having to say you’re sorry. At the moment, public opinion indeed seems resigned to leaving the EU. But that could change. Then MPs, too, may very rapidly decide that Theresa May was wrong to say that the best alternative to a poor deal is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. The best alternative is to change our mind and stay. But whose mind matters: parliament’s, or the prime minister’s? Here the law is clear. It is parliament, and not the cabinet, which is in the driving seat. The Grieve amendment is not about asking for parliament to have a vote on the final outcome: it is about saving the government from themselves, by pointing out that, in the absence of parliamentary authority, the prime minister cannot take us out of the EU. How are hard Brexiters responding to this? At the moment, by putting their fingers in their ears and saying “too late”. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the Andrew Marr show last Sunday that parliament could have no mechanism to keep Britain in the EU beyond 30 March 2019. He claimed that “parliament has already voted for leaving the European Union”. He’s wrong – not only because no parliament can prevent a future one from changing its mind, but because parliament has not yet even voted to leave the EU: all that the prime minister has done so far is give notice of the current government’s present intention to leave. After the referendum, Gina Miller and others challenged the government’s assertion that it could trigger Brexit on the basis of the referendum result alone, without further parliamentary authority. The supreme court pointed out that the EU Referendum Act had done no more than allow the government to hold an advisory referendum. It was parliament which made EU law part of UK law and so only parliament could take us out of the EU and stop EU law applying directly in the UK. So under current law we are part of the EU, and ultimately, the decision to leave the EU must be taken by parliament. If parliament wishes, it can instruct the prime minister of the day – whoever he or she may be – to inform the EU that we will not, after all, be leaving. If the government tries to take us out of the EU without a deal approved by parliament, there will certainly be another outing for constitutional lawyers to refight the English civil war. • Helen Mountfield is a QC at Matrix Chambers.

There is only ice-cream” is the darkly humorous sign off used in a recent ad for fast-growing American ice-cream brand Halo Top. The Black Mirror-style commercial, which ran in US cinemas before films including the horror flick It, features an elderly woman being force-fed ice-cream by a robot in some dystopian future. It was directed by Mike Diva, who has built a YouTube following with his advertising parodies, and who typifies the offbeat digital marketing aimed at millennials that has helped turn Halo Top into serious competition for bestselling brands such as Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs. The Los Angeles-based company was founded at the start of the decade by Justin Woolverton, a former lawyer who had a sweet tooth but was worried about sugar. So he bought a $20 ice-cream maker on Amazon and began trying to create healthier alternatives. “It was just something that I was making in my kitchen because I didn’t like sugar,” he told one interviewer about his Eureka moment. While most ice-creams are a sugar and fat-laden treat, Halo Top bills itself as a “low-calorie, high-protein and low-sugar” alternative to mainstream brands, with flavours such as mochi green tea and rainbow swirls. Its recipe uses sugar substitute Stevia, which means a scoop of its Vanilla Ice contains 60 calories versus 250 in a similar sized dollop of Häagen-Dazs. Reports in the US media have begun to question whether Halo Top is really as healthy as the marketing makes out, with some dieticians raising concerns about the use of artificial sweeteners. Halo Top is now stocked in supermarkets across America, with the company shifting nearly $50m (£38m) worth of ice-cream in the US last year. Its sales accelerated in 2016 after GQ writer Shane Snow lived on Halo Top ice-cream for 10 days and the resulting article went viral. The brand’s rise has been propelled by social media: it has 590,000 followers on Instagram and more than 700,000 on Facebook. The social media buzz helped Halo Top chalk up another milestone in the summer when industry data showed its pint pots were outselling Unilever’s Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Nestlé’s Häagen-Dazs in US grocery stores for the first time. Halo Top’s parent company, LA-based Eden Creamery, is seizing the day with one recent report suggesting it is exploring a sale that could value the company at up to $2bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/19/ministers-paving-way-for-tyranny-by-ignoring-universal-credit-vote-edward-leigh","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T11:53:53Z","webTitle":"Andrea Leadsom 'paved way for tyranny' over universal credit vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/19/ministers-paving-way-for-tyranny-by-ignoring-universal-credit-vote-edward-leigh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/19/ministers-paving-way-for-tyranny-by-ignoring-universal-credit-vote-edward-leigh","fields":{"headline":"Andrea Leadsom 'paved way for tyranny' over universal credit vote","bodyText":"The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has been accused by senior Conservatives MPs of paving the way for “tyranny”, after the government whipped its MPs to abstain on a Labour motion on universal credit. Leadsom faced criticism from some Conservative MPs after saying the government was not bound by the resolution, which called for the rollout of the controversial welfare changes to be paused. Sir Edward Leigh, the veteran MP for Gainsborough, said: “The road to tyranny is paved by executives ignoring parliaments.” Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the house, pressed Leadsom on the government’s response. “This is where we make the law. This is not a school debating chamber. This is a disorganised government, disrespectful to the house,” she said. “I know the government didn’t want to hear about people in rent arrears struggling to feed their families when they’re in work, but that’s the reality when government policy is failing.” Leadsom also confirmed that the EU withdrawal bill would not return to the House of Commons next week, and pointed to long breaks of up to 10 weeks at the same stage of other recent constitutional bills, such as the Human Rights Act and the Fixed Term Parliament Act. “It should be reassuring to the house to know that the government is looking very carefully at those amendments and clauses. I would like to point out to members across the house that there is nothing odd at all about a pause between second reading and committee of the whole house,” she said. The EU bill delay and the government’s decision to ignore the universal credit motion underline the challenges of governing without a secure majority. Jeremy Corbyn’s party is seeking to exploit the government’s weakness and press home the arguments made during the general election campaign by holding a series of debates on key social policy issues. Labour’s motion on universal credit passed unanimously on Wednesday night despite the concerns of several Conservative rebels, but some Tory MPs were infuriated by being urged by their own side to ignore it. Announcing parliamentary business for the week ahead, Leadsom repeatedly insisted that the government was listening to MPs’ concerns about universal credit, but Leigh said the secretary of state for work and pensions, David Gauke, should be forced to respond formally. “I do urge my right honourable friend to listen to parliament, and I urge the secretary of state to come to parliament and make a statement, and it should be a statement full of meat,” he said. His own party would be outraged if a future minority Labour government ignored parliament in this way, he added. Citing Gauke’s announcement that the universal credit helpline would be made free to use, Leadsom said: “This government is very clearly listening to parliament, and has very clearly taken action as a result of concerns raised in this house.“DWP ministers will come back to the chamber to update members across the house on the progress with rolling out universal credit.” Another MP, the avid Brexiter Peter Bone, said ministers should be obliged to respond to resolutions such as Wednesday’s with a statement to parliament within 12 weeks. “We cannot ignore the will of the house,” he said. At the regular lobby briefing with journalists, the prime minister’s spokeswoman said ministers’ participation in the debate showed they were not being disrespectful. “What would be disrespectful would be not to participate in the debate,” she said. “The secretary of state opened the debate and a minister of state closed it, and MPs from all sides took part and it was a five-hour debate. David Gauke was also in front of the select committee. We took part fully in the debate.” Ministers would be keeping the policy under review ahead of the next stage of the rollout in January, she said. “From our perspective, what’s important is that universal credit is working,. Yesterday the secretary of state made some announcements and we do not have anything further to add on that. We are listening to concerns and we will continue to do so, as it continues to roll out. We will keep it under review.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/what-really-thinking-older-man-offered-seat-on-bus","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-04T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"What I’m really thinking: the older man offered a seat on the bus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/what-really-thinking-older-man-offered-seat-on-bus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/what-really-thinking-older-man-offered-seat-on-bus","fields":{"headline":"What I’m really thinking: the older man offered a seat on the bus","bodyText":"The teenager who offers me her seat is pretty, I notice. Am I still allowed to notice that? With the warmest of smiles, she rises and steps into the aisle with courtesy bordering on a curtsey. I am wrong-footed, then conflicted. “No,” I scream silently, stifling an internal laugh, “I come from a generation where I do that for you.” I realise immediately what a strange and bygone place that is. Speech fails me; I burn with embarrassment and confusion. Later, I reflect that this is an act of unfettered kindness, an example of the goodness of a maligned generation. I bow in recognition, but feel bowed with shame. I am fit, able, strong. In my head, I am young; she shocks me by making me so acutely aware of my advancing years. To accept the seat is to accept that new status – elderly, needy, requiring care – a status I am not yet ready to embrace. To decline is to snub an act of generosity. To prevaricate is to appear ungrateful and , ungraciously dithery. To explain, on a crowded bus, is impossible. This dilemma is played out before the other passengers, whose inquisitiveness is that of doleful, cud-chewing cattle. What if, once I am seated, an older person boards and no one gives up their seat? Do I remain motionless and burn with shame, or stand and relinquish my newly received gift – a slap in the face for the kindly girl? I manoeuvre awkwardly into the seat, smile and sink my head on to my chest, in childlike submission to a world that has consigned me to a new role. The bus stumbles to a halt.

It’s there from the opening seconds, when we find our Norse god dangling before some horned demon, whose portentous monologuing is undercut by Thor’s continual interruptions, as he slowly spins around on his chains: “Hang on a minute… coming round again.” For a relative newcomer to the Earth, Thor has clearly got the knack of 21st-century comic timing. That’s the general register of this entertaining but frankly inconsequential Marvel movie. It’s what you’d call a “romp” – and one whose lurid 1980s-retro stylings bring it closer to the Guardians of the Galaxy end of the spectrum, though its spiritual forebears would also include Mike Hodges’ Flash Gordon, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, and possibly Red Dwarf. Comic-book movies have spent a long time striving to be taken as serious, grownup entertainment but Thor: Ragnarok is almost an admission that you can’t play this material straight. This is probably the wisest strategy with Thor. Despite his Avenger status, he has never felt particularly key to proceedings in the ever-unfolding Marvel Universe. His fantasy realm does not easily intersect with our own, and his last solo movie – Thor: The Dark World – was probably the weakest Marvel instalment to date. So this time they’ve brought in New Zealander director Taika Waititi, best known for lovable, considerably smaller-scale movies like Hunt for the Wilderpeople and vampire spoof What We Do in the Shadows. Waititi infuses proceedings with that familiar, generously self-deprecating Kiwi wit, nowhere more so than in his own scene-stealing voice turn as a cheery blue rock monster. He also unlocks untapped comedy reserves in Chris Hemsworth, who diffuses his character’s beefcake machismo with a quick tongue and a barely concealed insecurity – he’s like Ben Stiller in the body of Dolph Lundgren. Thor’s family problems are at the root of this busy saga. His adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is up to his usual tricks, on top of which they discover they have an elder sister: Hela, the goddess of death. (Norse scholars look away now.) Played by Cate Blanchett, with emo eye makeup and spiky antlers, she’s like a Norse Maleficent. While she sets about tearing up Asgard, Thor and Loki find themselves stranded on a brightly coloured planet that looks as if it’s made from the discarded sets of 1980s TV shows. Its face-painted, thrift-store-coutured inhabitants could be refugees from New Wave synth bands. (The score is by Devo’s Mark Mothersbaugh, which makes this OK.) That the ruler of this planet is Jeff Goldblum with a blue stripe down his chin is entirely appropriate, if not particularly scary. He condemns the captive Thor to gladiatorial combat – where his foe turns out to be “a friend from work”. If you’ve seen the trailer, this is not a spoiler. Fans will be satisfied at the most fleshed-out performance of Hulk we’ve yet had in this Marvel universe, though Mark Ruffalo is charmingly confused when he’s being Bruce Banner. And rounding out the cast is Tessa Thompson, who turns up as a lapsed warrior from Thor’s neck of the cosmos, which is a useful coincidence. There are a great many corners cut, plot holes papered over, and laws of physics bent out of recognition in this movie, to be honest. And if you’ve sat through the past dozen recent Marvel movies, you’ll find the core elements very familiar – a rag-tag team of heroes (Thor unimaginatively dubs them “the Revengers”), an all-powerful antagonist, an impending apocalypse, and a set of essentially unkillable characters. Added to which, the liberal use of CGI and green screen makes for a visual flimsiness. Even the scenes set in “Norway” look fake. But Thor: Ragnarok gets away with all of this because it’s so winningly, unpretentiously funny. It basically throws up its hands at its own ridiculousness and plays it all for laughs – and it gets them. The price of this irreverence is the possibility of taking anything that happens all that seriously – even the potential destruction of the Norse gods’ home (that’s not a spoiler either: it’s the title of the movie). There’s a potentially intriguing subtext about Asgard’s gilded spires – and by extension European civilisation – having been built on the suffering and riches of others, but, being a bit of a downer, it’s dealt with fleetingly. The romp must go on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/oct/20/vince-vaughn-brawl-cell-block-99-actor-extreme-makeover","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"No more Mr Nice Guy: the actors who revived their careers with extreme makeovers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/20/vince-vaughn-brawl-cell-block-99-actor-extreme-makeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/20/vince-vaughn-brawl-cell-block-99-actor-extreme-makeover","fields":{"headline":"No more Mr Nice Guy: the actors who revived their careers with extreme makeovers","bodyText":"Trace your way through Vince Vaughn’s career – from affable-boyish late-90s Vince, past affable-goofball noughties Vince and all the way to affable-jaded latter-day Vince – and you probably wouldn’t expect his next role to involve grinding another man’s skull into a cold concrete floor. Or snapping an assailant’s arm over his knee like a piece of firewood. But cinema is always capable of springing a glorious surprise, and Brawl in Cell Block 99 is certainly that: a spectacularly gruesome Ronseal tin of a thriller, plotted with a grownup’s patience and delivered with adolescent glee. Fitting, then, that it should be Hollywood’s perennial man-child who’s tasked with carrying the film. And Vaughn, trading in his motormouth and five o’clock shadow for a southern drawl and crucifix-emblazoned skinhead, lugs things along with conviction. The makeover is so convincing that, after an hour or so of watching him heave his hulking frame around the screen, maiming and dismembering anyone who comes near, it’s impossible to imagine him as the lovable loser of the last two decades. After 20 years of pithy high jinks, could this be the start of a late-career pivot towards heavyweight gloom? If so – and a similar turn in the best-forgotten second series of True Detective suggests it might well be – then here are five actors he could take some tips from. Dick Powell Half a century before the word “McConaissance” infected the lexicon, Powell was beating a path that would become well-trodden. Making his name as a sweet-voiced singer, Powell spent the first decade of his career signed with Warner Bros, bringing his nice-guy crooning to romantic musicals with titles such as Flirtation Walk and Naughty But Nice. But the urge to broaden his range got the better of him and he quit the studio, eventually convincing Warner rivals RKO to cast him in Murder, My Sweet as a whiskey-fuelled private eye named Philip Marlowe. The character, invented by Raymond Chandler in the 1940 novel on which the film was based, proved a screen sensation, and Powell promptly made himself at home in the murky world of film noir, spending his next few years following dubiously motivated women down dark alleys and helping shape a seminal cinematic age. Helena Bonham Carter It seems long ago, but there was a time when the gothic empress of British film was a mainstay of romantic epics. While Bonham Carter’s early career was livened up by a two-episode role in Miami Vice, it was almost exclusively spent playing despairingly lovestruck ladies of the upper middle classes. She did it well, too: her breakout performance in A Room With a View was much lauded and, 12 years later, her turn in The Wings of the Dove got her an Oscar nomination. But if a small part in the 1994 film Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein had hinted at a taste for the macabre, her role in Fight Club four years later showed it to be a fully fledged craving. Marla Singer was a pill-popping crackpot who got her kicks from infiltrating support groups for the terminal ill – not a hobby the Lucy Honeychurches of the world would be too keen on – and effectively gave the actor a one-movie makeover. Three years later, she met director Tim Burton, and her role as one half of cinema’s ashen-faced power couple was under way. Robin Williams Williams’ Oscar-winning turn in Good Will Hunting, as the paternal psychologist who sweet-talks Matt Damon into finding himself, is often looked back on as a left-field career move. In some ways it was – until then he’d spent the 1990s monkeying around in screwball comedies – but for the most part his earnest father-figure role was a retread of what he’d done in Dead Poets Society. The real reinvention came five years after Good Will Hunting. In 2002, Williams starred in three films; in One Hour Photo and Insomnia he played icily psychotic serial killers, while the other – the forgotten gem Death to Smoochy – was an inky-black comedy in which he played a corrupt and vengeance-seeking kids’ TV host. Unfortunately for us, the transformation wasn’t as full-scale as it might have been: the following years brought mostly child-friendly chuckles peppered with the odd crack at the scary stuff. But it was good fun while it lasted. Takeshi Kitano Since the late 80s Kitano, via a steady stream of masterful Yakuza movies, has become synonymous with a very specific type of gangster character – unspeaking, existentially anguished, reluctantly engaging in sickening violence – and in the process has become one of the most successful movie stars in Japanese history. Before then, though, he was a grade-A doofus, one half of an Abbott and Costello-esque comedy duo, his madcap persona offset by Nirō Kaneko’s straight man and increasingly notorious for his PC-flouting gags. In his first serious film, Kitano’s arrival on screen prompted reflex laughs from the audience. But with one poetically detached gunman after another, Kitano went from cracking wise to cracking skulls, from tickling ribs to bludgeoning them in. Slapstick’s loss was blood-spattered crime drama’s gain. Naomi Watts Until her descent into nightmarish insanity in Mulholland Drive, Watts had spent her short career flitting between Aussie soap operas (Home and Away), quirky cult hits (Tank Girl) and B-movies (Children of the Corn IV). But since her sinister side was unshackled, she has made a point of indulging it as often as possible. No other actor has worked under all three of cinema’s unholy trinity of directors: Michael Haneke, David Cronenberg and David Lynch. That’s to say nothing of her sterling work in the Ring remakes and the little-seen Hitchcockian horror Shut In. Matthew McConaughey The most famed and, by the shaky barometer of Academy recognition, the most successful of Hollywood’s dark-side reinventions. McConaughey’s Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club, the culmination of a two-year renovation project that saw him move fearlessly from handsome-charming to handsome-brooding, raised a couple of questions. First, why hadn’t the Oscar come for Mud, an infinitely better film and an infinitely better performance, a year earlier? And second, isn’t this a sneaky gambit: masquerading as a one-trick pony and then, a decade or so later, revealing that you can do something different after all? If acting is the process of creating characters, then playing the same role on repeat is a kind of anti-acting. Which is in itself no bad thing – there’s plenty to be said for fine-tuning your art, and I enjoy each Ryan Gosling outing as much as the last – but should it really score you extra points when awards season rolls around? Given the grindhouse leanings of Vaughn’s latest film, it’s probably not a debate anyone will be having about him just yet. But if he is offered a place on the Academy’s shortlist come February, he should snap their hand off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/19/talking-horses-outlander-fancied-to-win-early-clash-of-jumps-giants","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T10:36:57Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Outlander fancied to win early clash of jumps giants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/19/talking-horses-outlander-fancied-to-win-early-clash-of-jumps-giants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/19/talking-horses-outlander-fancied-to-win-early-clash-of-jumps-giants","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Outlander fancied to win early clash of jumps giants","bodyText":"Today’s best bet, by Chris Cook The jumps season starts here folks! Chepstow was all very enjoyable at the weekend but today at Punchestown we have some authentic Gold Cup horses taking each other on, headed by Minella Rocco, who was second in the big race at Cheltenham in March. Jonjo O’Neill has done well to find a race in which this beast is so well treated, getting at least 8lb from everything except the rank outsider. I can absolutely see why he heads the market but this is a horse who needs a proper test of stamina and I’m not sure he’s going to get it in this early-season, seven-runner contest. When I spoke to Jonjo yesterday, he talked about the importance of getting some more experience into a horse who only has one win over fences to his name. Winning today is not everything and I can’t bring myself to fancy a bet on him at 2-1. Let’s remember that he started last season in a handicap on what now looks a lenient mark and still got beat. Outlander (4.10) appeals to me at 9-2. I’m intrigued to see Gordon Elliott’s line in today’s Post that he’s been operated on for a kissing spine that might explain a poor couple of runs at the end of last season. I think the trainer will have him ready to go well here and the horse has a perfect 1/1 record under Jack Kennedy, who got a career best out of him to win the Lexus. Zabana would be the pick on his novice-season form but he was disappointing last year, while Sub Lieutenant doesn’t look in need of three miles to me. Road To Respect is the one to worry about, although meeting Outlander at level weights gives him half a stone to find. At Brighton, Bloodsweatandtears (3.05) is napped more because I thought the odds would be bigger than his chance, rather than because he’s a very likely winner. There’s 9-1, which is indeed bigger than he should be in my view, because his autumn record at this track takes some beating. His last three wins have been at Brighton in September of 2013, 2015 and 2016 and here he is again, on a beatable handicap mark and just a little bit later in the year. He’s been off since March but has gone well fresh in the past, including when scoring here in 2013, and another bold effort seems likely. At Uttoxeter, Cloudy Too (3.25) is 10-1, returning to hurdles for only the third time in five years. Last time he ran over hurdles, he hosed up by five lengths over this course and distance in November, although this is a stronger race and Sue Smith’s runners at Wetherby yesterday offered little encouragement. I think he’s worth a chance, while accepting the clear risk of a disappointing effort.

The Ministry of Health has refused to endorse the guidelines, which were designed to tackle the country’s high teenage pregnancy rate, objecting that they are morally wrong and would encourage promiscuity and abortions. Activists condemned the decision as a “failure of leadership”. Uganda’s first lady and minister for education, Janet Museveni, has also waded in to the controversy, calling the distribution of free contraceptives an “erosion of morals”. At an event to mark International Day of the Girl last week, she said: “We no longer have pride to say no. People are given contraceptives to use them and do what they want, have sex, take pills, conceive and abort. This is not our culture in Africa.” The revised national guidelines were drawn up by the health ministry’s own reproductive health division, with support from civil society organisations. They outline the need for “age-appropriate” sex education for 10- to 14-year-olds, promoting “information focusing on growth and development, life skills, proper nutrition and personal hygiene, abstinence, delay of sexual debut, staying in school”. A broader range of services – including access to family planning and contraceptive services – were recommended for sexually active females between the ages of 15 and 49. More than a quarter of 15- to 19-year-old girls in Uganda are pregnant or have given birth. Women have an average of five children, a figure the government wants to reduce, but just 24% of women use a modern form of contraception. “There are certain provisions in the … guidelines that we don’t agree with, [we find] uncomfortable and can’t accept,” said Joyce Moriku, health minister. “How can you teach [sex education] and provide family planning services to children below 18? The civil society organisations should feel ashamed.” But activists said the guidelines were “entirely appropriate”, considering the average age of first intercourse in Uganda is 16. “The guidelines do not recommend family planning for 10-year-olds. The ministry is blocking guidelines they themselves contributed to,” said Asia Russell, of the Health Gap project. Russell said the refusal to launch the revised proposals was symptomatic of a far greater problem. “The Ugandan government is resisting evidence-based interventions to respond to the crisis of teen pregnancy in the country – a crisis that has gotten no better over the last decade.“By repeatedly obstructing tools that work, such as school-based sex education and these guidelines on family planning for health workers, government leaders are burying their heads further in the sand.” Simon Richard Mugenyi of Reproductive Health Uganda said abstinence-only messages had not curbed teenage pregnancy, but pointed to the success of sex education programmes that promoted contraceptive use among sexually active young people. The Ugandan representative of the UN population fund, Alain Sibenaler, said the ministry needed to clarify its policy. He said the agency was concerned about the 10-year stagnation of Uganda’s teenage pregnancy rate, despite the country’s progress in reducing maternal deaths. Having withdrawn guidelines to prevent unsafe abortion in 2015, the government last year banned sex education. The education ministry is finalising new guidance that could reverse the ban. “I know our morals, religions and cultural norms are very important to us. But as long as we continue to pretend that our young girls are not having sex and not getting pregnant, we shall be doing a disservice for them,” said Justine Balya of the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/oct/17/margaret-drabbles-jerusalem-the-golden-isnt-a-hampstead-novel","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T11:09:19Z","webTitle":"Margaret Drabble's Jerusalem the Golden isn't a 'Hampstead novel'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/17/margaret-drabbles-jerusalem-the-golden-isnt-a-hampstead-novel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/17/margaret-drabbles-jerusalem-the-golden-isnt-a-hampstead-novel","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Drabble's Jerusalem the Golden isn't a 'Hampstead novel'","bodyText":"“Writers are often and rightly accused of self-absorption and egoism,” observed Margaret Drabble in The Pattern in the Carpet, “but many have a very fragile hold on the self”. She revealed her own fragile hold in the same book, which mixes personal history and reflections on jigsaw puzzles. “At times I feel some pride in my continuing capacity for feeling really, really bad,” she reveals. In fact, the details she gives of her struggles are often tragic and moving – but there are also lighter moments. One of the more curious relates to Jerusalem the Golden. Once the book was written, she says she took the manuscript in person to the offices of Weidenfeld and Nicolson at Bond Street in London. Except that when she got there, she found a dress shop. Her first reaction to this surprise was “shocking”: Instead of assuming that I had made the mistake in the address, I knew suddenly, in a thunderbolt of awareness, that I had been deluding myself for years, and had madly fancied myself a writer, when I was nothing of the sort. I had been living in a fantasy and had better get on the bus, go home to Highbury and adjust to reality … Fortunately, she soon realised that she should have gone to New Bond Street, delivered the manuscript and the moment passed – but was left wondering about the life she might have had if she had turned for home. “I didn’t see myself as a contender,” she writes. Had Drabble failed to hand in her manuscript and given up, late 20th-century English fiction would have looked very different – and literary criticism along with it. Most particularly, we might never have heard of the “Hampstead novel”. Hampstead novels were once much discussed, even if it was debatable whether anyone was actually writing them. They were supposed to be books about clever people in north London having tempestuous affairs and talking about themselves in exhausting detail. John Sutherland describes the term as “an easy sneer”, a shorthand for “middle-class orgasms, delicatessen food and high thought”. Drabble herself has pointed out that she never set a novel in Hampstead and suggested that this idea about her books was the invention of rightwing papers in an all too familiar attempt to brand leftwing intellectuals as a privileged elite. Even so, there are elements of Jerusalem the Golden that fit the stereotype: yes, it’s set in Highgate, across the heath from Hampstead, but it has the big house, the welcoming kitchen, the drinking, the adultery, the ease with money, the middle-class characters and the fervent conversations about poetry. There’s a cruel irony that the very book that made Drabble feel such insecurity and question her place as a writer should create the template that would allow others to deride her as an establishment figurehead. Just to add to the sting, when the book came out it in 1967 was criticised for diametrically opposed reasons. Rather than representing middle-class comfort and complacency, Drabble was castigated for trotting out another novel about northern folk escaping their drab homes. In a Guardian review (quoted last week), Martin Green compared Drabble’s book unfavourably to The Lost Girl, DH Lawrence’s story of a girl fleeing an industrial town and finding sexual freedom. That year, Drabble told the BBC: “I’d rather be at the end of a dying tradition, which I admire, than at the beginning of a tradition that I deplore.” She was actually talking about following in the footsteps of Arnold Bennett and eschewing a new form of modernism, but the quote is irresistible in relation to Jerusalem the Golden, since this book managed both to be at the end of one tradition, and the start of an oft-deplored other. But these insults can be quickly turned around. For a start, there’s surely something to be said for both being the last and first word, a latecomer to one genre and a pioneer of another. But the more important point is that neither of those categorisations actually reflected my experience of reading the novel. I didn’t notice cliches; I focused on the singular and difficult character Clara. Nor do I remember reading any comments during this month’s discussions about DH Lawrence or Hampstead. Instead, the book has been discussed as it should be: a strange story about a determined individual. In the closing pages, Clara begs her lover to forget her mother’s dour house, to stop him associating it with her. “I can’t be free,” she says, “but there’s no reason why I shouldn’t be thought to be free, is there?” The novel she appears in is stuck in the same bind – we should take it on its own terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/16/apocalypse-wow-saharan-dust-and-iberian-fires-turn-uk-skies-red","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T15:18:40Z","webTitle":"Apocalypse wow: dust from Sahara and fires in Portugal turn UK sky red","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/16/apocalypse-wow-saharan-dust-and-iberian-fires-turn-uk-skies-red","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/16/apocalypse-wow-saharan-dust-and-iberian-fires-turn-uk-skies-red","fields":{"headline":"Apocalypse wow: dust from Sahara and fires in Portugal turn UK sky red","bodyText":"The strange reddish sky reported over parts of the UK may appear to some a sign of impending apocalypse or a celestial Instagram filter, but experts say there is a scientific explanation. The hue is a remnant of Storm Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara, while debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain is also playing a part, according to the BBC weather presenter Simon King. The dust has caused shorter-wavelength blue light to be scattered, making it appear red. “Ophelia originated in the Azores, where it was a hurricane, and as it tracked its way northwards, it dragged in tropical air from the Sahara,” King said. “The dust gets picked up into the air and goes high up into the atmosphere, and that dust has been dragged high up in the atmosphere above the UK.” The Met Office said the vast majority of the dust was due to forest fires on the Iberian peninsula, which have sent debris into the air. This has been dragged north by Ophelia. Ophelia also pulled in unusually warm air from Spain and north Africa, which is why temperatures reached the early 20s over the weekend. “An interesting phenomena that is a result of the movement of ex-Ophelia is the colour of the sky and the sun this morning, and dust on cars,” the Met Office said. “The same southernly winds that have brought us the current warmth have also drawn dust from the Sahara to our latitudes, and the dust scatters the blue light from the sun, letting more red light through much as at sunrise or sunset.” The red sky also created a vivid backdrop for television broadcasters; the BBC’s Westminster interviews were conducted against a striking image of Big Ben."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/oct/17/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-goes-to-the-dark-side","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Turning to the dark side: is Luke Skywalker really the villain of Star Wars: The Last Jedi?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/17/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-goes-to-the-dark-side","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/17/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-goes-to-the-dark-side","fields":{"headline":"Turning to the dark side: is Luke Skywalker really the villain of Star Wars: The Last Jedi?","bodyText":"When giant Snoke told us last time out that there had been an “awakening”, most Star Wars fans assumed the alien overlord must be referring to Daisy Ridley’s proto-Jedi Rey and her madcap Force visions. But it’s becoming increasingly obvious in the run-up to Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi that disturbances in the Force are more insidious and potentially wide-ranging. First came last week’s final trailer for the middle part of the new Star Wars trilogy, in which Ridley seems to be cosying up to Adam Driver’s sinister Kylo Ren. And this week there’s been plenty of talk online to the effect that Luke Skywalker himself might finally be set to turn to the dark side, 40 years after we first met the Tatooinian farm worker with the big dreams and impressive knack for bullseyeing womp rats. The clues are in publicity material for Johnson’s film, which seems to be positioning Mark Hamill’s ageing Jedi knight as the villain of the piece. There is a tradition in Star Wars posters, for instance, that sees the bad guy positioned in the background, looming horribly over the story’s heroes. It goes back to the original trilogy, when Darth Vader took up that spot in a decent proportion (though not all) of the main posters for all three movies. (For The Phantom Menace’s posters, the snakelike red and black features of Darth Maul often replaced Vader, while in Revenge of the Sith, Vader once again returned to the slot. Attack of the Clones posters often feature no villain in the background, possibly because the relevant graphic designer struggled as much as the rest of us to work out who the bad guy was after sifting through the nebulous plotting of that deeply muddled and underwhelming film.) In the new poster for The Last Jedi it is a giant, looming Luke positioned to the rear, taking his dear old dead cyborg dad’s place. Moreover, a new display for the film’s Imax release sees two split posters based on the traditional division in the Force between dark and light. Skywalker not only appears on the light side, with Rey, Finn, Chewie and Leia, he is also on the dark side with Captain Phasma and Ren. “Hell the what?!!” As Yoda might have said. The idea that Luke might finally be set to shift, definitively, to the dark side, is unsettling for those of us who have a special place in our celluloid hearts for the original trilogy. But, in terms of creating dramatic weight for the new triptych of movies, it makes a certain sense. JJ Abrams was sold on the idea of directing The Force Awakens after LucasFilm president Kathleen Kennedy asked him to ponder the question: “Who is Luke Skywalker?” This implies that the Star Wars powers that be have been thinking a lot about what kind of person Obi-Wan’s apprentice might have become in the three decades or so since we last saw him. Han Solo seemed to have changed very little between his final appearance in 1983’s Return of the Jedi and his grizzled but enduringly charismatic turn in The Force Awakens, but repeating that trick with Skywalker would surely have led to accusations of lazy film-making. So it makes sense that screenwriters would look to try a different approach for The Last Jedi. For long-term fans, there’s also another way to look at things. Never for a second while watching the original Star Wars movies did any of us believe that Luke truly would follow his father to the dark side. In fact, not once in the original trilogy did he ever seem remotely tempted. For all those swampy scenes on Dagobah with Yoda and Obi-Wan warning ominously about the dangers of a fall from the light, the Empire simply never seemed all that enticing. A future of serving the hideous Emperor Palpatine, or one helping to lift the known galaxy from under the boots of stormtrooper repression: it was always obvious which way our hero was going to go. But, if Luke really should fall to the dark side, the tensions of the original trilogy are enhanced, and those moments in which our hero impulsively opts to ignore the advice of his mentors could take on new significance. There has never been any real payback for the Jedi knight following the impulsive decision to leave his training partway through and fly to the defence of his friends in The Empire Strikes Back. But if Skywalker finally succumbs to the dark side, that oversight might be both retrospectively explained and given lasting significance. There is another alternative here, of course. Luke might just be set to form a new order, free of the trappings of either side of the Force, like the so-called “Gray Jedi” of the Expanded Universe and Star Wars Rebels’ Ahsoka Tano. Personally, I like the idea of Luke as villain of the piece a little more. If you’re going to turn a much-loved character on his or her head, and “ruin” plenty of fortysomething childhoods in the process, at least have the guts to go the whole way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/family-life-bus-conductor-farmer-mush-mush-quiet-man-winkles","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T05:45:14Z","webTitle":"Family Life: Me as a bus conductor with my farmer dad; Mush, Mush, Mush from The Quiet Man; Sunday teatime winkles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/family-life-bus-conductor-farmer-mush-mush-quiet-man-winkles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/family-life-bus-conductor-farmer-mush-mush-quiet-man-winkles","fields":{"headline":"Family Life: Me as a bus conductor with my farmer dad; Mush, Mush, Mush from The Quiet Man; Sunday teatime winkles","bodyText":"Snapshot: Me as a bus conductor with my farmer dad I only have three photographs of me with my father. In the 1950s, photography was expensive and the film was mostly saved for snaps of weddings and the annual chapel coach trip to the seaside: it often remained in the camera for several months. My favourite photo, taken on Christmas Day 1951, is of me, aged four, proudly showing off my present of a bus conductor’s cap, uniform and ticket machine, standing with my dad in his leggings, boots and a three-piece suit that had been his Sunday best and then became his everyday working clothes. Shunning innovation and machines, my father chose the horsepower of a gentle shire, preferring the stench of sweat to that of tractor oil. Twice daily he milked his seven horned cows by hand, head bowed, as if in prayer, his forehead pressed against the flank; each animal named and treated with respect. Having no stomach for sticking pigs, he seldom saw the gush of blood spew steaming hot from an open throat. Neither could he bring himself to thrust a knife into the beak of a hanging fowl, instead allowing my mother to perform the task for our Christmas dinner. Each spring, he found the first white violets, presenting a small bouquet to my mother, a shy smile playing on his lips. He knew every one of his 11 fields and the surrounding hedges intimately and he knew where to find the nesting sites of robin, thrush and wren; the secret banks where wild strawberries grew and where common lizards basked beneath the sun. How he enjoyed at dawn the spiders’ webs sparkling silver in the dew, the glinting kingcups golden in the rushes. He seldom reminisced about ploughing with his team of shires, of how he had tramped 10 miles a day to plough a single acre, enjoying bird songs as he toiled. He told me how the newly cut sward and soil sang, of how the jangle of the harness and the heavy beat of hobnail boot and iron-shod hoof were musical rhythms to his ears. Scraping a living from 23 acres in East Knowstone, Devon, my father was, according to the big farmers in the know, a poor farmer. To quote Mark Twain – “When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.” My father died, aged 62, when I was 16. Only when I was much older than 21 did I realise he had found his riches in hedgerow, field and pond. It was only then that I heard his music of the earth and glimpsed his store of grain harvested by a truly parochial man. David Hill Playlist: My mum’s party piece for Saturday nights Mush, Mush, Mush – Irish folk song sung by Barry Fitzgerald in the film The Quiet Man “Mush, mush, mush, tural-i-addy / Sing mush, mush, mush, tural-i-ay” I was born into a singing family. None of them had any training, nor did anyone play a musical instrument, but if my parents had friends in for an evening meal on a Saturday, it always finished with a sing-song. As a small boy in the 40s I was introduced to, and can still sing, old music hall songs such as Hold Your Hand Out, You Naughty Boy and Johnny O’Connor Bought an Automobile. They also sang songs of the day, including tunes from what we now call The Great American Song Book, and popular songs such as Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats. Most of the adults had a party piece. My mother had two. The first was an Irish song, the chorus of which ran “Mush, mush, mush, tural-i-addy / Sing mush, mush, mush, tural-i-ay … If you’re in for a row or a ruction / Just tread on the tail o’ me coat.” The other was a narrative song called Granny’s Old Armchair. Does anyone sing them nowadays? About 30 years ago, I sang and recorded both songs on tape. Later, they were transcribed to a CD. Might some future musical historian stumble on this CD and resurrect the songs? I like to think so. David Steele We love to eat: Sunday teatime winkles Ingredients Tub of winkles Brown bread and butter I was born in 1941 and lived with my parents and older brother in a small village in Essex, 14 miles from the East End of London. Sunday routines were the same except for special outings or summer holidays. Dad would organise a charabanc day trip during the summer for neighbours and friends, collecting the money each week to pay for it. He kept the cash in a tin under his bed. The day would be spent on the beach, at the amusement arcades and on the numerous penny machines. We would visit the ice-cream shop for a knickerbocker glory and generally have lots of fun. Fish and chips were bought to eat in the coach on the way home, and the adults would finish up singing favourite songs such as Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag. We would arrive home tired but happy. On Sundays, Dad would meet his mates down at the local working men’s club. Sometimes he let me go with him to listen to the brass band practise and afterwards I would hurry off to get home by dinner time so I would not be late for Sunday school in the afternoon. Sunday dinner was always a roasted shoulder of lamb with vegetables from Grandad’s allotment. Dad wouldn’t eat any other meat. The only fruit he would eat was apple, and that stewed to a puree, with custard, was his favourite for afters. Sometimes the custard had an almond flavour when Mum had burned it a bit. On special occasions, Mum made an apple pie. Dad would return from the club, merry on too much mild and bitter, and my brother and I would run down the garden path to meet him. “Did you get some?” we would ask. With face beaming, Dad would pull from his pocket what was to be a real treat. At teatime, my brother and I would sit cross-legged beside the warmth of a coal fire on wintry evenings, full of anticipation. We were never disappointed. Mum would bring us a plate of brown bread spread with best butter, which was a Sunday treat in itself, together with two hat-pins, each with a shiny pearl at one end. And then came what we had been waiting for, a dish filled with what looked like small black snails. With our hat-pins we would ease off the winkles’ thin, waxy, top covering, then dig the pin into the dark brown flesh beneath, wriggling it round and round, while gently pulling, and watching the winkle come out all twisted like a corkscrew. Each time, we tried to get the winkle out whole without breaking off the very thin end. I don’t know if my dad realised just how much joy his tub of winkles from Tubby Isaacs every Sunday brought my brother and me, but I hope he could tell from our happy faces. Now in my old age, I can still remember those Sunday teas and the taste and chewy saltiness of those winkles mingling with the smoothness of brown bread and butter.

Just three weeks after her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) posted its worst national election result, the party suffered a surprise defeat in Lower Saxony to the Social Democrats (SPD). Until August, the CDU had a clear lead in the polls. At a press conference on Monday, Merkel admitted that talks between the CDU, the pro-business FDP and the Greens – a potential alliance nicknamed the Jamaica coalition due to their party colours – would not be straightforward. But she rejected the widespread view that her hand was weakened by Sunday’s result. “It is clear to us that these will not be easy talks.” she said. “But the Lower Saxony election result does not mean that we will enter the Jamaica negotiations weakened.” Merkel said the CDU’s result was being talked down, and argued that her party “didn’t get that many fewer voters than last time Lower Saxony voted.” Urging her potential coalition partners to put Germany ahead of party politics, she said: “The questions we now have to ask ourselves are: ‘what does Germany need? What sort of problem-solving should a government be offering the people?’” Many commentators, including some within her own party, believe Merkel is failing to recognise the unpopularity of her open border migration policy, which is believed to have led to the drop in support for the CDU. Wolfgang Steiger, general secretary of the CDU’s economic advisory council, accused Merkel of having arrogantly glossed over the results of the 24 September election, in which the CDU secured 33% of the vote, its lowest share since 1949. “The clue to the defeat in Hanover (Lower Saxony’s capital) is unfortunately to be found in the evening of the election of 24 September when the horrific losses of 8% were sugar-coated as if they were a strategic victory,” Steiger told German media. He said Lower Saxony’s voters had punished Merkel for saying on election night that the CDU had “done everything right”. Horst Seehofer, the embattled leader of the Bavaria-based CSU, which lost 10 percentage points in September’s election, is leading calls within the conservative alliance for the parties to shift to the right or risk losing more ground to the rightwing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD). While Merkel has so far resisted, her weakened position will make it harder for her to shake off his demands. He is also likely to feel emboldened by the rise of the right following Sunday’s election in neighbouring Austria. But Peter Tauber, general secretary of the CDU, said as all three parties involved in the national coalition talks had lost support in Lower Saxony, he did not think it would have a big influence on the talks. “It’s not wise to consider this as something that will weigh us down,” he said. In Lower Saxony, home to the beleaguered carmaker Volkswagen, the SPD secured 36.9% of the vote, the CDU 33.6%, the Greens 8.7%, and the FDP 7.5%. The far-left party Die Linke secured just 4.6%, below the 5% hurdle needed to enter parliament. AfD will enter Lower Saxony’s parliament for the first time having secured 6.2% by luring thousands of voters from the CDU in particular. However its support was considerably less than the 12.6% it secured nationally last month. The SPD’s strong showing takes some of the pressure off Martin Schulz, the party’s leader, who would have come under pressure to resign had the party lost. The SPD has lost three regional elections under his stewardship, as well as posting its worst parliamentary election result since 1949. Schulz called the result in Lower Saxony a “wonderful victory” for the SPD. But the party faces similar problems to the CDU on the national stage, because it will have to form either a three-party coalition or a grand coalition with the CDU, because the SPD and Greens did not secure enough of the vote between them. The Lower Saxony vote had hindered coalition talks between the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union, on the one hand, and the FDP and Greens on the other, because the latter two were cautious not to be seen to give too much ground lest it affect voter support. Now there is nothing standing in the way. On Wednesday, the first so-called “soundings” are due to take place in Berlinbetween the CDU/CSU and first the FDP, followed by the Greens. On Thursday the FDP and Greens will meet separately before all the parties come together for the first time on Friday, with the aim of finding common topics. But it could be Christmas before a coalition is in place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/oct/16/meet-nia-the-african-tank-engine-and-gratuitous-stereotype","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T14:53:51Z","webTitle":"Meet Nia, the African tank engine (and gratuitous stereotype)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/oct/16/meet-nia-the-african-tank-engine-and-gratuitous-stereotype","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2017/oct/16/meet-nia-the-african-tank-engine-and-gratuitous-stereotype","fields":{"headline":"Meet Nia, the African tank engine (and gratuitous stereotype)","bodyText":"Name: Nia.

Instead, it finds the two ground forces that did most to expel Isis, which are armed, trained and supported by Washington, at each other’s throats, with tensions concentrated on the oil city of Kirkuk. The hardline military response from Iraq and Iran in the past 24 hours to the Iraqi Kurds’ decision to hold a referendum on independence, a vote strongly opposed by every western state, risks a new war that could destroy the unity of the Iraqi state. The nightmare is a Turkish or Iranian occupation of parts of Kurdistan leading to a guerrilla war before the Isis dream of a caliphate is crushed. Already there is revived talk of disenfranchised Sunnis following the Kurdish path to independence by seeking to form their own state in Iraq – the genesis of Isis in 2014. Sunnis reason that, with the Kurds, they make up approximately 40%-45% of Iraq’s population, but if the Kurds secede from Iraq, the remaining Sunnis will form a smaller rump in an overwhelmingly Shia state, which will make them more vulnerable to sectarian persecution. There are also concerns about the influence of the Iranians over the Baghdad government; Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani, the leader of Iran’s revolutionary guard, has been in Baghdad for the past three days. The consequences of the standoff in Kirkuk could be catastrophic, according to Jack Lopresti, the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Kurdistan. “It would be catastrophic for Kurdish-Arab relations were the Iranian proxy militia to use American weapons against our vital allies in the peshmerga,” he said. “It would demonstrate a complete abdication of responsibility for Iranian-backed forces that have no interest in a peaceful settlement between Baghdad and Erbil [the capital of the Kurdistan region] – the key actors in post-referendum discussions. The west cannot stand idly by as the Shia militia and Iran exploit differences within Iraq for their own selfish ends.” It is possible there was miscalculation on both sides. Some initially interpreted the Kurdish referendum not as an outright declaration of independence, but another bargaining chip to restart talks on greater autonomy from Baghdad. Instead, nationalism pushed the Kurdish leadership further than it intended. An amicable divorce was always unlikely due to the formal incorporation into Kurdistan of disputed territories such as Kirkuk, an emotive issue for Kurds and Arabs given its oil and strategic position. The Kurds may have been overoptimistic about the reaction of the Turks, believing Ankara’s dependence on Kurdish oil, and wider commercial relations built up in recent years, would be enough for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to show flexibility. The Kurds, too, may have underestimated the influence that Iran, and its popular mobilisation units, hold in Baghdad. Western diplomacy may have been too little, too late. After watching the abject performance of Iraq state forces in the fight against Isis, the US under Barack Obama poured millions of dollars into the Kurdish peshmerga to try to defeat the terror group. They largely proved their value, and have been held in the highest standing in the US. The British and the Americans warned that a referendum would be destabilising and premature, but they found they did not have the leverage to stop the Kurdish leader, Masoud Barzani, pressing ahead. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, reportedly waited until 23 September, two days before the referendum, to offer Erbil a one-year window of dialogue on all outstanding issues, in conjunction with the UK. If Baghdad did not negotiate in good faith, Tillerson proposed, “we would recognise the need for a referendum”. The Kurds say they have heard such promises before and no date for a referendum was offered. From the Kurdish perspective, the Shia ruling elites in Baghdad want majority rule and the majority of the oil revenue. If the US is to prevent war inside Iraq between two of its allies, it may have to go back and strengthen the promise in the 23 September letter, or see its painstakingly assembled anti-Isis alliance dissolve in front of its eyes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/poem-of-the-week-an-invite-to-eternity-by-john-clare","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: An Invite to Eternity by John Clare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/poem-of-the-week-an-invite-to-eternity-by-john-clare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/23/poem-of-the-week-an-invite-to-eternity-by-john-clare","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: An Invite to Eternity by John Clare","bodyText":"An Invite to Eternity Wilt thou go with me sweet maid Say maiden wilt thou go with me Through the valley depths of shade Of night and dark obscurity Where the path hath lost its way Where the sun forgets the day Where there’s nor life nor light to see Sweet maiden wilt thou go with me Where stones will turn to flooding streams, Where plains will rise like ocean waves, Where life will fade like visioned dreams And mountains darken into caves. Say maiden wilt thou go with me Through this sad non-identity Where parents live and are forgot And sisters live and know us not Say maiden wilt thou go with me In this strange death of life to be To live in death and be the same Without this life, or home, or name At once to be, and not to be That was, and is not – yet to see Things pass like shadows – and the sky Above, below, around us lie The land of shadows wilt thou trace And look – nor know each other’s face The present mixed with reasons gone And past, and present all as one Say maiden can thy life be led To join the living to the dead Then trace thy footsteps on with me We’re wed to one eternity “He had a song in the night,” a fellow patient at the Northampton Lunatic Asylum said affectionately of Clare, according to Jonathan Bate’s biography of the poet. Clare liked to sing, and few of his poems from the Northampton years are songless or joyless. Clare was not imprisoned: he took day-long walks, and observed and celebrated the surrounding countryside. Sometimes, though, the lyricism seems a mask of wishful thinking and wishful remembering. An Invite to Eternity is a song in a particularly shadowy night and shares a metaphysical, introspective angle with two of his other poems. These are the much-loved I Am (“I am yet what I am none cares or knows”), and the lesser-known sonnet often given the same title. The three, I think, stand among Clare’s masterpieces. He produced more than 800 new poems between 1842 and 1856, most of them faithfully transcribed by WF Knight, the house steward at Northampton Asylum. The dating of most of these poems is uncertain, but Bate says that a copy of An Invite to Eternity was sent to Clare’s clockmaker friend Thomas Inskip in 1848. Some of Clare’s titles, like most of his punctuation, were added by his editors, but if this one isn’t his own I’d be surprised. The twinning of the homely vernacular noun “invite” and the grand concept “eternity” seems deeply symbolic. The pastoral genre where the rustic’s invitation to the maiden to go for a walk as a cover for romance and seduction is an ancient one. (Clare uses it in Meet Me in the Green Glen, a slightly cheerier poem.) At first, there’s nothing particularly arresting in the diction of An Invite to Eternity: “Wilt thou go with me sweet maid / Sweet maiden wilt thou go with me …” It’s only later that the repetitions will come to seem obsessive rather than melodic. The invitation is repeated, with delicate variation, three times in the first stanza, and the formulation “Say maiden wilt thou go with me” becomes a kind of wandering but insistent refrain. In a text faithful to Clare’s minimalist punctuation, the omission of commas soon takes effect. It makes the speaker’s request seem oddly rushed and anxious, even before the path, in the third line, has dipped into the underworld. At first, Clare’s valley of the shadow seems a mythologised, purgatorial landscape. The transformations offered are dramatic, almost biblical: stones become “flooding streams,” plains rise like waves, mountains become caves. Acutely conscious of man’s destructive encroachment on nature, Clare might almost be forecasting climate-change apocalypse. But the last three lines of stanza two reveal the internalised nature of the destination – “this sad non-identity”. The loss of a sense of self, foreshadowed by unnatural changes in the natural world, is equated with being neither dead nor alive, neither in the past nor the present. Clare enters this uncanny space via the loss of familiar people, places and time itself. The postmortem eternity will incur endless wandering. Coleridge’s “night-mare life in death” comes to mind, but Clare’s brush with the gothic is lighter, of course. Modern readers might see a portrait of depression, or of old age and its social diminutions. Bate notes the Hamlet reference in the line “At once to be, and not to be”, and it might be significant that Clare, delusional or jesting, sometimes claimed to be William Shakespeare. Of course the question in the poem is about existence itself, and the life-in-death of self-negation. It’s not a deliberation about suicide. Many editions of the poem add punctuation, but I prefer the flowing, stream-of-consciousness effect of its absence. And the lack of the question mark seems, importantly, to emphasise the lack of option for the “sweet maid” addressed. Both she and the speaker are all the more helplessly fated to walk the “valley of the shadow”. Only the culminating idea that the as-if-dead speaker and the living maid will be wed in shared non-existence brightens the vista, (though not, perhaps, for the woman). The haunting repetitions have a lullaby quality, but there is no consolation. The loss of home, name and self is hardly “the peace that passeth understanding”, although it is accepted with quiet, strangely dreamy stoicism. The qualities that make Clare a great pastoral and ecological poet are the same qualities underlying his interior documentary. He may begin with some borrowed romantic view and its conventional expression but he presses on beyond those limits. He reports what he sees, trying “to make his consceptions correct thinkings”, as he says in a little essay challenging the rigid application of English grammar. In the strange underworld of this poem, Clare is still the brave and faithful naturalist. And all the truer for the minimal grammar.

Not many comics run away from commercial success, but at the turn of the century Hughes quit standup for several years. “I found myself playing 4,000-seater venues packed with 14-year-old girls screaming at me,” he said. “That wasn’t why I did comedy.” For Hughes – at least after his early years, when he admitted he was motivated by fame – standup was always the space he sought to speak the truth in all its messy complexity. After his career hiatus, he returned with knotty, almost wilfully uningratiating shows, which didn’t always cohere, but which throbbed with grumpy-gadfly personality and showed bright flashes of the talent that once made him the youngest ever winner of the Edinburgh Comedy award (known back then as the Perrier). I always bracketed him in my mind with fellow Irishman Dylan Moran, who bagged a Perrier a few years later. But really, Hughes didn’t belong in anyone’s club. He gave every impression of being a cussed character and committed loner, one of those who ended up in comedy (or at least, stayed there) not because it was cool, but because his misfit character and the misery of his upbringing qualified him more for standup than for anything else. In interviews and on stage, he discussed his father’s alcoholism. His childhood was also marked by moving from London to Dublin: “I got a lot of stick, like, ‘Shut up, you Brit,’ and I felt like an outsider from very early on.” Because the jaunty misanthropy of his middle-age suited him so well, it’s hard to remember him young. But his Channel 4 sitcom Sean’s Show – detailing the everyday misadventures of bumbling Hughes, and addressed from his fictional flat directly at his studio audience – was ahead of its time. Now, it can be seen as an early staging post (after It’s Garry Shandling’s Show, before Spaced) in the development of the meta-sitcom. I didn’t start watching his standup till the second chapter of Hughes’ career, when he returned from his self-imposed exile to deliver a series of curmudgeonly bulletins from uncompromising and unheralded middle age. Sometimes, this was stock standup fare about the indignities of getting old. More often, it suggested deeper and darker currents swirling below the comedy’s surface. He complained that his audience were all his age, and no one heckled him any more. He was never a shock merchant, but the best of his standup worked slyly to challenge comforting bromides, to raise disagreements and unease. Such was the case with a set about his father’s death, Life Becomes Noises, that was pretty ruthless in its lack of sentimentality. In one show, I remember him taking impish pleasure in a joke that mocked Stephen Fry – then at the peak of his national-treasure popularity. His audience resisted – as they often did at his jokes about his own mental health and vegetarianism, which cheerfully refused to observe the pieties attendant on either. With Hughes, there was never any sense of provocation for the sake of it. Whether he was being mildly or monstrously funny, you seldom doubted that he was saying what he found, with neither fear nor favour. “I just wanted to tell the truth,” he said of his comedy career, “and be listened to.” So he did, so he was – and it’s poignant to think that we can’t listen any longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/16/no-such-thing-as-an-ideal-heating-setting","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:14:20Z","webTitle":"No such thing as an ideal heating setting | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/16/no-such-thing-as-an-ideal-heating-setting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/16/no-such-thing-as-an-ideal-heating-setting","fields":{"headline":"No such thing as an ideal heating setting","bodyText":"As a thermal comfort researcher, men often complain to me that their wives turn up the thermostat because they prefer warmer conditions (Why women secretly turn up the heating, G2, 12 October). There is no such thing as a single comfort temperature. A thin lady is likely to feel colder than a plump one. A recent sample in English homes recorded living room temperatures from 10C to 25C. Thermostat settings are driven by many factors including environmental beliefs, customs, daily routines, incomes or different approaches to heating. The heating and energy industries would love us to heat whole buildings, but all we often need to do is heat the people inside them. Average winter living-room temperatures in New Zealand are around 14C where people sit by a small heater when relaxing. In Japanese homes temperatures can fall to 5C indoors because people keep warm with a “Kotatsu”, a small heater by their chair covered by a shared rug, as in parts of Spain. We all adapt to those temperatures we normally occupy. If uncomfortable, and we can afford to, we change our environments.

Cultural capitals can ossify with time, but the constant influx of young blood into Bologna has kept the city alive. In the evenings, cafes flood with Bolognesi, from high-society ladies to stylishly scruffy undergraduates arguing politics and sipping Aperol spritzes. Piazza Verdi attracts musicians and dreadlocked punks, while bars under the arches of Piazza Santo Stefano are a lovely spot for a sundowner. At weekends the central Via Ugo Bassi and Via Rizzoli, along with perpendicular Via dell’Indipendenza, are pedestrianised and fill with shoppers and street performers. At nightfall, crowds from the student bars along Via Zamboni and the more upscale options on Via del Pratello spill into the streets. Bologna has several nicknames – la dotta (the learned) and la rossa (the red, for its leftwing politics) - but it is la grassa (the fat) that’s perhaps the most fitting. Food is a very big deal here, as it is throughout the Emilia-Romagna region – the home of parma ham, balsamic vinegar and parmesan. Cured meats, aged cheeses, cream, butter, game and truffles abound in this most indulgent of cuisines – and autumn, with its plentiful porcini mushrooms and sweet chestnuts, is a great time of year to visit. Many of Italian cuisine’s heavy hitters – tagliatelle al ragù, mortadella, tortellini, lasagne alla bolognese – originate and are at their finest here. The classics still have pride of place, but in the past few years the range of restaurants has broadened. And next month sees the opening of Fico Eataly World, a long-awaited €100m foodie theme park. WHAT TO SEE AND DO Learn about the cuisine Eataly World opens on 15 November, with rides, workshops, restaurants, pastures, an orchard and a vineyard for tasting and learning about everything from dairy farming to prosciutto production. There will be tricycles to explore the 20-acre complex, entry is free, the various activities start at €10pp and a hotel will open there next year. This may be the city’s flashiest culinary attraction, but it’s hardly the only one. For a more personal look at la cucina bolognese, book one of Rita Mattioli’s intimate cooking classes, which feel like a warm, sophisticated dinner party. Whether you’re a novice learning to roll translucent sheets of pasta or trying to reproduce a professional tiramisù, make sure to book well in advance (from €60pp, +39 348 341 0168, bolognawelcome.com). Davide Simoni’s family has run the Salumeria Simoni shop in the city centre for generations, and he leads tours (from €10) peppered with anecdotes about the city’s pork butchers. Those with a sweet tooth may prefer the Carpigiani Gelato museum, which offers sessions for casual ice-cream enthusiasts (€20) and masterclasses (€45). It’s a schlep out of the centre and booking is essential. For a more spontaneous sweet treat, Il Gelatauro on Via San Vitale, Cremeria Funivia off Via Farini and Cremeria Santo Stefano on Via Santo Stefano, south of the centre, all serve sublime scoops. Shop at the food markets Bologna’s food markets are among the best in Italy: stalls in the Quadrilatero, the centuries-old grid of streets south of Via Rizzoli, are the place to try fine cheeses, at La Baita Vecchia Malga on Via Pescherie Vecchie; pastries, from Paolo Atti &amp; Figli on Via degli Orefici; and anything else, from wine to charcuterie, at Tamburini on Via Caprarie. Pick up your delicacies and head to Osteria del Sole on Vicolo Ranocchi, a raucous bar dating back to 1465, where the wine is cheap and food is BYO. Bustling Mercato di Mezzo on Via Clavature is great at any time of day for a casual bite, while Mercato delle Erbe, at the western end of Via Ugo Bassi, is where chefs load up on Emilia-Romagna’s premium produce in the mornings. Though the rustic ambiance remains intact, the market now hosts the cool Altro? food hall and occasional live music events. For slow food straight from the source, head to the weekly Mercato delle Terre on Via Azzo Gardino, in the courtyard of the Cinema Lumière, where more than 40 vendors offer everything from artisanal cheeses to cooking demonstrations. Art, history and music Those planning to visit several museums can save money with a Bologna welcome card (from €20). There’s an impressive collection of works by Giotto, Titian, Raphael and other old masters at the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna (€6 adult, €3 for 18-25s), plus contemporary art at MAMbo (€4-€6, children free). The latter also houses the Morandi Museum, a tribute to local still-life artist Giorgio Morandi. In the early evening, wing by MAMbo’s bar for a drink and a sumptuous aperitivo spread (€8 with first drink). Museo della Storia di Bologna (€10 adult, €8 19-26s, €6 6-18s) in Palazzo Pepoli has interactive, hi-tech exhibits on Bolognese society through the years. Exhibits are in Italian, but there’s an engaging English-language audio guide. Film fans can journey back to the golden age of Italian film making at the vast library on the history of cinematography at the Cineteca di Bologna art-house theatre (Via Azzo Gardino 65). No visit to this Unesco world city of music would be incomplete without a stop at the Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica di Bologna (€3-€5, children free) in the frescoed Palazzo Sanguinetti. Small in size, yet broad in scope, the museum displays an array of historic portraits, documents and more than 80 instruments. Scale the heights The Santuario della Madonna di San Luca basilica keeps an eye on Bologna from a hill 10km south-west of the centre. It can be reached on the San Luca Express, a tourist “train” running from Piazza Maggiore, but it’s more enjoyable to spend an afternoon trekking the twisting path, with its (supposed) 666 porticos, from Piazza di Porta Saragozza on the western edge of the centre. Scholars believe the demonic number is no coincidence – the final stretch can feel particularly devilish. Back in the centre, it’s considered bad luck for students to climb le due torri (the two leaning medieval towers in Piazza di Porta Ravegnana that are a symbol of the city) before graduating, but travellers need not fear such superstition. The smaller Torre Garisenda, which leans the furthest of the two, is not open to the public, but the 498 steps to the top of Torre Asinelli (€3-€5) reward climbers with a postcard-perfect vista of the city’s red rooftops. WHERE TO EAT Trattoria di Via Serra Sparsely decorated and just outside the historic centre, this modest trattoria might seem an unlikely candidate for one of the most popular in town, but Flavio Benassi and Tommaso Maio’s inspired countryside dishes ensure the house is full every night, making reservations essential. The menu seldom stays the same for more than a week, but pear-stuffed tortellini slicked with butter and speckled with poppy seeds (€9.50), chestnut-flour spaghetti alla chittara with porcini and hazelnuts (€10.50), or a scoop of pistachio-dusted chicken liver pâté (€8) are not to be missed. • Via Luigi Serra 9, +39 051 631 2330, Wed-Thurs 7-10pm, Fri-Sun 12-2pm and 7-10pm, trattoriadiviaserra.it Sette Tavoli Rotating menus served at chef Marco Spanghero’s sette tavoli (seven tables) spot highlight a different region of Italy each month.

Don’t come here for a quiet, candlelit evening. • Via Cartoleria 10, +39 051 222 529, daily 1-2.30pm and 8.30-11.30pm, drogheriadellarosa.it Ristorante Pappagallo It’s more than a century old, and the crisp white linens and tuxedoed waiters may seem a throwback, but this gastronomic icon in a palazzo by the two towers doesn’t rest on its laurels. The kitchen keeps it fresh with contemporary twists on the regional cuisine, such as a glossy Iberian pork cheek on a brushstroke of butternut squash (€22) and coffee-flavoured tagliatelle. Classics, such as the legendary spinach-tinted lasagne (€14) or saffron-hued tagliatelle (€14), are treated with equal reverence. • Piazza della Mercanzia 3, +39 051 232 807, daily 11am-1am (2am on Thurs and Fri), alpappagallo.it Ristorante La Traviata Peek into the back on a lazy afternoon and you may spy the chefs pinching sheets of pasta into flawless tortellini. They perform other miracles with that yolk-yellow dough, the most impressive of which is the lasagne alla bolognese (€12), served once a week – a dish consisting of three kinds of meat and béchamel that still feels feather-light. Or try one of the many variations on classic lasagne – a savoury pumpkin-mushroom version is particularly good – that follow the seasons. • Via Urbana 5, +39 051 331 298, Midday-2.30pm and 8-11pm, closed Sunday, on Facebook Trattoria Valerio This humble, family-run eatery has been dishing up cosy comfort fare like tagliatelle al ragù (€9) and polpettine con piselli (meatballs with peas, €9) since 1898. The presentation is as unpretentious as can be, but the prices are low, the portions ample, and everything is made by hand with the greatest of care. • Via Avesella 10, +39 051 268 404, Midday-2pm and 7pm-9.30pm, closed Wed and Sun, trattoriavalerio.com Berberè Pizzeria If it’s pizza you’re after, and at a decent price (from €6) then the low-rise sourdough crusts and mostly organic ingredients (tomatoes are sourced only from select farms in Puglia and the mozzarella di bufala from Caserta, Campania) make this central eaterie stand out. Organic products are also on sale in the restaurant’s shop. • Via Petroni 9c, +39 051 275 9196, Tues-Sun 12.30-3.30pm/6-11pm, Mon 7-11pm, berberepizza.it WHERE TO DRINK Enoteca Storica Faccioli This sophisticated nook has one of the best selections of natural wines you’ll find anywhere. Though some of these vinos are notoriously funky, the cellar here is also stocked with pleasantly nuanced, thoroughly drinkable finds. Knowledgeable staff are passionate but never pretentious, making it a pleasure to seek out lesser-known vintages from the vast menu. • Via Altabella 15/B, Mon-Fri 5-9.30pm, Sat 11am-10pm, open on Sunday from October to March only (5-9.30pm), enotecastoricafaccioli.it Aroma A bad cappuccino is hard to find in this caffeine-obsessed city, but few places elevate it to the level that this shoebox-sized gem achieves. For a decadent start to the day, try the speciality coffees with local liqueurs or Sicilian almond milk. • Via Porta Nova 12, Mon-Sat 8am-6pm, ilpiaceredelcaffe.it Biblioteca Salaborsa When in Bologna, do as the students do and grab your morning espresso and brioche at this atmospheric library. And be sure to look up at the grand, Corinthian-columned central room that once housed the financial exchange, then down to the glass floor that exposes the 2,000-year-old ruins of the city’s ancient heart. • Piazza del Nettuno 3, Tues-Sat 10am-8pm, Mon 2.30-8pm, bibliotecasalaborsa.it Beer 4 Bunnies A few years ago, a beer bar in this wine-loving town would have seemed heretical; now locals drinking craft brews on Via del Pratello are a common sight. Beer 4 Bunnies, the first bar/shop of its kind in the area, packs an array of lesser-known bottles and a rotating selection of drafts into a small space. • Piazza San Francesco 11, Mon-Sat 4-10pm, Sun 3-9pm, on Facebook WHERE TO STAY I Portici Hotel Housed in the gorgeously restored 19th-century Palazzo Maccaferri, the city’s grande dame balances old world elegance with contemporary comfort.

The fashionable will join them: brands are embracing Stranger Things as cult TV. From the 20 October, Topshop and Topman will collaborate with Netflix to produce a range of clothing themed around the show – sort of merchandise for the series. In-jokes are rife. One T-shirt features the Upside Down – the alternate dimension featured in the show – while a backpack has patches for Hawkins Middle School AV Club, attended by the characters in the show. There will be Stranger Things ‘takeover’ in the brand’s stores in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester in the run-up to Halloween. This includes immersive – slightly terrifying – sets. In the Oxford Circus store, there will be the Hawkins lab, the wooded den created by the main character Will and, of course, the Upside Down. An area will be set up to watch episodes the night before its debuted on Netflix. “We’re always thinking about how we can create an experience,” says Sheena Sauvaire, director of marketing and communications at Topshop. “Stranger Things has cultural relevance and its very much a part of the zeitgeist.” High fashion is on board too. 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven in the show, starred in the advertising campaign for Calvin Klein this year and sat front row at the brand’s show in September. Nicolas Ghesquiere, the creative director of Louis Vuitton, is also watching the series. For the catwalk show earlier this month, T-shirts for Stranger Things were included amongst the four-figure luxury outfits. The first series was a hit for Netflix. According to Variety, viewing figures averaged 14.07m adults aged 18-49 in the first 35 days after it was released. While it was hugely popular, the series retained a crucial cool factor. This is perhaps down to the eighties setting, the movie buff references and the character of Barb. While her demise was relatively swift, she lived on in fashion-friendly memes thanks to her oversized glasses and cardigans, both items key to Gucci’s cult geek chic aesthetic. Barb is of course included in the Topshop range. She features on a T-shirt, with the slogan “never forget”. Alice Casely-Hayford, the fashion director of Refinery29, believes this trend is “about our current obsession with merch”. “2015 and 2016 were about [Kanye West’s] Life of Pablo, Justin Bieber. This is another way to show you’re part of something.” Casely-Hayford says that pop culture-centric consumers are disenchanted with the band T-shirt now it has become a fashion item – with the TV T-shirt taking its place. “Stranger Things is far more accessible [than an obscure band], but it’s genuine,” she says. Sauvaire considers that this new alliance between fashion and TV may yet become closer as Netflix and Amazon dominate the cultural conversation. “Pop culture is rooted in our brand so that’s why this felt right,” she says. “Fashion has now moved beyond it’s more immediate creative disciplines.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/16/finding-solutions-to-the-uks-housing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:16:18Z","webTitle":"Finding solutions to the UK’s housing crisis | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/16/finding-solutions-to-the-uks-housing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/16/finding-solutions-to-the-uks-housing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Finding solutions to the UK’s housing crisis","bodyText":"Larry Elliott suggests five steps to fix the housing market (Britain’s broken housing market – and how to fix it, 9 October) which include Kate Barker’s idea of “acquiring” large sites abutting urban areas at a modest premium to their existing use. That would effectively part-nationalise development value and might help supply, although the Tories wouldn’t do it because they reversed Labour’s two attempts at taxing development value, the Land Commission Act 1967 and the Community Land Act 1975/Development Land Tax 1976. Increased housing supply doesn’t automatically lead to lower prices of course (unless builders were to build at a rate that forced them to drop their own prices, which they wouldn’t) because, as Elliott says, the housing “market” isn’t a market at all in the traditional supply-and-demand sense. Before more of this crowded country’s open space is concreted over and its amenity value taken from those abutting urban areas, other expedients could be deployed, like penal taxation of empty property and progressive taxation of inherited property wealth, the latter of which continues to snowball for the haves and push prices further beyond the have-nots. Those two measures would do more to bring prices back closer to a manageable multiplier of local earnings and improve the rising generation’s chances of ownership. Whether the banks’ loan books could stand the strain of falling prices – and how hard the Treasury would fight to avoid them – is another question. John Worrall Cromer, Norfolk • Larry Elliott’s incisive analysis of the housing market missed a trick or two. We urgently need to move jobs where the people are, not the opposite. That just inflates southern house prices. And please stop blaming planners. America realised 20 years ago that sprawl is not the answer to housing problems; it doesn’t lower prices, it just increases greenhouse gas emissions. The US smart growth movement’s growing influence demonstrates that compact urban development produces better housing and vibrant communities. Of course the big measure that would reduce house prices would be extending right to buy to the private rented sector – politically impossible, of course. Jon Reeds Smart Growth UK • Analysis of possible solutions for fixing the housing market seem to overlook a key point: an understanding of what housing should be about – ie community. A home for our families, a roof over our heads and a secure base for the rest of our lives from birth to old age. We need less reliance on large builds by multimillion pound faceless corporations making huge profits, and more local planning in favour of self-builds to serve inter-generational families and communities. In France there seems to be a lot of one-unit building on the edge of villages and towns, often they appear to be small bungalows for the elderly. In the UK this is frowned upon. Second, we need to examine the way house prices soared when two full incomes became more the norm. This was a gift to those who benefitted from inflated housing values. It proved a disaster for households at the stage of raising children when (out of necessity) couples’ earnings go down to one and a half incomes or less, due to the need to meet important care responsibilities at home. It’s time to put families first and recognise that housing is a basic need. Let’s invest in construction of decent social “community” housing for young and old. Stop encouraging people to overstretch themselves. Only then will equilibrium be restored. Elliott’s solution number five – the need to boost wages will, I fear, just mean forcing mothers and fathers to both work longer hours with no time to care for children or older relatives. This in turn means a house is no longer a home, just a place to sleep. AM Lewis Salisbury, Wiltshire • Anna Minton’s concern about developers’ “artwash” is just the tip of an urban mountain of bling: “iconic”, “placemaking”, “cultural quarter”, the urban realm as theme park (Developers are using culture as a Trojan horse in their planning battles, 11 October). Meanwhile, city dwellers suffer chronic housing shortages, appalling air quality, gridlocked transport, increasing inequality and marginalisation. Why? Planners morphed into seeing cities as service centres, reflecting the shift since Margaret Thatcher to a service economy. Then Tony Blair brought the bling to the great neoliberal game, along with the expectation of remuneration. A whole generation of local politicians, responsible for taking bread-and-butter planning decisions, have grown up expecting to spread jam. They are too easily seduced by developers’ art-bling, even believing it ethical to join the revolving door of persuasively dazzling development consultancies. Perhaps the most egregious live example is at land secured for social housing at Coin St on London’s South Bank: Bjorn Ulvaeus’ application for an Abba nightclub is currently enjoying fair wind, following the collapse of the infamous garden bridge proposal on an adjacent site. The lessons from that debacle have yet to be learned. Michael Ball Waterloo Community Development Group • Your supplement Rebuilding social housing (20 September) described some of the efforts being made to fill the housing gap. All of these are to increase supply. With more than 300,000 immigrants per annum, a smaller number leaving, and with natural increase, there is no chance without addressing demand. We need more than to limit the number coming in to the country. The ideal would be a population policy with a cabinet minister responsible for population. David Hurry Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex • Regarding “insulting” levels of “affordable” housing at a development in Ilford (Report, 16 October), the really insulting thing is how no one really nails the government and developers on the massive lie inherent in every definition of “affordable” they use. Rather than fig-leaf approaches based on already unaffordable levels of rent, affordability can only be properly based on average incomes and standard mortgage lending criteria. Given average nationwide incomes and typical four-x income multiples, the actual number of truly “affordable” new homes built in the UK today – and for many years – is probably zero.

With good intentions. But this time it is showing the ubiquity of sexual assault. “If all women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too’ as a status, we might give everyone a sense of the magnitude of the problem,” said the actor Alyssa Milano. Well, now it’s there all over social media if you choose to see it. Women saying “me too”, often describing their first sexual assault, some when they were not yet 12. The experience of sexual harassment is not a one-off; it is ongoing – as I wrote last week. It’s the backdrop to many women’s lives. We are numbed by it because to think about it all the time would immobilise us. The reaction to the Weinstein harassment allegations is for some a sudden anger, for others a slow burn. Day by day, more is “known”. The more it is claimed that other people were aware – his assistants, big stars, small stars, all the surrounding servants/scumbags – the greater the effort in the popular press to isolate this behaviour and locate it in one man. So the tabloids are calling him a beast or a monster, usually alongside a picture of young, half-naked women. God forbid any link should be made between his behaviour and the way women are represented. God forbid any link should be made between him and the way other men behave. Contain him in his repulsiveness, and the more extreme he appears to be, the less like other men. So all these women saying “me too” – who have they been assaulted by? No one famous. No one who guaranteed them an Oscar. Not big, powerful men but ordinary men with more power than women. Enough power to shut them up. For this is the way of the world. Can those ways change? Is something actually happening here? I hesitate, but a connection may finally be being made between the paucity of women behind the camera and the way women are shown in front of it. The absolute imbalance of power at the top of the dream factory is hardly news. However, once women start talking, there is always already too much information. After Savile, after Rotherham, senior police officials told us that there is in fact an epidemic of child abuse, that the numbers are so high the police simply cannot prosecute every case. The same applies to domestic violence – and so we become aware of it but it also somehow slips down our cultural consciousness. What will keep this story alive is that it is a celebrity story. Women being sexually assaulted is a staple of much film and TV. What “me too” does is bring it back into the home, the school, the shop, the street, the office where women have been harassed. It makes it small screen not big screen. It makes it ordinary and everyday and seen. There are those who refuse to see. There are the men who can suddenly relate to all this because they have a daughter. There is Woody Allen, of course, who having married his ex-partner’s adopted daughter, must have some extra special insight on this score and so feels “sad” for Harvey “that [his] life is so messed up”. There is Tarantino who worked with Weinstein for 25 years but had no idea and now has to deal with his own “pain” and “anger”. We have comments from the likes of Arron Banks advising women on how to react. Banks, let’s not forget, was arrested on suspicion of harassment of a younger woman in 2012. He was not charged, but was issued with a harassment notice and “words of advice”. We hear from Björk about a certain director making her life unbearable. We watch these guys scuttling round. Weinstein’s brother describes his “waking nightmare”. James Corden apologises after making light of the allegations. All this collusion. All this male entitlement. All these men who still can’t listen. A hashtag is just a tiny symbol against the big guns, but now we are talking about possible crimes instead of just bad behaviour. Women move out of shame and into anger. This is a prerequisite for any change to happen. Male power is not laid low by the bringing down of one man. As long as we have Donald Trump in the White House ranks will close. But just for a moment there is a gap where we see things could be different. Many have waited a long time for this. Don’t let it go now. Keep saying “me too” because we are fighting not one guy here, but a system that can only be challenged by collective rage, not individual shame. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/20/trio-da-kali-the-malian-musicians-defying-jihad-with-help-from-kronos-quartet","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Trio Da Kali: the Malian musicians defying jihad – with help from Kronos Quartet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/20/trio-da-kali-the-malian-musicians-defying-jihad-with-help-from-kronos-quartet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/20/trio-da-kali-the-malian-musicians-defying-jihad-with-help-from-kronos-quartet","fields":{"headline":"Trio Da Kali: the Malian musicians defying jihad – with help from Kronos Quartet","bodyText":"The first time David Harrington met Trio Da Kali, they made him cry. The lead violinist and founder of Kronos Quartet was at the home of a colleague in London where he was to be introduced to the three Malian musicians. The door opened and there stood Hawa Diabaté, who spontaneously broke into a Malian praise song on the threshold. “She was smiling and singing for me,” Harrington tells me. Her song moved him to tears. Almost five years later, he is still spellbound. “It was incredible to be brought into a world of music I’d never encountered.” Diabaté’s voice and presence reminded him of American gospel diva and civil rights activist Mahalia Jackson; for a moment, he says, “it was like having Jackson herself sing to me”. For Diabaté, too, it was a powerful moment of connection. “I sang one of my songs in Bamana [her mother tongue]. A song of women. David is an artist with a big heart,” she says. “He is like a father.” The two groups have collaborated on a superb new album, Ladilikan, produced by ethnomusicologist Lucy Durán and Nick Gold of World Circuit Records. It was Durán’s matchmaking that brought them together. Kronos Quartet were looking to collaborate with Malian artists and Durán tapped three griots – hereditary musicians – all from extraordinary musical families, to form a sort of supergroup. Vocalist Diabaté (the daughter of the celebrated singer Kassé-Mady Diabaté) is backed by the balafon (xylophone) played by Fodé Lassana Diabaté, and the bass n’goni (lute) played by Mamadou Kouyaté. “I thought they would complement the sound of the quartet and would bring out the ‘classical’ side of the [west Aftican] Mande repertoire,” Durán says. Their lineup, too, is a traditional one, a format that, along with the traditional music they perform, is an endangered species in contemporary Mali. Making music with a Malian supergroup is all in a day’s work for Kronos. The quartet has worked with musical partners from all over the world, from folk and pop to jazz and world music. But, says Harrington, the enchantment of that first meeting led to something special on Ladilikan. “The interaction felt really natural,” he says. “We felt appreciated, and we hope they did too for the immense tradition they embody with every note they play. It’s one of our most beautiful collaborations.” None of the trio had ever heard a string quartet, nor were they familiar with western classical music. Lassana Diabaté confesses that he was anxious how his percussive balafon would blend with Kronos’s strings. When the seven musicians first sat down to rehearse together, he was particularly curious to hear what Kronos had done with one of his own compositions, Samuel, for solo balafon. Durán’s album notes pick up the story: “A cascade of delicate interlocking melodies, some bowed, some plucked, began flowing. Lassana’s jaw dropped in astonishment. When it was over he had tears in his eyes. He rushed over to grab David’s hand. ‘You play it better than me!! I can’t believe what you have done. This is going to be the best collaboration I’ve ever done in my life!’” The interaction of the trio with the strings on the album is artfully done, running the gamut from subtle harmonic counterpoint, to circular riffs reminiscent of Steve Reich’s minimalism, to grander phrasings that seem to join the dots between Malian blues and Appalachian folk. One of Harrington’s favourite gospel songs, God Shall Wipe All Tears Away, recorded in the 1930s by Jackson, is at the heart of the album, reworked with lyrics in Bamana and showcasing Hawa’s powerful contralto voice, with Kronos’s strings emulating the legato sustain of the original’s church organ. The title track, Ladilikan – which translates as “words of advice” – draws on another Jackson song, I’m Going to Live the Life I Sing About in My Song. New lyrics address the threat posed by Islamist extremists who seized parts of northern Mali in 2012 and declared religious war against music, among other things. Hawa sings: “You can’t pray on Friday then go out on Saturday and murder children.” Many musicians fled south to the relative safety of the capital, Bamako, although the coup’s economic impact has been a disaster for the city’s musical life. While the jihadist threat dissipated after the French military intervened, extremist factions are still operating in the country, and its musicians continue to defy the violent attempt to erase Mali’s ancient musical culture. “Lots of things about religion are good – don’t lie, don’t kill, don’t steal,” Fodé says. “That’s part of our culture, but now there are extremists who say you can’t dance and you can’t play music because God doesn’t like that. But God is big and great and doesn’t need anyone to fight his battles.” “We are griots … We bring peace. We are examples for the youth. We want to bring joy, and council.” Working with Kronos has changed the way he perceives his instrument, he adds. “I’ve found a way to make music on the balafon in a classical music context where people sit and listen. With this project, I can show that the balafon can do it all – it can make you dance [and] it can make you listen.” Harrington concurs and talks with delight about the virtuosity on the album. Over the five days it took to record Ladilikan, the quartet were treated to daily improvisations from Fodé, his wooden mallets dancing over the rosewood keys of his balafon. “Before every take Lassana did a little improv to get himself and everyone in the mood,” he says. “Imagine hearing one of Bach’s Goldberg Variations before every take, but the variation was on the music we were about to play. It’s the closest I’ll ever get to being in the same room with JS Bach.” Ladilikan is on World Circuit Records. Trio da Kali play Musicport Festival, Whitby (21 Oct), Howard Assembly Room at Opera North, Leeds (22 Oct), St Barnabas Church, Oxford (25 Oct) and The Old Church, Stoke Newington, London (26 October)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/13/share-your-photos-and-stories-of-how-you-are-avoiding-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T10:32:20Z","webTitle":"Share your photos and stories of how you are avoiding plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/13/share-your-photos-and-stories-of-how-you-are-avoiding-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/13/share-your-photos-and-stories-of-how-you-are-avoiding-plastic","fields":{"headline":"Share your photos and stories of how you are avoiding plastic","bodyText":"Pret A Manger announced in October the installation of taps dispensing free filtered water in some of its stores in an attempt to reduce the company’s use of plastic.

The electrician’s van is out front when I get back at 6pm. In the kitchen, two new pendant lights are hanging above the table. My wife walks in. “Kitch wants to speak to you,” she says. Kitch is the electrician. Kitch walks in and stands next to me. He places his fists on the table, knuckles down, and shakes his head ruefully. “I’ve had difficult words with your Mrs,” he says. “About what?” I say. “For God’s sake, Tim,” he says, “when you come in, you unpack the bag straight away.” “Exactly,” my wife says. “You don’t just leave it lying there,” Kitch says. “If I did that, I’d be sleeping in the van.” “I had to go back out,” I reply. “On business.” “How long does it take?” he says. “Just unload it straight into the machine.” “Some of it was clean,” I say. “It doesn’t matter, Tim! Wash it again! She’ll never know.” “OK,” I say, “I get it.” “Just keep her supplied with laundry, and she’ll be happy.” “What?” my wife says. My wife has begun to invite people round to the new house. Guests are required to be enthusiastic about the layout, the aspect and the area. How enthusiastic is not specified, but if you’re not clapping and weeping in the manner of a North Korean official following Kim Jong-un around a launch site, you probably need to be shown the colour for the bannister spindles again. Most guests are enthusiastic; others less so. Some go missing in transit. “Replacement bus,” texts one, in response to the question “where r u?” It’s a reminder that when you live in the suburbs, your house gets an hour farther away at weekends. My wife is defensive about journey times, and has no patience with people who arrive at the door looking theatrically road-weary. “Oh come on,” she says. “It’s Acton, not Surrey.” She’s also worried that the birds haven’t come. Three feeders offering a variety of seeds and nuts hang outside the kitchen, but the finches haven’t turned up. “I think they’re too close to the window,” I say. “There’s feed on the ground underneath,” she says. “Someone’s been eating it.” “That might be parakeets,” I say. “It had better not be parakeets,” she says. On my phone, I have a minute-long video of a fat parakeet hanging upside down from the middle feeder and spraying seed everywhere, but I haven’t shown it to my wife, because I don’t want to upset her. I’m saving it for a time when I do want to upset her. On Friday afternoon, Kitch is back to install two more lights. I am deliberately loading the washing machine while he works, but I can’t see what I’m doing. “It’s so dark in here,” I say, poking my head through the curtain between the laundry area and the kitchen. “Where’s the light?” “It doesn’t work,” my wife says. “I told you about it last week.” “Huh,” I say. “If only we had access to some kind of, I don’t know, a person with specialist knowledge of this sort of thing. A qualified…” “Kitch!” my wife shouts. Kitch comes downstairs. “This light,” I say. Kitch steps through the curtain and scrutinises the bare overhanging bulb. He taps it twice, and it lights up. “No charge for that,” he says. The next morning, I wake up with a wall-mounted bedside lamp shining in my face. I forgot to turn it off, overcome by the sheer novelty of having a wall-mounted bedside lamp. “Christ,” my wife says. “We’ve got people coming round again. You’ll have to go to the butcher.” “That’s good,” I say. “Then we can mention there’s a butcher.” “And the supermarket,” she says. “I’ll make you a list.” “OK,” I say. “I’m out this afternoon, so you can cook,” she says. “Fine,” I say. “For once,” she says.

Jeffrey Barry was found guilty at Bristol crown court of killing and mutilating Kamil Ahmad just hours after being released from a psychiatric hospital. He stabbed him repeatedly before calmly phoning 999 and telling the operator what he had done. He had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Prosecuting, Adam Vaitilingam QC said Ahmad died in a “savage and sustained” attack. Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Richard Ocone said: “Jeffery Barry may have a history of serious mental illness but at the time he attacked Kamil he knew exactly what he was doing... “It is clear in the 999 call he subsequently made that he was already thinking of his defence and the jury rightly recognised he was fully responsible for his actions.” He paid tribute to Ahmad’s family saying that they had been “extremely dignified” throughout the case. Ahmad’s family and friends said he had been let down by several agencies in the city, and that Ahmad had made repeated warnings about feeling threatened by Barry but was ignored. Barry had been arrested and sectioned the month before, having made threats to kill Ahmad, but was released from a psychiatric hospital after promising not to consume alcohol, which exacerbated his condition. He immediately went on a drinking binge, returned home, armed himself with a knife and attacked and killed Ahmad, who did not know Barry had been freed. In the three years before the attack, Ahmad had complained to police four times that Barry had assaulted him. Ahmad’s interpreter, Adil Jaifar, said he had worked with Ahmad for several years and that at weekly therapy meetings he attended with Ahmad, he always talked about how threatened he felt by Barry. “He felt that the police and social services didn’t take him seriously. Ironically, the only time he said that things were OK was the last time I saw him before he died. I asked him how things were with Barry and he said that everything was ‘quiet and pleasant’ because Barry had been detained in a psychiatric hospital. That was the last time I saw him alive.” The case has echoes of the death of Bijan Ebrahimi, a disabled Iranian refugee murdered by a neighbour in Bristol in 2013 after years of racial abuse and having been wrongly branded a paedophile. Earlier this year, Avon and Somerset police were heavily criticised over their role in the Ebrahimi case, and a review of the city council’s handling of the case is expected soon. Ahmad’s brother, Kamaran Ahmad Ali, said after the verdict: “Kamil was a much-loved brother, uncle and cousin. If he had been protected by the authorities, he would be alive today. Why was he not protected? We must have an answer to that question.” Barry had called the police weeks before the killing and falsely claimed that Ahmad was a rapist, paedophile and terrorist. He told support workers at the accommodation they shared in Bristol that he wanted to be a notorious murderer and Ahmad was top of his hit list. Chillingly, Ahmad predicted his own death three years before he was killed. His asylum claim had been considered and refused by the Home Office and he was preparing to submit a fresh claim just before his death. He wrote about his situation and helped to produce artwork revealing it. He drew a picture of himself being stabbed and wrote by way of explanation: “‘My name is Kamil Ahmad. I have painted this picture. This is a house, a window … I have always opened this window, looked outside and shut it again. I shut the window and now everywhere is closed for me. It looks like I am in one room and I can’t go out ... “This is my heart that has been stabbed with a dagger. This is my blood coming down. Someone [at] the Home Office did to me this. And I am bleeding still and no one can stop it. That is all.” A review will look at the role of organisations including the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP), Bristol city council, and Avon and Somerset police in the case. AWP and Bristol city council both said that they were reviewing their working practices in light of the case. The family’s solicitor, Tony Murphy, of Bhatt Murphy, said: “Losing Kamil in such unspeakable circumstances is all the more painful for his family given it was preventable. The evidence heard at trial points to a systemic, multi-agency failure to protect a known victim of violent race-hate crime from a known perpetrator. The family ask the authorities to be open about their failure to protect Kamil so that other lives can be protected.” Barry, 56, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1986 and for long periods his illness was controlled by medication. He moved into accommodation in Knowle, south Bristol, run by the Milestones Trust charity in 2010. Ahmad, who had post-traumatic stress disorder, arrived at the accommodation in 2012. Friends say he was a gentle and friendly man who helped out at a refugee drop-in centre in Bristol. Before the attack, Barry’s medication was changed and in June 2016 he was arrested and sectioned after allegedly threatening to kill Ahmad. The tribunal did not have full access to his medical history and did not realise he was no longer being prescribed the drugs that had helped keep his aggression under control. Nor was it aware of the concerns of Milestones staff about Barry’s obsession with Ahmad. During his trial, the court was told the trust wanted to get an emergency injunction to stop Barry returning to the sheltered flats but did not have enough notice to do so. The court was told there was no care plan in place for Barry. As soon as he was released, Barry went out drinking and in the early hours rang a mental health crisis helpline and told the operator he was criminally insane and was not responsible for his actions. Barry put the phone down, walked upstairs and killed Ahmad before cutting his penis off. Ahmad fled persecution and imprisonment in Iraq, and as a result of his experiences there was diagnosed with severe mental health difficulties. He arrived in the UK in 2011 seeking protection. Ahmad often spoke to friends of his dream of a safe, simple place to live where he could invite them for a barbecue. In a tribute following his death, Jaifar and Rebecca Yeo, a researcher into disability in the immigration &amp; asylum system, wrote: “The world has lost a gentle, kind-hearted and modest man. He will not, and must not, be forgotten.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/edinburgh-garage-conversion-studio-play-space","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Love shack: how a disused garage became a vital family space","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/edinburgh-garage-conversion-studio-play-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/edinburgh-garage-conversion-studio-play-space","fields":{"headline":"Love shack: how a disused garage became a vital family space","bodyText":"A few years ago, Ina Porras faced a dilemma: with a growing brood, her beloved Georgian bungalow outside Edinburgh was feeling squeezed. But the family didn’t want to leave. Porras and her husband, James Mayers, had moved to the seaside suburb of Portobello from London in 2002, with their four-month-old son Finlay. “We love the sea, beaches, and its proximity to Edinburgh,” she says. “It’s such a vibrant community.” So the couple – plus Finlay, now 14, Carmen, 12, and Pedro, nine – decided to convert the crumbling stone garage at the bottom of their garden instead. The walls, which in the early 1800s housed horses for the then owner’s carriage, were rubble and the roof was collapsing. “James wanted a proper garage for the bikes, the lawnmower and tools,” says Porras, who is from Costa Rica and works in international development, as does her husband. “I wanted a bright place where I could take up my new sewing hobby with Carmen. And the children wanted a place to hang out with their friends, and play music.” Local architects Chambers McMillan came up with a design that incorporated all three: a garage/workshop at the back; a glass-fronted studio extension at the front; and a mezzanine den above the studio with an asymmetrical roof. With timber beams and exposed OSB board (an alternative to plywood), the end result has a rough, unfinished feel. A window in the den is half-concealed behind strips of larch cladding, so when the kids are hanging out upstairs, they can see out but other people can’t see in. “There is something of the outdoors about it,” architect Thea McMillan says of the space. “It’s more like a shed or a shack. We kept as much of the original stone as we could, while the corrugated metal roof references traditional Scottish bothies as well as roofs in Costa Rica.” For Porras, “the studio is an extension of our home, yet separate enough to be a different space to retreat to”. The family has named it Osa, “after Peninsula de Osa, near my home town”, she says. “I like meeting friends here. It’s an intimate space where we can work, sew, talk and share a bottle of wine. Finlay’s in a band, and if it gets more serious, this will make a fantastic studio.” But, most of all, Porras says, “I love the sound of the rain on the tin roof. It takes me home.” House rules Pet interiors hate Lacy curtains and squint pictures. Worst decorating mistake Light-coloured carpets (given that we have kids and a dog).

A proposed legal bill would set down a clear age of consent for minors after a shocking case in which a rape charge was dropped when a court decided an 11-year-old girl had consented to sex with a man more than twice her age. It will also give traumatised child victims more time to come forward to bring criminal charges against their attackers. The announcement on Monday from the French equality minister, Marlène Schiappa, could hardly have come at a more appropriate time, with scores of French women coming forward to detail incidents of harassment and assault following the Harvey Weinstein scandal. A Twitter appeal by the radio journalist Sandra Muller using #balancetonporc (squeal on your pig), encouraging women to publicly shame their attackers, was top of the French Twitter trend list over the weekend. A second international campaign #MeToo is now trending in France. On Monday, Schiappa launched a pre-debate “citizens’ consultation” over the legislation, including the possibility of police warnings for everyday sexist acts such as wolf whistling and comments about physical appearance in the street. “The point is that the whole of society has to redefine what it will accept and what it will not,” Schiappa told La Croix, a Catholic newspaper. The minister pointed out that there are 84,000 rapes and 220,000 sexual assaults in France each year, and one woman is killed by a violent partner in the country every three days. “We want to reduce those statistics for violence … All sexually motivated violence must be taken into account, including male sexual violence against small boys and disabled people. On this, we have to address another taboo,” she said. “Voices are being heard, in France as in other parts of the world. Society is ready to reject this violence. There is a desire to act.” Police, magistrates, psychiatrists, and education and legal experts are also being solicited for their opinions, and a parliamentary commission is to study the question of harassment in public places. The information will be collated at the end of the year and a draft bill presented to the Assemblée Nationale in the first half of 2018. “I think, personally, that whistling at a women in the street is not harassment, but it’s the case when you follow her on to the subway. In this case, the stress, even intimidation, is evident,” Schiappa said. A key pillar of the legislation would be an increase in the time limit for cases of sexual abuse on minors from 20 to 30 years from them reaching adulthood at 18. Last year, Flavie Flament, a French broadcast journalist, alleged that she was raped by the British-born photographer David Hamilton 30 years previously, when she was 13. Flament said it had taken three decades for her to deal with the attack, but she was unable to bring charges because of the legal time limit. Hamilton was found dead in his Paris home having apparently killed himself after three other women made similar claims. The law would also define an age of consent for minors. The French high commission for male/female equality has suggested it be set at 13 years. Others, including Laurence Rossignol, a former family minister in the Socialist administration, are pressing for 15 years. The issue became a political priority last month following national outrage after a court reduced a charge against a 28-year-old man from rape to sexual assault because it decided the 11-year-old victim had suffered “no violence, no constraint, no threat, no surprise”, and could be deemed to have consented."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/17/ms-wins-crown-for-best-christmas-turkey-and-fizz-in-blind-tasting","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T23:01:22Z","webTitle":"M&S wins crown for best Christmas turkey and fizz in blind tasting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/17/ms-wins-crown-for-best-christmas-turkey-and-fizz-in-blind-tasting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/17/ms-wins-crown-for-best-christmas-turkey-and-fizz-in-blind-tasting","fields":{"headline":"M&S wins crown for best Christmas turkey and fizz in blind tasting","bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer has topped the major categories in an independent taste test of Christmas food and drink, winning with its turkey, cranberry sauce and sparkling wine, and taking more high ratings than any other supermarket. The store had 14 products in the top five for each category in the annual exercise by Good Housekeeping magazine, although budget chain Aldi had the best Christmas pudding and tastiest vegetarian meal – its £1.99 spinach, leek and cheddar cheese parcels. This year, for the first time, vegetarian main courses and stuffings were added to the “basket” of the usual Christmas staples: a 16-strong list including champagne and sparkling wine, mince pies, frozen turkey, smoked salmon, Christmas pudding and brandy butter – which were blind-tasted (all packaging removed) by a panel of experts. This reflected the rise of vegetarianism and “flexitarianism” in the UK, Good Housekeeping said, with festive diners expecting supermarkets to offer much more than a token nut roast for their Christmas dinner. The best Christmas pudding was Aldi’s Specially Selected Golden Topped Christmas Pudding (£7.99), while the tastiest mince pies were Tesco Finest six mince pies (£2). Iceland’s pigs in blankets (10 for £3) came top of their class. Taking the overall turkey crown this year was Marks &amp; Spencer’s British Oakham turkey crown with pork, sage and onion stuffing (£27). Shoppers were also advised to head to M&amp;S for its winning prosecco (£10) or to Sainsbury’s, where its Taste the Difference NV Champagne Brut (£18) – which goes on sale in November – scored top marks. “Supermarkets understand that consumers tend to trade up over Christmas and many have focused on their premium ranges,” said Angela Trofymova, food testing manager at Good Housekeeping. “M&amp;S has proved that shelling out a little more where possible can take your festive dining experience to the next level, while budget supermarket Aldi shows you can get cost-effective quality without breaking the bank.” In its quest to find the best, the Good Housekeeping taste test team and consumer panel ate and drank their way through 316 different festive foods in 16 different categories from more than 30 retailers. Positive recommendations in influential national taste tests can clear supermarket shelves. Last year, own-brand “luxury” mince pies from frozen food giant Iceland sold out in many parts of the UK after being judged the best, beating 24 other brands including Harrods and Selfridges. And Marks &amp; Spencer’s Belgian Chocolate and Orange Star Christmas Pudding – last year crowned the best of the Christmas pudding bunch – was a strong seller that other retailers sought to emulate. Aldi’s award-winning Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut NV – at £10.99 – was again highly rated this year.

MPs said they were “dumbstruck” to learn that even more material relating to patients’ health had been mislaid, some of it by NHS Shared Business Services (SBS), the firm co-owned by the government that lost the documents. The disclosure came at an evidence session of the Commons public accounts committee, which is investigating the disappearance that the Guardian first revealed in February. Health officials investigating a contractor’s loss of medical correspondence have discovered a further 162,000 missing documents, which could include patient records and cancer tests, parliament’s spending watchdog was told on Monday. Following an inquiry into the loss of the original 702,000 documents, NHS managers have admitted that two new tranches of missing medical papers have been uncovered and it is not yet known if the patients involved are at risk. The latest lost documents could include treatment plans, details of changes to what drugs patients should be taking, child protection notes and the results of various kinds of diagnostic tests. Officials said that in the course of their inquiries, they had identified a further 150,000 medical documents that had been mistakenly sent to the outsourcing firm Capita by GPs; and a further 12,000 missing papers that had had not been processed by SBS. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative committee member, said: “You tell us the bombshell that whilst on a trawl of local trusts you find another 12,000 and then you found another 150,000 [missing] items. “Until you have sifted through them, you don’t know if there is a serious case out there where someone is dying because the notes haven’t been transferred. So when are you going to get on top of this situation?” Simon Stevens, the NHS’s chief executive, replied: “This should be wrapped up by the end of March. End of March is a feasible goal.” NHS officials told the committee that of the original missing files, they sent 5,562 cases for clinical review. Of those, 4,565 have been completed – 3,624 of which have shown that there was no clinical harm to patients. There are 941 cases still to be cleared, officials said, adding that no one has yet been identified as coming to harm because of the loss. The National Audit Office found that SBS first recognised in January 2014 that patients may have come to harm as a result of what was at the time a fast-rising backlog of undelivered paperwork. However, despite staff raising concerns, the firm – which is 49.99% owned by the Department of Health – did not alert the department or NHS England until March last year, 26 months later. SBS was then “obstructive and unhelpful” to NHS England in the inquiry it then instigated, the NAO found. A review of the health department’s governance arrangements in relation to SBS, undertaken by its own internal auditor, later found it had not taken up two of its three seats on the firm’s board. NHS officials and SBS apologised for the lost documents, saying that SBS has paid £4.34m for the loss. Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, wrapped up the fraught session by saying that the committee would ask the NAO to look again at the loss of documentation. An NHS England spokesperson said: “These new cases have come to light as a result of our determination to leave no stone unturned and all these documents will be returned to GPs for clinical review where needed within the next 10 weeks. “People should be reassured that despite reviewing over 97% of the records that SBS failed to process not a single case of patient harm has been identified.” Labour said the disclosure that even more documents had gone missing than first acknowledged was “astonishing”. Jonathan Ashworth, its shadow health secretary, said: “Hundreds of thousands of patient letters have been lost, and the secretary of state only admitted it had happened because details were leaked. Now we find even more letters went missing than we were originally told. “The government’s response has been complacent and evasive. It’s still not clear how much public money has been wasted in this affair or how this private company is going to be held to account. It’s totally unreasonable for Jeremy Hunt to wash his hands of this when more and more details of his department’s failures keep emerging.” Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, demanded that Hunt -- who has already been summoned to the Commons twice over the scandal -- should urgently appear before MPs to update them on the situation. “This colossal blunder now turns out to be even worse than previously thought. the safety of thousands of patients has been put at risk due to the incompetence of a single private company and lack of proper oversight. Jeremy Hunt must urgently come before parliament to explain what steps are being taken to ensure this does not happen again.” • This article was amended on 17 October 2017.

Until his 1990 Edinburgh festival fringe show, A One Night Stand With Sean Hughes, won the Perrier award for best show, most alternative comedy shows at the fringe were little more than extended comedy club sets, gags shamelessly stitched together. Hughes did something different, weaving a narrative into his performance, which was set in an imaginary bedsit. Today we think nothing of comedy shows having an emotional arc regarding some personal grief or loss. There is even a joke about it. Comics talk about doing a “dead dad” show. We might not have had these shows without Hughes. His former promoter Richard Bucknall has rightly called him “a pioneering, groundbreaking comedian who changed comedy with that live show”. While the comic with the impish face and indie kid fringe was usually thought of as Irish, he was born John Hughes in London. His Catholic family moved to Dublin when he was six and Hughes used to talk about how sounding like a cockney in an Irish school was not easy. He later quipped that he spent “most of my childhood in a headlock”. Not surprisingly his Mary Poppins accent soon developed a lilting local burr. Making schoolfriends laugh was a classic defence mechanism and he even set up comedy gigs at his school. What started out as a hobby quickly became a career. After cutting his teeth on the small Irish circuit he came to London in the late 1980s where the alternative comedy scene was really taking off with standups such as Jo Brand, Jack Dee and Julian Clary making a name for themselves. Hughes immediately stood out. There was a literary bent to his playful style and his routines were peppered with references to pop music. He was a huge Smiths fan and imagined Morrissey phoning him up for a chat. He made comedy cool long before it was described as the new rock’n’roll. When he won the Perrier award at 24 he was the youngest winner of the prize. Further critical and popular success came with Sean’s Show on Channel 4 in 1992. This was a sitcom that broke down boundaries, as Hughes addressed the audience and commented on the action. It was not the first comedy to do this – Garry Shandling did a similar thing in the US with It’s Garry Shandling’s Show – but Hughes added a surreal sensibility to the format: musicians turned out to be living under his bed and his bath was filled with jelly by Windsor Davies from It Ain’t Half Hot Mum. Success did not always sit comfortably with his temperament. Although he went through a decidedly hedonistic period in his youth he could also be something of a solitary figure. He lived alone in a large house in Crouch End, north London, and while he had a number of girlfriends he did not seem to be interested in or able to form long-term relationships. “I like to be on my own. I can deal with that,” he told the Guardian in 2012. He will probably be known to most people for making playful digs about pop stars as one of the team captains on the BBC2 music quiz Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Hughes appeared on the show from 1996 to 2002 and enjoyed messing about with the likes of Boy George and Mel B, who chided him for not being sassy enough. There was a serious side, too. His numerous books included stark poetry and gloomy novels. His publishers, of course, wanted funny books, because they thought they were the ones that would sell. There was always a tension in Hughes. He could make people laugh easily, but wanted to achieve much more. Vivienne Clore, who was his agent for a while, describes him as a “poetic, lonely soul”. In recent years he had developed a new string to his bow as an actor. He appeared in high-profile television programmes including The Last Detective (2003-07) and Coronation Street (2007) and joined a long list of standups who have done Shakespeare, appearing as Touchstone in As You Like It at Wyndhams theatre in 2005. He also played Mr Perks in The Railway Children at King’s Cross theatre in 2015. More in keeping with his absurdist streak, he was the lead in a film adaptation of Spike Milligan’s Puckoon in 2002. In middle age he caught the standup bug again and performed a series of shows in which his sense of humour was as playful as ever – he was just older and portlier. The jokes were often about his body falling apart – Hughes recalled a recent prostate test: “You’ve never lived until a man has put his finger up your arse.” Reports suggest that he had been ill over this summer with liver problems. In his acclaimed 2012 show Life Becomes Noises, he finally did his own “dead dad” show and shed some light on his upbringing. His father, a driving instructor, had a fondness for betting on horses, so Hughes junior wore a jokey jockey outfit in the show. Both father and son liked to drink (though Sean gave up around this time), but were never close. “We used to high-five each other in the middle ground of self-hatred,” Hughes told the Guardian. A new generation of comedians seemed to be discovering Hughes, who was happy to return to basics and play the London circuit again to roadtest new material. The rising star Carl Donnelly was a big fan and says that Hughes helped him to develop as a comedian. And anyone who has ever staged an acclaimed Edinburgh show with a narrative element should probably dedicate any award they pick up to Hughes. He is survived by his brothers, Alan and Martin. • Sean Hughes (John Hughes), comedian and actor, born 10 November 1965; died 16 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-cant-be-done","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T16:46:49Z","webTitle":"The time has come for Theresa May to tell the nation: Brexit can’t be done | Alastair Campbell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-cant-be-done","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-cant-be-done","fields":{"headline":"The time has come for Theresa May to tell the nation: Brexit can’t be done","bodyText":"As she tries to move the Brexit negotiations forward, how much better would Theresa May and the country feel if the speech she made to her party went as follows. “Leadership is about confronting the great challenges. But Brexit is the biggest challenge we have faced since the second world war. So I intend to devote my speech, in four parts, to this alone. “First, I want to explain why I voted remain – because for all its faults, the European Union has been a force for good in Europe and in the UK. I believed that our future prosperity and security, and opportunities for our young people, would be enhanced by staying in. Second, I want to explain why, nonetheless, I was something of a reluctant remainer. The truth is, there is a lot wrong with the EU. So though I voted remain, I was not starry-eyed. I was determined that, had we won, we would also fight for reform. “Third, I want to explain why I have been trying so hard to deliver the Brexit the people voted for. It was a close result. But leave won. I felt strongly that it was my duty to deliver the only Brexit that I believed could meet the demands of the majority of leavers – out of the single market and the customs union, out of the European court of justice. “But precisely because I have a profound sense of duty, I want to tell you the absolute truth as I see it. It cannot be done. Yes, you can shout. You can storm out. But I have looked at it every which way. And, as your leader, I have concluded that it cannot be done without enormous damage to our economy, to your living standards, to our public services, to our standing in the world. This is damage I am not prepared to inflict. The cost is too high. “I will publish the legal advice that I have the right to unilaterally revoke article 50, and if you look behind me you will see the backdrop has gone and instead there is onscreen the letter I will be sending to Donald Tusk and the EU 27 heads of government later today. “I say to Boris, to Michael, to Liam, and to their acolytes, it is decision time. If you feel you don’t wish to listen to the arguments I will make, then you know what you have to do. I am ready for any challenge, confident that finally I will be able to fight for what I believe is the right course for Britain, and confident that once the public have the proper debate we failed to have during the referendum and the election, that my view can prevail in the country. “The Labour party will also have to make up its mind. Most Labour MPs support the position I am setting out today, though their leadership may need to be persuaded. We may need a general election to settle this. At some point we may need a referendum to reverse the outcome of the first one. I am aware I am launching something here, the course of which is unpredictable. I am prepared to take all the risks attached to that. For I am no longer willing to pretend. I am no longer willing for the delusions of the few to dictate a strategy for the many, when so much is at stake. “I will also be publishing the sectoral advice papers we have received on the impact of Brexit on all aspects of our national life, so MPs can debate these fully. I know many of you think I might be ill. I feel a lot better now. Because what has been making me ill is the reality of which I have been certain more each day … that Brexit is a disaster, a potential catastrophe for our country. That my duty now is to steer the country to the only sensible decision I can see – a rethink, a change of course: not hard Brexit or soft Brexit, but no Brexit at all.” Big and bold, I’m sure you will agree. She would get resignations, and vitriol by the bucket-load from the Brextremist media. She might lose her job. Equally, this might be the way to save it. In her Florence speech, May called for more creativity, as though it needed to come from others. This speech is the kind of creativity she needs. It would be the making of her. And most of the country, I am sure, would breathe an enormous sigh of relief. • Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair’s director of communications and is editor-at-large of the New European"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/23/tarragona-catalonia-second-city-barcelona-independence-catalan-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T10:45:15Z","webTitle":"Tarragona in the spotlight: Catalonia’s Roman-era gem stays calm amid storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/23/tarragona-catalonia-second-city-barcelona-independence-catalan-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/23/tarragona-catalonia-second-city-barcelona-independence-catalan-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Tarragona in the spotlight: Catalonia’s Roman-era gem stays calm amid storm","bodyText":"Tarragona, a coastal city that was once an important Roman capital, is used to all the attention falling on Barcelona. But Catalonia’s quieter southern sister is suddenly in the public eye due to the independence vote, raising its voice despite never being known for a strong nationalist identity. According to the Catalan government, only 21% of Tarragona’s electorate took part in the referendum for independence that was held on 1 October, with a majority voting Yes. Local pro-independence politician Jordi Martí has argued that, were Barcelona to become a potential new state capital, it shouldn’t act as imperiously as Madrid has: “Decentralisation must also happen at a smaller level.” For now, as in the rest of the region, there remain a lot more questions than answers. Attracting the ‘perfect tourist’ The city’s economy is mostly driven by the region’s huge petrochemical industry, the biggest in southern Europe, with Tarragona’s port serving as a transport hub. But one additional focus, now, is tourism. Tarragona is not only overshadowed by the bright Catalan capital: the nearby village of Salou, known for its “booze tourism” and crowded beaches, has stolen the limelight, as have the PortAventura theme park and the brand new Ferrari Land. “We are working to boost a Tarragona brand differentiated from Salou,” says José Luis Martín, the deputy mayor. The city has the perfect ingredients to draw visitors, being the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian peninsula, whose impressive ruins were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2000. Some relics are hidden in unusual places – for instance, inside rock music bars or restaurants in the Part Alta, the historical centre of the town. Tarragona also has the huge natural attraction of its coastline. Up to five beaches reachable by intercity bus. The biggest one, Platja Llarga, is a natural beach that was “saved from urban speculation thanks to the social movement of neighbours who stopped it”, Martí says. Tarragona in numbers … 15 – the percentage of women working inside the petrochemical cluster, the biggest in Spain. It accounts for a quarter of the total Spanish petrochemical production. 11 – the number of Roman constructions recognised by Unesco. 100 – the cost, in millions of euros, of state-of-the-art Mas d’Enric prison, inaugurated in 2015. It features “non-oppressive” exercise spaces, an interior meadow and cell windows that face outwards on to nearby woodland. … and pictures History in 100 words Tarraco, the city’s ancient name, was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian peninsula. It was founded in 218BC, and its urban planning and design served as a model for many of the empire’s capitals. The city then became part of the Muslim al-Andalus empire for four centuries (713-1129), until it was won back by the Christians. During the Spanish civil war of 1936-39, Tarragona was bombed several times. In the late 60s and early 70s, industrial prosperity arrived with the establishment of companies such as Dow Chemical, Bayer and Repsol in nearby villages. Tarragona in sound and vision Bigas Luna, the Catalan film-maker who discovered Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz, chose Tarragona for the setting of My Name Is Juani, a 2006 film about a working-class girl who dreams of becoming an actor. The city has also had its moments of glamour via high-end advertising. Dolce &amp; Gabbana chose its Roman ruins as the background for one of its campaigns … … while the Catalan beer brand Estrella Damm, whose yearly summer ads have become so long they qualify as short films, made use of the Platja dels Capellans in its latest production, starring Game of Thrones’s Peter Dinklage. Eco-fitting the city Between 1960 and ’64, the population of Tarragona experienced a growth of 20%, mainly due to workers from the south of Spain arriving to join the emerging petrochemical industry. With companies such as BASF and Shell Spain established close by, the region is considered the biggest petrochemical industrial complex in southern Europe. While a matter of pride for some, for others this development has become a problem. In recent years, leaks from the plants have polluted the city’s air, and they may be having a negative impact on public health. There is now a Change.org petition demanding a solution to the “frequent episodes of light, acoustic and atmospheric pollution (bad smells, big flames, black smoke, noise, etc)”. The industry has responded with projects such as “smell monitoring”. A team from the compound does daily rounds with special devices that measure odours in the air and detect high levels of undesired substances. However, ecological groups are demanding more. Inside city hall If the independence situation is complex throughout Catalonia, in Tarragona it has an added twist. Mayor Josep Fèlix Ballesteros, of the Socialists’ Party of Catalonia, had publicly declared his opposition to the referendum and stated that no council-funded spaces should be used for its celebration – a position shared by few mayors in Catalonia. Police brutality against voters on referendum day shook the municipal government. One of the deputy mayors resigned, claiming the mayor had not condemned the violence strongly enough, and left the city with a minority government. Instability is a concern in the immediate future. Councillor Martín, of the conservative People’s Party of Catalonia, does not think losing one MP will unduly affect the municipality, although he does have some concerns about independence: “Political uncertainty does not help Tarragona’s governance.” What’s next for the city? Next up are the Mediterranean Games 2018 – a reboot of the Mediterranean Games 2017, which were delayed due to economic problems but whose logo still graces bar chairs and beers glasses around the city. As well as exposure, the goal is the “urban transformation of one of the most degraded areas”, says councillor Javier Villamayor, who is in charge of the Mediterranean Games 2018 Commission. The area he is referring to is the Ponent district, where many of the poorest citizens live: existing sports facilities are being transformed into a sports arena with space for 5,000 spectators and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. However, not everybody supports the expenditure. “It is outrageous in a city that is already indebted, and when the Games end they will leave even more debt,” says Councillor Martí, adding that “the grassroots sports of the town continue to be left behind”. He argues that there are a lot of football clubs lacking good facilities, which would benefit greatly from the investment.

At the same time I’ve been reminded of the literally hundreds of times I, too, have endured varying degrees of sexual harassment in my nearly 40-year career. And I bet you won’t find a single actress who hasn’t got similar stories to tell. This behaviour was so commonplace it barely warranted comment except as “jokey” tales female actors would swap. In 1979 when I gingerly walked on to the set of my first TV drama, a (white, male, as they all were back then) electrician shouted from the gantry, where he busied himself with a light: “Nice big tits on this one, fellas.” This was met with much laughter from the rest of the (all-male) crew. I was surprised and embarrassed but not particularly shocked. My walk home from drama school included a shortcut through a street market peopled by barrow boys all using the same repartee. On my second TV job, when a props guy bent down in front of me to arrange a bit of set dressing, another crew member shouted across, “Oi, mate, while you’re down there …” and this, too, was met with general amusement. In 1980 on the set of the first film I did, The French Lieutenant’s Woman, a senior crew member to whom I’d never spoken asked me, again for the benefit of the crew, if I would “help him out” as he “hadn’t seen the wife for a bit and was heavy with seed”. Cut to later that decade, when I was doing a small part in a show starring a household name. I was young and fairly inexperienced, and at the end of my one day on the job, said household name (whose company also produced his show) suggested I come to his trailer to “give him a blow job while he sticks his fingers up my cunt”. We’d never spoken before, not even on set. Not long after that, I am auditioning for a national theatre tour. I haven’t worked for an entire year and I am absolutely desperate. I’m wearing a mid-calf-length skirt. The producer, a tiny, wizened man in his late 60s approaches from the back of the stalls after I’ve performed my piece and says: “Lift your skirt up, I need to see your legs.” I decline, spurred, pathetically, not by righteous indignation but because I believe that if he saw my imperfect legs then I wouldn’t get the job. “What the fuck’s the matter with you?” he barks, “You’re a pretty girl.” A few years later I’m in New York with some very close, older friends, and I meet their friend, a movie star. He shows no particular interest in me but offers me a lift home in his chauffeured limo. He doesn’t speak to me during the trip but at 4am the phone rings, and it’s him. “I’m sending the car for you,” he says. When I ask why, he screams: “Listen, you know what I want. You’re not the sort of girl I need to take to dinner, just get in the car.” I don’t. These are a few sample “highlights” but this sort of thing was commonplace. In fact, I’m hard pushed to think of a job (not to mention auditions) during which something sexual, unwarranted and wholly inappropriate did not happen. But not once, ever, did it occur to me to object or complain. For a start, who would I complain to? The desperate rarely find their voice and when the highest currency in the marketplace is one’s impossible-to-quantify “appeal”, how are you going to find the courage to complain about the very person to whom you are hoping to appeal? How does one object to treatment at the hands of the person who has the power to give you the work you so desperately need? The life of an aspiring female actor can be summed up in three words: please like me. And more often than not they will put up with whatever it takes. Fast-forward to the mid-90s, when I’ve got a bit of a profile thanks to The Fast Show. At the British Comedy Awards, where we are nominated, I find an Oxbridge-educated, hugely successful producer crawling on the carpet almost underneath me. He calls back to his group some feet away: “I’m trying to see if she’s wearing knickers.” Boys will be boys, eh? Shooting a sketch show, I am the only woman on set when one of my colleagues announces, without prelude: “You see, I sort of want to fuck you but I want to punch you too.” Another colleague rejoins: “Yeah, I know what you mean, me too.” This time I do object – cue cries of, “Come on, it’s a joke, lighten up.” Clearly, I was taking it the wrong way. In an industry where the idea of meritocracy cannot feasibly be applied, where an independent measure of talent cannot possibly exist, where a person who has no training or experience but who looks amazing can be cast as the lead in a film, then of course it’s going to be fertile ground for people who abuse their power. If you’re a sexual pervert then why not become a producer or director? You’ll get to be alone in a room, entirely legitimately, with girls (or boys) you wouldn’t get close to in a million years if you’d chosen to start up a chain of dry cleaners instead. No one is desperate for a job in dry-cleaning. I am midway through shooting a BBC sitcom in Glasgow, Two Doors Down. Unlike when I started out, at least 30% of the crew are women. I don’t imagine a single male member of our crew or cast would dream of making a lewd comment – not because it doesn’t occur to them but because the presence of women in film and TV crews means the wolf-whistle culture no longer prevails. But there still aren’t anything like enough visible, powerful women represented on, or working within, film and TV, and that has got to change. We need to be the change. No man was ever going to expose Harvey Weinstein. It’s down to women in all walks of life to complain every single time we see a woman poorly represented on screen. We need to call out the disgusting treatment of women by people in power every single time we witness it and we need to risk not being liked for doing so. We need to be the change we want to see. • Arabella Weir is a comedy writer/performer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/17/true-scale-of-uk-slavery-tens-of-thousands-of-victims-kevin-hyland","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T11:31:05Z","webTitle":"True scale of UK slavery likely to involve ‘tens of thousands' of victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/17/true-scale-of-uk-slavery-tens-of-thousands-of-victims-kevin-hyland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/17/true-scale-of-uk-slavery-tens-of-thousands-of-victims-kevin-hyland","fields":{"headline":"True scale of UK slavery likely to involve ‘tens of thousands' of victims","bodyText":"The number of people living in slavery in the UK is likely to be considerably higher than the current estimate of 13,000, according to the independent anti-trafficking commissioner, Kevin Hyland, who has claimed that the “true number is in the tens of thousands”. Speaking to the Guardian, Hyland said that a better understanding of the real scale of slavery in the UK must become an “absolute priority” for government, if there was a chance of reaching as many potential victims as possible. “The 13,000 figure is based on old intelligence and we’ve come a long way since then in terms of our understanding of the real scale of the problem we’re facing,” he said. “We know now that slavery here in the UK is far more prevalent than we have ever realised, and building a better response needs to be an absolute priority both domestically and globally.” The anti-slavery commissioner said that victims are currently being failed by the national referral mechanism (NRM), which was introduced in 2009 to identify cases of slavery and trafficking. “The NRM is a system designed to deal with hundreds not thousands of victims and needs to be more flexible and accountable,” said Hyland. “At the moment all of the emphasis is on identification but victim support must be at the heart of this process if we are to get people to trust us in coming forward and reporting these crimes.” However, speaking after the publication on Monday of his annual anti-slavery report (pdf), Hyland pointed out that real progress has been made in tackling slavery crimes. The UK recorded 2,255 modern slavery offences across England and Wales last year, a 159% increase from the previous year. Hyland – who formerly headed the Metropolitan police’s human trafficking unit and criticised the UK police’s poor efforts to report modern slavery offences last year – was “particularly pleased” by Northern Ireland’s efforts to combat slavery, which has passed on all slavery offences to the referral mechanism for the second year running. The Met alone this year recorded more than double the number of offences of the previous year, amounting to nearly 500 crimes of modern slavery, the highest figure by far in any police force in the UK. West Midlands recorded the second highest number of offences this year (215), followed by Kent and Essex (179), West Yorkshire (147) and Greater Manchester (139). Detective chief inspector Phil Brewer of the Met’s modern slavery and kidnap unit said the increase in offences and referrals was down to clearer pathways for victims to seek help and protection; greater awareness among officers, as well as the public, at recognising potential victims; and better cooperation between agencies at referring potential leads. More than half of all suspected victims referred to the national mechanism in 2016 were from Albania, Vietnam, the UK, Nigeria and China. The majority of child trafficking victims identified were British citizens. This week, the Church of England is also mobilising its parishes to be the “eyes and ears” of local communities to identify signs of modern slavery and to support its victims in an initiative backed by the prime minister and archbishop of Canterbury. The three-year project, launched at Lambeth Palace on Tuesday, is called the Clewer Initiative after an order of Anglican nuns funding the project: they were founded in the 19th century to help vulnerable young women. Ten C of E dioceses have signed up to the initiative, with a further 14 expected to participate by the end of the year. It is hoped that all 42 dioceses will take part. The project will provide training and information on how to spot signs of slavery and victims of labour exploitation in areas including construction and car washing. Hyland said faith groups had “influence, insight and rare avenues into the community – they are therefore a powerful tool in the fight against modern slavery”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/oct/16/negotiation-have-we-got-it-wrong-brexit-best-deal-skills-common-myths-misconceptions-simon-horton","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T14:45:48Z","webTitle":"Negotiation – have we got it wrong? | Simon Horton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/oct/16/negotiation-have-we-got-it-wrong-brexit-best-deal-skills-common-myths-misconceptions-simon-horton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2017/oct/16/negotiation-have-we-got-it-wrong-brexit-best-deal-skills-common-myths-misconceptions-simon-horton","fields":{"headline":"Negotiation – have we got it wrong?","bodyText":"With Brexit negotiations constantly in the news, everyone has become an expert and has an opinion on what David Davis needs to do to get a good deal. But are they right? Do these beermat philosophers really know what they are talking about? Negotiation is a much-researched topic, and projects like the Harvard Program on Negotiation have built extensive bodies of work, studying what actually works in practice and revealing a number of common misconceptions on the subject. So let’s have a look at some of the commonly held negotiation beliefs research has shown to be wrong. Good = tough Perhaps the most common myth is that to be a good negotiator, you need to be tough and never budge an inch from your position. There are many problems with this approach. First, if both sides are tough negotiators and nobody budges, nobody gets a deal: a deal that could benefit both parties is lost because neither side is willing to shift. Alternatively, if the sides do begrudgingly move to meet somewhere in the middle, you can end up with a result where neither side is happy. For example, one side could walk away thinking they sold something for a steal and the other side may still believe they paid too much. Being a tough negotiator, you may also get a reputation and people will either not want to work with you or – if they really have to – factor it in accordingly. That 20% discount you got? Well, maybe unbeknown to you, they had first hiked the price up by 30%. Don’t give away too much information We are often told we should not give the other side too much information because they will use it against us. In actual fact, studies show that the more information is shared, the better the solution reached. Trust is very important in negotiation – the greater the trust, the better the outcome – and the best way of developing trust is by showing it. In other words, share some information. Obviously, you should not be too naïve, but in general, sharing information is a good thing. It’s all about power A lot of the conversation around negotiations is about who has the power. But in actual fact, if power is a factor, the deal is already on shaky ground. Let’s say you have all the power in a situation and you want to push something through just because you can – even though the other side does not want it. What will happen is they will find a way to even things up. The horsemeat scandal is a great example of this: supermarkets used their muscle to push through terms that were unprofitable for the supplier, so the supplier simply swapped the beef for horsemeat. The win-lose approach rapidly becomes lose-lose. You need to use tactics Everybody has their favourite negotiation tactic – good cop-bad cop, take it or leave it, a deadline – and there are many more. But they don’t work. Correction: they work, once. And once only. Because afterwards that other person will never trust you again. It’s like clickbait – you fall for it once and never again. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think through what you are going to say. But tricks are likely to be counterproductive in the long run. You have to compromise The myths above are mostly held by “tough” negotiators. But “nice guys” have myths of their own, too. For example, that it’s all about compromise. Actually, good negotiators avoid compromise. Instead, they see negotiation as a process to create extra value, so all parties are better off and no one has to compromise. It’s the 1 + 1 = 3 solution. Compromise takes place when the desired outcomes are mutually exclusive, but the best negotiators know that if you dig deep enough, this is rarely the case. This is not to say “never compromise” – but compromise should be the last resort. So next time someone is giving you advice on how to negotiate, it’s always worth checking it against the research. Maybe your old-school adviser is not actually giving you best practice after all?

Frank Field said he suspected that ministers had only pressed ahead with the accelerated rollout of universal credit this month because civil servants at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had withheld the true scale of the problems. The MP says that despite evidence of mounting problems with universal credit, the DWP has yet to provide new written evidence to the work and pensions committee, and has so far refused to answer four formal letters requesting statistics and clarifications of policy sent to David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, over the past six weeks. Field said: “For the secretary of state not to answer letters shows either a huge discourtesy to parliament or a sign that the government knows the game is nearly up in trying to present this mega-reform as a success. “I don’t know if the DWP is deliberately concealing information about universal credit or is simply incompetent. Either way, it is not good enough. This has obvious echoes in the far greater failure of not paying hungry claimants on time. “One letter simply asked if the conference announcement on advance payments was, despite appearances, simply a restatement of existing policy. You’d think they could at least answer that one.” Field’s comments come as Gauke prepares for a potentially uncomfortable appearance before the inquiry committee on Wednesday morning, just hours before an Labour opposition day debate calling for the accelerated rollout to be paused. The work and pensions committee inquiry was launched last month amid mounting concern – including on the government backbenches – that flaws in the design and implementation of universal credit, which was meant to streamline and simplify the benefits system, is causing confusion and chaos for many claimants and landlords. The committee has since received over 100 evidence submissions on universal credit from claimants, landlords, councils and charities. Of those so far published on the inquiry website, almost all report major problems, with consequences for claimants ranging from debt and rent arrears to mental distress and hunger. Field said: “Given everything we have heard, I was surprised that David Gauke opted to proceed with the accelerated rollout. I strongly suspect his decision, together with the failure to tell us anything, reflects a culture at the DWP of those most invested in universal credit not telling anyone, including their ministers, bad news. “The overwhelming picture we are getting is that universal credit as currently configured is very bad news. We have heard nothing, to the contrary or otherwise, from those running it.” Earlier this month Gauke delivered an upbeat assessment of universal credit in his speech to Tory party conference in Manchester. He rejected calls for the rollout to be paused, calling the changes a step towards a Tory vision of the modern welfare state that was “compassionate, practical and aspirational”. Liverpool city council said local authorities were moving into “dangerous and uncharted waters” as the cost of supporting increasing numbers of low-income residents plunged into financial crisis by long waits for universal credit payments became unsustainable. In evidence to the work and pensions committee inquiry it said: “Given the growing pressures caused by the government’s multiple welfare reforms and the additional hardship resultant from UC [universal credit], the ability of the council and its partners to support those most affected and protect vulnerable households is not likely to be affordable for much longer, or ultimately sustainable. “We, along with many other local authorities, are now in what I consider to be ‘dangerous and unchartered waters’.” A DWP spokesman said: “We are fully engaged with the work and pensions select committee. The secretary of state recently met its chairman and will be appearing before it this week. Meanwhile, committee members have taken up our invitation to visit a jobcentre to see how universal credit works for themselves. “The department also published a raft of research and analysis of universal credit, following requests from the work and pensions select committee, five weeks ago. This included evidence showing that the vast majority of people are paid on time and in full, and that people are moving into work faster than under the old system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/last-concorde-on-show-new-aerospace-bristol-museum-filton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T15:40:30Z","webTitle":"Last Concorde goes on show at new Aerospace Bristol museum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/last-concorde-on-show-new-aerospace-bristol-museum-filton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/last-concorde-on-show-new-aerospace-bristol-museum-filton","fields":{"headline":"Last Concorde goes on show at new Aerospace Bristol museum","bodyText":"After languishing on a scrubby strip of disused runway near Bristol for more than a decade, the last Concorde to be built is taking pride of place in a glittering £19m home. From Tuesday, visitors will be able to follow in the footsteps of world leaders, rock stars and royalty when they step onboard Concorde G-BOAF, also known as Alpha Foxtrot, at the new Aerospace Bristol museum. Filton, just north of Bristol, bills itself as the British spiritual home of Concorde, the Anglo-French supersonic plane that crossed the Atlantic in less than three hours on the edge of space. The planes were built and maintained in Filton, but since their retirement, Concordes in the fleet have been placed in museums around the world. Alpha Foxtrot had remained exposed to the elements since its final flight in 2003. John Britton, who was the plane’s chief engineer in Britain from 1994 and is a volunteer at the museum, said it was emotional to see Alpha Foxtrot, one of 20 Concordes built, back under cover and in pristine condition. “It’s brilliant,” he said. “I was here when this plane took off for the first time from Filton and I was here when she landed for the final time. It was very sad when they shut the engines down for the last time.” The impact of a Concorde crash in 2000, the September 11 attacks and rising maintenance costs contributed to the decision by British Airways and Air France to retire Concorde. “If something is not making money, it goes,” said Britton. “I’m glad I’ve been able to bring my grandchildren here so they can see what was achieved. I think we’ll see commercial supersonic flight again, but perhaps on a smaller scale.” Displays at the museum feature Concorde menus, bottles of champagne, the super-smart uniforms cabin crew wore and, almost inevitably, a picture of the late actor Sir Roger Moore in the cockpit. Onboard, the seats are made of soft Connolly leather, but visitors may be surprised at how cramped the cabin feels – the legroom is just adequate – and the toilets are nothing to write home about. “It was all about speed,” said Britton. “It wasn’t as plush as people may think.” While Concorde is the star of the show at the museum, a second hangar at the museum tells the wider history of the aerospace story in Filton and Bristol. In 1910, the entrepreneur Sir George White announced that his Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company was going to branch out into aircraft, and by the time the first world war began, British Colonial Aeroplane Company (BCAC) was building reconnaissance and fighter planes. Since then warplanes, helicopters, missiles, satellites and rockets have been built in Filton, Bristol and the surrounding areas by successor companies and other businesses. Exhibits at the museum range from a Sea Harrier jet fighter, known for its vertical take off, to the twin-rotor Bristol Type 192 Belvedere helicopter, which was originally designed for intercity travel, but found a use as a troop carrier. Linda Coode, the museum’s collections manager, said: “We’re trying to tell the complete aerospace story in Bristol and to inspire future generations to look at careers in the industry.” Coode said one of the exhibits she expected visitors to be surprised by was a dinghy that helps tell the story of the Bristol Plastics Division, which came out of wartime work to create gun turrets. But Concorde, inevitably, will command the most attention. After its final landing in 2003, the crew scribbled their names and messages on the inside of the fuselage close to the flight deck. One of the notes sounds all the more poignant now: “Gone but never forgotten. G-BOAF is home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/17/centenary-britains-calamitous-promise-balfour-declaration-israel-palestine","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"The contested centenary of Britain’s ‘calamitous promise’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/17/centenary-britains-calamitous-promise-balfour-declaration-israel-palestine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/17/centenary-britains-calamitous-promise-balfour-declaration-israel-palestine","fields":{"headline":"The contested centenary of Britain’s ‘calamitous promise’","bodyText":"On the evening of Thursday 2 November, at an elegant but as yet undisclosed central London location, Theresa May will sit down for a festive dinner with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and 150 other carefully selected VIP guests. They will be celebrating the historic promise, made a century ago to the day, that the British government would use its “best endeavours” to facilitate the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Security for the event will be tight and protesters will be kept well away. This is no ordinary anniversary. That 1917 pledge – known to posterity as the Balfour declaration – had fateful consequences for the Middle East and the world. It paved the way for the birth of Israel in 1948, and for the eventual defeat and dispersal of the Palestinians – which is why its centenary next month is the subject of furious contestation. After 100 years, the two sides in the most closely studied conflict on earth are still battling over the past. Controversy dogged the declaration from the moment that Arthur Balfour, then foreign secretary, sent it to Lionel Walter, Lord Rothschild, who represented the British Jewish community. Its 67 words combined considerations of imperial planning, wartime propaganda, biblical resonances and a colonial mindset, as well as evident sympathy for the Zionist idea – embodied in the famous commitment to “view with favour the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people” in the Holy Land. It ended with two important qualifications: first, that nothing should be done to prejudice the “civil and religious rights” of Palestine’s “existing non-Jewish communities.” And second, that the declaration should not affect the rights and political status of Jews living in other countries. This contested anniversary is a dangerous minefield for May’s embattled government. The prime minister has said she is looking forward to it – although the London dinner, as all those involved are anxious to emphasise, is deliberately being hosted not by her, but by the current Lords Rothschild and Balfour. In addition to the two prime ministers and other political heavyweights, invitees include the historian Simon Schama, who will deliver a public lecture on the subject the day before. Scores of other events are being organised by Jewish communities across the UK. Christian Zionists, who believe in the unerring power of biblical prophecy, are to celebrate at the Albert Hall under the slogan “Partners in this Great Enterprise”. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, will hold a special session honouring Balfour, while British immigrants to the Jewish state are organising street parties to celebrate the day. In the US, the Israel Forever Foundation is urging supporters to “Stand with Balfour and make it YOUR declaration”. The original letter, kept in the British Library, may be loaned to Israel next year to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s independence. In 2015 it was inspected by a reverential Netanyahu, who used the photo opportunity to call for a renewal of the “partnership” of 1917. (Netanyahu’s official residence, incidentally, is on Balfour Street in West Jerusalem. The address is used in the Israeli media, like Downing Street in Britain, as shorthand for its occupant.) A copy of Balfour’s letter is also on permanent display at the Yasser Arafat Museum in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority and, since the 1967 war, occupied territory under international law. In London, Jerusalem and elsewhere, however, others will be commemorating and protesting what they condemn as an act of betrayal and perfidy, the “original sin” that led to injustice, war and disaster for the Palestinians in the Nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe”) of 1948. Two packed conferences took place on the same day in London in early October, with speakers lambasting British responsibility for continuing Palestinian suffering. The Balfour Project – founded by clergymen and academics who want to see change in the UK’s Middle East policy – is holding a public meeting in Westminster on 31 October. Its slogan is: “Britain’s Broken Promise – Time for a New Approach”. But concern for the plight of the Palestinians is no fringe preoccupation. The former UN envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi – one of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 – is the biggest name on a Chatham House panel on Balfour. The British Academy is organising a seminar about the decision, which was described by the historian Elizabeth Monroe in the 1960s as “one of the greatest mistakes of our imperial history”. A London art gallery is running a series of events called “Turning the Page on the Balfour Declaration”, focusing on Arab culture and identity in Palestine before 1948. The centenary was debated in the House of Lords in July. In an age when the conflict is increasingly waged by volunteer armies of social-media warriors, it should come as no surprise that both sides are determined to press their competing claims. The Balfour Apology Campaign is demanding Britain make amends for “colonial crimes” in Palestine. It is promoting a short film, 100 Balfour Road, which tries to explain the long-term effect of the declaration by showing the Joneses, an ordinary family in suburban London who are evicted from their home by soldiers and forced to live in appalling conditions in their back yard. Another family, the Smiths, take over their house and, supported by the soldiers, mistreat the Joneses and deprive them of food, medicine and their basic rights. The dissident group Independent Jewish Voices has produced a critical talking-heads documentary about Balfour – being circulated under the Twitter hashtag #NoCelebration. For the past year, the Palestinian mission to the UK has been running its own campaign around the centenary, titled “Make It Right”, to demonstrate that “the legacy of the British government’s broken promise still continues”. This month, the Palestinians attempted to place adverts on the London underground and buses, citing Balfour’s qualification about “the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities”, alongside before-and-after pictures highlighting Palestinian suffering since 1948. But Transport for London blocked the ads on the grounds that the issue is too sensitive and controversial. Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian Authority’s ambassador to the UK, has complained of “censorship”. In Jerusalem on 2 November, separate Palestinian and Israeli Balfour conferences are being held – completely ignoring each other – on the eastern and western sides of what Israeli governments call the country’s “united” capital. In the UK, a national march and rally will be staged on 4 November by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the Stop the War Campaign. History is alive, toxic, intensely political and bitterly divisive – and it will be revisited with passion and anger on this resonant anniversary. The battle over Balfour has much in common with other disputes over historic apologies or redress for the wrongs of the past. It may be seen alongside recent rows over the Cecil Rhodes statues in Oxford and Cape Town and Confederate memorials in the US, compensation for British mistreatment of Mau Mau rebels in Kenya and French atonement for atrocities in Algeria. But the Israel-Palestine issue is far harder to deal with. Its past is not another country. Truth and reconciliation, let alone closure, are remote fantasies. Unlike slavery, apartheid, the Irish famine and western colonialism – all, at least formally, consigned to the dust heap of history – the Arab-Jewish conflict between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan shows no signs of fading. Indeed, it remains as bitter as ever, stuck in a volatile status quo of unending occupation and political deadlock. * * * Arthur James Balfour has always been a hero to Zionists and a villain to Arabs and their respective supporters. The brief document that bears his name is seen as marking the beginning of what is today widely considered the world’s most intractable conflict. On that, if on little else, Israelis and Palestinians agree. The central issue is that when the declaration promised that “Jewish national home”, what it defined as Palestine’s “existing non-Jewish communities” – who remained unnamed – made up some 90% of the 700,000-strong population. The words Arab, Muslim or Christian were not mentioned. Nor were those natives consulted as to the future of their country, which was then made up of three provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Their “civil and religious rights” in fact counted for little. The anniversary has been marked by Arab protests since the very first one in 1918. In 2004, when president George W Bush issued a statement that reversed decades of US policy by stating that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories could stay put, the Palestine Liberation Organisation compared it to Balfour’s declaration – which has been traditionally described in Arabic as a “calamitous promise”. “For Palestinians, the Balfour declaration is the root cause of our destitution, dispossession and the ongoing occupation,” the Palestinian mission to the UK told the Commons foreign affairs committee in April as it gathered evidence for an inquiry into British policy towards the Middle East peace process. “The centenary … allows us to take the long view. Our present reality is a consequence of a British policy that created Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people.” At a recent film festival in Gaza – ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas – attendees walked up a red carpet that had been imprinted with quotations from the declaration. In Ramallah this February, a day after the Knesset voted to retroactively legalise West Bank Jewish settlements, which are seen by most of the world as illegal, I interviewed Hanan Ashrawi, the veteran Palestinian spokesperson and legislator, who described the ongoing occupation as a natural consequence of the 1917 declaration. “This is Balfour’s chickens,” she said, “coming home to roost.” The declaration, Ashrawi said, “didn’t create the state of Israel, but it set in motion a process by which Zionism was adopted internationally. It is an outcome of a colonial era and it belongs to that era in many ways – the European white man’s burden of trying to reorganise the world as they saw fit, to distribute land, to create states. They defined us as the ‘non-Jewish communities’. It’s so patronising, so racist.” By contrast, Israel and its supporters like to remember a magnanimous British gesture towards a persecuted people who were yearning, according to the Zionist narrative, to “return” from exile to their biblical homeland – even though, in the three decades before the first world war, the vast majority of east European Jews who were able to were heading west to that far more promising land, the US. (Britain’s self-interested motives are acknowledged too, and there is an awareness, on what remains of the Israeli left, of the stigma of colonialist patronage.) Yet not only is there nothing to be sorry about, many insist, but to demand an apology is an act of antisemitism; to question the justice of the declaration, it is argued, is to question the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in a century that saw a third of them exterminated by the Nazis. “The Palestinians’ new campaign to highlight the ostensible illegalities and iniquities of the Balfour declaration,” David Horovitz, the editor of the Times of Israel, has written, “shows an undimmed hostility to the very notion of Jewish sovereignty anywhere in the holy land, and an abiding refusal to accept Jewish legitimacy here.” Netanyahu uses similar language – stating ever more explicitly, especially since the Donald Trump era began, that a Palestinian state worthy of the name will never be created. His government is the most rightwing in Israel’s history. The “peace process” has been clinically dead for three years, and moribund for several more. Pro-Palestinian activists are using the centenary to step up the international campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), many of whose supporters characterise Israel unequivocally as an apartheid settler state, and whose modest successes so far have alarmed many Israelis and Jews. Others, including the UK’s Balfour Project, are adamant that they are not questioning the legitimacy of Israel, but working for Palestinian rights and a two-state solution. But a middle ground is hard to find when the mainstream positions of the two sides on this question are so very far apart. “God did not give you the land,” protested one pro-Palestinian Twitter message this month. “The UK did – illegally.” * * * The most memorable line about the Balfour declaration was composed by the Hungarian-born Jewish writer Arthur Koestler. With it, he quipped, “one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third” – an echo of the popular early Zionist slogan that depicted Palestine as “a land without a people for a people without a land”. Questions about exactly what constituted a nation or people, Palestine’s identity and borders and how these related to Britain’s other wartime promises have occupied historians – and propagandists – ever since. Avi Shlaim, emeritus professor of international relations at Oxford and a leading expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict, has described Balfour as “a millstone round Britain’s neck” because it prompted the wrath of both dissatisfied or impatient Zionists and angry Arabs and Muslims. Jonathan Schneer, an American historian, has called the pledge “the highly contingent product of a tortuous process characterised as much by deceit and chance as by vision and diplomacy”. There has long been debate over the intentions and meaning of the declaration. David Lloyd George, the Liberal prime minister at the time, highlighted sympathy for Jews and his own Welsh nonconformist familiarity with the Old Testament. But British motives in the penultimate year of the first world war, following the February revolution in Russia and America’s entry into the conflict, were mixed. The decisive considerations were the wish to outsmart the French in the postwar Levant, and to use Palestine’s strategic location to protect Egypt, the Suez canal and the route to India by creating “a loyal Jewish Ulster”, in the words of Ronald Storrs, the first British military governor of Jerusalem. Other scholars have placed greater emphasis on the need to mobilise Jewish public opinion behind the flagging allied war effort. Balfour told the cabinet: “If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal [Zionism], we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and in America.” This approach, as modern researchers have observed, wildly exaggerated Jewish wealth, power and influence – a familiar antisemitic habit. Balfour, as Conservative prime minister, had, after all, backed the 1905 Aliens Act, which severely restricted Jewish immigration. Anti-Zionist critics like to point out that he never proposed a national home for oppressed Jews in his native Scotland; he was “uncertain and uncomfortable about their place in gentile society,” reported Leonard Stein, who published the first serious study of the declaration. Questions continue to be asked about the connections and contradictions between Balfour’s public statement of support for Zionism; the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain, France and Russia to carve up Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq; and earlier secret pledges about Arab independence made by the British to encourage Sharif Hussein of Mecca to launch his “revolt in the desert” against the Turks (with the help of TE Lawrence “of Arabia”). The truth, buried in imprecise definitions, misunderstandings and duplicity, remains elusive. But Britain’s own wartime interests, in any event, were the absolute priority. Arab views were blunt from the start. The Balfour declaration, argued the Lebanese historian George Antonius, betrayed the understandings between Sharif Hussein and Sir Henry McMahon, Britain’s high commissioner in Egypt. And these in turn were contradicted by Sykes-Picot, under which much of Palestine was to be under international administration. Britain’s promise to the Zionists, Antonius wrote in his 1938 book The Arab Awakening, “lacks real validity, partly because she had previously committed herself to recognising Arab independence in Palestine, and partly because the promise involves an obligation which she cannot fulfil without Arab consent”. If the first point – often summarised as “the twice-promised land” – was debatable, the second was not. Arabs had not consented; they felt, then as now, that they had been cheated. Balfour’s carefully drafted formulation was also studiously vague – a diplomatic “fudgerama” in the words of the current foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. It neither defined the legal meaning of a “national home” nor promised to create a Jewish state. And that vagueness encouraged Palestinians to hope that Britain’s policy would not be pursued. Chaim Weizmann, the Russian-born Zionist leader whose charm and assiduous lobbying were instrumental in securing the declaration, was disappointed with its final wording. “I did not like the boy at first,” he wrote. “He was not the one I had expected. But I knew this was a great event.” The key fact was that the world’s greatest power had given a massive boost to the Zionist movement 20 years after its birth – against the background of Russian pogroms and the Dreyfus affair in France. In a mood that is often described as “messianic”, Balfour was hailed as a “new Cyrus” – the Persian king who liberated the Jews from their Babylonian exile in the sixth century BC. “There was a great stirring of the dry bones of Israel,” one Zionist wrote, “as if in realisation of the prophetic vision of Ezekiel.” The Manchester Guardian gave the declaration an effusive welcome. CP Scott, its editor, had introduced Weizmann to Lloyd George; his editorial invoked the memory of the recent massacres of the (Christian) Armenians by the (Muslim) Turks, as well as reflecting contemporary colonialist assumptions. Jews needed a national home for their security, wrote Scott, calling Balfour “the signpost of a destiny”. Arabs in Palestine reacted with alarm. The country’s native Jews were predominantly Orthodox, and enjoyed religious autonomy under Ottoman rule. But the demographics of the Jewish community had begun to change with the arrival of the first Zionist settlers from Europe in the 1880s. In 1910, an Arab writer fretted that Jews in Haifa were starting to interact exclusively with their own community. “Establishing a Jewish state after thousands of years of decline … we [Arabs] fear that the new settler will expel the indigenous and we will have to leave our country en masse. We shall then be looking back over our shoulder and mourn our land as did the Muslims of Andalusia,” Abdullah Mukhlis warned in a remarkably prescient article. “Palestine may be endangered. In a few decades it might witness a struggle for survival.” The new reality of British rule arrived on 11 December 1917, when General Sir Edmund Allenby walked through the Jaffa Gate into Jerusalem’s Old City. “Palestine is Arab”, a newly created nationalist association declared. “Its language is Arabic. We want to see this formally recognised. It was Great Britain that rescued us from Turkish tyranny and we do not believe that it will deliver us into the claws of the Jews. We ask for fairness and justice. We ask that it protect our rights and not decide the future of Palestine without asking our opinion.” British officials ignored such appeals, though some quickly recognised what was happening. “It is indeed difficult to see how we can keep our promises to the Jews by making the country a ‘national home’ without inflicting injury on nine-tenths of the population,” one wrote in 1920. “But we have now got the onus of it on our shoulders, and have incurred odium from the Moslems &amp; Christians, who are not appeased by vague promises that their interests will not be affected.” In 1922, Balfour’s pledge was incorporated into the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, setting out the terms for Britain’s administration – what the new body called a “sacred trust for civilisation”. Promotion of Jewish immigration and the revived Hebrew language were key commitments. The word “Arab” did not appear in it. * * * Early Arab opposition to Zionism was often described as an “unseen question”, and it was frequently suggested that the Palestinians had no national identity before the arrival of the first Jewish settlers. But both the British and Zionists were acutely aware of local objections from the start. “Even if all our political schemings turn out the way we desire, the Arabs will remain our most tremendous problem,” Weizmann’s colleague Harry Sacher worried in June 1917. “I don’t want us in Palestine to deal with the Arabs as the Poles deal with the Jews, and with the lesser excuse that belongs to a numerical minority.” Zionists believed fervently in their “right to national rebirth” in Eretz-Yisrael (“the land of Israel”) – from where their ancestors had been exiled by the Romans in AD70. Earlier efforts to secure recognition from the Turks had failed. Balfour mattered because the alliance with Britain allowed them to exercise that right. And there was wider support – contrary to Koestler’s clever “one nation” quip – from the US, France, and Italy. The League of Nations mandate, five years after Balfour, provided the first international legal framework for Zionist ambitions – ignoring Palestinian objections and setting a pattern that would be repeated in the future. Britain’s recognition also helped the Zionist movement evolve from an insignificant minority in world Jewry to one that attracted growing sympathy. Objections by Jews to Zionism started to fade once the mandate was in place – though it took the horrors of the second world war for them to all but disappear. Arab opposition never weakened. Balfour showed no regrets. In 1919 he famously told his cabinet colleague, Lord Curzon, who had expected the declaration to cause trouble for Britain, that “Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-old traditions, in present needs, in future hopes of far profounder importance than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land”. This brutally candid display of partiality – “dripping with Olympian disdain” in the words of the veteran Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi – still arouses Arab anger. The aftermath was marked out by sombre milestones, each representing further escalation. Arabs attacked Jews in 1920 and 1921. In 1925 Balfour, now retired, visited Palestine, where he was feted by Jews – who named a new settlement in the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amr in Arabic) after him. Arabs shunned him. Four years later came new disturbances in Jerusalem: the focus, then as now, was the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, site of the al-Aqsa mosque. The worst bloodshed, though, was in Hebron, where Arabs killed 67 defenceless Orthodox Jews who were not part of the Zionist camp – though that old distinction was rapidly disappearing. Three of the 1929 killers were hanged by the British in Acre jail – and are still hailed in a popular song as “martyrs” to the Palestinian cause. On 2 November 1932, by now a familiar date, the Arabic newspaper Filastin devoted its front page to a cartoon picturing Lord Balfour dominating a map of the country, clutching his “calamitous promise”. It displayed “the woes inflicted on Palestine” – the advances of Zionism under the protection of the British, represented by a haughty officer in riding boots and a warship moored off Haifa. It shows Jewish immigrants striding energetically towards Tel Aviv, passing a glum-looking Arab peasant family on a camel, evicted from their land and plodding towards the desert. The scenery is dotted with factories, mechanised agriculture and bustling public works – all Jewish achievements. In the corner stand Arab men in European suits and tarbushes, arguing (presumably ineffectively) about the transformation they are witnessing. Sir John Chancellor, British high commissioner until shortly before, reflected that Balfour had been “a colossal blunder”. Events elsewhere, however, were soon to mean that it was too late to do very much about it. In the mid-1930s, with the spread of antisemitic legislation in eastern Europe and Hitler’s rise to power, came a massive wave of immigration – of refugees who were also settlers – doubling Palestine’s Jewish population. In the wake of the Arab rebellion in 1937 – Balfour’s 20th anniversary – Britain’s Peel Commission, which was established to look at the cause of the violence, acknowledged the “irreconcilable aspirations” of the two peoples. It proposed partitioning the country into Jewish and Arab states, but retreated from the idea as a new war approached. Only in 1939 did Britain change policy, severely restricting Jewish immigration and land sales, and promising Palestinian independence. “The framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population,” stated that year’s white paper. “His Majesty’s government … now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish state.” The Jews, outraged, rejected this – many now viewing the British as their enemy. But so, foolishly, did the Arabs, missing a last chance to salvage something from what the Palestinian historian Rashid Khalidi has called the “iron cage” of the mandate and the wreckage of the preceding two decades. By the declaration’s 30th anniversary, in November 1947, in the wake of the Holocaust, public opinion outside the Arab and Muslim world backed the creation of a Jewish state. Even as the Royal Navy was turning back Jewish refugees trying desperately to reach the shores of Palestine, and Irgun and Stern Gang terrorists were targeting the British, the Jewish population had reached a third of the total. In the US in particular, Zionists were seen as progressives, fighting both British imperialism and its reactionary Arab lackeys. In those early cold war days, the US and USSR both supported that month’s UN plan to partition the country into separate Jewish and Arab states. It was rejected by the Palestinians, because they refused to surrender to what they saw as foreign settlers who had transformed the country while ignoring them. It was another error – though arguably an understandable one. Israel’s independence became the Palestinians’ catastrophe – the Nakba – in which half the country’s Arabs were driven out or fled. Arab Palestine was erased by Israel and Jordan. The UN’s decision would not have taken place without the British one in November 1917. Balfour remains a byword for the legitimacy of Zionism, and for the calamity that it brought the Palestinians. It is hard to imagine that changing. * * * Preparations for the centenary have posed a difficult challenge for the British government. It continues to emphasise support for a two-state solution to the conflict, a position that dates back to the late 1980s, though its roots can be traced to 1967, when Balfour’s jubilee was overshadowed by the six-day war. Israel’s stunning feat of arms that year meant that all of Mandatory Palestine – as well as the Egyptian Sinai peninsula and Syria’s Golan Heights – was re-reunited under its rule. Military victory, though, turned out to be the easy part. The timing created a neat and thought-provoking link between two towering historical landmarks: the first political triumph of Zionism, and the beginning of an occupation that would, over the years, undermine it and threaten to isolate Israel. “If the Balfour declaration represents the moment the goal of Jewish statehood first gained formal international recognition and legitimacy, 1967 was the moment when the recognition and legitimacy started to ebb, gradually giving way to 50 years of growing unease,” Jewish-American journalist JJ Goldberg wrote this summer. “Put differently, the Balfour declaration launched a diplomatic process that led to an international embrace of what had been up to then a crazy dream of Jewish national rebirth. The six-day war touched off a series of events that may yet end in the dream’s demise.” It was then that the Palestinians, remembered since 1948 only as “Arab refugees,” returned to centre stage. Resistance to occupation or terrorist acts such as the Munich Olympics massacre of 1972 made headlines. Sympathy for them grew with the Lebanon war of 1982. But the Israelis were only seriously challenged in 1987, by the first intifada – the “war of the stones” – when the world saw Palestinian children confront Israel’s armed might. That was followed by Yasser Arafat’s unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence, which paved the way for the 1993 Oslo agreement. Oslo was killed off – after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin – by settlement expansion, bad faith, suicide bombings and a second, armed intifada that erupted disastrously after the collapse of the Camp David summit in 2000. Arafat’s death in 2004 marked a nadir for the Palestinian cause. Little has changed since he was succeeded by Mahmoud Abbas, though the Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007 was deeply divisive. In 2012, when Abbas secured UN observer status for Palestine, the UK refused to follow the 136 other countries which had recognised it, standing loyally by the US. Last year the government’s initial public line, after nervous consultations in Whitehall, was awkwardly defensive: Britain would simply “mark”, not “celebrate”, Balfour because the declaration was flawed in not backing political rights for Arabs as well as Jews. But Britain would not apologise. To do so, ministers told Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian ambassador, would open a Pandora’s box of demands about Cyprus and Kashmir and other festering imperial wounds. “It can’t be all bells and whistles to support Israel, but nor can it be complete sackcloth and ashes and let’s hear it for those who would recover Palestine,” one well-placed politician told me. “It’s about finding a line between those two.” The aftermath of the EU referendum in 2016 brought a small but significant change in Britain’s public stance. May, attempting to think more “globally” after the Brexit vote and Trump’s election victory, criticised Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, for his warning that the expansion of Israeli settlements was leading to “one state and perpetual occupation”. Kerry’s remarks followed the passage of UN security resolution 2334, which reiterated that Israeli settlements were illegal under international law – and which was backed by the UK and, unusually, not vetoed by the US. That was widely seen as a frustrated Obama’s parting shot and an attempt (so far in vain) to “Trump-proof” US policy. May was scorned for trying to curry favour with the incoming president. Soon afterwards she invited Netanyahu to London for the Balfour centenary, and added that Britain would mark it “with pride” – two words that attracted disproportionate attention, as ever with this most sensitive of subjects. And that remains the current official mantra – albeit muttered sheepishly by embarrassed FCO officials. The official UK response to the demand for a Balfour apology – which had been supported by 13,600 people who signed a petition to parliament – was released this April. “We are proud of our role in creating the state of Israel,” it said. “Establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in the land to which they had such strong historical and religious ties was the right and moral thing to do, particularly against the background of centuries of persecution.” Alistair Burt, minister for the Middle East, has quietly compromised since then by talking of “pride and sadness”. Brexit also killed off the ongoing investigation by the Commons foreign affairs committee into UK policy towards the conflict. The FAC, as the rules require, was dissolved along with parliament when the election was called. Its chairman, Crispin Blunt, had hoped to publish his report on 2 November – for symbolic reasons – and had been expected to challenge government positions. Blunt was unpopular with Israel and its supporters. His replacement, Tom Tugendhat, is far closer to Israeli views and emphasises wider regional instability. The Arab spring and its bloody aftermath, he has suggested, “showed that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict doesn’t matter”. There is said to be “no appetite” to reopen the FAC investigation on his watch. Sir Vincent Fean, the former British consul-general in East Jerusalem, and a supporter of the Balfour Project, never believed that an apology for Balfour was worth pursuing, preferring to call for UK recognition of Palestine. “Recognition means that when Abbas or whoever comes after him next applies to the UN for full membership, the UK will vote yes,” he argues. “That will put us in a different part of the forest from the US, and it does strengthen the argument that there should be consequences for breaches of international law. It could cause other EU members to think hard about doing it, too.” Foreign Office officials insist, however, that recognition will not happen until or unless it can help advance peace – leaving unsaid that a decision of that magnitude is, of course, for Washington to make. Still, resentment at the UK attitude may yet produce a pre-centenary parliamentary statement that at least reiterates support for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. In the multilateral, post-colonial world of 2017, Britain no longer has the power – for good or ill – to issue unilateral declarations that are intended to serve its interests but have a massive influence on other peoples who are not consulted. The clock cannot be turned back. It is impossible to conceive today – joking apart – of a “Johnson declaration” that could have even a fraction of the impact of the one made by Balfour. In recent years, the UK consulate in East Jerusalem has been helping Palestinian farmers harvest their olives in vulnerable areas of the West Bank that are affected by Israeli settlements – emphasising that practical assistance is more useful than symbolic gestures or apologies. Still, it does not appear that Britain’s “best endeavours” – at a time when its international clout is weakening – can do much to help resolve the enduring conflict it helped create a turbulent century ago.

I’d like to see the Ukip leader try","bodyText":"As Theresa May trips off to the continent for her game of deal or no deal, the party that was instrumental in establishing this bewildering alternative universe is lost in a fantasy about apprehending badgers. Henry Bolton, the 54-year-old former army officer recently elected leader of Ukip, claims that a suitable initiation ceremony for him is “chasing a badger across Dartmoor, capturing it and breaking its neck with one’s bare hands”. If overestimating our abilities wasn’t regarded as a British trait before Brexit, it is now. I hate to break it to Bolton but, were it legal, there’s no way he could murder a badger without a gun, a dog, a trap or poison. Despite being badgered for centuries, Meles meles is not our largest surviving carnivorous animal for nothing. It runs faster than us and administers a ferocious bite from jaws that don’t dislocate. If a badger ever lost its super-powered senses of hearing and smell and was rugby-tackled by Bolton, Ukip’s leader would end up with a broken arm, or worse. One badger capable of chasing Bolton across Dartmoor and breaking his neck is Detective Inspector LeBrock, the hero of Bryan Talbot’s stunningly immersive steam-punk graphic novels, who is back for a final outing next month in Grandville Force Majeure. LeBrock is a muscular beast with powers of deduction to rival Sherlock Holmes but, rather like May, Bolton or the real badger in our countryside, everyone’s out to get him. Talbot’s alternative universe – hopefully coming to TV screens as a live action series – is populated by bears, gerbils, horses, rats and lizards. With witty allusions to everything from our class system to writers (Talbot appears as fishy hack Bryan Turbot), perhaps there’s a satirical nod to our current predicament too: in Granville, Britain is subservient to the continent – ruled by the French empire after losing the Napoleonic wars. Talbot’s fantasy also belatedly bequeaths literature with a heroic female badger. For a century, the literary badger has boringly followed the template established by Kenneth Grahame’s Mr Badger in The Wind in the Willows: we’ve had dozens of morally upstanding male badgers, from the road safety Policeman Badger to the badger in The Animals of Farthing Wood. These mostly boss other animals around. LeBrock is an old sexist but his girlfriend, Billie, takes a pair of scissors to her period dress and turns into an action hero every bit his equal. She’s another one who could take out Henry Bolton, any time she chose. A fairytale breakaway As Britain’s quest for independence looks increasingly disastrous, Bolton might find it more profitable to champion smaller breakaways. Fourteen of 17 councillors on the estuarine Essex island of Canvey are members of its own independence party. Some of Canvey’s 40,000 residents complain that the “mainland” council treats them as “the Cinderella district”. Channel Island Alderney is sometimes called the same by its larger neighbours Guernsey and Jersey, to which delighted locals retort: Cinderella had two ugly sisters. Taking an axe to democracy More power to local communities sounds good, but plenty of local authorities are deaf to democracy. Tooting lost its much-loved Chestnut Avenue when the council replaced mature chestnuts with tiny limes last month; it currently resembles an avenue of unattractive street lamps. When I visited last week, the first thing I noticed on the surrounding roads was the terrible vehicle pollution; gone, now, are some giant trees that ameliorated this. There’s genuine grief from local residents and there will be more in Sheffield this week, with the Vernon Oak, a beautiful 150-year-old tree, earmarked for destruction. Shame on the councillors who won’t make exceptions for exceptional trees or the bonds local people have with them. • Patrick Barkham is a natural history writer for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/16/fa-greg-clarke-mark-sampson-pfa-eni-aluko","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T15:05:30Z","webTitle":"Revealed: the 14-word email that puts FA’s Greg Clarke under fresh scrutiny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/16/fa-greg-clarke-mark-sampson-pfa-eni-aluko","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/16/fa-greg-clarke-mark-sampson-pfa-eni-aluko","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: the 14-word email that puts FA’s Greg Clarke under fresh scrutiny","bodyText":"Greg Clarke’s position as chairman of the Football Association is likely to come under severe scrutiny after new revelations about his handling of the alleged‑racism scandal and cover-up that has led to his organisation being summoned to a parliamentary inquiry to explain the Mark Sampson affair. Two weeks after Clarke publicly praised Eni Aluko for reporting alleged racism within the England Women’s football set-up, the Guardian can reveal his 14-word reply after initially being told of claims that the FA had put together an internal inquiry that was “not a genuine search for the truth” and “designed to close down the complaint and absolve Mark Sampson”. Clarke was one of four senior executives to receive a six-page document from the Professional Footballers’ Association that accused the governing body of deliberately sabotaging Aluko’s 11-year international career to protect Sampson, the now-sacked England Women’s manager, and set out a series of grievances detailing “the incontrovertible evidence that makes it clear the purported investigation was a sham”. The letter was sent in November 2016 and was also the first time the FA had been informed of a previously unreported allegation that Sampson – already accused of offending Drew Spence, a mixed-raced player, with an allegedly racist joke asking how many times she had been arrested – had made a comment about Aluko’s family and Ebola. That was later revealed to be a reference to Sampson having allegedly told Aluko to make sure her Nigerian relatives did not bring the virus to Wembley. Sampson strenuously denies making any racial remarks about Aluko or any other player. Yet Clarke’s response came in the form of a curt email that threatens to be hugely embarrassing for his organisation and leaves questions about his ability to run a body that purports to be leaders in the fight against racism. Clarke is now under intense pressure to explain why he responded within 30 minutes, sending the PFA an email stating: “I’ve no idea why you are sending me this. Perhaps you could enlighten me?” The one-line response has shocked a number of people who are working on the case and opened him to allegations that he completely misunderstood the seriousness of the matter at a time when the FA’s technical director, Dan Ashworth, and human resources director, Rachel Brace, had been accused by the PFA of conducting “a sham [inquiry] which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”. The PFA, which was representing Aluko, was so taken aback by Clarke’s tone and apparent lack of interest it did not reply, taking the view that the man at the top of the FA should not need an explanation of why such serious allegations had been directed his way. The latest revelations will raise further questions about whether the FA has treated the affair with the same seriousness as it would have done had it involved the men’s national team. Clarke’s handling of the crisis has already come under scrutiny because of the circumstances surrounding Sampson’s sacking and the latest revelations will further weaken Clarke’s position before his appearance alongside Ashworth, Brace and the FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn, in front of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Wednesday. The relevant MPs have been made aware of Clarke’s email and he can expect some tough questions. The four executives are likely to be asked to explain the safeguarding investigation that was cited as the reason for Sampson’s dismissal and how the people Glenn has described as “the grown-ups within the organisation” originally missed the report from March 2015 that stated its employee had inappropriate relationships with players at Bristol Academy, where he had previously coached. However, the hearing was initially arranged to deal with the allegations of racism and cover-ups and Clarke will inevitably be asked why he appeared so uninterested in being told the FA had not dealt appropriately with allegations involving two female international players – including one who had won 102 caps but was dropped from the squad within two weeks of agreeing to discuss Sampson’s regime in the FA’s culture review. The FA has declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about whether it was an appropriate response for someone in his position, or whether Clarke was willing to explain why he used such a dismissive tone given the seriousness of the allegations. The FA also refused to answer questions about whether the latest controversy might have an impact on Clarke’s position or what it said about the organisation’s anti-racism policies that its own chairman should react that way when told of an alleged cover-up involving two seniorexecutives. “Once Greg Clarke had received the letter he checked with his executive team as to what actions were being taken regarding the allegations,” the FA said in a short statement. “At this point there had been an internal inquiry and Katharine Newton was about to be appointed to lead an independent second inquiry. He was therefore satisfied that the FA was taking the matter very seriously and acting appropriately.” Yet that still leaves serious questions about his judgment bearing in mind the correspondence from the PFA not only highlights the alleged Ebola remark but also states there was evidence that a member of Sampson’s staff allegedly used to talk to Aluko in a fake Caribbean accent. Speaking on 2 October, Clarke praised Aluko for reporting Sampson. “I’m pleased she raised the issues. If there are issues, we want people to feel safe and raise them … all we want is to get to the bottom of it.” Yet it was a different response to being informed by the PFA that Ashworth and Brace had been guilty of “gross failures”, not least by putting together their findings, exonerating Sampson of any wrongdoing, before speaking to one of the key witnesses and without watching a video recording of the relevant meeting in the 2015 China Cup where the comment to Spence was allegedly made. It was, according to the PFA, a “failure to conduct even a basic investigation”. Ashworth’s role, in particular, is questioned bearing in mind his claims that it was merely a coincidence – the PFA uses the word “retaliation” – that Aluko, last season’s Golden Boot winner, lost her place in the England squad within a fortnight of what she was told was a confidential process. He also says it was a coincidence that the FA launched an investigation into Aluko’s work as a sports lawyer, citing a potential conflict of interest, within 24 hours of the meeting when she explained her grievances. Ashworth denies breaking any confidences but it emerged over the weekend that he was criticised in an independent inquiry, conducted by the barrister Newton, after nominating himself as a witness, apparently to speak on Sampson’s behalf, in the review he was overseeing. Ashworth told Newton he did not see it as a conflict of interest. Yet the barrister disagreed and the FA, already accused of one whitewash, might have to explain why this part of her findings was not included in the edited section the organisation later released. “An investigator should not also be inputting evidence into the same investigation and I would advise avoiding this situation arising in any future case,” Newton wrote. Newton’s report also exonerated Sampson but ruled the comment to Spence had never happened without interviewing the player or three team-mates – Jill Scott, Izzy Christiansen and Jo Potter – who were in the same meeting. That will also form part of Wednesday’s hearing, not least because of the widespread scepticism surrounding the FA’s claims it did not know Spence was the player involved. Amid escalating criticism of her initial three-month inquiry, Newton has now made it her mission to interview all the relevant players as part of a new investigation, reopened following the media coverage since the Guardian broke the story, on 16 August, about Sampson being accused of a racial remark. The latest investigation, the third in just over a year, has already begun and it is possible the initial findings could be delivered at the hearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/18/these-guys-can-make-something-beautiful-tracy-chevaliers-new-project-quilting-with-prisoners","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T08:39:41Z","webTitle":"'These guys can make something beautiful': Tracy Chevalier's new project – quilting with prisoners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/18/these-guys-can-make-something-beautiful-tracy-chevaliers-new-project-quilting-with-prisoners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/18/these-guys-can-make-something-beautiful-tracy-chevaliers-new-project-quilting-with-prisoners","fields":{"headline":"'These guys can make something beautiful': Tracy Chevalier's new project – quilting with prisoners","bodyText":"“Turn that bloody torch off. I only get two hours” is stitched into one patch of The Sleep Quilt, Tracey Chevalier’s latest project. The bestselling author explains: “The prisoner is high risk and on suicide watch, so he is woken every two hours to make sure he’s still alive. It’s been happening for 24 years for this prisoner – it’s horrifying. For him, sleep is something he craves, but it’s a horrible experience.” After teaming up with 63 inmates in Wandsworth prison, south London, the author of novels such as The Girl With a Pearl Earring has helped them to create a quilt made up of the patches they sewed. Now that quilt is set to become a book. Chevalier, who discovered her love for quilting while researching her novel The Last Runaway (“my heroine was a quilter … it meant I could write about it more easily”), curated a quilt show at Danson House in Bexleyheath, London, in 2013. Subsequently, she was contacted by the charity Fine Cell Work, which teaches needlework to prisoners and pays them for the work they do, to come and speak about her books and quilts. Chevalier asked the Wandsworth inmates to design a quilt for her show, Things We Do in Bed, which was split into the themes of birth, sleep, sex, illness and death. Sleep seemed like the least controversial theme for prisoners to tackle, so Chevalier invited them to design and create a 10” x 10” square each. “The need for sleep is universal and, I assumed, a kind of comfort in prison,” Chevalier writes in an introduction to the resulting book, The Sleep Quilt, which launched its own Kickstarter page on Tuesday. “I wrote and explained: ‘Your square can reflect your feelings about sleep, either in images or words or both. How do you sleep in prison? Well? Poorly? Deeply? Lightly? Do you sleep more or less than you did outside? What are your dreams like? Have they changed since you’ve been inside? Are they happy or do you have more nightmares? What wakes you up? What keeps you awake when you want to sleep?’” Chevalier says that the project “became much more therapeutic than I’d thought – things came out, emotions came out. Sleep is quite contentious in prisons, and I hadn’t known that. But when we’re going to sleep, it’s often the time we think the most. For prisoners, things have gone wrong for them in their lives and that’s the time it comes out. That definitely came through in the quilt.” On one square, a prisoner is crouched, almost foetal, in a cell, with the moon shining through the window. “The stitcher used a chain stitch symbolically to outline the inmate. Crowding him in is the word ‘SHAME’ embroidered in a repeat pattern,” writes Chevalier in her introduction. “When he showed me the square on one of my visits, he explained that a guilty verdict makes you feel shame even if you know you are not guilty.” Another sees an inmate lying in bed with embroidered tears running down his face. One prisoner said that their square – a sleeping woman in an eyemask – “represents me and my dream – love of the outside, the beach, owning a beach hut and a vintage VW camper van to drive around in and be a free spirit once again … I have been in prison for quite a few years, and my dreams and aspirations of a life outside of these four walls are what keep me going all day.” Chevalier says: “Once the individual squares came together, the strength of these emotions was greater than the sum of the parts.” The plans for the book, which features the patches alongside quotes from the prisoners, came about when publisher Alexander Fyjis-Walker of Pallas Athene saw what had been produced. “It’s such a touching piece – tragic in some places, witty and lighthearted in others, and always so beautifully made. I wanted to bring its designs and ideas to as wide an audience as possible,” he says. The Kickstarter is looking to raise £5,000 in order to publish the book, with all royalties from sales going to Fine Cell Work. “It sounds crazy to say that sewing can help people, but it is actually very therapeutic and calming,” says Chevalier. “And it’s an opportunity for these guys to make something beautiful and be praised for it and paid for it. They might start out thinking they’ll join as they’ll get paid for the work, but most continue because they like sewing … It seems so unlikely, that sewing would unlock something, but it does.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/24/on-balance-sinead-morrissey-poetry-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T06:30:39Z","webTitle":"On Balance poetry review – an imagination that never closes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/24/on-balance-sinead-morrissey-poetry-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/24/on-balance-sinead-morrissey-poetry-review","fields":{"headline":"On Balance poetry review – an imagination that never closes","bodyText":"Sinead Morrissey’s On Balance, which has just won this year’s Forward prize, is a collection that keeps extending itself and that shares many of the satisfactions of fiction, memoir and history (there is an especially arresting poem about a model of Napoleon’s horse, another fine poem about the aviator Lilian Bland and an astounding poem based on a garish photograph of tsarist Russia). Even the poems that cross the finishing line with a flourish are open-ended, leaving one with the sense that there will always be more to say, and this is because Morrissey is possessed of her own invigorating brand of Irish fluency and an imagination that never closes. On the subject of balance – there is always the likelihood that the world is about to tilt. The Millihelen (the poem that launches the collection) means (I had to look it up) “a unit measure of pulchritude, corresponding to the amount of beauty required to launch one ship”. A natural performer on the page, Morrissey holds us here with a feat of suspension, of literary engineering. This is a phenomenal performance: a single sentence, no full stops, a steady push out into the water – I take liberties in interrupting its flow to lift out these lines: grandstand of iron palace of rivets starts moving starts slippery-sliding down slow as a snail at first in its viscous passage taking on slither and speed gathering in the Atlas-capable weight of its own momentum tonnage of grease beneath to get it waterborne She describes an event that one has witnessed but, without the detailed evidence of her poem, would have judged indescribable. She takes on the “tonnage” lightly, steering the poem to its close. But in another sense, the voyage has scarcely started. We wonder about the “ladies lining the quay in their layered drapery/touching their gloves to their lips” and their untold stories, their romances. Other poems are anchored by family. There is a touching sequence about her grandfather, Collier(see below). He followed the horses but never placed a bet; fantasy wins furnished his life. The imagined improvements were humble – tea cosy, boots, a pigeon cote – and the writing about him is unprecious too. There are beautiful companion piece family poems about the importance of play. The Rope describes the bond between siblings and Very Dyspraxic Child is about a boy’s brave loyalty to Batman. Child’s play is seldom child’s play to write about. And then there is the splendid title poem, taking on Philip Larkin, in which Morrissey arraigns him for his sexism in Born Yesterday (the poem written to mark Sally Amis’s birth) in which he wished her “dull” for the sake of happiness – playing bad fairy. She ends with this rebuke: I wouldn’t let you near my brilliant daughter – so far, in fact, from dull, that radiant, incandescent are as shadows on the landscape after staring at the sun. The stinging spirit of this is wonderful. But it is Nativity that is the multi-tasking show-stealer. I love this poem. It starts as a sympathetic record of a school nativity play but then, by the second verse, has evolved: she casts the headmaster as an almost comically biblical figure. Morrissey knows how the story of the nativity will make every parent think. And she ends with a funny, moving, nerve-racking admission about the primary school children she watches: “whose frankincense we breathed when they were born” admitting that, as parents, we don’t know “what the instructions are – we’ve left them in itchy kneesocks, holding up a sign – or how it will end.” • On Balance by Sinead Morrissey is published by Carcanet (£9.99).

Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said it had been granted permission to seek a judicial review of the limit, which stops child tax credits or universal credits being paid for more than two children in most cases. CPAG, which issued the high court claim against the pensions secretary, David Gauke, in August, argues that the limit is discriminatory and breaches the right to a private and family life under human rights law. On Tuesday it was told it had been granted permission for a judicial review of the policy, though it is unlikely this will begin until after Christmas. Carla Clarke, a solicitor for CPAG, said the two-child limit put “women in particular in invidious positions about the choices they have to make” and thus breached the right to family life. She said: “You have the government saying this is about people making rational decisions on whether they have more children. But if birth control fails it puts a woman in the position of deciding if they continue with the pregnancy, knowing the child will not bring any more child tax credits into the family, or have an abortion. “There’s a lot of women who might not have any particular religious persuasion but, as a fundamental ethical matter, will not entertain abortion. To put women through that is unbelievable.” The legal challenge also argues that the limit unlawfully discriminates against children with multiple siblings, and against families with religious or moral opposition to birth control. It argues that the justification for the two-child benefits limit by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is “logically flawed”. The DWP argues that it is meant to ensure those claiming benefits have to make the same choices as families in work, and thus incentivises claimants to get work or make “progression” in their jobs. But Clarke said 70% of tax credit recipients were already in work and often found it hard to earn any more. “The nature of the reason you are on tax credits is because you are in low-paid work where progression is limited,” she said. The two-child limit has certain exceptions, one of which is that benefits will be paid if a mother can demonstrate that a third or later child was conceived because of rape, generally known as the rape clause. This element has prompted a vehement reaction from women’s aid and rape crisis groups, who argue it is inhumane to oblige traumatised women to explain the circumstances of a rape as part of a benefits claim. The eight-page form to apply for the exemption obliges women to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex, give the child’s name, and confirm they do not live with the rapist. Women’s aid charities say the latter element fails to take into account that most rapes occur within domestic violence relationships. Alison Thewliss, the SNP MP who first campaigned against the clause, has described it as “one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from Whitehall”. Thewliss welcomed the upcoming legal case. “The two-child limit is ideologically driven and will only plunge more families in to poverty. It is in breach of the UK’s obligation under the UN convention on the rights of the child,” she said. “It is estimated that around 250,000 children will be pushed into poverty as a result of this measure by the end of the decade, representing a 10% increase in child poverty. Add to this the despicable rape clause, whereby women have to prove they have been raped just to put food on the table. Anyone with an ounce of humanity can see how toxic and ill thought out this policy is.” For child tax credits, the new rules limit payments for third or subsequent children born on or after 6 April 2017. But for universal credit, which is gradually replacing the tax credit system, the limit applies irrespective of when the child was born. As well as rape, other exemptions include multiple births, and adoption from local authority or kinship care. A DWP spokeswoman said: “This reform ensures people on benefits make the same choices as those supporting themselves solely through work. But we have always been clear this will be delivered in the most effective, compassionate way, with the right safeguards in place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/russian-troll-factory-activists-protests-us-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:13:52Z","webTitle":"Russian troll factory paid US activists to help fund protests during election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/russian-troll-factory-activists-protests-us-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/russian-troll-factory-activists-protests-us-election","fields":{"headline":"Russian troll factory paid US activists to help fund protests during election","bodyText":"Russian trolls posing as Americans made payments to genuine activists in the US to help fund protest movements on socially divisive issues, according to a new investigation by a respected Russian media outlet. On Tuesday, the newspaper RBC published a major investigation into the work of a so-called Russian “troll factory” since 2015, including during the period of the US election campaign, disclosures that are likely to put further spotlight on alleged Russian meddling in the election. The existence of the troll factory, which has a history of spamming Russian and English blogs and comment forums, has been reported on by many outlets including the Guardian, but the RBC investigation is the first in-detail look at the organisation’s activity during the election period. RBC said it had identified 118 accounts or groups in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that were linked to the troll factory, all of which had been blocked in August and September this year as part of the US investigation into Russian electoral meddling. Many of the accounts had already been linked to Russian disinformation efforts in western outlets, but RBC said its sources at the troll factory had provided screenshots of the internal group administration pages of some of the groups, as proof they were run from Russia. It also spoke to former and current employees of the troll factory, all of whom spoke anonymously. Perhaps the most alarming element of the article was the claim that employees of the troll factory had contacted about 100 real US-based activists to help with the organisation of protests and events. RBC claimed the activists were contacted by Facebook group administrators hiding their Russian origin and were offered financial help to pay for transport or printing costs. About $80,000 was spent during a two-year period, according to the report. The main topics covered by the groups run from Russia were race relations, Texan independence and gun rights. RBC counted 16 groups relating to the Black Lives Matter campaign and other race issues that had a total of 1.2 million subscribers. The biggest group was entitled Blacktivist and reportedly had more than 350,000 likes at its peak. Last month, CNN also reported that US authorities believed the Blacktivist Facebook group and Twitter account were the work of Russian impostors. The infiltration of American social networks by Russian trolls and bots appears to be the conclusion of an operation that began by targeting the Russian-language internet space, grew to encompass the comment pages of western newspapers and blogs, and eventually seems to have led to the creation of whole Facebook communities designed to look like they are run by ordinary Americans. Two years ago, the Guardian spoke with two people who worked at the “troll farm”. They would clock on at the building on Savushkina St each morning, turn on a VPN connection to disguise their location, and spend their days inhabiting fake personas on Russian social networks. These profiles would post dozens of innocuous musings on travel or baking, and then occasionally fill them out with politicised entries that mirrored Kremlin talking points. Generally, the posts were either in praise of President Vladimir Putin or about the “chaos” and “degeneration” of Europe, often with homophobic or racist undertones. The Internet Research Agency, one of the companies believed to run the trolling operations, has long been rumoured to be a project of Evgeny Prigozhin, a shadowy businessman known as “Putin’s chef”, who ran Putin’s favourite restaurant in St Petersburg and later won billions of dollars worth of state catering contracts. A number of semi-legitimate news aggregating websites appear to be run by the same people as the troll operations. Google has said Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on targeted ads on YouTube, Google and Gmail, according to reports. Last month, Facebook released a statement saying it had found $100,000 of ad spending on about 3,000 ads that it linked to 470 “inauthentic” accounts that it had linked to Russia. The company later clarified that the ads focused on “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum”. The company estimated that about 10 million Americans saw the ads, but interestingly also specified that only 44% of the impressions took place before last November’s election, making the Russian campaign look more like an attempt to sow general chaos rather than a narrowly focused electoral drive. “The task wasn’t to support Trump,” one of the factory’s employees told RBC. “We raised social issues and other problems that already existed in the US, and tried to shine as bright a light as possible on them.” The employee said that because Clinton was part of the current regime, she was also a target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/17/uk-withdrawal-bill-rips-the-heart-out-of-environmental-law-say-campaigners","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T13:24:47Z","webTitle":"UK withdrawal bill 'rips the heart out of environmental law', say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/17/uk-withdrawal-bill-rips-the-heart-out-of-environmental-law-say-campaigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/17/uk-withdrawal-bill-rips-the-heart-out-of-environmental-law-say-campaigners","fields":{"headline":"UK withdrawal bill 'rips the heart out of environmental law', say campaigners","bodyText":"The cornerstones of wildlife and habitat protection have been quietly left out of the withdrawal bill ripping the heart out of environmental law, campaigners say. A key principle under EU law which provides a robust legal backstop against destruction of the environment – the precautionary principle - has been specifically ruled out of the bill as a means of legal challenge in British courts. Based on the idea that the environment is unowned, the precautionary principle creates a bottom line forcing those who want to build or develop, for example, to prove in law what they are doing will not damage the environment. Other key elements of EU legal protection, the polluter pays, and the principle that preventative action should be taken to avert environmental damage, have also been ruled out in the bill as a means to protect the natural world from damage by policymakers, development or industry after Brexit. The withdrawal bill began to be debated in committee this week by MPs. Ministers are facing intense lobbying by Greener UK, an umbrella group of several leading environmental NGOs and backbench MPs, to ensure that the UK does not throw out these key protections. Richard Benwell, head of government affairs at WWT, said: “Take out principles like precaution and polluter pays and you rip out the heart of environmental law. “For decades they have helped guide good decisions – and strike down bad decisions – from planning to food safety to water quality and chemicals licensing. “The principles must be available not just to interpret old law, but also to inform future decisions. Crucially we must be able to challenge Government in court if environmental principles are ignored. At the moment that’s explicity ruled out – a clear departure from the commitment to legal continuity on Brexit day.” The precautionary principle and polluter pays principle are contained in Article 191 (2) of the Lisbon treaty which states policy on the environment should be “based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay.” But Schedule 1 of the withdrawal bill rules out these EU principles as a basis for challenge in British law. It states there is no right of action in domestic law on or after exit day based on a failure to comply with any of the general principles of EU law, and that no court or tribunal or other public body may, on or after exit day, quash any conduct or decide it is unlawful because it is incompatible with any of the general principles of EU law. Tom Burke, chair of the global climate change think tank E3G, said: “It would not be an exaggeration to say that Brexit will have more immediate impact on our ability to manage the growing stresses on the environment than any other single political development of the past 50 years. “There is no formal place in British policy practise for the writing into legislation of principles such as the polluter pays or the precautionary principle. This weakens the guidance to policy makers and judges as to the tests that should be applied in policy formation or implementation.” Amendments put forward by Caroline Lucas, leader of the Green Party, Kerry McCarthy Labour MP and Mary Creagh the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, aim to fill the vacuum left by the bill in its current form. Amendment NC28 puts forward a new clause to ensure that public authorities must have regard to environmental principles currently enshrined in EU law. Lawyers from the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) when asked by the Guardian about the absence of the precautionary principle as a means of challenge, made no comment on whether the amendments might be accepted as the bill goes through committee. Benwell said ministers in Defra did appear to be looking for answers. But he said: “To give the public confidence that the spirit of our environmental law will be upheld, we are looking for strong solutions from Government to preserve and improve the application of the principles in UK laws in the early stages of the EU withdrawal bill.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Our ambition is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. “The decision to leave the European Union creates new opportunities for a green Brexit and to enhance our environmental standards. We now have the chance to deliver higher standards of animal welfare and reform how we manage our land, rivers and seas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/what-makes-a-child-a-psychopath","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Brain unpicked: what makes a child psychopathic? | Abigail Marsh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/what-makes-a-child-a-psychopath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/what-makes-a-child-a-psychopath","fields":{"headline":"What makes a child psychopathic?","bodyText":"The concept of a psychopathic child makes people queasy. The two categories seem incompatible. Children, even badly behaved ones, are viewed as maintaining some fundamental innocence, whereas psychopaths are seen as fundamentally depraved. Neither stereotype is totally true. Children, just like adults, are capable of cruelty and violence, and even highly psychopathic people are not cruel or violent all of the time. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder. It doesn’t emerge out of nowhere in adulthood – all psychopathic adults show signs during adolescence or childhood. But this doesn’t mean we should label a child a psychopath – far from it. No responsible researcher or clinician ever would. Even though every adult psychopath began as a psychopathic child, the reverse is not true: many children with high psychopathy scores do not go on to become adult psychopaths. And remission can occur in response to favourable changes in a child’s environment, or as a result of innate developmental processes. But the fact that children can strongly express psychopathic traits should not be ignored. What is sometimes overlooked is the impact on parents. During our research, the stories they told us about their children were heart-rending. Often they worried about what new episode of violence or theft or destructiveness each day would bring, about the safety of their other children and about their own safety. In your mind the thought that “these kids must have really terrible parents” may be bouncing around. The belief that badly behaved children are the product of bad parenting is so deeply rooted in our culture that it is difficult to dispel. But let me try. I have talked to many families over the years and a common thread has been that the parents had tried literally every possible option before coming to see us – counsellors, medication, special schools, social workers. These were caring parents with resources. Nearly all had other children, none of whom were psychopathic. Engaging in psychopathic behaviours seems to be driven by inherited factors, as we know from adoption and twin studies. These studies show that parenting and other environmental factors explain only a small fraction of the aggression of psychopathic children. So what was going wrong with these children? Part of our research measured activity in the prefrontal cortex, right above the eyes, and a region called the amygdala. The amygdala (Latin for almond) is a lump of fat and fibre about half an inch in diameter that is buried beneath layers of cortex under each temple. Among other things, it plays a critical role in recognising fearful facial expressions. The psychopathic children showed no activation – zero – in the righthand amygdala when they viewed the face of someone experiencing intense fear. The sight of another person in distress made no mark on this part of their brains. These children literally struggle to understand what they are looking at. The children with psychopathic traits reported that they felt fear only infrequently and weakly. Two claimed they had never felt fear, whereas no healthy children said this. This suggested a possibility that amygdala dysfunction in psychopaths impairs not only their behaviour, but their fundamental ability to empathise with another’s fear. If someone doesn’t understand what it means to feel fear, how can they empathise with it in others?

Some people think I’m ugly. What can I say? I was born in 1955, in Appleton, Wisconsin – primarily a paper mill town. I grew up with Eisenhower. It was a Republican kind of area. It wasn’t a bad upbringing. People were hardworking and good, but I always had the sense there was a bigger world out there that I would feel more comfortable in. I knew, even as a child. I’m happiest when I’m in nature. I mean, deeply in nature. It allows you to forget and join the bigger picture. My favourite landscape is jungle down to water. My dream is to wear flipflops, boxer shorts and a vest all day. I’ve thought about murder many times. I have dreams about murders. I haven’t done it yet because I don’t think it’s my talent. I’d get caught. I’m the guy that if I’ve got some food in my luggage and I get stopped at customs, sweat breaks out on my forehead. I’m not the murdering type. I’m not a natural killer.

Now this is helping us because it’s harder and harder to have original thinking. My closest friends are women. My mother and father worked a lot, so my five sisters raised me. All but one is older than me. They gave me a lot of good advice and trained me well. I think that makes me more appreciative of women. But I’m not going to say I understand women because of that, or that I have some special insight. I’m not gonna brag. Keep your mouth shut and listen. That is the best piece of advice I have been given. I played a polar bear glove puppet for Birds Eye Fish Fingers. The ad agency said: “He may only be a glove puppet but he needs integrity.” When they first pitched the idea to me it sounded really cool.

At a time when council housing and domestic architecture was at a low ebb, his housing estates, such as the Alexandra Road estate for the London Borough of Camden, designed in the 1970s, were beacons of hope. Brown’s estates were robust reminders of the dramatic progress public housing in the UK had made over the course of the 20th century. Barely 100 years since Charles Booth shone a light on the living conditions of the most needy in London, Brown and his team built on the progressive traditions of public housing in the UK to create some of the best, most innovative homes this country has ever seen. This month, Brown received the RIBA royal gold medal in recognition of a lifetime’s contribution to advancing architecture. This is the UK’s highest honour for architecture and for it to be awarded to a figure like him matters hugely. He has no ego and his buildings are no swaggering monoliths. Brown is a humble, but hugely intelligent chap and his courageous buildings are the result of his quiet, but gritted determination to carve out a new direction for modern architecture and housing design, that put quality above all else. The award therefore is a timely reminder of those qualities and the scale of our ambitious for everyday housing in the 1960s-70s. At Camden, Brown was part of a young and ambitious architects’ department that wanted to do housing differently. They were opposed to tower blocks and slab blocks and the kind of generic housing estate architecture thrown up across the UK, and they pushed hard against cheap, contractor-led system building techniques, whose faults and shortcomings were there to be seen, even in the 60s. Instead Brown invested in creating a new humanism where low-rise, medium- to high-density housing layouts responded to the characteristics of north London to create new neighbourhoods and people-focused domestic space. At his scheme at Dunboyne Road, completed in 1975, spacious homes are arranged in stepped terraces huddled among a landscape of trees and gardens. At Alexandra Road, completed in 1978, he scaled up this concept into one of London’s most ambitious public housing statements with two mighty terraces providing 500 homes, shops, workshops, a community centre, schools and a public park. While its sheer scale is undeniable, this is also an incredibly human and open environment full of spaces for residents to meet, talk, lounge, play and linger and for visitors to wander through. People who live there absolutely love it. One I spoke to recently told me it wasan “extraordinary privilege” to live in such an extraordinary home full of endless clever and beautiful details. I believe we are on the cusp of again creating public architecture that can start to lay claim to the mantle of those conceived by Brown and his Camden colleagues. Projects like Alexandra Road were not abstract architectural concepts plucked from the avant garde; they were housing schemes designed for ordinary, middle- to low-income families and part of a long British architectural tradition that started with the philanthropists of the 1860s, were fine-tuned by the London county council and diversified by boroughs and tenant groups, but that were wilfully cut down by opportunist politicians and the Thatcher government. If we are ever to see projects of the same quality and ambition again, we need to reach back into our own history and support local authorities to build the housing they need. This doesn’t mean simply throwing occasional grant funding at them. It means building them back up as clients and as leaders so that they again have the confidence to innovate and deliver housing with flair and imagination.

A swing of the foot, a lucky connection, and a ball that on any other day – on every other day – flies wildly high and wide this time rockets into the top corner. This is how Nemanja Matic ends up on the shortlist for the Puskás Award. The only fail-safe method of proving a goal was no fluke is simple: do it again, and again. Just as Dennis Bergkamp’s goal for Holland against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup made his earlier effort for Arsenal against Leicester all the finer, what makes Simon Cox’s goal for Swindon against Walsall in January 2009 even more mind-blowingly amazing is the goal he scored in a friendly against Fenerbahce in July 2008. The goals are not identical, but they are extremely similar. A long, high ball brought perfectly under control with a single gossamer touch from a player running into the centre of the pitch from the left, and an arcing, long-range shot that flew over the goalkeeper and dipped into the far corner. Cox has scored more than 100 first-team goals, and has perfect recall of almost all of them. “If you tell me a goal, I’d be able to go back in my mind and tell you who passed it, or how it came about, or the feeling I had at the time,” he says. “When you talk about specific goals, or specific games, most players I’d imagine would be able to go back to that time and tell you a little bit about the day, or the game, or something that happened. There’d be something about it. For me, scoring goals is always quite memorable.” Perhaps this is because there haven’t really been enough of them. At one stage, while at Reading, Cox went 471 days without scoring, not exactly ideal for a striker even if he started a lot of the matches on the bench. His total tally of top-flight strikes stalled at one. But it’s also because many of his goals are genuinely memorable. Yet from all the goals he has scored across his career so far – at 30 there should be quite a few more to come – four stand out in his memory, of which those against Fenerbahce and Walsall are two. “I remember the Fenerbahce one really well even though it was just a pre-season friendly,” he says. “The ball got played into me. I remember that early in the game the defender kept trying to come tight, so I thought I’d try to flick this one over him and go for a one-versus-one race into the penalty area. But as it was it sat up really nicely and I thought: ‘Why not?’ Because it was a friendly it didn’t really matter if it went into Row Z or anywhere else, but thankfully it looped over the goalkeeper and into the net. So that one, it wasn’t quite luck but I had a different thought process about what I was going to do. “The Walsall goal was special because I wasn’t actually on a very good spell of scoring. I’d probably gone seven or eight games without one. And Lilian Nalis just tried to loop one over the defence, again for a one-against-one foot race. I was thinking: ‘You can just control this and drive with the ball into the area.’ Again it popped up nicely. This one was more technique than it was power, more precision than trying to kick the leather off the ball.” Fabulous as these goals are, Cox himself rates neither as his favourite or finest. He picks out two favourites, one scored for West Bromwich Albion against Tottenham in April 2011, which secured his team 40 points, denied his opponents a Champions League place and remains his only Premier League goal. It was a lovely, curling shot from just outside the penalty area, which Harry Redknapp, at the time the Spurs manager, described as “world-class” and his own boss, Roy Hodgson, considered “superb”. The second was another fabulous piece of skill, for Nottingham Forest against Birmingham City in September 2002. “I’d got injured while playing away for Ireland,” he remembers. “I came back and really wanted to make the game, but I didn’t train until Friday. We were getting beat and the manager threw me on with 20 minutes to go and I came up with that. I can watch that one over and over again, and I have done. It’s not one you easily forget about.” For those who haven’t seen it, or who have found it easy to forget about, here’s a reminder: “I had one of the biggest strappings you’ve ever seen on my foot and that’s probably what cushioned the ball more than anything else,” Cox says. “I remember the pass, the run into the area, and then it was just about being able to get something on the ball in terms of control.” The control was instant and suddenly the goalkeeper, rushing out ready to dive upon the ball, was hopelessly exposed. “When I saw him running out, he sort of made my mind up, as much as you have to do it all in a split second. I thought that if I could lift it over him, it’s only going to go in. If the goalkeeper hadn’t run out I probably wouldn’t have scored.” You are unlikely to have seen the goal he considers the best of all. It is not on YouTube or on any season-highlights DVD, though it was recorded on camera. Cox has lost his only copy. “My best goal, my best ever, was in a reserve game for Reading,” he says. “I can’t find that one. I don’t think even Reading can find it. I scored four in the game, and my fourth one was the one I’m talking about. It was a volley from just inside the centre circle that lobbed the goalkeeper. That’s my favourite ever one. It sat there nicely to be hit, but it was the audaciousness to have a go at something like that. It’s not something you’d try if it was 0-0, that’s for sure.” This all adds up to quite the collection of memorable goals. Those that it is possible still to see share a spellbinding beauty. They are, without doubt, among the finest you will ever witness. To author one of them takes cunning, lightning reflexes and impeccable technique. To do it three times demonstrates a level of consistent magicianship that should rank the player among the very finest. This one, however, is seeing out the end of what should be his peak years in League One at Southend, with a contract that expires in the summer. “What puts the elite forwards into that category isn’t just that they have them in their bag of tricks, it’s that they’re more comfortable trying those sorts of things,” Cox says. “Whereas the people who are not in the elite, which is most of the world, will have a go at those sorts of things every now and again but are probably more happy to pass the ball wide and get into the box and score a header than try an audacious lob from 40 yards. Most professional players probably have the ability, but they’re cautious about trying it in matches. “I’m quite happy with what I’ve done in my career so far. I’m still 30, still able to get in positions to score goals. Hopefully I’ll sign a new contract at Southend, or just see what happens at the end of the season. While I’m still healthy and able to run around a pitch I want to play for as long as possible. I’ve never had lightning pace. Teddy Sheringham was my idol, the way he played the game in terms of his intelligence. He wasn’t the quickest, and he had to be sharper in his mind than he was with his feet, so he was a role model of mine. And I admired Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who again wasn’t blessed with outstanding pace but always seemed to be in the right place at the right time. “I’m happy to have scored 100 goals. I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d get that. I should have scored more in the Premier League, if I’d have got the chances to do so. For me personally, I probably got promoted to the Premier League a year early. But I wouldn’t change it for the world. I probably spent too many years sat on the bench, in my own opinion. More games than I wanted to. But in terms of where I’ve been, the teams I’ve played for, the leagues I’ve played in, I don’t think there’s much I can be too upset about really.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/17/world-cup-2018-play-off-draw-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T12:37:16Z","webTitle":"World Cup play-off draw: Sweden face Italy, Northern Ireland get Switzerland, Denmark draw Republic of Ireland  – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/17/world-cup-2018-play-off-draw-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/17/world-cup-2018-play-off-draw-live","fields":{"headline":"World Cup play-off draw: Sweden face Italy, Northern Ireland get Switzerland, Denmark draw Republic of Ireland  – as it happened","bodyText":"So, that is pretty much that.

Looking at the non-Irish ties, Sweden-Italy should be a jazzer. Italy have struggled to get anything going, while Sweden pushed an admittedly Deschampsed France to the last. Martin O’Neill is pleased to be in the draw, given what it took to get there. He says most coaches prefer to play at home second, but sensibly notes that the away goals rule - a nonsense, in mine - and potential for extra-time negates any advantage. Darren Randolph has got the draw that he wanted, and Cyrus Christie concurs. Ireland could definitely beat Denmark, but the Danes improved significantly during qualifying - I’d not back against them. Michael O’Neill points out that, while Switzerland are the highest-ranked side left, they had probably the easiest group. And it’s also fair to say that they were miserable against Portugal, in the key game; if Northern Ireland turn up, they’ve got a chance. “Cherry over Regular is a war crime,” chides David Angel. “More importantly, it clearly goes... 1.

Sadly I’m not confident we will be in Russia. But I could be wrong. I hope Northern Ireland draw Switzerland. Italy and Croatia are best avoided.” Yes, I’d agree with that, though I’m not quite sure how Croatia managed to avoid qualifying automatically. There’s a yellow ticker up trailing the draw; I’m sorry, but that is not right. I want to read that Rotherham have signed Jamie Cureton, not know about something I already know that hasn’t yet happened. “As a Scotland fan I’d just like to congratulate England on another qualification job well done,” magnanimises Simon McMahon, teeth ground to gristle, “and wish good luck to all the teams involved in today’s draw. In any case, the World Cup Finals is no place for small nations like Scotland and, eh, Iceland, is it?” A primer for youse: “Ryanair don’t miss a turn,” tweets Paul Kelly. “Flights from Dublin to Copenhagen/Zurich €210+ for the playoff dates. Pre draw.” Michael O’Leary really needs a cuddle doesn’t he. So what do we groupthink: should this draw be seeded or not? I suppose it’s for our own good in the end: we probably want the best teams in Russia. But imagine if, in order to get there, Italy met Croatia and Ireland took on Northern Ireland! Email and tweet! “I’m lying at home recovering from the removal of my burst appendix so this is the highlight of my day,” stoics Andy Simpson. “Please make this as entertaining as possible.” Er, are you in any way familiar with this medium? Get well soon! Some people think football is all about winning; some people are also c silly billies. Take today’s draw, for example. Though few players, teams and countries ever win a World Cup, simply being there is, while not as intense as Leicester-West Brom, the key to months of hope, pride, excitement and joy - and oh my days don’t we all need some of that. How those actually participating process the unfathomable emotion of it all, the rest of us will never know: can they or can they not brand themselves upon the history of their nation into the annals of humanity? So today’s draw is a BIG DEAL, salvation in contemplation of failure as well as a gentle cattle prod that in a mere 209 days’ time, the glory of a World Cup will be upon us. Seeds: Italy, Croatia, Switzerland, Denmark.

A lawyer representing four of the alleged victims has claimed the abuse was covered up by the C of E and has called for a independent review. The allegations date from the late 1970s when Whitsey was bishop of Chester, and in the 1980s after he had retired and was living in the diocese of Blackburn. The C of E said it had supported a police investigation into allegations of sexual offences against children and adults. The police told the church that, had Whitsey still been alive, he would have been interviewed in relation to 10 allegations. Whitsey died in 1987. In a statement, the archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, and the bishop of Chester, Dr Peter Forster, said: “We are deeply sorry and apologise to those individuals who have come forward to share their account of abuse by a bishop in the Church of England who was in a position of power and authority. We appreciate that it is very difficult for individuals to come forward and to give their account. “Sexual abuse is a heinous crime – and is an absolute and shameful breach of trust. We acknowledge that for survivors the effects of sexual abuse are lifelong. We are offering pastoral support to all those who have come forward and continue to hold them all in our prayers.” It added: “The church will consider what lessons can be learned from this case and whether any action needs to be taken as a result of what these inquiries have shown.” Cheshire police said the allegations related to 13 people, five males and eight females. “The abuse is alleged to have taken place whilst the bishop was living and working in Chester and one incident is reported to have taken place outside the county,” a statement said. The police investigation had spanned 13 months, it added. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represents four of Whitsey’s victims, said: “The abhorrent and disgusting abuse perpetrated by Bishop Whitsey destroyed many lives, driving some to attempt suicide. What is equally abhorrent is that the Church of England knew of his abuse, did nothing to stop it and covered it up. It is crucial that there is now an independent review into Whitsey abuse and who failed to act when they learnt of his heinous behaviour.” The law firm understands that a complaint was made to the C of E while Whitsey was still serving as bishop of Chester, but it was not passed to police. The church was believed to have been made aware of further allegations following Whitsey’s retirement, but no action was taken. Slater and Gordon released a statement from one of Whitsey’s alleged victims. It said: “When I met Victor Whitsey I was young, innocent, and naive. I longed for his blessing to achieve my wish of a future as a vicar, serving God and the community. He told me he agreed I had a calling from God. He also told me he had the power to give me everything I wanted in life and the power to take it all away. He then proceeded to abuse me sexually and psychologically. I was powerless to stop him. “I blamed myself, though I was the only victim and rationalised that it was my fault … I told no one; who would believe a teenage boy’s word against a bishop of the Church of England? I became reclusive and came to the ultimate conclusion. The prospect of ever seeing Victor Whitsey again was so abhorrent to me that I turned my back on my beloved church and my calling to serve God. I self-harmed and have spent a lifetime focusing on resentment and bitterness. “Twenty years after my abuse, I suffered a complete mental nervous breakdown which included attempted suicide. Because of the sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of Victor Whitsey I lost my faith, my chosen life as a vicar, my self-belief, my freedom from worry and my dignity. Child sex abuse is a crime which stays with you for a lifetime. As a child you don’t understand why or what is happening, but as you grow older you realise the enormity of the abuse and it hurts you all over again – you blame yourself for allowing it – you hate yourself for being weak. “Since my abuse, not a day has gone by that I have not thought about what happened to me.” The author of the statement said he hoped there would be a public inquiry “to understand not only what Whitsey did to his victims but to also learn who knew what he was doing, to what extent his actions were intentionally covered up, and who else was complicit in the crimes that he committed, and for which, I continue to suffer every day of my life”. The church has faced a number of high-profile cases of sexual abuse. Peter Ball, a former bishop of both Gloucester and Lewes, was jailed in October 2015 for the grooming, sexual exploitation and abuse of 18 vulnerable young men aged 17-25 who had sought spiritual guidance from him between 1977 and 1992. He was released from prison in February after serving 16 months. A damning independent report, published in June, found that senior figures in the C of E had colluded over a 20-year period with the disgraced former bishop. The report made harrowing reading, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said. “The church colluded and concealed rather than seeking to help those who were brave enough to come forward. This is inexcusable and shocking behaviour,” he said. George Carey, a former archbishop of Canterbury who was criticised in the report, resigned as honorary assistant bishop in the diocese of Oxford. Two years ago, the church issued a formal apology for alleged sexual abuse committed by one of its most senior figures, George Bell, the late bishop of Chichester, who died 57 years ago. It also settled a civil claim brought against Bell by a survivor. However, critics accused the church of acting improperly and without sufficient evidence, saying Bell’s “condemnation as a paedophile” had irreparably damaged his reputation. An independent report into the church’s handling of the case is expected to be published next month. • This article was amended on 18 October 2017 to correct a reference to George Bell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/17/venus-in-fur-review-natalie-dormer-game-of-thrones-theatre-royal-haymarket-david-ives","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T22:00:36Z","webTitle":"Venus in Fur review – Natalie Dormer dominates S&M game of cat and mouse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/17/venus-in-fur-review-natalie-dormer-game-of-thrones-theatre-royal-haymarket-david-ives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/17/venus-in-fur-review-natalie-dormer-game-of-thrones-theatre-royal-haymarket-david-ives","fields":{"headline":"Venus in Fur review – Natalie Dormer dominates S&M game of cat and mouse","bodyText":"Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer is dominant in every way in this tricksy, mildly entertaining two-hander written by David Ives, in which 21st-century sexual politics meet 19th-century S&amp;M. Dormer plays Vanda, a mysterious actor who turns up late to audition for the female lead in a play adapted by writer-director Thomas Novachek (David Oakes) from the novel Venus in Furs by Sacher-Masoch, the man who gave his name to masochism. With auditions finished, Thomas has just been on the phone to his girlfriend complaining that “young women can’t even play feminine these days” and out of the 30 he’s already seen, “half are dressed like hookers, half like dykes”. Then Vanda appears with a flash of lightning. Patrick Marber’s production lays on the Hammer Horror effects with gusto. Thomas initially refuses to hear the brash, motormouth Vanda read for the part, using the age-old excuse “we’re looking for somebody different”. With the weariness of the powerless actress used to the meat market of casting calls, she counters: “Somebody who’s not me. I’m too young. Too old. I’m too big, I’m too small. My résumé’s not long enough. OK.” But when Vanda slips into a dress she brought with her she is transformed. As Thomas starts to read alongside her, he becomes Severin von Kushemski, the protagonist in Sacher-Masoch’s novel, whose early experience of being birched by an aunt while lying on a fur cape has left him longing to be dominated. So begins a game of cat and mouse, an intricate two-step operating as a play within a play in which the power balance continually shifts. Soon Vanda is giving Thomas notes and direction, pointing up his sexism and taking control. Ives’ script wears its influences on its sleeve, whether it’s The Bacchae, Strindberg’s Miss Julie or the dangerous dressing-up games of Genet’s The Maids. In the showier role, Dormer negotiates the switches in mood with real virtuosity, but it is never quite the engrossing power struggle it might be, because Oakes’ Thomas is such a bland chap. One might think that in the light of the recent Harvey Weinstein allegations this would have added pungency. Thomas admits he once said that being a playwright was an opportunity to get laid, but excuses it as his younger self talking. That sounds familiar. But the play’s uncertainty of tone – veering between comedy, campness and mild erotica – undercuts any serious points it might make about the way sex and power are intimately entwined. It has a problem, too. From the moment Vanda arrives dressed in a revealing black corset and bends over offering Thomas an eye-popping glimpse of her bottom, the audience’s gaze is also his gaze – and therefore the male gaze. Ives and Marber can’t resist titillating even as the play appears to question the objectification of women. Even the casting of Vanda as the goddess turned femme fatale plays to Hollywood conventions. Venus in Fur has become one of America’s most regularly staged plays since its 2010 premiere. It’s no surprise: it’s a mere tease, and one that never strips bare the way some men use sex and power to dominate, control and obliterate women to satisfy their own desires.

Sales flew up by 30%. Brace yourself for a similar explosion. This is all well and good, but what do you actually do with them? Restaurants are starting to put them in pancakes and ice-cream, but a good start for the home cook is to steep them in coconut milk and then whip that up into a nice custard.

No, listen, I’ve just Googled “pandan health benefits” and apparently the leaves also heal sunburn, repel insects, reduce stress, blacken hair and treat premature ejaculation. I’m not making this up.

Theresa is no stranger to coughs: her total lack of charisma means she has do at least a dozen of them to get her reflection to come to the mirror. Admittedly, she had the kind of conference breakdown where if she was a car she’d have been set on fire and rolled into a quarry. May’s attempts to deal with Brexit have all the conviction of someone whose long-term partner has developed a new fetish. You feel like saying, “Look, your heart isn’t in this, stop clinging to the pain and pass it on to someone who’s already bought the rubber sheets.” The cabinet have been making supportive noises, the Jaws theme of the Tory leadership. When asked if they would like to be PM, the prospective candidate always says no, and adds that Theresa May is doing, “an excellent job”. By which they mean being prime minister is an excellent job and they’d happily perform transplant surgery on themselves with some Christmas cracker nail-clippers for the chance to replace her. They say the PM is doing an excellent job but that can’t be true because, let’s face it, no one in the UK is doing an excellent job. Look around you. Stop reading this and have a look at your colleagues. Check out the waitress. Your fellow commuter. Your spouse, parents, children. None of them are doing an excellent job. I’m sure at some point in this country’s history someone, somewhere did an excellent job. But sadly we’ll never know who that person was, because whoever it was that should have recorded the fact was doing a piss-poor job. And don’t think I’m doing an excellent job. I’m not. I’m watching the word count build up and when it hits the magic number I stop. Even if my very next thought was something to rival Flaubert, I’d let that thought shrivel in my skull and rot for a week like a windfall apple. May’s position has been strengthened by an abortive coup led by Grant Shapps, which was like watching a wounded antelope trying to bring down a wounded antelope. The Conservatives have never been a party burdened by needless sentimentality; some MPs only keep their children’s photos in their wallet to make sure that at the end of term they don’t bring the wrong one home. No doubt her rivals will keep May in position while she retains some brief usefulness, like when a bank robber in a movie holds a dead body in front of them to soak up the bullets. Also backing May is John Major, who can’t stab anyone in the back after his knife got accidentally cremated in 2013. How enlightening it must be to exist as Theresa May at this moment in history. To live while still dead must give you an almost Buddhist level of insight: to attend meetings, give speeches, avoid questions, as a vertical cadaver; propelled by a sort of furious nothing. Perhaps the next leader will be Boris Johnson, a man who sees genocide as the first stage of a planning application. Boris, a malevolent baked Alaska, is living out in public the great dramatic sweep of a life that asks what if a hero, instead of a single tragic flaw, had all of them. Or perhaps it will be David Davis, a man who seems to suffer from the same lack of imagination as his parents. Or Jacob Rees-Mogg (a man who has taken the phrase “stalking horse” rather too anthropomorphically), who, when he’s not on the run from Westworld: Victorian Britain, seems to be one of those people who flicks through the Old Testament looking for the sexy bits. Rees-Mogg’s wife has phenomenal personal wealth of her own. Not sure where she got it, presumably by marrying him for a bet. Or maybe Philip Hammond, a man who could send a wooden leg to sleep, a haunted suit with all the personal magnetism of Paul Scholes’s accountant, glimpsed through a fog. A good outside bet is Ruth Davidson, Boris Johnson in negative. Davidson seems quite cheerful for a British person, but by Scottish standards she’s pretty much Santa Claus. I can’t believe so many people are fooled by her. Don’t you remember Boris was a laughing panel-show goon too? The British public have the memory span of an abused dog who has been offered steak. She has the jovial, apologetic bonhomie that most politicians don’t master until 10 years after a disgraced exit from the Commons. Her success should at least be contextualised by the fact that there are plenty of places in Scotland that should be natural Tory strongholds, if only because of the sheer unpleasantness of their populations. In an attempt to give herself some intellectual heft she recently published a longish essay of the “whither capitalism” variety (personal highlight: “The centre cannot hold. Or can it?”). The essay is a breezy acknowledgement of the problems of capitalism that concludes that government needs to “press the case for fairer markets”. How, or to whom, is left completely unaddressed. Of course governments can simply create fairer markets, with rent controls or stronger unions or what have you, but this doesn’t seem to be what Davidson means. Davidson seems to be outlining a worldview where it’s important that you talk about problems in the system and make sure that the government (which you are part of) is aware of the problems that it creates, and presses a case for greater fairness, to itself. Really the essay is a pitch for little more than a management style that is closer to the shop floor. It’s essentially a reminder to Conservatives to scrunch their face up in a concerned way when people are telling them their worries. Sometimes I wonder if the Conservatives are the party to which Davidson’s brand of guarded joshing is best suited. She didn’t join the Tories till 2009 and, had the wind been blowing differently, she could have slotted into New Labour quite comfortably. Indeed, while her support for the union is obviously genuine, her proudly vacuous Scottish boosterism is exactly the same as the SNP’s. The Scottish press are uniquely incompetent and you have to wonder whether under national media scrutiny her Blue Peter campaigning style (never mind that, look at this enormous cheese!) would play quite as well. In any case, she knows that any attempt to gain the leadership will involve a damaging byelection against Lee Nelson, Baron von Boobies, The Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (splitting the Tory vote), and some bloke dressed as a giant haggis. The Conservative party now exists largely to misinform the public, to convince voters struggling through austerity that they have the same interests as billionaires and corporations. The leadership may soon be little more than being the friendly face of forcing rape victims to discuss the worst moment of their life with a civil service cashier. Despite a deflating election and aftermath, the Conservatives probably still feel that led by a less dreadful campaigner, and with a less openly suicidal manifesto, they might win a majority. Tragically, as they hold firm at 40% in the polls after one of the most dismal conferences in living memory, they might well be right. • Frankie Boyle is a comedian and writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/21/champions-day-2017-flat-racing-finale-at-ascot-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T15:50:57Z","webTitle":"Cracksman and Frankie Dettori win Champion Stakes in superb style  – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/21/champions-day-2017-flat-racing-finale-at-ascot-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/21/champions-day-2017-flat-racing-finale-at-ascot-live","fields":{"headline":"Cracksman and Frankie Dettori win Champion Stakes in superb style  – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s your lot for Champions Day for another year. Aidan O’Brien started the day as the big possible headline maker but in the end he was upstaged by Cracksman, a simply brilliant winner of the Champion Stakes who will be even better over longer. The anticipation of the Cracksman v Enable match-up next year, in the King George at Ascot or even the Arc at Longchamp, will keep racing fans warm all winter. Watch this space. 1 Lord Glitters (D Tudhope) 3-1 Fav 2 Gm Hopkins (R Havlin) 20-1 3 Dark Red (F Norton) 25-1 4 Accidental Agent (Charles Bishop) 12-1 20 ran Cracksman lived up to the hype with a stunning display in the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot. Plenty was written and said about connections deciding to skip the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe and shunning a clash with John Gosden-trained stablemate Enable, who eventually won in great style. And while the decision to drop back to 10 furlongs did not look sure to suit the son of Frankel, he absolutely blitzed a classy field. Frankel won the race himself in 2010, but even he did not win by seven lengths, as the 13-8 favourite stamped his authority on the contest from some way out in the hands of Frankie Dettori. Taking up the running just before the home straight, Dettori knew there were no stamina issues and he poured it on, with Poet’s Word and Highland Reel giving game chase. Truthfully, they were not in the same league on the day, although third-placed Highland Reel’s effort in conditions he would not have appreciated can be marked up, given Ryan Moore took the longer route under the trees searching for better ground. The race was all about Cracksman, though, and he is already 4-1 with Paddy Power for next year’s Arc. Gosden said: “He’s a very talented horse, Frankie rode him positively and beautifully in the straight. We said to come wide and he has done it well. You can see why I didn’t want him to run [in the Arc] - I don’t know, him and Enable would be fun. There’s not much between them, is there? “It’s great for Frankel to have a Group One winner in Europe, he’s got that wonderful Japanese filly but he’s had a proper Group One here in a race he won himself.” PA 1 Cracksman (L Dettori) 13-8 Fav 2 Poet’s Word (Andrea Atzeni) 7-1 3 Highland Reel (R L Moore) 17-2 10 ran There’s going to be a slight delay as Barney Roy had the wrong saddlecloth number on ... and they’re off ... Success Days takes an early lead ... Highland Reel is second and is taken very wide by Ryan Moore ... Maverick Wave and Cracksman are prominent ... Cracksman comes to the front and kicks clear ... He’s staying on well for a superb victory. That looked a championship performance. Persuasive made sure Frankie Dettori was on the scoresheet on British Champions Day at Ascot as she ran out an impressive winner of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Without a prior win this season, the four-year-old filly was sent off an 8-1 chance to beat the boys and quickened up smartly to win in style. Ribchester, the leading miler in Europe this season, tried to control the race with two furlongs to run, but was there to be shot at in the closing stages. When Dettori got in the clear on John Gosden’s grey she found a change of gear that Ribchester could not live with, eventually scoring by an eased-down length. Churchill was third for Aidan O’Brien, while Nathra, a stablemate of the winner, was fourth. Gosden said: “He was saving and saving, trying to keep her together. He went for a run on the inside and got blocked, so had to take her back and swing out. She’d have been an unlucky loser. When she got out she flew down the middle of the track and Nathra ran a blinder in fourth, they are both off to stud now to be mothers but they’ve gone out in proper style.” Dettori, who performed his trademark flying dismount in the winner’s enclosure, said: “She travelled so well, the ground is so key to her. She has an exceptional turn of foot and put the race to bed very quickly. This very race was my first Group One in 1990 [with Markofdistinction].” PA Another stellar year for John Gosden and Frankie Dettori should be capped off with victory in the feature race on British Champions Day, to be provided by Cracksman (3.50). This robust-looking son of Frankel was on the edge of becoming disappointing in the first half of the year, when beaten by unglamorous rivals in both the Derby and the Irish Derby, but things look rosier now. The turnaround began when he ran away with the Voltigeur, while his French win last month proved he can cope with soft. He has grown up, grown into his frame and looks a strong proposition from a handy draw in stall four. Barney Roy sets a high standard, though his ability seem to have plateaued in his last three runs. Highland Reel might find this ground on the soft side. Latest betting: 2-1 Cracksman, 5-1 Barney Roy, Brametot, 7-1 Poet’s Word, 9-1 Cliffs Of Moher, 14-1 Highland Reel, 20-1 Recoletos, 40-1 Desert Encounter. 1 Persuasive (L Dettori) 8-1 2 Ribchester (W Buick) 2-1 Fav 3 Churchill (R L Moore) 9-2 15 ran And they’re off ... Ribchester and Toscannini away well ... Sir John Lavery prominent ... Ribchester keen in the early stages ... Breton Rock the back marker ... Toscannini leads with Lancaster Bomber very prominent ... Ribchester just in the front ... Lihgtning Spear challenges ... Persuasive finishes best of all to run out a winner for Frankie Dettori. Ribchester was second. Aidan O’Brien drew level with the late Bobby Frankel’s world record of 25 Group/Grade One wins in a year when Hydrangea landed the Qipco British Champion Fillies And Mares Stakes at Ascot. The Galileo filly had beaten dual 1,000 Guineas winner Winter twice already this campaign, but was racing over a mile and a half for the first time. Ryan Moore made a bid for home early, obviously in no doubt about her ability to stay the distance, but the favourite Bateel cruised up alongside her. When asked to go and win the race, though, Bateel simply could not get past Hydrangea and in the final 100 yards the 4-1 shot began to pull away again. Hydrangea eventually won by two lengths, with Coronet back in third. On equalling the record, O’Brien said: “It’s incredible for everyone, they all put in so much hard work, day in day out. We’re a small link in a big chain and I’m delighted for everyone - it’s a magic, special day. The chain is so long and we’re so glad to be a little link in it.” He added of the winner: “She’s by Galileo and they will not stop, their will to win is incredible. She pulled out more and it was Ryan’s idea to run her as he thought there was a chance she’d get the trip. We weren’t sure, but she did.” PA From the Andrew Balding stable that shocked Ribchester in the Sussex, Beat The Bank seems on a strong upward curve and odds of 11-2 underplay his chance. A dirty scope after the Jersey Stakes explains the only blip on his record and he is proven on soft. Here Comes When and Zonderland may also outrun their odds. Latest betting: 9-4 Ribchester, 4-1 Churchill, 9-2 Beat The Bank, 7-1 Al Wukair, 16-1 Thunder Snow, 20-1 Persuasive, 22-1 Here Comes When, 40-1 Lightning Spear. 1 Hydrangea (R L Moore) 4-1 2 Bateel (P C Boudot) 7-4 Fav 3 Coronet (O Peslier) 11-2 10 ran And they’re off ... Alyssa and The Juliet Rose are the early leaders with Journey handy ... Hydrangea is caught out wide in the early stages ... Not much change in the order with Left Hand getting closer ... Journey travels well ... Bateel is waited with ... Hydrangea comes through but Bateel travels to challenge ... Hydrangea gets the trip well and goes on to win with Bateel second. Librisa Breeze downed all the big names to win the British Champions Sprint at Ascot. With Harry Angel sent off favourite to follow up his scintillating Haydock win and Commonwealth Cup winner Caravaggio plus Quiet Reflection and The Tin Man all in the line-up, there was no hiding place. However, they were all left in the wake of Dean Ivory’s speedy grey, who survived a bump a furlong out to win impressively. Adam Kirby adopted more patient tactics on Harry Angel, but he kicked clear with two furlongs to run. But despite coping with heavy ground at Haydock, Harry Angel was soon getting tired and the cavalry began charging. Tasleet attacked on the far side, with Librisa Breeze in the middle of the track as Caravaggio also began to stay on. Owned by Tony Bloom, who is the chairman of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and won the Cesarewiitch last week with Withhold, Librisa Breeze obliged at 10-1 under Robert Winston, beating Tasleet by a length and a quarter. Caravaggio was third. Winston told ITV Racing: “It means a hell of a lot - my career was finished, only for this horse, and that’s being honest. I was packing up last year, I gave my notice to Dean, but this horse and Mr Bloom have kept me going. Dean is a great man to ride for, he has great staff and brilliant owners, including Mr Bloom.” He added of the winner: “He’d get a mile plus, but has so much natural speed and is so genuine. I know I have been criticised a couple of times this year when he should have won, but that’s the way you have to ride him. It doesn’t really matter now, he’s won the big one this year and this was the plan.” PA Since moving to France, Bateel has improved significantly and it is hard to see how Journey can turn around their form from Chantilly last month. Latest betting: 9-4 Bateel, 4-1 Journey, 6-1 Hydrangea, 13-2 Coronet, 14-1 Horseplay, 20-1 The Juliet Rose, Alyssa, 33-1 bar. 1 Librisa Breeze (R Winston) 10-1 2 Tasleet (Jim Crowley) 10-1 3 Caravaggio (R L Moore) 9-2 12 ran Also: 5-4 Fav Harry Angel 4th Non Runner: 7 And they’re off ... Donjuan Troumphant leads ... with Harry Angel close ... Tasleet comes with a late run and so does Librisa Breeze, who gets up close home, to win. Big Orange, the Gold Cup winner, was beaten before the home turn in the Long Distance Cup on ground that he hates, and finished so far behind the winner, Order Of St George, that it is hard to believe a switch to the better ground on the track’s inner course would have made a great deal of difference. The decision to stick to the outer course, and the appearance of “heavy” in the going description on Champions Day for the first time, has prompted some to wonder why the course did not take up the option of switching some or all of the Group One events to the inside course. The answer, according to a track official, it that there is a lot more to it than simply taking a GoingStick reading on both tracks when the conditions are soft and opting for the one that is faster (which would be, in almost every case, the inner course, which does not get watered over the summer). For one thing, it would be a breach of the rules after the 48-hour stage on Thursday morning, and for another, it would annoy as many owners and trainers as it would please. Champions Day is, for better or worse, an autumn race day and everyone needs to campaign and enter their horses on that basis. For every Big Orange, there will be a Bateel, whose chance of adding another Group One to her win in the Prix Vermeille is enhanced by the cut in the ground. If it were unraceable, or close to it, on the outer course and soft on the inner, that would be different. But the contingency is not there - and neither is a rule – which would allow Ascot to race on good ground on the inner track instead of soft on the outer, above all when the forecast is changing by the hour. Order Of St George pulled off an unlikely victory to get up close home in the Qipco Long Distance Cup at Ascot. Aidan O’Brien’s stayer was sent off the 4-5 market leader, but with two furlongs to run he looked beaten back in fourth, hitting a big price on the exchanges as Torcedor kicked clear. Gold Cup hero Big Orange was a spent force a long way out on the testing ground and it was Mount Moriah who led them into the straight, with Torcedor on his shoulder. When Colm O’Donoghue asked the Jessica Harrington-trained Torcedor for maximum effort he looked sure to collect, but in the final 100 yards he was treading water as Ryan Moore got a late lunge out of Order Of St George. John Gosden’s Goodwood Cup winner Stradivarius stayed on for third under Frankie Dettori. Moore told ITV Racing: “I was very happy the whole way round and thought I had the first two covered, but they picked up very well and it didn’t look likely for a long time. But as they came back to him he began to get motivated and at the line he’s won well. He’s an unbelievably good horse, he ran a very good race in the Arc 20 days ago, he’s come here at the end of a long, hard year and looked magnificent. He’s a pleasure to deal with and we’re very lucky to have him.” O’Brien said of his five-year-old, who was fourth to Enable in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe: “He is tough and hardy and Ryan gave him a great ride. He never stops. In every race he has ever run in, he is always finishing. “We saw him in the Gold Cup. He was finishing. Sometimes the line comes too quick, but he doesn’t stop. He has had a busy time. Obviously we are delighted with him. That is him for this year, I imagine.” Harrington said: “He’s run a real cracker, I’m absolutely thrilled. He’s been beaten by a very good horse, it’s as simple as that. He put it up to him and he’s come on again since the summer and I’ve only had him a year, not even a year in training. I’m still learning [about him] and he’ll be back next year.” Gosden said: “He’s run a blinder. It’s not his favourite ground, he has this ability to quicken and you can’t really quicken in that. It was a tremendous race, Order Of St George brings Arc form in here. Jessie’s horse looked like he’d got it. We’re thrilled with him and he’s a better horse on good ground. He stays in training and we look forward to races like the Ascot Gold Cup.” PA There was some disquiet about Cap’n being allowed to run in the opening race, Timeform stating that “he had no business” to be running in a race of Group Two quality first time out. His finishing position won’t have dissuaded them. This was a nice little feature on the trip the horses make from arriving in theior stable box to going out onto the track. After Aidan O’Brien’s winner in the first race, all attention will now turn to whether the trainer can beat Bobby Frankel’s Group One-race winning total for a year. He needs two more to overtake the legendary American handler’s record. Andy Stephens of Racing UK has all the stats you need. The best form on offer is Harry Angel’s demolition job at Haydock last time but it’s asking a lot for a three-year-old to keep producing performances at that level and there is no twang in his odds. Quiet Reflection has had an easier year but looked close to her best in her prep-race in Ireland and should get involved at 7-1. Latest betting: 11-8 Harry Angel, 4-1 Caravaggio, 6-1 Quiet Reflection, 10-1 The Tin Man, 12-1 Librisa Breeze, 16-1 Tasleet, 25-1 Donjuan Triumphant. For those taking notes, looks as if the official description of testing ground is correct given the time Order Of St George clocked in the opening race. 1 Order Of St George (R L Moore) 4-5 Fav 2 Torcedor (C O’Donoghue) 25-1 3 Stradivarius (L Dettori) 4-1 13 ran And they’re off ... Cap’n (having first ever run incredibly) very slow into stride ... but Big Orange leads ... Mount Moriah and Stars Over The Sea are prominent with Order of St George and Dartmouth in midfield ... Stars Over The Sea has lost his position ... Order Of St George has made nice progress ... Big Orange goes backwards ... as they turn for home ... Mount Moriah leads with Order Of St George back in third ... Torcedor takes the lead ... Order Of St George fights back in the final half furlong to win. HM is at the track today and might be considered that Dartmouth is getting a bit warm in the paddock apparently ... Order Of St George gets his ground but has had another long year and short odds do not appeal in a hot race. Big Orange and Stradivarius might both prefer a drier surface, so a chance is taken on the improving Desert Skyline, who stormed home in the Doncaster Cup last time. Latest betting: 5-6 Order Of St George, 9-2 Stradivarius, 10-1 Big Orange, Desert Skyline, 12-1 Duretto, 20-1 Dartmouth, 25-1 bar. ITV have started their Champions Day coverage. There is a lot to like about the new channel’s racing programmes and no one has more respect than me for AP McCoy, but I don’t understand why the multiple champion jumps jockey is used for Flat meetings, as he is again today. Why not have Johnny Murtagh for the meetings on the levels and McCoy for the steeplechasing? The ex-jockeys are there to give their insight on riding the tracks and their experience in racing against their fellow pilots. McCoy doesn’t have any with regards to Flat racing and racing around Ascot’s unique track. There’s a very nice little item on page 38 of today’s Times newspaper about Countdown, featuring the sort of word the Thunderer doesn’t normally have in its pages. In other news, Carol Vorderman has arrived. She’s getting plenty of comments. Talking of the Long Distance Cup, it appears the French are not amused at the race being scheduled a day before their stayers’ contest, the Prix Royal Oak tomorrow. For Long Distance Cup read Brexit Cup! Big news ... Big Orange runs ... the most popular horse in training will get his chance to race in the Long Distance Cup despite the soft ground as Rupert Bell, brother of trainer Michael, has just revealed on Twitter. Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, or in other words the man who tells us what it’s like out on the track, has been telling Mike Cattermole about conditions at Ascot. How soft the ground is and how windy and in what direction Storm Brian is blowing in are all-important. Here are Stickels’ words of wisdom: “We have now had about 17mm of rain this week, following three millimetres of rain overnight, with a further two millimetres up until midday. This month we’ve only had about 19mm, so it’s quite surprising that most of it has fallen this week. The majority of the rain, around 14 millimetres, has fallen since the declaration stage. “When I first walked it this morning at 6am, the going was soft and after walking it again, I have made a small adjustment to the going description on the round course. It is quite wet underfoot because we have had that rain this morning.” Regarding the forecast for the rest of the day, Stickels continued: “There is the risk of blustery showers throughout the day and we have had a couple of heavy showers this morning that I wasn’t really expecting. We are expecting it to get quite windy. In fact, I expected it to be windier already, but the wind will pick up and the gusts are expected to reach up to 45mph. The wind will come from behind the grandstand and will be blowing down the track, so it will affect the runners. “There will be a bit of a headwind as they turn in and as they are coming up the straight, so it will be fairly testing and tiring for them. The best of the ground on the straight course will be middle to far side and I would imagine that they would stay in that area.” A JustGiving crowdfunding page has been set up to suport the family of Ken Dooley, the stable lad who was tragically killed after being struck by a horse at Kempton Park on Saturday 14th October. Ken, who was in his 50s, reportedly died after being kicked in the head by a horse. He had worked in the stable yard for seven years. So far more than £1,300 has been donated.

Hello and welcome to our Champions Day coverage. Greg Wood will be reporting live from Ascot and I’ll be guiding you through the day’s action with the help of Chris Cook’s expert tipping. Remember Brian and Ben? They were the mythical racegoers dreamed up by a team of marketing executives back in 2009, when the sport was in the throes of a relaunch which ultimately led to the creation of Champions Day at Ascot to cater for a new breed of fan. Brian was described as “traditional”, “British” and someone who “thinks in quite an old-minded way”. Ben was “younger-minded than Brian, more wordly, in touch with a new generation but the nice bit about him is that he can talk to your grandmother”. There will be plenty of Bens in attendance at Ascot this afternoon, but the bad news for the organisers is that this year, Brian is coming too. The going was already soft when rain arrived at the track just before 10.30, and while the latest forecasts suggest that it will ease off into occasional showers well before the opening race at 1.25, many racegoers could be spending almost as much time looking at the sky as they are at the horses. Whatever happens, this year’s Champions Day is going to be another muddy one, like three of the first six, and a sharp contrast to the Royal meeting here in June, when the meeting opened on quick ground in sweltering heat. This will be the fifth time that there has been “soft” in the going description somewhere, and is potentially the first when the ground will be heavy, at least in places. The idea that the “champions” of a summer sport can regularly be anointed on testing ground when both horse and rider are covered in mud still seems very odd to me, but the mid-October date is apparently now set in stone, so we will have to get used to it. So will the cast that has assembled for today’s card, which has as much strength in depth as any Champions Day meeting to date. It is a real pity that the opening stayers’ race, which includes a rematch of a brilliant Gold Cup in June when Big Orange edged out Order Of St George, will not be run on the good ground or better that would give Big Orange a real chance to show his best form, while Highland Reel, another winner at the Royal meeting, would also be a lot shorter than 14-1 for the Champion Stakes on good-to-firm going. Other big names, though, including Ribchester, the favourite for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Cracksman, the market leader for the Champion, do have form on soft going and should run to form if the conditions do not deteriorate dramatically. Britain’s champion trainer and jockey will also be awarded their trophies today, though both title races were effectively over months ago. Aidan O’Brien, who missed out in the Caulfield Cup in Australia this morning and still needs two more Group One wins to beat Bobby Frankel’s world record of 25, will feature a lot more prominently on the card than Silvestre de Sousa, the champion jockey for the second time in three years, who has just a single ride, in the opening Group Two race. There is still just one non-runner – Tupi, in the 2.00 – and an update on the going is expected shortly after Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, walked the entire track at 10.30."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/20/liz-diller-rebel-architect-moma-high-line-simon-rattle-centre-for-music","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T11:42:31Z","webTitle":"Meet Liz Diller, the rebel architect behind MoMA, the High Line and now a home for Simon Rattle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/liz-diller-rebel-architect-moma-high-line-simon-rattle-centre-for-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/liz-diller-rebel-architect-moma-high-line-simon-rattle-centre-for-music","fields":{"headline":"Meet Liz Diller, the rebel architect behind MoMA, the High Line and now a home for Simon Rattle","bodyText":"‘We’ve never stopped being rebellious,” says Liz Diller, founding partner of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the New York architects who have just been selected to design London’s new concert hall, the £250m Centre for Music. “But now we are operating in a stealthier way. Rather than trying to kick the establishment walls down, we’re walking in through the front door.” To reach the hallowed entrance of London’s cultural establishment, they skipped past fellow competitors Norman Foster, Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano and a host of other ageing purveyors of big‑budget arts buildings – an unadventurous shortlist, on which the Americans clearly stood out as the most interesting thinkers of the bunch. This will be their first project in the UK, and the stakes are high for the self-styled provocateurs. Most famous for their transformation of a redundant Manhattan railway line into the High Line park, which now attracts eight million visitors a year, DS+R are almost accidental architects. They have recently completed a string of major arts buildings, from the faceted coral rock of the Broad Art Museum in Los Angeles, to the silvery cyclopean slug of the Berkeley Art Museum and the Pacific Film Archive, but for the first two decades of their practice they barely built anything at all. “I never thought I was going to be an architect in the conventional sense,” says Diller, 63, who met her then tutor Ricardo Scofidio, now 82, while studying at the Cooper Union in New York in the 1970s. They started working together on self-initiated installation projects – part of a New York scene that was fizzing with the likes of Trisha Brown and Vito Acconci, Steve Reich and Gordon Matta-Clark – and their sense of mischief soon caught the eyes of curators. They were invited to make something for the project space at the Museum of Modern Art, and took the opportunity to critique the power of the institution, fitting out the room with surveillance cameras and screens to monitor visitors’ behaviour. Twenty-five years later, having been elevated from rebels to royalty in the interim, they unveiled a $450m masterplan to transform the very same museum, only to be met with furious opposition. Their expansion project was accused by artists and museum-goers of representing the “death knell” of MoMA, seen as the greedy institution selling out to commercial interests and trampling one of its neighbours, the beloved American Folk Art Museum, in the process. “I think it was a kind of lightning rod for so many anxieties about the power of MoMA,” Diller said in a 2015 interview. “The expansionist mentality. The previous renovations that people may not have been happy with.” The venom seems to have subsided for now: the first phase of the renovation project opened earlier this year to general approval, their surgical interventions seen to be fixing some of the practical flaws of the rambling warren. DS+R’s shift from fringe radicals to powerful players in New York’s cultural scene hasn’t been an easy one. The High Line has also been subjected to a backlash in recent years, mainly due to its phenomenal success. While the project began as a bottom-up activist initiative, it has been identified as the culprit for the super-gentrification of the surrounding Meatpacking District, spawning a cluster of luxury real-estate towers along its green fringes. It has become the template for countless mayors around the world looking to drive up land values in their cities with a little green garnish. “The High Line is pushing people out,” says Diller, frankly, speaking from her office nearby. “And it will soon drive us out of the area too.” She is rueful about the consequences, but says she wouldn’t have done anything differently. “There’s no way that anyone could have predicted how successful it was going to be. You don’t want to do unsuccessful projects, but success breeds speculation and development. It’s a weird cycle. You can only jump in there and try and do the best thing at that moment in time.” As for their concert hall credentials, the architects have proved themselves in the performing arts arena and won plaudits from New York’s concert-going class for their decade-long work on the Lincoln Center. “We strongly felt that it had to be turned inside-out to make good on the ‘publicness’ of its public spaces, to attract new audiences,” says Diller. “Today’s cultural institutions have to do much more than house art or music. They have to play a social and educational role in the community and engage everyone with or without a ticket to a performance.” It is a theme they are exploring to extremes in their latest project, The Shed, a $500m centre for the performing arts, designed in collaboration with Rockwell Group and currently under construction at the northern end of the High Line. Looking something like a transparent Chanel handbag on wheels, it will house a vast transformable performance space, with a big open piazza able to be covered by the extension of the movable outer shell, clad with an inflatable skin of quilted pneumatic cushions. “Both The Shed and London’s Centre for Music are 21st-century institutions that force the question, ‘What are artists going to be doing in the next 15 years, 30 years, and beyond?’” says Diller. “The answer is simply, ‘We do not know.’ Our response for The Shed was to make an architecture of infrastructure with enough variable space, loading capacity and electrical power to support any use.” The main challenge will be to make sure it doesn’t feel like a corporate events hall, given that the space will be regularly rented out for fashion shows, product launches and other commercial bonanzas, to help subsidise the artistic programme. Some have scoffed that it is merely a cultural bauble to decorate Hudson Yards, the biggest private real estate development in US history, and it is unfortunate that the Shed will now be plugged in to the base of a 70-storey tower of luxury apartments, also designed by DS+R. “It’s our deal with the devil,” says Diller. “It allows us to get an extra 10 storeys of back-of-house space. We never imagined in a million years that we would be doing a commercial tower. But we like to do everything once.” The architects land in London on equally rocky ground. Many have questioned the need for the project, which is to be shoehorned on to a tricky roundabout site in the City, currently occupied by the Museum of London. The entire argument for the building, which will be home to the London Symphony Orchestra under the leadership of Sir Simon Rattle, rests on the claim that the acoustics of the Barbican and Royal Festival Hall are not good enough, as Rattle has bewailed. To justify its existence, DS+R’s auditorium will have to sound pitch-perfect to even the most supersonic ears. When UK arts funding is so unbalanced – with a 2014 report finding that Arts Council spending amounted to £68.99 per head of population in London and £4.58 in the rest of England – critics have questioned if this is something the capital really needs. The government withdrew funding last year, so a private fundraising plan is now under way, for which DS+R’s design will have to serve as the crucial bait. Whatever the outcome, with Diller at the helm, it is likely to confound all expectations of what a concert hall might be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/18/university-interview-tips-confidence-wont-make-up-for-flannel","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T10:45:21Z","webTitle":"University interview tips: 'confidence won't make up for flannel'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/18/university-interview-tips-confidence-wont-make-up-for-flannel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/18/university-interview-tips-confidence-wont-make-up-for-flannel","fields":{"headline":"University interview tips: 'confidence won't make up for flannel'","bodyText":"Interviews are a chance for university applicants to ask questions about the course, meet the academic team and show they deserve a place. They might also be a time to say “um, like” six times every sentence, develop a muscle twitch and get hit by a crippling cough. To demystify its interview process and soothe students’ nerves, Oxford University last week released its annual sample questions and – crucially – the answers to them. But besides knowing what questions might come up, what else can you do to prepare? And how does this differ at other universities? We spoke to interviewers to find out more. Don’t stick to a script Everyone has a favourite topic to talk about, but trying to reel off a party-piece is a bad idea. “We’ll stop any such attempt and remind them of the question we had asked, not the question they wished we had asked,” says Steve Watts, admissions tutor at Homerton College, Cambridge. “Any sense we have that the applicant is well rehearsed rather than thinking for themselves will lead to a move to the less familiar.” Dr Helen Swift, tutorial fellow in medieval French at Oxford, agrees, adding it’s not like an X Factor audition; interviews are conversations. Applicants should make sure they’re listening carefully to the question. “Even when your heart is pounding, answer as precisely as possible, don’t just pick up on keywords,” she says. Students need to pause to think. “Even though silence can be daunting, allow yourself time to process your thoughts.” Interviews also aren’t quizzes with marks for right answers. “Don’t try and bluff your way, and hope that confidence will make up for flannel. The interviewer is an expert in the subject who wants the applicant to show off what they know and how well they think; not deliberately bamboozle them,” says Watts. However, Julie Tucker from the applicant services team at Falmouth University, which interviews all prospective students, says isn’t necessarily a bad thing to have some talking points prepared – it can help with focus when the nerves are kicking in. Think beyond stock questions Most interviews won’t have trick questions and you can think about your answers beforehand. For medicine, questions are set by the Medical School Council, which are often predictable: Why do you want to be a doctor? What are your interests and hobbies and how does this relate to being a doctor? Discuss a medical issue – and so on. That said, Simon Atkinson, who interviews medicine, veterinary and dentistry students at Bristol, says you need think beyond the stock questions. He advises being able to talk about your hobbies and work experience and how this relates to being a doctor – whether it’s a part-time job at Tesco, planning the family holiday or clinical work experience. “You’re applying for a job. The interviewers are asking themselves, would this person make a good doctor or dentist? It would be strange if someone hadn’t prepared for a medicine interview, but I think preparing answer by rote is a bad idea. It’s obvious which candidates have done that and you don’t come across as genuine.” Practice on anyone who’ll listen Spend time reacquainting yourself with your personal statement or doing further reading. Atkinson advises taking notes and talking them through with friends and family. He says that the better you can get at talking to adults you’ve never met before, the better off you’ll be. “You could record yourself and listen back or even talk to the cat,” Swift adds. Look beyond the syllabus Interviewers are looking for people who love their subject. Languages courses, for instance, include the study of literature and culture and so Swift says Oxford wants students who are keen on this too. “We’re not looking for particular experience, but motivation. People who have read a bit off their own back and are interested in thinking about and discussing what they’ve read, such as listening to podcasts, reading articles and thinking about films they’ve watched.” Atkinson agrees. “It’s very hard to say no to someone who is absolutely passionate. If they live and breathe it, that’s really hard to turn down.” You don’t have to be slick Don’t imagine people like you never get a place, because somebody does. Professional programmes are looking for people with a high degree of integrity. “The kind of people who could treat your mother,” says Atkinson. “You don’t want someone who is glib, or says something someone wants them to say. You want them to be true and that comes across even in nervous candidates. It isn’t always about slickness.” If you’re feeling especially nervous, there are some things you can do to keep your thoughts on track. “Don’t talk for longer than 45 seconds,” says Atkinson. “Lead the interviewer into asking about the things you want to talk about by letting them ask more. Avoid telling them everything at once.” Know when to ask questions At the end of the interview, you might be asked: “Have you got any questions for us?” A perfectly acceptable answer is – no. Don’t bother asking about what’s in the course, Watts says, because that might appear a bit daft. You’ve hopefully applied because of, well, what’s in the course. However, questions that emerge from the discussion can be sensible. Tucker says these should reflect your interest in the subject and show you’ve done some research already. “Questions can reinforce an applicant’s suitability, and it gives them an opportunity to get to the heart of any academic issues they’re not sure about.” It’s not your only chance to impress Applicants should remember that interviews are just one part of the admissions process. “We look keenly at everything sent in from previous results to the school reference,” says Watts. “These will form just as important a part in our judgement as the interview does.” And, if things don’t go your way, well, you can always reapply next year. “Loads of people get into medical school second time round,” says Atkinson. “It’s not the be all and end all.” Follow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.

Downing Street suggests their meeting is nothing out of the ordinary. The cast list and timing suggest otherwise. Theresa May The hope among business leaders is that the prime minister is playing a game of bluff. By talking up the prospect of walking away with no deal, May is seen as playing the only card she has left: cut me some slack or we all lose. The trouble is that her dinner party hosts in Brussels are not the only ones who need convincing. As well as watching her back in London, May has also been negotiating by phone with Berlin and Paris to convince other national leaders that she really has no alternative. Until they give the nod, there is no room for anyone to climb down from the ledge. Jean-Claude Juncker There may be a surprising amount of sympathy for the British predicament from the commission president and his team. Unlike their last, chilly, meeting in London, the Brits are no longer pretending there is not a problem. Officials in Brussels would also like to cut a deal so they can prove it is the commission, not member states, that really calls the shots. Whether Juncker has the temperament to act as a go-between is another matter. His last few public utterances – “Now they have to pay” – suggest it will all come down to money. David Davis The Brexit secretary arrives in Brussels with a mixed agenda. On the one hand, his failure to make progress during regular negotiating sessions is the reason his boss has had to step in over his head. He will be looking for political cover to end what has been a thankless deadlock. Yet Davis also represents the Brexit wing of a Tory party that will be first to pounce on May if she gives away too much in pursuit of progress. The pound rose on Monday as expectations grew that the PM will offer more money to unlock talks, but she’ll need to keep one eye on her ambitious Brexit secretary if she does. Michel Barnier The EU chief negotiator has also been striking an increasingly chilly pose in public but, like his boss in the commission, he has a personal incentive to make the process work – not least a rumoured ambition to one day step into the top Brussels job. So far, a narrow negotiating remit has given him something to hide behind when the Brits attempt to play hardball. After weeks of fruitless talking, it must now be tempting to at least try to discuss a trade and transition deal alongside the tedious process of opening the British cheque book. Oliver Robbins Whitehall’s top Brexit civil servant joins May and Davis as a symbol of the tussle between them, recently moving from the Department for Exiting the EU back to the Cabinet Office. Though he works directly for the PM, Robbins also brings the perspective of Whitehall and the Treasury into the room. Like many civil servants, he is thought to be alarmed at the extent to which the talks process has become politicised. His job is to present any climbdown as a more routine diplomatic manoeuver. Martin Selmayr Arguably, the most powerful man in the room is the one with the least impressive job title. As Juncker’s chief of staff, this German lawyer is technically an official with a firm grip on the detail. In practice, he is seen as wielding significant political power not just in Brussels but also as a trusted intermediary with Berlin. Rumoured to be the source of unflattering leaks in the German press from the last time this cast of characters met for dinner in London, the “Beast of Berlaymont” may be on his best behaviour this time, but Selmayr will be the one to work on if the Brits have any hope of persuading Angela Merkel to unlock the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/16/al-michaels-harvey-weinstein-comments-sunday-night-football-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T12:51:44Z","webTitle":"Top NFL commentator sorry for comparing New York Giants' form to Weinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/16/al-michaels-harvey-weinstein-comments-sunday-night-football-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/16/al-michaels-harvey-weinstein-comments-sunday-night-football-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Top NFL commentator sorry for comparing New York Giants' form to Weinstein","bodyText":"Al Michaels, one of America’s most respected sports commentators, has apologised after jokingly comparing the New York Giants’ problems to those of the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse. Michaels made the comments during NBC’s Sunday Night Football, which regularly draws audiences in excess of 25 million. Referring to the Giants poor start to the season – they had not won a game before Sunday – Michaels said: “And let’s face it: the Giants are coming off a worse week than Harvey Weinstein, and they’re up by 14 points!” His co-commentator, Cris Collinsworth added: “only my LA guy comes up with that one.” Michaels was widely criticised on social media for his comments, and later in the broadcast apologised. “Sorry I made a reference earlier ... I was trying to be a little flip about somebody obviously very much in the news all over the country and it was not meant in that manner. So, my apologies, and we’ll just leave it at that.” The 72-year-old is not the first media figure forced to apologise for comments about Weinstein. The British TV presenter James Corden said sorry after joking about Weinstein at a charity event in Los Angeles, while Woody Allen clarified comments about the producer after saying he felt “sad” for him. Michaels has been a nationally recognised figure in the US for 40 years, winning five Emmys for his work. He has covered multiple World Series, Super Bowls and Olympics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-jean-claude-juncker-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T11:08:02Z","webTitle":"Only Theresa can clean up the mess left by her Brexit Marx brothers | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-jean-claude-juncker-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/theresa-may-brexit-jean-claude-juncker-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Only Theresa can clean up the mess left by her Brexit Marx brothers","bodyText":"Wanted: a siren and flashing blue light for the prime minister. We know from her conference speech that she sometimes goes unprepared. Today the paraphernalia of the emergency services would come in handy. Theresa May is now off to Brussels for dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, and the hope is that this time he will give her the time of day, for no one could bear another of those European events where our prime minister loiters alone while the other leaders glad-hand – Theresa no mates. The hope is that she’ll fare better than the last time she dined privately with Juncker. Soon afterwards – to her complete detriment – his people leaked the whole thing. Her officials say the meeting has been long planned. But that’s strange because when the other day Juncker detailed his forthcoming engagements, a tete a tete with May wasn’t mentioned. Three possibilities present themselves. Either he needs a new diary secretary, or the meeting comes so low on his list of priorities that it didn’t merit listing. And then there is the most likely explanation given how the Brexit process has gone so far: that Theresa’s people are telling porkies. So off she goes, the Red Adair of Brexit, hoping, we must hope, that she can avert the disaster so far conjured up by Davis, Fox and Johnson, the Marx brothers of her government. If that’s true, we must wish her well. Because the time has surely come for the nearest thing the government has to a grownup to take things in hand. Last week, more than any other since the vote itself, catastrophe became a real possibility as the Brexiters and their water carriers in the press launched their grooming process to make crashing out of the EU, with no deal and no safety net of any sort, the preferred option. We know that for most, this is a response to the fact that talks aren’t going well and that – as the UK was warned would be the case – EU leaders refuse to see themselves as supplicants. They may prefer a deal with us over no deal, but not at any price. They have their own priorities, not least the continuation of the EU itself, and their own domestic politics. If May, somewhere between the main course and the port, communicates a willingness to have a proper conversation rather than the infantile game of chicken being played by the Marx brothers, her trip will have been worthwhile. She will, no doubt, stick to the line that the people have spoken, that we are leaving and that’s an end to it, but she can – she should – say that the talks are being held on Earth rather than in Narnia, that everything else not mandated by the vote is flexible. She may feel the threat of hard Brexit will concentrate minds on the continent, and in the manner of sympathy it may do so. But that’s a perilous strategy. All she would be saying is that Britain will detonate itself and Europe will be covered in splatter. As it would. But Europe would soon scrape it off. This is a moment. If hard Brexit – deified again this morning on the Today programme by John Redwood (the Marx brother no one knew or cared about) – solidifies as the default position, all is lost. We will have been bullied, nagged, bamboozled into a position that some desired but no one can claim to have voted for in the idiotic yes/no ballot. It is a moment for all who view a cliff edge as sane folk normally do to throw their weight behind a sensible Brexit. The Brexit-at-any-cost contingent know that too. That’s why Redwood today characterised any drift as a soft Brexit, as a drift towards Labour that no Conservative could countenance. Theresa May has her part to play, but so too does parliament. The majority of the Commons know what a sensible Brexit looks like. Now is the time to fight for it, accepting all the while that the whole thing might yet fall apart, making a rethink a necessity. The siren and the blue light should be flashing there too. • Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/storm-ophelia-irish-leader-urges-citizens-to-stay-indoors-during-national-emergency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T07:35:06Z","webTitle":"Three die as Storm Ophelia batters Ireland and Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/storm-ophelia-irish-leader-urges-citizens-to-stay-indoors-during-national-emergency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/storm-ophelia-irish-leader-urges-citizens-to-stay-indoors-during-national-emergency","fields":{"headline":"Three die as Storm Ophelia batters Ireland and Britain","bodyText":"Storm Ophelia is expected to cause further disruption in Great Britain today after three people died in hurricane-force winds and hundreds of thousands were left without power. Scotland is braced for gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h) and flood warnings are in place on its west coast as the remnants of the hurricane batter the British Isles. A yellow weather warning for wind covering Northern Ireland, southern and central Scotland, the north of England and north west Wales is in place until Tuesday afternoon. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said commuters should expect “very gusty conditions”, with winds of up to 70mph. “The strong winds will continue but should moderate a little bit compared to what we have seen.” Ireland experienced the worst of the weather on Monday, with winds of almost 100mph damaging electricity networks and causing widespread disruption. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, described Ophelia’s impact as a “national emergency” that forced the closure of schools and colleges and brought the transport network to a standstill on Monday. He said it was the worst storm in Ireland in 50 years and appealed to people to stay indoors. The chairman of Ireland’s national emergency coordination group, Sean Hogan, said: “These gusts are life-threatening. Do not be out there.” Details emerged on Monday night about the three people killed during the storm over Ireland. The first victim was 58-year-old Clare O’Neill, who died after the car she was driving in Co Waterford was struck by a tree around 11.40am. She had been due to celebrate her 59th birthday on Tuesday. Her mother, who is in her 70s, was sitting in the passenger seat and suffered non-life threatening injuries in the accident. O’Neill had worked as an oncology nurse for more than three decades. At around 12.30pm on Monday Michael Pyke, 31, was attempting to clear a fallen tree with a chainsaw near Cahir in Co Tipperary. Another tree collapsed on him and he fell onto the chainsaw, police said. Fintan Goss, the third victim, was killed when his car was struck by a tree in the Ravensdale area north of Dundalk in Co Louth. The married father of three, who was in his 30s, had been travelling home early from work due to the storm when the accident occurred. A local councillor, John McGahon, said Goss and his family are “extremely well regarded” in the community. Referring to Hurricane Debbie in 1961, Varadkar said: “The last time we had a storm this severe, 11 lives were lost, so safety is our number one priority.” Ahead of her trip to Brussels for dinner with EU leaders on Monday night, Theresa May telephoned the taoiseach to offer her sympathy for the deaths caused by the storm. “On Storm Ophelia, the prime minister expressed her sympathies for the loss of life and said the UK government stood ready to provide any support if requested,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. The storm also prevented Bill Clinton from visiting Belfast for a crucial round of talks with local politicians. The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, speaking from his native Cork, one of the worst-affected parts of the country, said: “This is a weather event the likes of which we have never seen before.” Coveney said the government was briefed that the strong winds would whip up waves on the Irish coastline up to 40ft (12 metres) high and in some cases “taller than a double-decker bus”. As Ophelia struck land at about 10am, there were outages due to felled power lines in the south and south-west of the country. Power cuts continued throughout the day and by mid-afternoon, 360,000 customers were without electricity. The Irish Republic’s Electricity Supply Board warned of further outages throughout the night. More than 140 flights from Irish airports were cancelled and by 10am, all Dublin Bus routes in the capital were shut down. The city’s Luas tram system was also closed over safety fears. Every creche, school, third-level college and university in Ireland was closed. Ireland’s education minister, Richard Bruton, announced that all schools and colleges would remain closed on Tuesday. Later, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said all its schools would also not open on Tuesday. Those caught up in the storm on Ireland’s western seaboard described violent winds pounding the coastline. Kathryn Johnston drove 260 miles on Monday from Ballymena in Northern Ireland to Galway in Ireland for her daughter Alice’s graduation. However, the National University of Ireland Galway shut due to the storm and the graduation ceremony was cancelled. Johnston and her daughter were staying at the Jurys Inn hotel close to the river Corrib in the city. With the front entrance to the hotel blocked with sandbags by the afternoon to prevent flooding, Johnston said even birds were “being blown away” in the sky by the violent winds over Galway Bay. When going through the automatic doors of the hotel, “a blast of wind and rain just hits you in the face full on”, she said. Meanwhile, passengers on Aer Lingus flight EI483 from Lisbon to Dublin praised the skill of an Irish pilot who guided their plane safely into land in the middle of the storm. Paulo Nunes Santos contacted the Guardian from the plane after it landed in Dublin. Santos, who is originally from Portugal but has lived in Dublin for 15 years, said: “I’ve been in hundreds, if not thousands of flights, but never experienced this level of turbulence. “We only started feeling it more or less as we started approaching via Cork. The pilot was great. The plane shook like mad and the approach to the runway was the worst I have experienced. “But the pilot, she was brilliant. Oddly, there was no panic among the passengers. Everyone clapped and applauded the pilot, we were told her name is Niamh Jennings. You could feel the huge sense of relief in the plane.” By mid-afternoon, Ophelia was hammering Northern Ireland with winds of up to 80mph. By 4.45pm, about 18,000 homes in Northern Ireland were without power due to falling trees knocking down power lines. A tree had also fallen on to the railway line at Lambeg, outside Belfast, disrupting one of the busiest rail links in the region. Roads in Belfast were closed due to flying debris and the newest bridge over the Foyle river in Derry was also shut. Clinton was due to meet political parties represented in Stormont to urge them to find a deal to restore the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. There had been hopes that the former US president could have held talks with the parties on Tuesday, but plans for this were later cancelled. The Stormont parliament building suffered in the storm. The home of the Northern Ireland assembly, which has not functioned for 10 months due to the breakdown of power sharing, suffered an electrical outage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/16/man-booker-prize-2017-ali-smith-leads-sales-george-saunders-ahead-at-bookies","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T12:31:11Z","webTitle":"Man Booker prize 2017: Ali Smith leads sales, George Saunders ahead at bookies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/16/man-booker-prize-2017-ali-smith-leads-sales-george-saunders-ahead-at-bookies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/16/man-booker-prize-2017-ali-smith-leads-sales-george-saunders-ahead-at-bookies","fields":{"headline":"Man Booker prize 2017: Ali Smith leads sales, George Saunders ahead at bookies","bodyText":"Ali Smith is outselling the US writers on the Man Booker prize shortlist with just one day left before the winner is announced – but American author George Saunders remains the favourite at the bookmakers. According book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, Smith’s novel Autumn is the commercial winner so far among the six titles shortlisted for the UK’s most prestigious prize for fiction with almost 50,000 copies sold. From the US, Paul Auster’s 4321 comes in second with nearly 15,000 sales. Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, debut British novelist Fiona Mozley’s Elmet, and British/Pakistani Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West have all sold about 10,000 copies each. History of Wolves, by the American first-timer Emily Fridlund, has sold the least, with a figure of 3,410 copies. A different measure of success is seen at Ladbrokes, however, with the bookmaker making Saunders its 6/4 favourite to take the £50,000 prize for his novel about Abraham Lincoln’s visits to his son’s grave. Coming in next are Hamid at 7/2 and Mozley at 4/1, with Auster and Smith both at 8/1 and Fridlund the 10/1 outsider. Acknowledging that Ladbrokes’ favourite has won the Booker only once in the last five years, the firm’s Jessica Bridge said: “The shortlist is still somewhat surprising, and punters’ money is pointing towards a victory for Saunders.” At Waterstones, fiction buyer Chris White said that sales of the shortlist had been steady. “They are slightly down overall compared with last year, but both Paul Auster’s 4321 and Fiona Mozley’s Elmet are proving extremely popular, and Autumn by Ali Smith, is in our top 10,” said White. All of the shortlisted titles are dwarfed by sales of two titles that failed to make the move from longlist to shortlist, however: Zadie Smith’s Swing Time and Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad have both sold more than 100,000 copies to date. The winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night. The award was opened to American writers in 2014, and was won for the first time by a US author last year, when Paul Beatty took the prize with The Sellout. Three American writers, Fridlund, Auster and Saunders, are in contention for this year’s prize, prompting questions about its Americanisation. In response, the chair of judges, Baroness Lola Young, said: “Nationality is not an issue in terms of how we decide on a winner – it’s what is in our opinion the best book in these six. “All we can say is that we judge the books submitted to us, and make our judgment not based on nationality or gender, but what is written on the pages,” she told a press conference to announce the shortlist last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/02/why-university-is-the-place-to-find-your-cause","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-02T11:59:35Z","webTitle":"Why university is the place to find your cause","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/02/why-university-is-the-place-to-find-your-cause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/02/why-university-is-the-place-to-find-your-cause","fields":{"headline":"Why university is the place to find your cause","bodyText":"Freshers’ week is a hazy memory, and students are getting stuck into their studies. But university life needn’t become as routine as lecture, library, halls, club, repeat. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved with activities outside of your course, where many students discover their calling . One reason to volunteer or get involved in philanthropic activities alongside your degree – whether political, charitable or environmental – is that it looks great on your CV. More than 70% of employers believe those who volunteer have a better chance of earning a high salary and gaining promotion. “When you’re looking for work you need to have more on your CV than academic achievements. Volunteering can enhance your job prospects,” says Chris Rea, higher education services manager at Prospects. “It’s an opportunity for students to develop those skills employers look for, such as teamwork, communication and problem solving.” This was the case for Prishita Maheshwari-Aplin, when she volunteered for an education programme in Tanzania last summer through the Cambridge Development Initiative: “It wasn’t just the hard skills. I became better at conducting meetings and presenting, and developed my writing and communication,” she says. Your studies could benefit, too. “It helped me to keep things in context,” says Jack Wakefield, who joined Just Love, a Christian social justice group, while studying Theology at Oxford University. In his second year, Jack helped deliver a project focused on climate change. “It was really easy to stress about essay deadlines but when you’re part of a group that is passionate about global poverty and living sustainably, it’s easy to see that it’s not the end of the world.” And student campaigning can lead to real change. As a member of the Amnesty International society, James Ingram campaigned for the introduction of refugee scholarships at the University of Bath. They held protests on campus, raised £6,500 as a contribution from students, and worked with the students’ union to develop a policy proposal, which the university accepted last year. The three scholars will start in September 2018 and will have bursaries, tuition fee waivers, and their living costs covered. One of the easiest ways to figure out how to figure out what cause is for you is to attend a freshers’ or volunteering fair. “T here’s usually an organisation for whatever you care about,” says Dave Coles, volunteer centre manager at the London School of Economics. “Think about what makes you frustrated about society or if there is something on the news or in your local community that you’d like to help change.” Try speaking to charities that are working in that area to see what opportunities they have. And think about what skills and talents you can offer different organisations . Arts students might help a charity with design work, for example, or those taking languages might volunteer to teach in local schools or community groups. Ideally, your decision to volunteer won’t only be about what you can gain – but the main thing is to get involved. “Some people may be concerned that they need to have a certain level of knowledge, but that’s not the case,” says Ingram. “ There’ll be something there for you if you’re passionate about it.” Need inspiration? One of the most popular charity challenges among students is Jailbreak. You have 36 hours to travel as far away from your campus as possible without spending your own money. Get sponsored, go. Organisations such as GoodGym or Green gym make working out more worthwhile, putting your exertions to good use in the local community. For conscientious creative types who prefer a more artistic kind of protest,“craftivism” could be your ideal new hobby. Becoming a guerrilla gardener could help you meet new people off campus while you spruce up a local concrete eyesore. If you’d prefer not to leave your bed, you could try events like Blog Action Day and write for a good cause.

Hyde, who sit seventh in the Evo-Stik North table, beat Scarborough on Sunday to earn a place in the draw and earn the chance to welcome one of the round’s bigger names to Ewen Fields. Club chairman Steve Hartley said: “We couldn’t ask for more than a home game and against a big club, it’s absolutely perfect for us. These guys deserve it, it’s the best team this club has had in a long, long time.” Ossett Town, who lie 15th in the same league as Hyde, face a replay with Solihull Moors, with a home tie against Wycombe awaiting the victors. Heybridge Swifts, the third and final team from the eighth tier, were the last team to be drawn and were given an away game at League Two high-flyers Exeter. Swifts, who ply their trade in Isthmian League Division One, defeated Haringey Borough 4-2 in the previous round. National League outfit Sutton, who last season made a thrilling run to the final 16 before being deposed by Arsenal, head to Cambridge. Lincoln went one better than that, becoming the first non-league side to reach the quarter-finals in more than 100 years before they too fell foul of the Gunners, who lifted the cup at Wembley. The Imps went on to win promotion to League Two and will kick off their competition at AFC Wimbledon this year. Shaw Lane, in their first ever first-round appearance, welcome Steve Evans’ Mansfield and Truro, Cornwall’s first representative at this stage since 1969, head for Charlton. Wigan, the 2013 cup winners and highest-ranked side in the hat as League One leaders, host Harry Kewell’s Crawley, with six-time winners Blackburn facing Barnet at Ewood Park.

There are three teams from the eighth tier of the football pyramid in there and, in the shape of Truro City, there is the first Cornish side to reach the Cup since 1969. It’s the FA Cup first-round draw! Clubs from the English Football League join the draw for the first time today, meaning the chance of a good giant-killing or two when the ties are played on the weekend of 3-6 November and each winning club gets £18,000 to put towards a few tins of paint for the old stands etc. There are potential derbies galore, perhaps one of the tastier ones would pit Maidenhead United against Slough Town, less than 10 miles apart, or Oxford United v Oxford City, which would mean a 15 minute drive for the away team. There are plenty of others too. Anyway, we’ll find out shortly enough – the balls will be pulled at 7.10pm BST by none other than Dean Saunders and someone else who they’ve not named yet.

One of the few that has endured is Lautrec’s famous image of a Moulin Rouge dancer, Jane Avril, whose high-kicking cancan is seen from the perspective of a double-bass player. That is a rare example of the poster as a durable work of art. But, if most of them fade with the productions they are designed to promote, they are still worth preserving and the National Theatre has made a fascinating selection from the 1,700 posters in its archive. A handful are on display in an exhibition at the Olivier theatre’s Wolfson Gallery. An even larger collection can be found in a magnificent book, National Theatre Posters, in which Rick Poynor traces their design history. Having seen the bulk of the National’s shows over five and a half decades, I found Poynor’s selection evoked many memories. Looking at the poster for a 1967 version of Strindberg’s The Dance of Death, the photo of Laurence Olivier doing a boyars’ dance, with hand on hip and left leg feverishly outflung, instantly brought back the manic exhilaration of one of his late, great performances. From more recent times the shot of a quietly rapturous Helen McCrory in Rattigan’s The Deep Blue Sea or of Lucian Msamati as a murderously pensive Salieri in Shaffer’s Amadeus trigger instant memories of the productions. At other times, it’s the arresting graphics themselves that matter. I’ve largely forgotten the 1977 production of Jonson’s Volpone: what remains is the astonishing image, designed by Richard Bird and Michael Mayhew and adapted from an illuminated medieval manuscript, of a fox with spiky white teeth and snaking red tongue. It somehow perfectly captures the vulpine predatoriness of Jonson’s hero. Similarly a beautifully reproduced Picasso drawing of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, in which character is evoked through elliptical strokes of the pen, outlives my hazy recollection of a 1982 staging of the Cervantes novel. Sometimes memories of a show coalesce with admiration for the artwork: you could hardly have a better summation of War Horse than the poster showing silhouetted soldiers marching to war under a sympathetic, tear-flecked equine eye. What is striking about NT posters is the mix of continuity and change. Since the National began operations at the Old Vic in 1963, there has been only a handful of poster designers and one of those, Michael Mayhew, was in charge from 1976 to 2009. But, while the quality has been consistent, there have been shifts of emphasis – as Poynor points out – from typography under the pioneering Ken Briggs, to illustrative images under Richard Bird and then photography under Mayhew. I also noticed one recent and more controversial change. For the bulk of its history, NT posters were not only there to promote the production and provide a visual clue to its content; they were also vital sources of information telling you who wrote the show, who was in it and who were the key creatives. Today all that has gone and I think it’s a pity. I understand the need to sell the NT brand but I’d have thought that people were more, rather than less, likely to go and see a production if they knew who had made it and who was in the cast. That cavil aside, I’d strongly recommend both a book and an exhibition reminding us that, while the play’s the thing, it’s the poster that often imprints it on the public’s imagination. National Theatre Posters is on display at the Wolfson Gallery, National Theatre, London, until 31 March 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/24/essential-info-for-the-changing-media-summit-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T14:26:30Z","webTitle":"Essential info for the Changing Media Summit 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/24/essential-info-for-the-changing-media-summit-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/24/essential-info-for-the-changing-media-summit-2018","fields":{"headline":"Essential info for the Changing Media Summit 2018","bodyText":"At the Changing Media Summit 2018 we will discuss the importance of responsibility and balance in an ever-changing media sector, and hear how publishers and brands can act responsibly to best serve their audience and consumers.

In fact, he’s got so far under David Silva’s skin that the midfielder has taken a razor to his head and had a bit of a go at a beard, in what appears to be an attempt at getting himself work as a Pep lookalike at Fake Faces, “the UK’s leading lookalikes agency” (instant quotes available, though it may have been a while since ‘David Beckham’ or ‘Juan Seba Verón’ had many enquiries). But we digress. On his arrival, Guardiola set about trying to build the perfect Premier League squad, signing Claudio Bravo as a deliberate error so as not to anger the footballing gods. It seems to be working. During the 7-2 dismantling of Stoke, Kevin De Bruyne carved out enough time and space to attach a Groucho Marx-esque ‘tache, eyebrows and cigar to the ball so as to more effectively disguise his pass to Leroy Sané. Meanwhile, Kyle Walker, a £53m wing-back who can’t cross, has found the perfect striker to work with, what with Jesus’s aversion to them. In fact, City are ticking along so nicely that their Big Cup opponents on Tuesday night, the unbeaten Serie A-topping Napoli, have seemingly thrown in the towel. “In Europe, we should only worry about getting to the next stage, not about winning every match,” parped their owner Aurelio De Laurentiis, calling Guardiola a “wily old fox”, then telling his manager to rest Napoli’s best players because they’ve got Inter at the weekend. “For us,” he added of the City match, “it could also be a game that’s almost impossible to win, but we’ll wait for them in Naples …” That’s the spirit Aurelio! So for Pep, it appears to be going rather well: his side are on fire, and the opposition have given up. There’s just one thing that he appears not to have factored in. This is Manchester City, a club perpetually aiming a gun at their own foot, to which they’ve attached a banana skin and left hovering over an upturned rake, which they’ve lain across an open manhole cover. He might be able to get Brian Kidd to dress up like a dad at a disco, but it remains to be seen whether he’s got the chops for that kind of voodoo.

QUOTE OF THE DAY “For the love of me, I couldn’t work Roberto Mancini out. We heard that when he was sacked by Inter in 2008, the entire squad had a massive night out to celebrate. By the time I left Manchester City in July 2011, I was ready to throw a party myself. Roberto Mancini saw the world differently to Shay Given, that’s for sure. He fell out with everyone. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone. The players, the back-up staff, the physios, the kitman, the press officers, the canteen workers, the car park lads, the lot. He probably even swung a punch or two at his own reflection for looking at him funny” – Shay Given goes full third-person in his autobiography, Any Given Saturday, while detailing his love for his former boss.

But his … explosante-fixe … has become one of the signature works of the Ensemble Intercontemporain, the house band of IRCAM in Paris, which Boulez himself founded in 1976, and no further justification is needed for the chance to hear their dazzling performance of it once again. What began in 1971 as a memorial to Stravinsky, a flat-pack collection of musical fragments with several pages of accompanying instructions on how to perform them, was elaborated and refined by Boulez over the following two decades into a 35-minute piece for solo flute, two further flutes, ensemble and real-time electronics. In the final version of … explosante-fixe … the solo flute is echoed and shadowed by its two congeners, while their trills and arabesques and those of the ensemble are digitally transformed and sent spinning around the auditorium to create dazzling, constantly shifting webs of sound. It’s one of Boulez’s most immediately beguiling and approachable works, and one of the classics of electro-acoustic music. Sophie Cherrier, who gave the first performance in 1993, was the coolly expert solo flautist here, too, with Matthias Pintscher conducting the EIC, but the Festival Hall isn’t the best space for its delicate interplay of live and electronic sounds, and the balance between the two wasn’t always as convincing as it could be. Another groundbreaking exploration of instrumental and electronic sounds, Jonathan Harvey’s Bhakti from 1982, fared a bit better at the beginning of the concert. It was one of the first pieces to demonstrate the musical potential of the electronic hardware that IRCAM was developing in its early days, and though its use of prerecorded tape now seems awkward and outdated, the sounds themselves, seamlessly morphing from the live to the synthesised, are still ravishing, and its link with Hindusim – each of the 12 sections is headed by a quotation from the Rig Veda – at least connected with the Belief series. Philippe Schoeller’s Hermes V, the final part of a projected cycle of pieces inspired by the legend of the Greek god, which was receiving its UK premiere, made little impression, though its command of colour and texture was expert enough in a post-Boulezian way, and the ensemble played it authoritatively."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/16/leipzig-get-revenge-on-dortmund-in-clash-of-pretenders-to-bayern-throne","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T12:46:22Z","webTitle":"Leipzig get revenge on Dortmund in clash of pretenders to Bayern throne | Andy Brassell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/16/leipzig-get-revenge-on-dortmund-in-clash-of-pretenders-to-bayern-throne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/16/leipzig-get-revenge-on-dortmund-in-clash-of-pretenders-to-bayern-throne","fields":{"headline":"Leipzig get revenge on Dortmund in clash of pretenders to Bayern throne","bodyText":"It was clear, from the way Ralph Hasenhüttl jumped on the pitch at full-time, bouncing with his fists pumping and the full complement of equally jubilant backroom staff in tow, that this meant something – that this meant everything. In winning at Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig had done more than beaten the leaders, and more than further opened up what threatens (at least for now) to be a title race. It meant more, even, than ending BVB’s incredible unbeaten Bundesliga run at Signal Iduna Park, incorporating 41 matches – under Jürgen Klopp, to Bayern Munich, in April 2015. “I am very, very proud,” beamed Hasenhüttl. “It was sensational, with so much passion. We had a real spectacle.” That it certainly was. This was the match of the season so far in the Bundesliga, hands down, despite Hasenhüttl’s opposite number Peter Bosz claiming: “It wasn’t a great game.” From a technical standpoint, one might have some sympathy for the Dutchman’s argument – and his side certainly made far too many mistakes for one with ambitions of holding what was a five-point lead at the top before kick-off. This was simply exhilarating, though. It had always promised to be a real occasion, not just between two of the pretenders to the crown of a wobbling Bayern Munich, but as a clash of cultures. The pair’s first meeting at Westfalen in February was a bracing affair, with extensive protests against the Red Bull model. In some cases, that distaste went way too far outside the ground, with small groups of ultras harassing and even in some cases attacking visiting fans. Mercifully, the more extreme elements were quelled this weekend, but the spirit of protest was still there. Ultras went on a march before the game and the Yellow Wall was again bumper-to-bumper with banners full of indignation for their opponents, proclaiming Leipzig as “der schade” – the shame – of the league and pledging: “Null Toleranz.” So when Hasenhüttl and his team frolicked on the field at the end, it was hard to think there wasn’t a bit more to their delight than just a prestige victory. The coach spoke after about how his team had wanted to “put on a show”, and one-by-one his players revealed how the aim had been to attack Dortmund from the off. “Playing so offensively in Dortmund can also be a bad idea,” admitted Hasenhüttl, and it hadn’t looked too promising for his side when Stefan Ilsanker’s stumble allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to open the scoring in the fourth minute. Leipzig hit back quickly though, with Marcel Sabitzer – who found out from Hasenhüttl he’d be wearing the captain’s armband 10 minutes before kick-off, with the team’s three captains Willy Orban, Diego Demme and Emil Forsberg all on the bench – nodding an equaliser. When the indefatigable Yussuf Poulsen tapped in after some brilliant wing play by Bruma, Die Roten Bullen’s bravery was rewarded. Those players who stepped in deserve much of the credit, with top scorer Timo Werner also an unused substitute, with the squad showing its depth. This was, however, as eloquent an expression of Hasenhüttl’s intelligence as you could wish to see. Dortmund’s excellent defensive record – only two goals conceded in the Bundesliga before – had always seemed an anomaly, and the visitors’ coach sought to expose it. Poulsen openly admitted after the game that Leipzig’s plan had been “to press very hard when Ömer Toprak was on the ball”, and it worked a treat, as they funnelled BVB’s possession into the hands, or feet, of their least dangerous players. Centre-back Toprak had 105 touches. Goalkeeper Roman Bürki had 78, more than any Leipzig player. “We played it backwards too often,” agreed Bosz. “Not forward, where our good players are.” It is no secret where Dortmund’s strengths lie, and those qualities should have been enoughfor a point, with Andriy Yarmolenko shanking over an open net late on with an equaliser looming – which would have put a completely different spin on the match, as Dortmund had been trailing 3-1 and a man down early in the second half. That might have been deserved but it might also have covered up to what extent Leipzig expertly poked at Dortmund’s weaknesses, unsettling them with physical play. From that angle, Hasenhüttl’s team lucked out a bit, with Naby Keita sailing perilously close to a third red card of the season. Most Dortmund fans would probably be disgusted at the thought of giving Leipzig the acknowledgment, but this has – already, just three games into the fixture’s history - developed into an absorbing grudge match. Roll on the first weekend of March, when these two meet again. Talking points • It was back to the future at the Allianz Arena, as Bayern swept aside Freiburg 5-0 in Jupp Heynckes’ return as head coach. “Spaß ist zurück” – fun is back – said the voiceover on ZDF’s Aktuelle Sportstudio, and it certainly felt like that, particularly after half-time as Bayern started to play with real swagger. It was all about that magic word that went missing under Carlo Ancelotti – intensity. This may have been a predictable win but the manner, and the eagerness of Bayern’s pressing, was notable. It wasn’t perfect, with the much-criticised Sven Ulreich’s save from Liverpool loanee Ryan Kent preventing the visitors from taking a shock lead, and Mike Frantz missing a golden chance while it was still 1-0. Soon after came Kingsley Coman’s goal, notable for the reaction of genuine joy on the bench. It felt right that it was finished up by a stylish finish by Joshua Kimmich, who much of the German media are pushing as the new Philipp Lahm – and not just positionally – for the new Heynckes era. Clearly the coach has already identified Kimmich’s importance, with the prolific right-back saying Heynckes had “given me a few tips” in the lead-up. • Before Julian Nagelsmann assures the succession in eight months’ time as we all expect, he still has work to do with Hoffenheim. He wore an infuriated expression as his side let two points slip in the home game with Augsburg, after Kevin Vogt’s unfortunate own goal. The hunger is certainly there – that much was clear in the way defender Benjamin Hübner smashed a team-mate, the formidable Sandro Wagner, out of the way to score the opener – but maybe the knowhow isn’t at the moment, despite Mark Uth’s sublime strike which almost proved to be the winner. They haven’t won in almost a month, and host Basaksehir on Thursday as they attempt to get some Europa League points on the board. • It could be worse, of course – he could be Alexander Nouri. The Werder Bremen coach’s job appears to be hanging by a thread after a comprehensive 2-0 home defeat by Borussia Mönchengladbach, in which they never looked like coming back after Lars Stindl’s stunning opener . “The team doesn’t seem to be listening to his instructions,” wrote Bild, and though Nouri was again backed by sporting director Frank Baumann – whose own job has been questioned, with club legend Thomas Schaaf linked with a return – the support sounded more equivocal than before. “We need to work on our mental strength and find solutions on the ball,” said Baumann, which didn’t say much for Nouri’s leadership. • They face a high noon – or half past noon, anyway – face-off at Köln, still stuck on a single point after a heartbreaking (and ludicrous) late defeat at Stuttgart on Friday. Locked at 1-1 after Dominique Heintz’s superb equaliser, they appeared to have a perfect chance to claim their elusive win after referee Benjamin Cortus awarded them a last-minute penalty. Three minutes and 40 seconds of VAR delay later, Cortus reversed the decision, leaving Stuttgart to go up the other end and fashion a winner, with Chadrac Akolo’s shot taking a huge deflection off Tim Handwerker. Even Stuttgart’s Holger Badstuber described it as “brutal”. • Hertha began their home game with Schalke by collectively taking a knee – with the coaching staff and backroom team – in solidarity with US sportsmen. It was, unfortunately, the last real impression they made on the afternoon, with their decline accelerated by Genki Haraguchi’s red card on the stroke of half-time. “It felt like they were playing with two extra men,” said Davie Selke after poor defending allowed Leon Goretzka – from a penalty - and Guido Burgstaller score. • Leverkusen continue to infuriate. They played brilliantly for half-an-hour only to allow Wolfsburg back into the game, shelling a lead twice. Die Wölfe are showing fight under Martin Schmidt, with Divock Origi and Jakub Blaszyszkowski – with his first Bundesliga goal in almost four years – scoring fine equalisers. • Mainz goalkeeper René Adler almost gifted his old mates from Hamburg a much-needed goal, air-kicking in front of Aaron Hunt, who wasn’t quite switched on enough to take advantage. HSV did score twice, with their first Bundesliga goals since August, but still slipped to a fifth defeat in six. • It was a second successive last-minute winner for Eintracht Frankfurt – a goal of some quality, rattled in from range by Ante Rebić from Sebastien Haller’s chested pass – to hand Hannover a first home defeat. Nico Kovać’s improving team host Dortmund next.

Lidia Dragescu, 23, from Romford, Essex, died as a result of the fall on 11 October at the cathedral in London. Her death is not being treated as suspicious. The cathedral was closed for the day after police were called to the building at 10.30am to reports that someone had fallen from the Whispering Gallery, which runs around the interior of the dome. In a statement issued by City of London police, her family said: “Our daughter and sister was the most beautiful person in the world. Her heart was pure and kind, a soul from another world. “She was an outstanding student and a talented figure skater. Beautiful, intelligent and kind. She would always help me, not allowing me to do any difficult chores. “Her love for us was beyond measure, she was selfless and kind. Everything that she had she shared with us, always putting us first. We love her and will always love her. For Lidia, the world has been a bad place to live in.” The Whispering Gallery is so called because its acoustics allow whispers to be audible around the dome. St Paul’s Cathedral on Wednesday said it was “deeply saddened” by the woman’s death. “Although robust procedures for emergency situations are in place at St Paul’s, and today’s response bore that out, it does not lessen the shock we feel as a close community, especially for those of us who witnessed and responded to this incident,” a spokesperson said. “We hold also in our thoughts those visitors within the cathedral at the time.

His daughter asks him to confide in her and, when he does, it is as if a great burden has been lifted. So he and his wife set the girl up as a miracle worker. Soon the entire town are demanding to unburden themselves to her. While their confessions bring them lightness, the child becomes increasingly anxious. Perhaps some secrets are too terrible to be kept, and the responsible thing to do is reveal the truth, whatever the consequences. In a month when the behaviour of Harvey Weinstein has been talked about in terms of being an open secret in Hollywood, Angela Clerkin’s fairytale for adults should have real traction, as grim as it is Grimm. But it never feels urgently necessary. That’s because, for all its gothic atmosphere (delivered courtesy of designer Simon Vincenzi), the storytelling is as baggy as an old shirt. The first half in particular is too repetitive and the show should really be reduced to a trim 90 minutes. It is neatly performed by Clerkin herself as the daughter, and a splendid cast of three others – Niall Ashdown, Hazel Maycock and Anne Odeke – who play all the inhabitants of a town that makes Twin Peaks look normal. There’s also a chorus of beaky, ominous crows. But the show feels like a short story that hasn’t found vivid life in performance. Some strands – such as the mother’s greediness and the significance of salt – are broached but never properly explored. The fact that the father is a doll’s house maker has visual currency but nothing more. Drawing on the imagery of the Roman Catholic confessional, spliced with gothic fairytales, the play successfully creates a creepy sense of foreboding as both secrets and blood are spilled. But the excessive frills surrounding the storytelling obscure its focus, and it never glistens as a sharply contemporary metaphor for the responsibilities and burdens of keeping secrets. Nor does it shine a light on why whistle-blowers such as Edward Snowden are viewed by some as heroes and by others as villains. • Ovalhouse, London, until 21 October. Box office: 020-7820 0990.

Despite the widely publicised deadline of midnight on Sunday – when the old coin ceased to be legal tender – our reporters had no problem offloading outdated money. John Lewis and Waitrose – both part of the John Lewis Partnership – became the latest retailers to soften their approach on Monday when they said their stores were free to accept the old coins until Saturday. John Lewis said: “All our systems and trolleys are ready for the new coin. However, we want to be helpful to our customers and, if they have no alternative ways of paying, we will continue to take old-style coins until the close of trade on 22 October. Meanwhile, clearly with an eye on children’s pocket money, The Entertainer toy store said it will accept the old pound coins in all 140 UK stores until the end of the year. Aldi, Iceland and Poundland have already said that they will continue to accept the coin until 31 October, while Tesco has agreed to take the old-style coins for a week after the 15 October deadline. But on Monday branches of Boots, Asda and Morrisons visited by the Guardian were all accepting the old coins without question, along with Transport for London (TfL) ticket machines. At a branch of Asda in Walthamstow, north-east London, a cashier accepted £1 to pay for some chewing gum, while at Boots an old £1 was accepted as payment for some sweets. TfL’s ticket machines – used by people buying tube and London Overground tickets – have been updated to not accept the old £1 coin, but a few do appear to still be taking it. A machine at Walthamstow tube station accepted two of our old £1 coins without quibble. Despite the midnight expiry date, the self-checkout tills at Morrisons in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, were accepting old pound coins this morning. Staff on nearby tills said they would continue to to take the old coins until 28 or 29 October. Sainsbury’s has said it would continue to accept the old coins at its tills on Monday,[see footnote] and that shoppers would be able to donate them to this year’s poppy appeal until 12 November. But when the Guardian went into a Sainsbury’s store to pay for a bar of chocolate with a round pound, the member of staff firmly shook her head, adding: “No mate, it’s not legal tender in here.” She handed our £1 back, but did point out that Poundland accepted them. At Kings Cross station in London, Marks &amp; Spencer, Pret a Manger, Caffè Nero and giftshop Oliver Bonas refused to accept the old coins, and it was rejected in the self-service machine at WHSmith – and at two branches of Waitrose. The Royal Mint and the Treasury were keen for retailers to stick to the deadline for a clean break from the round pound to avoid chaos being created by some shops continuing to accept them. Now that the deadline has passed, businesses have the right to stop accepting it and will not automatically be giving it as change for notes. The new 12-sided £1 coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit, entered circulation in March and has new hi-tech security features to thwart counterfeiters. Poundland stores have posters in their windows, saying: “Breaking News – Spend your old £1 coins with us until 31st October!” Sure enough, the man on the till accepted the Guardian’s old £1. • This footnote was added on 18 October 2017.

Speaking publicly for the first time since her trial began six months ago, Park told a hearing at the Seoul central district court on Monday: “I was supposed to be released today, but the court issued another arrest warrant … I can’t accept its decision.” Late last week the court extended her detention until April next year, citing a potential risk that she would attempt to destroy evidence. Her first six-month period of detention expired on Monday. “My lawyers and I felt helpless,” Park said, according to the Korea Times. “I have lost faith that the court will do a fair job in accordance with the constitution and conscience.” In an outburst that appeared to be directed at her successor as South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, Park claimed her treatment was politically motivated. “I hope I will be the last victim of political revenge in the name of the rule of law,” she said. Park’s intervention comes after international lawyers acting for the former president approached the UN in an attempt to secure her conditional release from “inhuman and degrading” detention to undergo urgent medical treatment. A legal team led by Rodney Dixon QC said they were “dismayed” by the court’s decision to extend Park’s detention by a further six months. Park, who was arrested soon after her impeachment in March, faces a possible life sentence if found guilty of bribery – the most serious charge – in a case that has also ensnared the heir to the Samsung technology empire and dozens of senior politicians and business figures. The former dictator’s daughter, who was elected South Korea’s first female president in 2012, is accused of colluding with her close friend, Choi Soon-sil, to secure tens of millions of dollars in bribes from businesses in return for political favours. Lee Jae-yong, the acting chairman of Samsung, was sentenced to five years in prison in August after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and other crimes. He is appealing against the verdict, claiming that Park coerced him into helping Choi. A pale-looking Park, who arrived at the court on Monday in handcuffs, insisted she was innocent. “I never accepted or granted requests for favours while in office,” she said. “I believe it has been fully revealed during the course of the trial that the corresponding suspicions are not true.” Park said the last six months had been “a horrible and miserable time” during which she had “endured pain in my body and mind”. She added: “I had trust in a person who later betrayed me. As a result, I have lost my honour and everything else in life.” Her international legal team – which is separate from the defence lawyers who have been representing her in her corruption trial – has asked the UN working group on arbitrary detention to recommend that she be granted a conditional release, although the ultimate decision rests with the South Korean courts. “The UN is looking at our application urgently and the South Korean authorities need to respond,” Dixon told the Guardian. “We have asked the UN to address the matter as swiftly as possible because every day counts.” Park, 65, suffers from chronic lower back pain, osteoarthritis in her knee and shoulder joints, and Addison’s disease, a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. “Our point that we’ve been highlighting to the UN is that her condition has certainly been aggravated by being in detention and that if she doesn’t get proper medical attention it’ll only get worse,” said Dixon, a human rights lawyer based in London. “If you could release her you could have very clear conditions in place – you could even put her under house arrest – and her health conditions could be treated.” In a submission to the UN, the lawyers said Park’s ongoing detention, despite her deteriorating health, “constituted a violation of her fundamental human rights, including her right against arbitrary detention, her right against inhuman and degrading treatment, and her right to a fair trial”. They added that it was a matter of “extreme concern” that South Korean courts had turned down her repeated requests to be released during the trial, even after she collapsed during a hearing. “Our biggest fear is that she will have a complete breakdown, and that is why we are urging an intervention now so that she doesn’t get into the position where it becomes completely intolerable,” Dixon said. The resignation of Park’s seven-member defence team means the trial cannot continue until replacement state lawyers have been appointed. The interruption could cause a long delay in the trial, since they will have to review more than 100,000 pages of evidence. Her lawyers said the decision to extend her detention was proof that the principle of the presumption of innocence was collapsing, according to Yonhap news agency. “As we’ve reached a conclusion that any defence argument for the defendant is meaningless, all of us decided to resign,” one of her lawyers, Yoo Yeong-ha, told the court. Park’s international lawyers claimed that her detention includes sleep deprivation, abusive and coercive interrogations, and excessively rough treatment that has left her with bruises from handcuffs. “It is internationally accepted that detention is the exception under international human rights standards, and is only justified in exceptional circumstances,” they said. “None of these pertain in the present case, which does not concern violent crimes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/16/gerhard-richter-brisbane-show-honours-german-masters-irony-and-influence","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T03:01:25Z","webTitle":"Gerhard Richter: Brisbane show honours German master's irony and influence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/16/gerhard-richter-brisbane-show-honours-german-masters-irony-and-influence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/16/gerhard-richter-brisbane-show-honours-german-masters-irony-and-influence","fields":{"headline":"Gerhard Richter: Brisbane show honours German master's irony and influence","bodyText":"To say that an international artist can be hugely influential in Australia, where their work has rarely been seen, is to pay testament not just to the aesthetic qualities of their work but also to the appeal of the ideas behind it. German-born Gerhard Richter is one such artist. Since the early 1960s he has explored a number of related themes and ideas, producing paintings and photographs that question the nature of the images that can be produced by both mediums. Through magazines and books, and later the web, Richter’s work has been the subject of intense interest by many Australian artists – even when access to it meant trips to galleries in Europe or the US. Now, the 85-year-old German artist is the subject of a major career survey show, Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images, which opened this weekend at the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane. With a collection of work that spans Richter’s entire career, and featuring key loans from European, American and Australian collections, this a major coup for the gallery. While the exhibition itself is a standout for both its rigour and range of work, it’s also an opportunity to explore why Richter has had such an influence in Australia. A Facebook friend, who has been involved in art book retailing for more than a decade, posted recently that books about Richter’s work have been hugely popular for many years, and only in the last decade have they been eclipsed by books on perennial favourites Banksy and David Shrigley. On the basis of the pure visual appeal of Richter’s painting, it’s easy to see why. Trained in East Germany in the classical art of realist painting, Richter’s images have the quiet stillness of European masterworks, taking in genres such as the still life, landscape and portraiture, but of contemporary subjects that are often rendered like a slightly out of focus photograph. For Richter this “fuzzy” focus is a way of depicting memory, but it also has an ironic edge since many of Richter’s images are appropriated from the media. Collecting images since the beginning of his career, Richter has compiled thousands of photographs into a vast archive that includes personal and family pictures, all exhibited together under the title Atlas Overview (1962-ongoing). Since the early 1960s, Richter has explored a variety of styles, including various flavours of abstraction, from hard edge stripes to the faux expressionism of squashing paint under glass or dragging it across the canvas with a squeegee. His early works in the 60s, painted from images sourced from the media, were parodies of the then-ascendant international styles of American Pop Art and the postwar culture and economic boom in West Germany at the time. After forming and then promptly disbanding the satirical art movement Capitalist Realism, founded with fellow German artists Sigmar Polke and Konrad Leug, Richter would go on to explore the nature of image making, testing the limits of what might be called a photo, and what might be considered a painting. For Richter, that tactile thingyness of a painting stands in contrast to the ephemeral nature of the photo – particularly the way images appear online, weightless and without material form. He has painted on photos, painted over photos, and questioned the possibility of literally representing monumental tragedy, such as the series Birkenau (2014): four imposing works that had begun life as images of the Nazi death camp of the title, but then painted over to become inscrutable abstracts. This kind of interest in the language and meaning of image making found resonance in Australian art, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, as the dominance of expressionist painting began to wane and a more conceptual, playful and ironic postmodern art emerged. The Popism artists in Melbourne in the mid-1980s – including Maria Kozic, Phillip Brophy and Peter Tyndall, among others – owe no obvious visual allegiance to Richter’s work, but he was conceptually influential, as was his sense of irony. Richter’s continuing influence can be found today in the work of painters who investigate the relationship between the photographic image and painting, and its reproduction in painting, including Halinka Orszulok, Tony Lloyd, Victoria Reichelt and Sam Leach. Earlier this year, the National Gallery of Victoria showed the first comprehensive exhibition of Melbourne-based artist Patrick Pound; titled The Great Exhibition, it was a testament to the influence of Richter’s Atlas Overview on the Australian artist’s work – an influence that Pound himself paid tribute to in his talk at Goma. As an artist, Richter represents a practice of making art that is both remarkably consistent, even within his varying styles, and the result of deep thinking on the implications of making images. One of the lessons of Richter’s work for Australian art is the way in which he has treated history. Along with his Birkenau paintings, one of Richter’s most famous images is the small portrait Uncle Rudi (1965). Dressed in his SS uniform, Uncle Rudi smiles at the viewer amidst a smear of grey and black paint. Made during his Pop period alongside images of clothes dryers, fighter jets and celebrities, there’s a suggestion of an equivalence of moral context in mass media images – the personal and family history at the same level as world historical events. But for a German artist in the postwar period, to acknowledge family participation in the Nazi holocaust is remarkable. For all Richter’s influence here, it’s hard to imagine a white Australian artist acknowledging a family member’s happy participation in the Frontier Wars. Certainly not one smiling so serenely. • Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images is showing at the Gallery of Modern Art (Goma), Brisbane, until 4 February 2018.

The defence and security communities must be “on the lookout for threats” as government and business expand the trade relationship with China, the Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman told the Australian Institute of International Affairs in Canberra on Monday. But Wong warned that discussion about China was “vulnerable … to infection with undertones of race and alienation”, citing One Nation’s “dystopian rhetoric” as an example. Wong said Australia must “understand China, its motives and its mindsets” because “we don’t yet know how its pursuit of a more ambitious agenda will play out globally” nor “how China intends to condition its use of power”. “China is becoming more assertive, and more inclined not only to demand a place at the table, but also a say in which table and what design,” she said. Wong said that Australia should work with China “to encourage it to play the positive role it is capable of in supporting and furthering regional stability and security”. Wong said Australia must afford China the “priority it merits”, including by not remaining “defiantly monolingual”, instead committing to ramp up study of Mandarin. Wong encouraged greater integration of economic and security policy, noting that China’s belt and road initiative was an example where assessment purely on strategic implications could see Australia “missing out on its potential” but a “purely economic approach ignores our own strategic interests”. She announced that, in addition to engagement at the head of government and ministerial level, Labor would “considerably expand” engagement between the senior public service, not just in defence and foreign affairs but “in particular the Treasury” and other departments with ongoing business in China. She noted proposals for an independent Australia-China commission, and said Labor would give “serious consideration” to the idea. Wong said that at times China’s strategic objectives and its “long-term vision of its own place in the world” conflicted with the regional rules-based order, citing the South China Sea as an example. In 2016 the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague ruled that China had no historical title over the South China Sea. The Turnbull government has stressed the need for China to respect the binding ruling and the sovereignty of smaller nations, contributing to warnings from Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, that Australia must not “take sides” as occurred in the Cold War. Earlier, in her speech at the same event, the foreign minister rejected the view Australia was “taking sides” by insisting China and the Philippines respect the international court’s decision. Julie Bishop warned the international rules-based order was “under strain, even fraying” as some nations sought to bend or break the rules for “short-term gain”. She cited North Korea’s defiance of United Nations security council resolutions as the “most egregious” example. Bishop said while the US would be the “only global superpower into the foreseeable future”, in the next 10 years – the time covered by the forthcoming foreign affairs white paper – Asia’s combined military spending would match the US’s. In that time, she warned Australia could fall out of the world’s top 20 economies; it is projected to be overtaken by Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand. Bishop noted many territorial disagreements involved Asia’s great powers, citing China’s maritime disputes with five south-east Asian states including the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, the dispute over the Senkaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu Islands) with Japan and a land border dispute with India. Wong said the world was in a period of disruption characterised by “unpredictable political events, re-emergent nationalism, the increasing challenge to democracy as the most effective form of political participation, worsening economic inequality” and a challenge to the international rules-based order. China was part of that disruption and through economic growth had achieved “a standing as a world power that would once have only been possible through military power”, she said. Wong argued Australia’s long-term relationship with China would be developed not “at the expense of our relationship with the US” but rather to a “very significant extent” because of that relationship. She said the Anzus treaty between Australia and the US not only underpinned Australia’s security but “is a key contributor to the peace, stability and security of our region”, rejecting both the view of US regional treaties as an attempt to “contain” China and any suggestion China needed to be contained. “What Australia, China and the US are looking for is a convergence, as far as is practicable, of our individual national interests in Asia, locating those interests within a rules-based order.” Wong argued that China’s long-term interests were enhanced by stability, and that Australia could navigate a path guided by its own national interests rather than treating China and the US as competitors engaged in a “binary relationship”. At a press conference after her speech, Bishop defended “openness and freedom” over reports in the Australian that universities are concerned about incidents of Chinese interference, including academic staff targeted in social media campaigns after complaints from Chinese international students about “offensive” teaching material. “We want to ensure that everyone has the advantage of expressing their views whether they are at university or whether they are visitors – we don’t want to see freedom of speech curbed in any way involving foreign students or foreign academics,” Bishop said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/15/rugby-union-champions-cup-toulon-scarlets-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T19:47:44Z","webTitle":"Bittersweet return for Leigh Halfpenny as Scarlets lose at Toulon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/15/rugby-union-champions-cup-toulon-scarlets-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/15/rugby-union-champions-cup-toulon-scarlets-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Bittersweet return for Leigh Halfpenny as Scarlets lose at Toulon","bodyText":"Leigh Halfpenny scored 15 points on his return to Toulon, but his penalty miss 10 minutes from the end cost the Welsh region, who had lost their previous nine away matches in Europe, victory in a match that showed their pre‑tournament billing as one of the likely quarter-finalists was not misplaced. The Scarlets were 15 points down in as many minutes, caught out by Toulon’s willingness to move the ball, but there were periods in the second half when the team that won the Champions Cup three times in a row this decade was hanging on before recovering to win 21-20. The Scarlets, who had left with nothing on their two previous visits to Toulon, secured a bonus point but they face Bath in Llanelli on Friday, five days after a physically gruelling encounter. “Maybe we were given the short turnaround because we were not expected to go through,” their captain, Scott Williams, said. “We showed we are a good enough team to progress and, despite the slow start, it was a game we could have won.” Toulon’s first try came from a Scarlets mistake after five minutes: a loose tap back from a lineout on their 10-metre line saw Aled Davies pass when he should have held on to the ball and Eric Escande intercepted. The second resulted from a sense of adventure for which Toulon are not renowned. A quick drop out gave Josua Tuisova space and the wing galloped through Halfpenny’s challenge to set up Guilherme Guirado. Anthony Belleau’s second penalty gave Toulon an 18-point lead but the Scarlets worked their way back. Halfpenny, on his first return to Toulon since leaving last season, made up for an earlier penalty miss with a 20-metre kick and when Steff Evans’s break resulted in a yellow card for Hugo Bonneval after the full-back tackled Davies without the ball, Halfpenny trimmed the home side’s interval lead to 15 points. The Scarlets started the second half as Toulon had the first. Rhys Patchell’s chip into space that would have been covered by Bonneval saw Chris Ashton beaten by the bounce which favoured Johnny McNicholl. Eight minutes later Halfpenny crossed the line after using Tadgh Beirne as a decoy. The Scarlets were showing the form that took them to last season’s Pro12 title and took the lead on the hour through Halfpenny’s boot. Toulon regained the advantage through François Trinh‑Duc after Beirne entered a ruck from the side and both teams pressed for victory, Halfpenny missing from wide 10 minutes from the end. Toulon’s Argentina back-rower Fecunda Isa was denied a try with what would have been the last play for a double movement after Sebastien Tillous-Borde had been held up over the line. The Scarlets, who by then had Beirne in the sin-bin, ran the ball from their own line before accepting the bonus point. Elsewhere, Munster were relieved to leave Castres with a 17-17 draw while Ospreys went down 26-21 against Clermont Auvergne in a game in which Clermont held a 20-7 half‑time lead. A disappointing result was compounded by a serious-looking injury to the Wales international flanker Dan Baker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-yellowface-casting-row-classical-music-has-a-diversity-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:29:24Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the ‘yellowface’ casting row: classical music has a diversity problem | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-yellowface-casting-row-classical-music-has-a-diversity-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-yellowface-casting-row-classical-music-has-a-diversity-problem","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the ‘yellowface’ casting row: classical music has a diversity problem","bodyText":"The Hackney Empire in London announced last week that it had cancelled a performance of an opera that had come under fire from members of Britain’s east Asian community. The Golden Dragon, by the Hungarian composer Peter Eötvös, is set in a Chinese restaurant, and has Chinese characters. But the cast was all white. In its statement, Hackney Empire cited its commitment to reflecting the UK’s diverse population on its stage. In truth, common sense ought to have kicked in at Music Theatre Wales, which created the production, long before The Golden Dragon reached the stage. The opera’s music and libretto are by white men; the staging was designed and directed by white men. Though the well-intentioned production seeks to shine a light on the immigrant experience, it seems perverse to attempt to do so without any involvement at all from the communities described. The music itself contains passages that can be understood as cultural cliches that skate dangerously towards caricature. The fact that common sense clearly did not kick in points to a problem with diversity in classical music that goes far beyond operatic casting. Though there has been a recent efflorescence of women attaining high-profile music director jobs (such as Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra), conducting remains far from a level playing field, with women and non-white artists relative rarities. Research by Sound and Music, the UK’s national organisation for new music, has found that while a nearly equal number of girls and boys take GCSE music, girls account for a steadily decreasing proportion of composers as they move through college and into the profession. In terms of BAME singers on stage, the problems are exacerbated by a narrow and homogenous group of gatekeepers (casting directors and singers’ agents); and many British productions, having scant funds for lengthy rehearsal periods, are apt to rely on the kind of singers who can learn a work at speed. That often means casting those whose training involved years as a cathedral chorister followed by an Oxford or Cambridge choral scholarship. Arguably, however, the problem is most importantly one of mindset. Too often, lack of diversity in programmes is defended by artistic directors using weak arguments – that it would compromise quality to factor in thinking about race or gender, for example. Or that if an opera is essentially “a fable” (itself something of an orientalist trope), it does not matter if an all-white cast is singing non-white parts. Or that programming must not be “contaminated” by extra-musical considerations (as if that were possible, or even desirable). This may seem almost laughably old-fashioned to many, but it is the kind of thinking (with some honourable exceptions) that remains too common in classical music. After an initial hesitation, Music Theatre Wales has finally done the right thing by promising a period of self-examination. It remains an exciting company that now has the opportunity to challenge its own thinking, and even begin to lead the way. Other parts of the industry, including funders, can also learn from this episode. Singers from BAME backgrounds should be better supported.

Her role in the college’s birth began in 1962, when, as a teacher in the drama department of the Royal Academy of Music in London, she was told that her unit was to close. Characteristically, she refused to take the announcement lying down, and with two colleagues decided to set up a new college that would provide theatre training in much the same way as her old department. Having identified the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova’s former home in Hampstead as a good base, they were told by their solicitor that he would raise finance for the project if they could get some well-known names as trustees. A week later they came back with Lord Denning (Pauline’s stepfather), Sir Ralph Richardson, Peter Sellers and Richard Dimbleby. With one phone call the money was made available and the New College of Speech and Drama was born. The college ran for 12 years independently before being merged into Middlesex Polytechnic (later Middlesex University). To this day, her former students remember Pauline as a dynamic personality and an inspiring teacher. Born to John Stuart, a civil engineer, and his wife, Joan (nee Taylor), in Maymyo (now Pyin Oo Lwin), Burma (now Myanmar), Pauline’s parents, with her sister, Hazel, and brother, John, returned to Britain during her childhood. Her father died when she was a teenager, and her mother remarried, to Alfred “Tom” Denning, a judge. Pauline attended Trevelyan school in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, and then was a boarder at Queen Anne’s school, Caversham, near Reading. She wanted to be an actor, but those dreams were shattered when her left arm was set crookedly after a fall playing leapfrog. She opted instead to become a drama teacher, gaining a scholarship to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After completing her training in 1945, her first job was as a drama adviser at the YWCA in London, putting on plays and musicals, and teaching classes. It was while there that she met Derick Simond, a BBC producer whom she married in 1946. She then taught at the Royal Academy of Music until setting up the New College, where she taught full time as well as being an examiner for London University and the Institute of Education. Her connection with the Royal Academy of Music did not end in 1962 – she continued to provide dramatic training for its opera class and produced operas there, working with young artists such as Sheila Armstrong, Norma Burrowes, Ian Caddy and Philip Langridge. She later directed operas at Trinity College of Music, London, where she was made a fellow in 1976. From 1974 she was course leader for the New College diploma at Middlesex, where she helped design the first performance arts degree in the country and subsequently, after five years as head of the polytechnic’s school of drama, a master’s course in the same subject. She ran experimental theatre groups, wrote and directed many plays and premiered two new musicals at the Edinburgh fringe. She also published a student handbook, Theatre Procedures and Practice (1982). Outside of work, she divided her time between her home in London and a cottage in Goodworth Clatford, Hampshire. Derick died in 1995. She is survived by her two daughters, me and Miranda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/15/higher-food-prices-could-be-avoided-if-no-brexit-claims-chris-grayling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:11:12Z","webTitle":"Chris Grayling: farmers can grow more food if there is no Brexit deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/15/higher-food-prices-could-be-avoided-if-no-brexit-claims-chris-grayling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/15/higher-food-prices-could-be-avoided-if-no-brexit-claims-chris-grayling","fields":{"headline":"Chris Grayling: farmers can grow more food if there is no Brexit deal","bodyText":"British farmers would need to grow more food to prevent a rise in food prices if Britain crashes out of the EU without a negotiated deal, a senior cabinet minister has said. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, who backed leave in the EU referendum, said the EU would also be damaged by a failure to reach a settlement, but suggested homegrown produce would protect UK citizens from soaring prices. In remarks that critics said evoked the second world war “Dig For Victory” propaganda campaigns, Grayling said Britain would “succeed whatever happens” as concern mounted about lack of progress in the EU negotiations. Asked what would happen to food prices if there was no deal, he said farmers would “grow more here” and “we’ll buy more from around the world”. “It would mean that producers, supermarkets bought more at home, that British farmers produced more, that they bought more from around the world and it would damage French producers and continental producers,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday. Labour said the comments showed a cavalier approach to a potentially serious issue. The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: “This is yet another example of the Tories’ chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations. “Rather than planning for no deal, ministers appear to be telling us to dig for no deal. British farmers already work incredibly hard and to suggest that they could simply grow more food is ridiculous.” Chapman said it was infighting in the Conservative party that was the biggest threat to Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal when the two-year article 50 timetable for withdrawal expires in March 2019. “Ministers should stop fighting among themselves and start putting the national interest first,” she said. “That means avoiding a cliff edge for our economy and agreeing strong transitional arrangements within the single market and a customs union.” Grayling said it was right for the government to prepare for the possibility that both sides would not reach an agreement. “I believe we’ll end up with a sensible agreement with the European Union because it’s in both of our interests that that should happen,” he said. “But of course we must plan for all eventualities. People would think it was ridiculous if the government wasn’t planning for all eventualities.” The former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, the party’s new Defra spokesman, said farming would be one of the industries most at risk from a no deal Brexit. “The government’s inability to make progress on negotiations is leaving farmers in the lurch and creating huge uncertainty,” he said. “Since farmers’ exports will collapse if they are lumbered with massive WTO tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit, farmers could certainly end up with lots of spare produce they won’t be able to sell.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/15/time-for-a-rethink-about-locking-people-up","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:47:55Z","webTitle":"Time for a rethink about locking people up | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/15/time-for-a-rethink-about-locking-people-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/15/time-for-a-rethink-about-locking-people-up","fields":{"headline":"Time for a rethink about locking people up","bodyText":"Your report about the demonstration at Long Lartin (Disorder at Long Lartin raises fears about jails, 13 October) missed a key issue which has bedevilled the debate about the recent prison crisis. The debate has no sense of history. There were widespread demonstrations in the pre-cuts era when there were little or no staff shortages. Long Lartin is a maximum security prison. Between 1969 and 1983, there were at least 10 major disturbances in five of the eight male, maximum security prisons at the time. These demonstrations, involving long-term prisoners, were not about overcrowding or staff shortages but were about the bleak, alienating regimes which were operating in these prisons and about the violence that was being perpetrated by staff in places like Hull, especially towards black and Irish prisoners. Unless the government, and the Labour opposition, recognise this history, learn from the abject failures of the past and move towards a radical response to the prison crisis, these demonstrations are likely to continue, in long-term and short-term prisons, with potentially devastating consequences for all concerned. Professor Joe Sim School of Humanities and Social Science, Liverpool John Moores University • Prison has become a very expensive way of making people less good citizens. Short sentences are particularly illogical. When will a bold defence solicitor submit that it would be a breach of article 3 of the European convention on human rights to impose a short prison sentence? Article 3 is an unqualified ban on inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Imprisonment now exposes an inmate to a constant regime of almost continuous containment, inducing or exacerbating high levels of mental illness, disorder and violence, abuse of prohibited drugs and so-called legal (ie not yet illegal) highs, bullying, black marketing and, in the case of Muslim prisoners, attempts at indoctrination into radical beliefs, all in an atmosphere of cigarette smoking and managed by overwhelmed prison staff. Prison will always be unpleasant but standards have collapsed. Much cheaper and much more effective reformative sentences are available. A far smaller number than 86,000 men and women need to be kept in prison in order to protect the rest of us from them because they are dangerous.

And if you’re looking for competitive fixtures, you have to go all the way back to the last century – Davids Seaman, Batty and Beckham played alongside each other on a number of occasions, most recently in 1999 under Kevin Keegan. Also worth noting is the first match of Terry Venables’ reign, against Denmark in 1994. England played the first 67 minutes with three Pauls on the pitch (Parker, Ince and Gascoigne), and the remainder with three Davids, as Batty replaced Gazza from the substitutes bench to join Platt and Seaman.” We did some of our own digging and discovered that Gary Lineker, Gary A Stevens and Gary M Stevens were on the pitch together for 33 minutes at the Azteca Stadium for England’s 3-0 win over Paraguay in the last 16 of the 1986 World Cup. On three occasions in the 1970s Ray Wilkins, Ray Clemence and Ray Kennedy trotted around on the same piece of turf in an England shirt. And if we trawl back over 100 years ago to 15 February, 1913 an England team containing three Georges (Wall, Elliott and Utley) lost 2-1 to an Ireland side with four Billies (McConnell, Gillespie, Andrews, Scott) at Windsor Park. “Bobbys Moore, Charlton and Smith played together eight times,” writes Graeme Gaff. “On two occasions a fourth Bobby (Tambling or Thomson) joined in. Harry was also a popular name for 1880s footballers. Messrs Cursham, Goodhart, Swepstone and Moore all played against Ireland in February 1883. And on 2 December 1948 John Aston, John Haines, John Hancocks, John (‘Jack’) Rowley and John (‘Jackie’) Milburn were all in the starting XI against Switzerland.” Scotland can match England for Johns. At Hampden Park on 13 March 1880, when the wonderfully monikered Segar Bastard made his one and only international appearance for England, the Scots had five Johns in their lineup (McPherson, Smith, McGregor, Baird and Kay). Two of them scored in the 5-4 win. Other current international teams who regularly field three players with the same first names are Egypt, for whom Mohamed Salah, Mohamed Elneny and Mohamed Abdul Shafy are regular starters and Oman fielded three Alis (Ali Al Habsi, Ali Al Busaidi and Ali Al Jabri) in an Asian Cup qualifier on 10 October against Maldives, who had three Ahmeds playing for them as well as two Mohameds and one Mohammad. And Stephen Pollard broadens the question out to include club teams. “In Arsenal’s match against Brighton a front three all named Alex was fielded: Alexander Iwobi, Alexandre Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez.” Any more for any more?

Missing footballers “Where some former players go on to manage pubs, get ‘normal’ jobs etc. Has any player ‘disappeared’ never to be seen again?” asked Tony Crawfod. Chris Whiffin was on hand to answer this. “Sadly the answer is yes in the case of Richard Young a talented young striker who is fondly remembered by Exeter City fans for his part in their Division Four Championship winning team of 1989-90. The Grecians’ Official Archive takes up the story …” After losing his place in the City team and being sidelined with a back injury, Young turned down a £30,000 move to Hereford United in December 1990. Shortly after, he was involved in a car accident in the early hours in Wiltshire. Young was sacked by the Grecians for a breach of contract in March 1991 having not reported to St James’ Park or contacted manager Terry Cooper for several weeks. Mystery surrounds the whereabouts and what happened to Young after that with several unsubstantiated stories being quoted. And Graham Clayton adds: “Willie McClean, who represented the United States at the 1934 World Cup, left Chicago in the summer of 1938 and was never seen again. Wikipedia suggests ‘his family continued to receive infrequent Mother’s Day cards from towns along the Mississippi River for several years after. Finally, in November 1944 Aetna Life Insurance placed an advertisement in the Midwest Soccer News asking for information regarding his whereabouts. Despite these efforts, he was never seen again.’” European Copa Libertadores winners “Has a European player ever won the Copa Libertadores?” wondered Stoyan Ivanov last week. Dirk Maas can answer this one. “Christian Rudzki, who was born in Czechoslovakia, was part of the 1970-winning side, Estudiantes de la Plata, the four-times champions from Argentina. Dante Mircoli, born in Italy, took victory in 1972 with Independiente, who won four Libertadores in a row between 1972 and 1975.” But Kari Tulinius can broden their elite club. “As far as I know, Liédson and Mirko Jozić have won the Libertadores. The latter coached Chilean club Colo-Colo to victory in 1991. The former was born in Brazil but had become a Portuguese citizen and played for Portugal by the time he won a Libertadores medal with Corinthians in 2012, coming on as a first-half substitute in the first leg. Also featuring in that side was Emerson Sheik, a Brazilian-born player who represented Qatar three times, until Fifa ruled he was not allowed to do that. And, famously, Leo Horn is the only referee to have whistled his way through a Copa Libertadores and European Cup final, the former – one leg – in 1962 and the latter in 1957 and 1962. Marcel Albert Bois of France refereed both legs of the 1963 Libertadores final.” Knowledge archive “My club, non-league side Guildford City, have just completed what I think may be a unique, albeit unwanted, record,” wrote Matt Howell in 2011. “Have there been any other instances within senior football of two brothers being sent off for the same club during the same season while playing in the same position? Regular goalkeeper Antony Hall was dismissed last weekend, further to the sending off of his brother Michael during a cup match earlier in the season.” The Hall boys have some company at the very top of the English game. “Fábio da Silva was sent off in a League Cup match against Wolves for a professional foul on Michael Kightly during the 2009-10 season,” wrote Tim Hill. “In the same season his brother (and twin) Rafael was also red carded while playing against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final.” Can you help? “As I’m writing this, George Weah is running for president in Liberia. At the same time, his son, Timothy, is playing for the United States at the U-17 World Cup. If George wins the general election and Timothy makes his full debut for the US senior national team, will Timothy become the first child of a head of state to play for a different country?” asks Samir Gelb. “I recall, early in Niall Quinn’s career, the late, great Irish commentator Jimmy Magee saying his family had told him Quinn’s name was pronounced ‘Neil’ and not ‘Nile’, as is the correct pronunciation in Irish – even Irish people habitually mispronounce it. Clearly few people got the message and Quinn is still called ‘Nile’ by most people. Are there any other footballers whose names have been constantly mispronounced throughout their career and beyond?” – Oliver Farry. “While belting out the Liverpool song Poor Scouser Tommy the other day it occurred to me that it is really long – over 250 words, at least. Are there any other original fan songs (not just songs written by bands and sung verbatim by supporters) that are longer?” wonders George Jones. “Watching Daniel Sturridge run on at Anfield this weekend got me thinking: has anyone ever injured themselves running on as a substitute and been subbed off immediately?” asks Grant Ninnes. “I’m sure that Blyth Spartans’ 3-1 win away to Stockport in the Cup this weekend encouraged, for many of your readers, reminiscences about the days when the latter were good. But this led me to a question. Which former league teams have sunk to the lowest level? And I’m not counting sides that went out of business and later reformed, of which there are many. I know that Ashington, founder members of Division Three North (and managed by former England fast bowler Steve Harmison), are currently knocking about in Northern League Division One – the ninth tier of the pyramid – and have been one step lower in the recent past. Are there any continuously extant former league clubs doing worse?” – Rob Marriott.

They bring that story up to the canvas, they make it known, they do it with their mind and heart and it strengthens them and they be, you know, they strong.” Ward is one of several hundred Indigenous artists who travelled to Adelaide for the Tarnanthi festival of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the weekend. She is sitting with other artists from the Warakurna arts centre in remote Western Australia. Warakurna represents artists from the Ngaanyatjarra lands, communities whose country is on the Western Australian side of the Gibson desert, 330km east of Uluru. They are waiting for the three-day art fair to begin. Twenty-four stallholders, representing Indigenous arts centres from around Australia, have brought their best work to Adelaide to sell in the Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute. The art fair is part of the Tarnanthi festival of contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art, a citywide festival that runs until 22 October. In the Ngaanyatjarra lands, as in many remote communities, art is one of the main sources of income. “Art provides another income stream,” Warakurna arts centre’s manager, Jane Menzies, tells Guardian Australia. “One can’t live off the Centrelink dole payments. It’s woeful, unsustainable out there … the cost of living is so high.” Welfare payments range between $540 a fortnight for the unemployment benefit and $890 for the aged care pension. Once the bills are taken out, it’s barely enough to cover the cost of petrol. “A lot of our artists are travelling for funerals, and funerals are not just 10km up the road, it’s 800km up the road,” Menzies says. “The elders are doing this sometimes three times a month. The cost of doing this is much higher than the money that they receive from the government.” Art is also a way of building resilience in communities straddling the divide between Indigenous cultural traditions and the western expectations of state and federal governments. “It empowers people to share their knowledge, to collaborate and paint that knowledge and ensure that it has a place that’s ongoing: a legacy, which clearly has huge benefits for mental health and wellness,” Menzies says. The role of art as cultural maintenance is particularly important when people become too old or unwell to travel on country themselves. Once a week, a busload of artists from Warakurna travel 100km down the Great Central Road to Kungkarrangkalpa aged care facility in Wanarn to paint and hear the stories of old people who can no longer return home. “It gives the old people an opportunity to paint their Tjukurrpa [a Ngaanyatjarra word meaning culture or dreaming] with artists and to see their family,” Menzies says. Ward, who takes part in the visits every Friday, says it helps to keep both older and younger people “healthy and strong”. “They keep the knowledge into their system, whole body, to work through it,” she says. “When they age they go there and they paint, paint, paint.” Across the border in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands in South Australia, art is playing a more direct role in improving the health of people in remote communities. They are holding an auction to raise money to pay for nurses to run a dialysis centre at Pukatja, a remote community formerly known as Ernabella. Pukatja is about 1,300km north of Adelaide and 420km south of Alice Springs. Since the Northern Territory closed its borders to out-of-state dialysis patients in 2009, dialysis patients in Pukatja and other APY communities have had to travel more than 1,000km south to Port Augusta, or to Adelaide, to receive treatment. Purple House, a community-controlled health organisation based in Alice Springs that has helped six remote communities in the territory and three in WA open local dialysis centres, has secured a federal funding grant to build a four-chair dialysis centre and nurses’ accommodation in Pukatja. But the funding does not cover operational costs. Purple House has already raised $180,000 and hoped to raise the final $150,000 needed to cover the first 12 months at an auction on the last day of the art fair on Sunday. Leading artists from the APY lands’ prolific arts centres, including Jimmy Pompey, Robert Fielding Punnagka and Nura Rupert, donated works to the auction. A number of the artists also have pieces showing in the Tarnanthi exhibition at the Art Gallery of SA, which will run until January. The largest piece at the auction, a women’s collaborative work from Tjala Arts, was expected to sell for $30,000 alone. It sold for $69,000 and has been donated to the SA Museum to form part of an installation with dialysis machines about the impact of kidney failure in remote communities. In total, the auction raised $169,300, enough to open the doors of the new dialysis centre. Addressing the crowd following the auction, one Pukatja/Ernabella elder, who had been living in Adelaide to receive dialysis, said she was going to roll up her swag and “hit the road to Ernabella!”. Others who might otherwise have put off treatment to avoid leaving their home will also be able to receive treatment locally, Purple House chief executive Sarah Brown says. “There are a number of senior artists who have got family on dialysis and this will mean that they’ll be able to get home from Adelaide, Port Augusta and Alice Springs back to the APY lands, and there’s a lot of people who know that they’re going to need dialysis soon who may actually otherwise choose not to start dialysis and pass away on country,” she says. “And if that happens, all their cultural knowledge and all their creative spirit will be lost to the whole of Australia.” Diabetes is the second leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, behind heart disease. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, rates of death from diabetes in 2016 were 4.9 times higher for Indigenous Australians than non-Indigenous Australians. Indigenous people are five times more likely to be hospitalised from chronic kidney disease, whether linked to diabetes or other causes, than non-Indigenous Australians. In remote communities in the central desert region, Brown says, rates of kidney disease can be between 15 and 30 times the national average. Purple House opened its first remote dialysis centre at Kintore in the Pintupi homelands, 550km west of Alice Springs, in 2004. “We started to get people home, very gently and quietly and carefully, and people’s health just improved enormously,” Brown says. “People who had been stuck in town painting for carpetbaggers, dodgy art dealers, were suddenly back out in their community able to support their family through painting for their art centre.” The Kintore clinic and the central Purple House clinic in Alice Springs were kickstarted by funds raised at an art auction, just like the Pukatja centre. Subsequent centres have been built and run using mining royalties, government grants and philanthropic donations. Brown hopes a new Medicare item number for remote community dialysis, proposed by the expert taskforce conducting a review of the Medicare Benefits Scheme, will provide ongoing funding. “So then we know as long as people want to go home for dialysis and they’re well enough to go that we’ll have the money to be able to do it,” she says. “We’re really hoping that that’s going to start in the next year or so, and the donated money will run the service up until then. Anything left can go to making sure that this service is really robust and we’re working to help people get home safely.” • Guardian Australia travelled to Adelaide courtesy of the Art Gallery of South Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/15/the-question-that-should-be-asked-at-oxford-interviews","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:47:21Z","webTitle":"The question that should be asked at Oxford interviews | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/15/the-question-that-should-be-asked-at-oxford-interviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/15/the-question-that-should-be-asked-at-oxford-interviews","fields":{"headline":"The question that should be asked at Oxford interviews","bodyText":"Despite his profound knowledge of world history, in describing the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” (Report, 11 October), President Trump seems to have forgotten, for starters, the Munich agreement and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

He was appointed the first chief executive of the UK’s Higher Education Academy (HEA). His books, Learning to Teach in Higher Education (1991) and Learning to Lead in Higher Education (1998) have inspired thousands of academics to improve their professional practice. Born in Leeds to Mary (nee Ryder) and Ernest Ramsden, who worked in property insurance, he attended school locally and gained a BSc from the University of London and doctorate in education from Lancaster University before taking up a lecturing post at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University). In 1984 Paul emigrated to Australia accompanied by Elaine Martin; they married in 1993. Six years later he was appointed pro-vice chancellor (Teaching and Learning) at the University of Sydney. He was the architect of the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), a central feature of quality assurance in Australian higher education and the model for the UK’s National Student Survey, launched in 2005. Paul encountered a great deal of resistance to the CEQ from those opposed to performance measures, including professionals who could not accept that student feedback should be used as an indicator of good teaching. In 2004 Paul returned to the UK to become the founding chief executive of the HEA, the national body for promoting effective university teaching. In 2008 he served as an expert adviser to the British government on the future of teaching and the student experience, contributing a highly influential essay on the curriculum.

For daring to look at the Brexit small print","bodyText":"The book The Power of Positive Thinking introduced the notion that you can shape reality by mere “affirmations”. It has many adherents, as does the more recent nonsense of The Secret, which ascribes similar potency to “visualisation”. I suppose snake oil of this sort might help some people get through the day. But it is no basis upon which to govern a country – or to negotiate a country’s exit from a vast commercial and geopolitical alliance. Wishing upon a star is not enough for a successful departure from the EU. Yet this is precisely what the exasperated Jiminy Crickets of Brexit are demanding of chancellor Philip Hammond. On Thursday, John Redwood tweeted: “The Chancellor must get the Treasury to have more realistic, optimistic forecasts &amp; to find the money for a successful economy post Brexit.” Nadine Dorries, meanwhile, complained: “We need a ‘can-do’ man in the Treasury, not a prophet of doom.” By something close to constitutional convention, the chancellor is the government-of-the-day’s Dr No. Whoever holds this great office of state must personify prudence, protect the public finances, resist all harebrained schemes that will jeopardise jobs, or otherwise imperil prosperity. That, at least, is the job description. So it is innovative, not to say extremely stupid, to insist that Hammond suddenly pick up the pom-poms of the cheerleader and whoop that “Brexit totally rocks!” Maybe it’s just me, but I’d rather not have a chancellor who behaves like the man on the bungee launchpad paid to say “jump”. Not that we should be surprised. In politics, each action usually has an equal and opposite reaction, and the present calls for Hammond’s head are the symmetrical consequence of the briefing against Boris Johnson during the Conservative conference. In Manchester, the foreign secretary declared it was time to “let the British lion roar”. Now his fellow Brexiteers want the lion to bite off Hammond’s head. The latest charge levelled against the chancellor concerns his alleged failure to prepare with sufficient enthusiasm and application for a “no-deal” outcome. All departments have been instructed to make contingency plans for the collapse of David Davis’s negotiations with Michel Barnier. But Hammond’s foes want to see the public coffers opened, and money splashed out to make Britain ready for the cliff-edge. Of Hammond’s refusal to spend, former chancellor Lord Lawson said last week: “What he is doing is very close to sabotage.” Spent on what, though? Were Britain to crash out of the EU at the end of March 2019 without a deal, it would be subject to the rules of the World Trade Organisation – meaning export tariffs of 10% on cars, 36% on dairy products, and high levies on clothes, footwear, chemicals, aerospace transactions and much else. The customs system would grind to a halt. International regulation systems would vanish, replaced by an economically disastrous vacuum. It is pitifully deluded to suggest that spending a few billion here, and a few billion there, is going to prepare the UK for such an outcome. As Hammond himself has suggested, the only way for Britain to cope with such a calamity would be for it become an entirely different kind of country: low-tax, low-regulation, a Singapore of the west. The problem is that the British themselves would never tolerate the inevitable consequences of such a transformation – the drastic shrinkage of public services, the welfare state, and core social entitlements. Small wonder that Kenneth Clarke and other Tory remainers are tabling an amendment that would write the two-year transition plan into the EU withdrawal bill – effectively giving the Commons the ability to reject Brexit entirely if no agreement is reached with Brussels. At present this stands little chance of becoming law; but it will remind Theresa May and her whips that the parlous state of the EU talks is jeopardising her already-precarious majority. (At the same time, the Democratic Unionist party – whose 10 MPs are essential to the prime minister’s parliamentary survival – is said to be irritated by Hammond’s conduct.) As it happens, I believe that May’s public readiness to countenance a “no-deal” outcome reflects a strategy rather than a secret yearning. She calculates that the EU will not negotiate fairly unless its 27 other member states believe we are ready to walk away without an agreement. But, as the months pass and the talks stall, I also sense that a growing number of Brexiteers see “no deal” not as a threat but as an objective. Before the election one cabinet minister close to the talks told me that “life under WTO rules would be perfectly OK, you know.” Really? At the same time, to take a specific example, there is serious talk of shifting from the jurisdiction of the European Medicines Agency to that of the US Food and Drug Administration: the FDA may be in Maryland, but at least it is not subject to the European court of justice. Again: is this truly what Britons were voting for in last year’s referendum? For daring to look at the small print of Brexit and failing to declare the whole process “doubleplusgood”, Hammond is now pilloried by the faction within his party that, whatever its numerical strength, shouts loudest. A senior Tory told me recently that what the country needed was not a new centre party but a proper Conservative party. His point was that the Tory movement, once remorselessly committed to the business of government and the hard realities of office, had sailed off into the seas of ideology, captured by a gang of pirates seeking the imagined treasure of Brexit Island. In her interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Hillary Clinton reflected that, in modern politics, “being thoughtful is viewed as being somehow inauthentic. If you’re taking your time formulating an answer to a very difficult question … that’s not as immediately satisfying as coming out with some rhetorical blast.” The defeated presidential candidate wondered if there were resonances in this country, and indeed there are. Hammond is hated by his enemies because he puts fact before emotion, and refuses to join in the feelgood fantasia. It is bleakly ironic that those who are working hardest to mitigate the most damaging consequences of Brexit are routinely accused of undermining the whole process. If only the chancellor would think positively, it would all be fine. Wouldn’t it? • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/16/english-school-budgets-facing-breaking-point-warn-headteachers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"English school budgets facing 'breaking point', warn headteachers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/16/english-school-budgets-facing-breaking-point-warn-headteachers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/16/english-school-budgets-facing-breaking-point-warn-headteachers","fields":{"headline":"English school budgets facing 'breaking point', warn headteachers","bodyText":"Headteachers are to warn MPs that school budgets in England are facing “breaking point” after a combined £2.8bn in cuts and costs imposed upon them by the government. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is writing to all Westminster MPs to highlight the plight of state schools in England suffering from funding shortages, in which it tells the politicians that standards are at risk. The letter contains a blunt plea from Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary, for MPs to lobby Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and ask for more resources for schools ahead of next month’s autumn statement. “The autumn budget is the last chance for money to make it to schools this year,” Whiteman said. “Please write to the chancellor of the exchequer to ask him to announce more money for schools.” Privately, school leaders are concerned that Brexit and other education issues – especially university tuition fees and student loans – are crowding school funding concerns off the political agenda. With the Department for Education and the Treasury having already made major concessions on student loans, and with the possibility of more to come, headteachers fear there are few resources available for schools. Whiteman said he believed the message had not been getting through to MPs about the extent of the crisis in schools, despite education being “a vote-changer for nearly a million people on polling day” at the last election. In his letter, Whiteman tells MPs: “I’d be very surprised indeed if you hadn’t heard from a headteacher or a parent expressing concerns about school funding over the last few months. “And yet, there’s a concern amongst school leaders, that despite the hundreds of letters written, and the thousands of parents, families and governors who have become campaigners, many MPs have failed to grasp the severity of the issue.” The NAHT also plans to have members lobby parliament directly later this week. It has detailed how changes by the government since 2015 has resulted in £2.8bn being taken out of school’s frontline budgets. The changes include national insurance and pension increases that have cut teaching budgets by 5.5%, as well as £600m-worth of cuts made to the education services grant used to fund services such as facilities management and legal advice. Promises of higher pay for teachers will also have to be met out of current budgets, making the situation worse. The letter to MPs also points out that many schools and academies will have to pay a further 0.5% cut of their payroll for the government’s new apprenticeship levy. The DfE has already announced an extra £1.3bn for schools between 2018-20, but the headteachers argue that is still below the further £2bn a year schools need to keep their budgets at the same level as 2015-16. The NAHT’s campaign follows last month’s move by 4,000 headteachers to write to parents, telling them there is “simply not enough money in the system” to fund schools properly. In response, the DfE said the new national funding formula being introduced by the government, alongside the extra £1.3bn announced by the education secretary. Justine Greening, would see funding distributed more fairly to each school."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2017/oct/17/after-the-survey-we-need-a-prompt-path-to-legislation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T04:31:17Z","webTitle":"After the survey, we need a prompt path to legislation | Alex Greenwich and Anna Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/oct/17/after-the-survey-we-need-a-prompt-path-to-legislation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/oct/17/after-the-survey-we-need-a-prompt-path-to-legislation","fields":{"headline":"After the survey, we need a prompt path to legislation","bodyText":"Over the past month, almost 11 million Australians have responded to the postal survey, mailing in their forms on whether same-sex couples should be able to marry. If the will of the Australian people is reflected in the results, then our nation will be expecting politicians to listen, to act decisively and to get marriage equality done so we can unite around a reform that will bring our country together in a celebration of fairness and equality. We may not know the results yet, but we have seen people across the country taking the opportunity to vote yes for a fairer society for all. This is not a process that started when the government announced the postal survey. It is one that has been going on for well over a decade. During this time support for marriage equality has grown to the point where it is far more popular than any political party. But the journey to marriage equality will not end with the announcement of survey results on 15 November. If yes is successful, legislation will still need to be passed by the parliament. The country and the world will be watching our parliament closely. The postal survey result will hopefully put an end to politicians in Canberra playing games with the lives and dignity of same-sex couples across Australia. The result would provide MPs and senators with the opportunity to pass a reform that will bring great happiness and take from no one. After being sent the bill for the government’s $120m survey, voters should not stomach any attempts by fringe elements to muddy the waters, or delay reform with amendments that bring more, not less, discrimination. With millions of votes being posted, we will expect urgent action and a fair bill. Australians are voting to give citizens the freedom to marry the person they love. We are not voting to increase discrimination or wind back long-standing legal protections. Fortunately the legislative pathway is there. Prior to the postal survey commencing, a group of Liberal MPs and senators released a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry while protecting the religious celebration of marriage for people of faith. Currently, religious ministers aren’t compelled to marry anyone they don’t want to. This, along with other protections, won’t change with marriage equality. The bill followed a robust multi-party Senate inquiry tasked with developing legislation. The findings from this inquiry, headed by Senator David Fawcett, have shaped the bill’s protections for religious freedoms. In a debate too often mired in seemingly intractable positions and wedge politics, this bill is a game changer. It would deliver equality for same-sex couples and it also ensures that faith communities can continue to celebrate religious marriage. The bill is so robust it was welcomed by faith leaders, LGBTI organisations, the Labor party, crossbenchers, and key figures in the Coalition including federal Liberal party president Nick Greiner. This represents an incredible consensus, something rare in today’s political world. After 15 November, there should be no more excuse for delay. We’ve got the bill, we’re having the postal survey – let’s get this done by the end of the year so we can all get on with our lives and celebrate living in a country where everyone is given a fair go.

His work has been acknowledged by British royalty, hung in the drawing rooms of the mega-rich and exhibited worldwide. His coveted, creviced landscapes of valleys, copses and bone-dry riverbeds, with their softened palettes of primary colours that defy caricature of the desert and its harsh light, sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars on the rare occasions they come under the auctioneer’s hammer. The sidelines of associated merchandise – postcards, tea towels, biscuits tins, for example – are worth a fortune in themselves. So it is shocking – perhaps astonishing to some – that Namatjira’s Arrernte family should, for several generations, have endured intense poverty because they did not own the copyright to his work. But it should not be at all surprising given the Commonwealth of Australia’s historic and ongoing treatment of its Indigenous people – even those it has regarded as appropriately assimilated or culturally “exceptional” by its own norms. The vaults of museums and auction houses the world over are bursting with the priceless works of some of the finest artists in the world, taken on completion before the paint could dry or “traded” in exchange for tobacco – their only legacy now, in the communities from which they were appropriated, is a generational addiction to tobacco with all its associated disease and suffering. But the copyright to Namatjira’s works has finally transferred to his grandchildren. It followed a long battle between, on the one side, the family and their pro-bono legal representatives Arnold Bloch Leibler, the social change organisation BIGhArt and leading cultural institutions and, on the other, Legend Press, a non-Indigenous Sydney art publisher that has enjoyed majority or full control of Namatjira’s copyright for six decades. The continuous pressure from the family and its supporters, coupled with a recent intervention by the entrepreneur Dick Smith, a childhood friend of the Brackenreg family that owns Legend Press, and the campaigning journalism of Rosemary Neill of the Australian and the ABC’s Daniel Browning, resulted in a deal late last week to transfer the copyright to the artist’s descendants. The arrangement will be worth, potentially, millions of dollars to the Namatjira clan and their community. It will also give them (through the Namatjira Legacy trust) control over how copies of the painter’s work are commercially – or otherwise – used in, for example, catalogues for his exhibited paintings. The family (and some galleries) has argued that such use has been at best highly restrictive. It is a wonderful result for Namatjira’s legacy and, of course, his people. But it is also a salient reminder of just how oppressive post-colonial Australian society was for Indigenous people less than an average (white) lifetime ago, how pitifully slowly things have changed and of the enduring inequity between black and white Australia. The complex story of how the Namatjira copyright was sold in full to Legend in 1983 (after, in 1957, the artist having entered an agreement with the then principal of Legend, John Brackenreg, for a 12% royalty) by the Northern Territory public trustee, has been well told. The then public advocate has even publicly expressed his regret at the 1983 sale of the Namatjira copyright for $8,500, which was made without any consultation of the family. While the long tussle over the copyright has pitted moral against legal rights, the central – and sometimes, perhaps, overlooked – issue has always been the fundamental denial of Indigenous agency. For it is hard to imagine that Australia would ever permit the family of any non-Indigenous artist of Namatjira’s cultural stature to be treated accordingly in the 1950s let alone the 1980s. White Australia – as it then, in the 50s, knew itself – had embraced Namatjira ... to a point. It’s often said he operated between two worlds (black and white), as one of the first Indigenous people to be granted citizenship and, hypothetically at least, its associated privileges. His embrace of some whitefella painting techniques to bring his watercolours a more actual or literal interpretation of country (as opposed to earlier more figurative Indigenous paintings, that so appealed to ethnologists and anthropologists, of creationist stories and myth) drew European eyes. But they also inspired occasional critics among some of his people, who thought he should stick with his more traditional painterly and craft roots, and the white salons and academies who unfairly dismissed his work as derivative. Namatjira’s life played out tragically. But the resolution of his copyright restores appropriate dignity to his legacy and justice to his family. It is not, however, the end. Indigenous art and culture more broadly – story in all its forms including visual art – has been appropriated since first colonial contact. If the story of Namatjira’s copyright has a broader resonance it is that sadly many other Indigenous creators will probably never, in life or posthumously, be afforded such agency. • Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/20/canada-national-pharmacare-prescription-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T10:30:05Z","webTitle":"The serious flaw in Canada's healthcare system: prescription drugs aren't free","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/canada-national-pharmacare-prescription-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/20/canada-national-pharmacare-prescription-drugs","fields":{"headline":"The serious flaw in Canada's healthcare system: prescription drugs aren't free","bodyText":"In his campaign for universal publicly funded healthcare in the US, Bernie Sanders has repeatedly held up Canada’s system as an example, highlighting the pride Canadians take in the idea that medical care is a right for everyone. But his legislation would aim to go further, addressing a critical shortcoming: that Canada is the only developed country in the world with a universal healthcare system that does not cover essential medications. “It’s a big issue, a big problem,” Danielle Martin, a Toronto doctor, told Sanders in a recent podcast. “I have patients who take their pills every other day, or who take them for a few weeks and then have to wait until the cheque comes in to fill it again.” The gap, said Martin, was partly because Canada’s system was designed in the 1960s, when prescription medication was less of a focus for care. Today Canadians, however, face the second-highest drug costs in the industrialised world, after Americans. And they are forced to cover those costs either out of their own pockets, or through a patchwork of provincial and private drug plans. The result has left many in Canada choosing between meeting their basic needs or complying with the doctors’ orders, said Hassan Yussuff of the Canadian Labour Congress. “If you’re not fortunate enough to work for a sizeable employer that has the resources to provide you with benefits, you’re left on your own,” he said. His organisation, which represents labour unions across Canada, recently launched a campaign for a national pharmacare plan. “This patchwork that we have throughout the country is devastating for working Canadians,” he said. “We believe anyone with healthcare should have coverage for the medication they need.” About 700,000 Canadians – many of them in precarious or lower-paid jobs – have no prescription drug coverage at all, while another 3.6 million are believed to have coverage that falls short of allowing them to afford medications, according to estimates from the government. “What we do know is that far too many Canadians are going without medication,” said Yussuff. “Studies have indicated they’re splitting their medication, they’re sharing their medication and in some cases not taking it.” This month, the country’s New Democratic party (NDP) introduced a motion to force the federal government to begin laying the groundwork for a universal pharmacare program. “Here is the absurdity,” the NDP MP Don Davies told the House of Commons as he put forward the legislation. “If someone cuts a finger, he or she goes to the doctor who stitches it up, and the individual leaves and never sees a bill. However, if people go to a doctor and their ailment needs to be treated by medication, they are at the mercy of their ability to pay.” While the legislation has little chance of passing without support from Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party, which holds a majority in parliament, the NDP motion got a recent boost from the country’s parliamentary budget officer. The independent government agency estimated that a national pharmacare program – under which one entity would negotiate bulk purchases of pharmaceuticals for all Canadians – could slash the overall cost of prescriptions in the country by more than C$4bn a year. But more than C$19bn in net costs to run the program would probably fall on the federal government. Supporters of the proposal say that the system already shoulders a high price for patients who can’t afford to take their medications. Davies gave the example of a diabetic patient who ended up in intensive care after being unable to pay for insulin. The single hospital visit, he said, “costs more money than providing free medication for life”. Recent research suggests that a national pharmacare scheme could save Canadians as much as C$11bn a year, said Steve Morgan, a professor at the University of British Columbia. “My research group’s best available estimate to date is in the ballpark of about $7bn a year in savings.” The idea has begun to gain traction, with one poll suggesting that as many as 91% of Canadians are in support. “I think it has to do with the extent that Canadian medicare is a source of pride for Canadians,” said Morgan. “Particularly at this point in history, this idea that only the United States does what Canada does on pharmaceuticals is probably a source of embarrassment.” The federal government is not currently considering adopting the program, however, but a spokesperson for the country’s health department, Health Canada, said the government had budgeted C$140m over five years to lower drug prices and improve Canadians’ access to prescription drugs. “By working collaboratively with provinces, territories and other partners, we will lower drug prices, provide timely access to new medicines if they are effective, and improve patient care through more appropriate prescribing.” The government’s stance echoes what the Canadian Labour Congress heard earlier this year when it lobbied for universal pharmacare. Many of them liked the idea but balked at the cost, said Yussuff. His organisation is digging in its heels, readying for what is likely to be years of campaigning. “We know a little bit about taking on big national issues – it’s been part of our history over the years,” said Yussuff, whose organisation spent nearly nine years campaigning – successfully – to expand Canada’s pension plan. He described this campaign in the same vein – a hard-fought battle seeking to address an inequality that has become normalised in Canada. “Nobody should have to choose between paying for groceries or the medication they need,” he said. “Those choices should not be happening in a modern country as ours.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/17/dries-mertens-napoli-street-dog-striker-manchester-city-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T08:59:09Z","webTitle":"Dries Mertens, Napoli’s street dog striker, sets sights on Manchester City | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/dries-mertens-napoli-street-dog-striker-manchester-city-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/17/dries-mertens-napoli-street-dog-striker-manchester-city-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Dries Mertens, Napoli’s street dog striker, sets sights on Manchester City","bodyText":"In isolation there was nothing special about the goal, almost exactly a year ago, that gave Napoli brief parity in a group-stage tie with Besiktas. It was a sharp enough finish from Dries Mertens, getting across his man to stab in José Callejón’s low centre, but the headline was that they proceeded to lose at San Paolo for the second time in four days. The fact that the Turkish champions had joined Roma in putting three past Napoli at home looked of much greater consequence than a stand-in striker’s demonstration of instinct. Thirty-eight goals later, Mertens, who takes on Manchester City with Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday night, has been the dominant force in a side whose irresistible form suggests a first Serie A title in 28 years may be a matter of time. Few could have seen this coming from Mertens, previously a capable winger who had an eye for goal but had largely played second fiddle on the left to Lorenzo Insigne since joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2013. A serious injury to Arkadiusz Milik led Maurizio Sarri to test a hunch that Mertens could fill the void up front; the rest is history and, were anything to happen to Mertens now, the gap would more resemble a chasm. “I never thought he could be a striker like he is now – never thought it,” says Marco Heering, who was the assistant manager at the Dutch club AGOVV Apeldoorn when Mertens spent three formative years there between 2006 and 2009. “I’m very, very surprised. He started in midfield for us and then we used him on the flanks, as he had good actions and could learn to run better with the ball in that space. The way he is playing now is unbelievable, and it’s because he is very smart.” That spell at AGOVV, who were in the second tier and sought to improve by developing young talents such as Mertens and Nacer Chadli, accelerated a career that was yet to take off as planned. Mertens had not convinced in his native Belgium at Anderlecht or Gent, who both doubted the durability of his 5ft 7in frame. Heering remembers a 19-year-old who, when he arrived on an initial season-long loan, struggled on heavy winter pitches and looked more comfortable refining his evident technique on an artificial surface. He could dribble and pick a pass better than most of his team-mates; now he needed moulding into a team player who could master the game’s dirtier side. He has got the hang of it. Sarri called Mertens a “little animal” last month and the player compared himself to a “street dog” in an interview earlier this year. Mertens’ hunger is unstinting: many of his goals have been attributable to a sharpness and aggression that confound even the hardest-wired of Italian centre-backs but he has come alive outside the box too, dropping off to participate in buildups that Pep Guardiola believes are unrivalled in Europe. Although Heering says he and AGOVV’s then-manager, John van den Brom, would “never, never, never, never, never” have contemplated fielding Mertens through the middle, there were a few pointers in hindsight. “After training he would stay and shoot at goal from every distance,” he remembers. “We knew he could play football very well, but you must score too. That’s something he worked at all day, every day. You need that attitude to become the player he is now.” Mertens was known for being a compulsive trainer, often joining his housemate Chadli to agitate for extra sessions on the pretext that they could otherwise be bouncing off the walls. The fruit of those labours has become clear. Mertens’ range of expression has been breathtaking and the whipped, angled finish over the stranded Lazio goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, last month drew instant comparison to a famous goal Diego Maradona scored against the same opponents in 1985. The 30-year-old is not at the old master’s level but if Napoli – yet to drop a point in the league – maintain their momentum then the city’s street artists will be preparing a few fresh murals in six months’ time. “He’s becoming bigger and bigger and bigger,” says Heering, who is now assistant at Almere City FC. “Normally 25 to 28 is the best time for a player but since his 28th birthday he has become better, and maybe it’s because of the position he plays now in a very good team. The way Napoli plays, so positive and with everything on the ground, is exactly the way he likes it.” Sarri lamented after Mertens’ flourish against Lazio that his calling had been discovered only recently, saying he “could have been at the top level in the world for years and years”. But football is rarely that simple and it is as well to bask in the present. Mertens was rested for Napoli’s last Champions League away match, a surprise defeat at Shakhtar Donetsk, but can be expected to play against City even if the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, would rather focus on the weekend’s Serie A match with title rivals Internazionale. A decisive statement against Guardiola’s team would suggest the importance of that unremarkable strike in October 2016 is looking greater all the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/iraq-kurdish-forces-army-us-military","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T21:46:42Z","webTitle":"US military rushes to defuse looming crisis in Kirkuk after Iraqi army advances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/iraq-kurdish-forces-army-us-military","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/iraq-kurdish-forces-army-us-military","fields":{"headline":"US military rushes to defuse looming crisis in Kirkuk after Iraqi army advances","bodyText":"US military commanders are scrambling to stop a conflict escalating between two forces they arm and train, after the Iraqi army seized the contested, oil-rich city of Kirkuk, from Kurdish peshmerga. The Pentagon sought to play down the scale of clashes between the two sides, after forces loyal to the central government in Baghdad rapidly took over nearly all the city on Monday, and Kurdish forces abandoned their positions, retreating to nearby oilfields. Video footage showed streams of Kurdish refugees leaving Kirkuk in cars. Baghdad’s move came three weeks after a referendum on Kurdish independence included the ethnically diverse oil city – a contentious move that Baghdad viewed as an effective annexation. The peshmerga withdrawal delivered decisive military and political gains to Baghdad and a devastating blow to the Kurdish region’s de facto president, Massoud Barzani, who had staked much of his legacy on the referendum and aimed to use it as a stepping stone to consolidate Kurdish autonomy. Col Robert Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, described the takeover, as “coordinated movements, not attacks” and said an exchange of fire that is reported to have resulted in several casualties was “an isolated incident”. “We have not seen levels of violences suggested in some of the media reports,” Manning said, urging both parties to focus on the “common threat” of the Islamic State. “This is certainly not helpful and again we encourage both sides to not fight each other.” He added that US commanders in the region were active in trying to mediate between the two sides in the city. “Coalition leaders at all levels are engaging with their counterparts in the Iraq security forces to encourage dialogue and de-escalation,” Manning said. Speaking at the White House, Donald Trump said: “We don’t like the fact that they are clashing, but we’re not taking sides.” But the US embassy in Baghdad declared its support for Iraq’s reassertion of sovereignty in Kirkuk. “We support the peaceful reassertion of federal authority, consistent with the Iraqi constitution, in all disputed areas,” the embassy said in a statement. The confrontation with Kurdish forces is a serious threat to US efforts to focus its allies’ efforts against Isis, an effort in which Kurdish forces have been Washington’s most effective partner. There was also concern in Washington over the role of Iran in the move into Kirkuk. The Iraqi army advanced alongside mostly Shia Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), which are Iranian-backed. “I am especially concerned by media reports that Iranian and Iranian-backed forces are part of the assault. Iraqi forces must take immediate steps to de-escalate this volatile situation by ceasing their advances,” Senator John McCain said in a written statement. “The United States provided equipment and training to the government of Iraq to fight Isis and secure itself from external threats – not to attack elements of one of its own regional governments, which is a longstanding and valuable partner of the United States.” Manning said the Pentagon had been assured by the Iraqi government and security forces that they would use US equipment “in accordance with US law and our bilateral agreements”. “If we receive reports that US-origin equipment is being misused or provided to unauthorized users, we engage the Iraqi government in conjunction with the US embassy to address any confirmed issues – up to the highest levels, if necessary,” Manning added. He also said he was not aware of any direct Iranian involvement in the Kirkuk operation though the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds force, Gen Qassem Suleimani – and PMU officials loyal to Iran’s supreme leader – are reported to have directed the offensive. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior foreign policy adviser to the Iranian supreme leader, praised the Iraqi army’s move to capture Kirkuk, framing it as a blow to Israel’s strategic ambitions. “With the defeat of the Kurds in Kirkuk, Barzani’s conspiracy against the region’s security was foiled. Barzani’s aim and Israel’s covert aim were to seize Kirkuk’s oilfields to serve the Israeli interest. In the Kurdistan region, they raise the flag of Israel and this means if Kurds gain independence in Iraq, we will share a border with Israel,” Velayati said, according to the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim news. The Kirkuk governor, Najmladin Karim, has gone into hiding according to a former state department official, David Philips, who spoke to Karim on Sunday night at the time of the offensive. “This was an attack by Shia militias under an Iranian commander,” Philips, who is now director of Columbia University programme on peace-building and rights. “The PMU is an entirely Iranian construct,” he added. “This operation was about Iran against Kurdistan.” Philips pointed out that the US special envoy for the anti-Isis coalition, Brett McGurk, was in Baghdad over the weekend for talks with the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi. “I would like to know what he and Abadi talked about,” he said. “The long history of links to the Kurds didn’t seem to matter when it came to crunch time.” In a statement on Monday, Abadi said: “We have only acted to fulfil our constitutional duty to extend the federal authority and impose security and protect the national wealth in this city, which we want to remain a city of peaceful coexistence for all Iraqis.” Kirkuk was seized by the Kurds in the summer of 2014, after Iraqi forces fled their positions following an Isis attack on nearby Mosul. At the time, peshmerga units beat Isis militants in a race to control installations and oilfields. Ever since, Erbil has tried to strengthen its claim on the city, which comprises Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen and is the epicentre of regional oil production. Kurdish officials had set up a pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey, through which they had been selling crude oil – amid bitter opposition from Baghdad. The withdrawal of Kurdish forces underscores a deep rivalry between two political blocs in Iraqi Kurdistan, which came to a head in the past three days as Iraqi forces and allied Shia units stalked Kurdish forces from south of the city. Some leaders of the PUK bloc, based in the region’s second city, Sulaymaniyah, had viewed the referendum as a partisan move by Barzani to consolidate domestic control. The veteran leader had instead insisted that the ballot represented a defining moment in Kurdish history, which he hoped would transcendhelp overcome longstanding disunity. Divisions, however, were on stark display, as the peshmerga units capitulated, shocking even members of the two feuding parties. The general command of Kurdistan’s peshmerga slammed the PUK for what it described as a “major historic betrayal”. In contrast, Iraqi leaders, including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Haidar al-Ameri, both senior commanders of the Popular Mobilisation units – a conglomerate of largely Shia forces, arrived in Kirkuk mid-afternoon to witness the Iraqi flag being raised at the governor’s office. The decision to hold the ballot had drawn strident criticism from Iran, Turkey, Baghdad and the US. Baghdad and Tehran have blockaded the Kurdish north for the past two weeks, closing air space and partially suspending trade. Shia units pressed into Kirkuk’s southern outskirts early on Monday and civilians started leaving the city en masse. Aziz Ahmad, an aide to the Erbil-based security tsar, Masrour Barzani, said rival security officials of the PUK bloc, had “betrayed Kirkuk and [the people of] Kurdistan, conceded to Iran and withdrew from frontlines without a fight”. Peshmerga units loyal to Barzani remain in control of two oilfields north of Kirkuk and said they had no intention of surrendering them. But the remaining Kurdish forces appear to have little chance of holding back a bigger and better armed foe, should the central government choose to attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/17/its-a-folly-to-dismiss-city-warnings-over-brexit-transition-deal-delay","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T05:20:27Z","webTitle":"It's a folly to dismiss City warnings over Brexit transition deal delay | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/17/its-a-folly-to-dismiss-city-warnings-over-brexit-transition-deal-delay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/17/its-a-folly-to-dismiss-city-warnings-over-brexit-transition-deal-delay","fields":{"headline":"It's a folly to dismiss City warnings over Brexit transition deal delay","bodyText":"TheCityUK is a lobbying group whose dire warnings about the potential loss of trade and jobs from the City of London tend to infuriate true believers in Brexit. Too gloomy, say hardcore Brexiters. A few jobs may go, runs their argument, but Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Dublin are too small to inflict lasting damage on London. Besides, the rest of the EU will come to its senses eventually and realise that a fragmented European financial industry would serve nobody’s interests, apart from perhaps New York’s. There is some truth in those objections, of course, since it is true that London currently plays in a different league as a European financial centre. But it is also time for all sides to acknowledge TheCityUK was 100% correct on a common-sense point it has shouted from the rooftops from the outset: a transitional deal that is signed at the eleventh hour of negotiations won’t be worth much. Sam Woods, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, captured the argument when he said “diminishing marginal returns” would start to kick in around Christmas. “Firms would start discounting the likelihood of a transition in the central case of their planning,” he said. Indeed, there was more than a whiff of contingency plans being executed when Goldman Sachs said this month it will lease eight floors of new office block in Frankfurt, enough to house 800 people. Does Goldman actually want to add 800 jobs in Frankfurt? One suspects not. Like most big London-concentrated investment banks, it would prefer Brexit to involve as little disruption to its business as possible. But, in the absence of transitional deal, it has to cover all possibilities. For Goldman et al, it doesn’t matter if UK division or EU belligerence is mostly to blame for the current stalemate. Banks just look at their own interests, which means keeping clients and local regulators happy. TheCityUK may have examples like Goldman’s in mind when it now warns of decisions by firms becoming “increasingly irreversible, resulting in activities being permanently located outside the UK”. As it says, companies don’t like having double running costs. The lobby group’s own approximate deadline for a transitional arrangement to be useful is the first quarter of next year “at the latest”. That is as good a guess as any. The most gruesome predictions of the eventual whack to the City – up to 75,000 and £8bn-£10bn in lost tax revenues – still feel too dramatic. But it’s no longer possible to dismiss the figures, as some Brexiters do, as a flight of fancy. Events are happening on the ground. How ConvaTec fell ill ConvaTec is one of those FTSE 100 companies that rarely commands attention because its business – making medical products such as colostomy bags, catheters and wound care treatments – seems so dull. How wrong we were. ConvaTec managed to remove 25% of its stock value, equivalent to £1.3bn, with a thumping profits warning on Monday. ConvaTec has made a botch of the superficially simple job of shutting a factory in North Carolina in the US and shifting its production to the Dominican Republic. The move didn’t go as planned, output was constrained and a backlog of orders built up. A hurricane didn’t help the dispatch of goods either. The company may call this is “a temporary but painful setback” but you can understand why the shares were savaged. First, there should have been a better back-up plan: ConvaTec could have held more stock in reserve. Second, the company undermined its big pitch to investors at flotation last year. The promise was that gross margins could be improved by three percentage points by 2020 but, while the ambition remains, the arrival date is now up in the air. Third, ConvaTec has destroyed the easy idea that a big operator in a growing market could be relied upon to improve revenues at an annual clip of 5% or so. Organic growth will be between 1% and 2% this year, the company says now. Is it completely coincidental that ConvaTec was owned by two private equity houses before last year’s float at 225p? Private equity, remember, has a reputation for hollowing out businesses before offering them for sale. On this occassion, however, it’s hard to make the charge stick. Nordic and Avista may have flogged the bulk of their stake at prices far higher than Monday’s closing level of 205p, but the production cock-up seems to a straightforward case of over-ambition and bad planning. That nuance, however, won’t help to restore ConvaTec’s City reputation. Famous chairman Sir Christopher Gent, once of Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline, has his work cut out. Aramco IPO and China Saudi Arabia’s latest idea, it is reported, is to forget about an international listing for Aramco, the state oil company, and instead flog a 5% stake to Chinese investors. This plan could definitely be achieved since China would probably be willing to play ball, and might even pay a higher initial price than international investors would. But it’s hard to see how the Saudis’ long-term interests would improve. If the country’s rulers want permanent access to ready cash, they need to widen the pool of investors in Aramco. Having to ring Beijing when you want to sell the next 5% is not a good position to be in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-austrian-elections-an-old-threat-in-a-new-guise","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T18:18:30Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Austrian elections: an old threat in a new guise | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-austrian-elections-an-old-threat-in-a-new-guise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-austrian-elections-an-old-threat-in-a-new-guise","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Austrian elections: an old threat in a new guise","bodyText":"Back in 2000, when the late Jörg Haider’s far-right Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), which had won 27% of the vote in the general election the previous autumn, joined the centre-right Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) in government in Vienna, governments in Europe and beyond reacted with shock and outrage. The EU imposed diplomatic sanctions. The European parliament said Austria should be suspended if the new government breached European principles. Israel withdrew its ambassador. The New York Times urged the Clinton administration to do likewise. In the event, the ÖVP-FPÖ coalition survived its pariah status uneasily for five years, then fell apart in 2005. Today, 17 years on from that first coalition, a second coalition between the two parties of the right now seems likely. In Sunday’s Austrian general election the People’s party and the Freedom party emerged as the big winners, with 32% and 26% of the vote respectively after a campaign in which they vied with one another to attack migration through the Balkans and the perceived threat to Austria from what the ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz called “political Islam”. Between them, the two parties increased their share of the vote by 13%. Mr Kurz greeted the result as a mandate for change. A new alliance between the two is therefore the most likely outcome, though it is not the only one. The social democratic SPÖ, which held its own on Sunday with 27%, voted today to begin talks with the Freedom party so see if it could thwart Mr Kurz. A renewed centre party coalition between the ÖVP and the SPÖ, of the kind that has ruled since 2006, is not out of the question either. Any thought that the FPÖ has become an untouchable ally for the mainstream parties in Austria has thus fallen at the first fence. International calls to treat any Austrian government that includes the FPÖ as a pariah are conspicuous by their absence too. These are developments that should be deplored. Yet there are many reasons for the more fatalistic approach. One is that the FPÖ has refocused since 2008. Its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, has tried to soften the neo-Nazi image, articulating an Islamophobia widely shared in parts of Austria. Another is Mr Kurz’s reinvention of the ÖVP as a vehicle for his brash youthful low tax populism, which has rebranded one of the pillars of Austria’s political corporatism. A third is the volatile interface between unemployment, migration and a society which, in some eyes, has seen itself as the frontline defence of Christendom against Islam since at least the time of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. Like the rest of Europe, politics in Austria exhibit distinctive national characteristics as well as broader continental ones. But Austria’s move to the right has striking echoes of that in neighbouring Hungary. It is a reminder that, two years after the migration crisis in the Balkans, the issues still trigger anger and threaten establishment parties. The new government in Vienna, whatever form it takes, is likely to add Austria’s voice to others in central and southern Europe that will approach the problems of Europe from a more sharply nationalistic standpoint. The rightward lurch in Austria, coinciding with the showdown between Catalonia and Spain, is also a reminder that the populist ferment in Europe takes different forms but is far from dead. Hopes that the election of President Macron and the re-election of Chancellor Merkel marked the end of the populist wave are clearly an oversimplication. Mrs Merkel will be only too conscious of this; her party lost an important regional election in its one-time stronghold in Lower Saxony on Sunday. The deepening of the union proposed by Mr Macron in September looks a more daunting prospect than before. Nevertheless, when Theresa May joins other EU leaders for this week’s Brussels summit, she should not go as another nationalist disrupter but as the leader of a country whose interests lie in a constructive and engaged approach to our continent’s many problems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/16/dejan-lovren-accuses-romelu-lukaku-liverpool-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T11:26:59Z","webTitle":"Dejan Lovren accuses Romelu Lukaku of deliberately kicking him in the face","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/16/dejan-lovren-accuses-romelu-lukaku-liverpool-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/16/dejan-lovren-accuses-romelu-lukaku-liverpool-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Dejan Lovren accuses Romelu Lukaku of deliberately kicking him in the face","bodyText":"Dejan Lovren has made the startling claim that Romelu Lukaku deliberately kicked him in the face during Liverpool’s goalless draw with Manchester United. The Croatia defender made the accusation in Slovenia, where Liverpool are preparing for their Champions League tie against Maribor on Tuesday night, after it was confirmed Lukaku will face no action over a seemingly accidental collision between the pair on Saturday. Lovren appeared to be caught by the United striker’s heel as Lukaku extricated himself from a challenge shortly before half-time on Saturday. The referee took no action and the Football Association has backed his judgment by deciding the Belgium striker should face no charges. The Liverpool defender, however, has claimed contact was deliberate and that Lukaku’s demeanour after the incident demonstrated guilt. “I made a tackle there, I felt he was over me and he could move away, but, to be -honest, my point of view is that he did it on purpose,” Lovren said. “Even if he did it normally he would apologise after that but I saw that he was nervous during the game so maybe that was also the reason [why he didn’t apologise].” Asked whether he was disappointed that the FA had decided United’s £75m summer signing has no case to answer, Lovren said: “That happened on the pitch and it is over. I cannot change it and no one can change it so that is what I am thinking about. This is not my decision. I cannot say I am disappointed but it is what it is. We need to move on. That is football, part of the game.” The fallout from the Premier League game on Saturday has been more noteworthy than the match itself. Lovren also claimed that Liverpool’s defending at Anfield ensured United “did not cross the centre of the pitch” while Jürgen Klopp, who suggested that Lukaku could have been sent off, insists he will not have to rotate players against Maribor as Saturday’s game was not physically taxing. Liverpool’s situation in Group E, two points from two games they arguably should have won, also ensures that Klopp cannot take selection risks against the Slovenian champions. The Liverpool manager said: “The Man United game was not that intense because it was like it was. We don’t have to rotate because of intensity physically, but mentally we could do a little bit. It is a moment now where all of us have rhythm so the last thing I would do is come here to rotate in a game like this where already everybody is saying: ‘That’s the easy one in the group.’ And then I come with six or seven changes? No, we respect this opponent, we know it is unbelievably important for us, so nobody should expect 11 changes. “In this moment it is the key game because it is the only game we can play now. Now we have twice Maribor and we know what we have to do: we have to get the points. Of course it is like this but it doesn’t make the job any easier. It is clear, we have to win, and we should not waste time. We want to go to the next round but now it is only possible if we start collecting points. We cannot break through unless we start collecting points.” One player pressing for inclusion is the £40m summer signing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has made a quiet start to his Liverpool career but impressed as a late substitute against José Mourinho’s team. Klopp admits the former Arsenal midfielder’s assimilation has not been ideal but is adamant that, with time, the England international will become an important asset to Liverpool. Klopp said: “Since Alex came in he has been twice with the national team, there have been a lot of games with no training and so his start has been interrupted. He is a big signing for us, obviously, but a fast player like him needs the circumstances to perform so he needed time. So far it has been OK but not what we know he is able to do. But then Saturday, bang – comes on, uses his speed, really spot-on, it was a very nice sign. I loved to see it. “Apart from Mo Salah, who we have been working with for four or five months, the rest have been together with me for pretty much 15-16 months and that makes a big difference. Obviously it is a different style to Arsenal and a different role to the wing-back role he played in his last games for Arsenal. Then he plays for England and they all come back from their national teams not confused but with different plans. That is not too simple. “I would say there has been no con-sistency until now. We let him run so far, let him do what he is naturally good at and it will take time, but it’s all good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/16/a-simple-list-of-things-men-can-do-to-change-our-work-and-life-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T21:18:08Z","webTitle":"Men, you want to treat women better?

Here's a list to start with","bodyText":"Hey men, what are you planning to do better? Because you need to do better. Here are ideas on how you should treat women better. Talk to your friend who is “kind of a creep” at work. Don’t talk over women. If you are asked to be on a panel/team and see that it’s all men, say something. Maybe even refuse the spot! When you see another guy talk over a woman, say: “Hey, she was saying something.” Learn to read a fucking room. Don’t call women “crazy” in a professional setting. Don’t use your “feminism” as a way to get women to trust you. Show us in your day-to-day life, not in your self-congratulatory social media. Don’t touch women you don’t know, and honestly, ask yourself why you feel the need to touch women in general. Do you feel that any woman on earth owes you something? She doesn’t. Even if you’re like, “Hm, but what about basic respect?” ask yourself if you’ve shown her the same. Don’t send pictures of your penis unless she just asked for them. If a woman says no to a date, don’t ask her again. If a woman has not given an enthusiastic “yes” to sex, back the hell off. If a woman is really drunk, she cannot consent to you and she also cannot consent to your buddy who seems to be trying something. Your buddy is your responsibility, so say something and intervene. If you do the right thing, don’t expect praise or payment or a pat on the back or even a “thank you from that woman”. Congratulations, you were baseline decent. Involve women in your creative projects, then let them have equal part in them. Don’t make misogynistic jokes. Don’t expect women to be “nice” or “cute” and don’t get upset when they aren’t those things. Don’t make assumptions about a woman’s intelligence, capabilities or desires based on how she dresses. Pay women as much as you pay men. If a woman tells you that you fucked up, and you feel like shit, don’t put it on that woman to make you feel better. Apologize without qualification and then go away. Don’t punish women for witnessing your vulnerability. Don’t get defensive when you get called out. Don’t need to literally witness a man being horrible in order to believe that he’s horrible. Trust and believe women. Don’t use your power to get women’s attention/company/sex/etc. Be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men. Stop thinking that because you’re also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women. If women’s pain makes you feel pain, don’t prize your pain above hers, or make that pain her problem. Don’t read a list like this and think that most of these don’t apply to you.

Three minutes’ work, another useful chunk of prize money in the bank and the Italian was able to make the short journey back to his Newmarket home, doubtless reflecting all the way on the pleasures of being back at the top of the racing world, looking forward to some fine Champions Day rides at Ascot this Saturday. But there was a point, four years ago, when such good times seemed gone for ever. Dettori had an upsetting end to 2012, when he finally severed his links with the Godolphin organisation that no longer seemed to appreciate his talent and was then served with a six-month ban after a positive test for cocaine. On his return, he found a mortifying lack of demand for his services and spent a couple of months bumping along on a 6% strike-rate while observers muttered to each other about how the mighty had fallen. “I couldn’t see anything coming up. I didn’t expect it would be so hard to fit back in but it was hard. If it wasn’t for Sheikh Joaan, who gave me the lifeline, I would have packed up at the end of that season. I couldn’t get any rides. It was frustrating and I would have had no choice but to focus on something else.” Sheikh Joaan, a Qatari royal who was trying to break into top-class Flat racing as an owner, seized the chance that so many others overlooked and signed up Dettori to ride for him. The following year, a vacancy arose at John Gosden’s stable and Dettori fairly sprinted back into the arms of a trainer who had been important to him some 20 years before. Those two alliances, with Sheikh Joaan and Gosden, have provided a glorious Indian summer for Dettori’s career. These days, Flat racing is populated almost entirely by trainers casting a jaundiced eye at the jockey they stuck with in 2013 and wondering if they might not have made a better choice. “It’s amazing how it turned round. I’m very lucky. One Derby, a King George and two Arcs later … It’s not bad, is it?” Enable’s triumph in the Arc at Chantilly a fortnight ago made Dettori the most successful jockey in the race’s history, a record he cherishes. “It’s amazing. As a kid, just to ride in the Arc was an achievement. To be the first to win five, brilliant. I guess Lester’s nine Derbys is a bit too far out of my reach ...” But, while the Arc repeatedly bends to his will, the Champion Stakes has so far proved resistant. More than a quarter of a century after he first tackled the race, back in the days when it was run at Newmarket, he has yet to get his name on the board and his keenness to rectify the omission is hardly dulled by the fact that it is now worth £1m in prize money. “It’s more than just the Champion Stakes, it’s The Race I’ve Never Won. I haven’t got many left but this is definitely a big one. So I’m nervous!” Cracksman is the unlucky beast charged with doing what no horse has done before, getting Dettori across the line first in the feature race on Qipco British Champions Day. The betting market gives him a favourite’s chance at odds of 100-30 and Dettori sounds broadly positive, reporting that the horse pleased him in a bit of work on Saturday. “He’s learning how to really gallop. He used to spend a lot of time in the air. Now, he’s getting down and he’s got stronger. He’s definitely a better horse than when he was third in the Derby.” Dettori is likely to have a second favourite to ride at Ascot on Saturday, as Journey is top of the betting for the Champion Fillies and Mares race, which she won last year and nearly won in 2015. “She comes good this time of the season and she likes Ascot,” he says. The Long Distance Cup that opens the card reminds Dettori of a slightly sore point, when he deserted Gosden’s Stradivarius for the more fancied Big Orange in the Goodwood Cup and got beaten by the horse he might have ridden. On Saturday, he swaps back to Stradivarius but fears there is enough rain in the offing to dish the chances of both and hand the prize to Order Of St George. After that and a jaunt to the United States for the Breeders’ Cup, the jockey’s year will be almost over.

What does Colin Kaepernick allege in his case? Kaepernick alleges that the 32 NFL owners have “colluded” or entered into a prohibited agreement with either another club or the league to not sign him to a contract this season. Interestingly, the grievance was filed directly by Kaepernick’s attorney, Mark Geragos, and not through the NFL Players Association. The NFLPA appears to be staying on the sidelines even though a victory by Kaepernick could well be a victory for all NFL players. What is collusion? The NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement specifically forbids “collusion”, which is defined as a club entering into any agreement, express or implied, with any other club or the league to not sign any particular player. What chance does Kaepernick have of winning? Kaepernick’s chances will rely heavily on any potential evidence available to prove collusion. In a private proceeding before an independent arbitrator, not a court, Kaepernick will bear the burden of demonstrating by a clear preponderance of evidence that there was a forbidden agreement between NFL teams and/or the league office that amounted to collusion and that the forbidden agreement caused him economic harm. The provision that governs the proceeding in the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement explains that the failure of a club to offer him a contract shall not alone be enough to prove collusion, but that other evidence indicating there was collusion is needed. In light of this legal standard, for Kaepernick to succeed in his case he will almost certainly need to present compelling objective evidence in the form of written communications between NFL teams and/or the league that there was an agreement between them not to sign him. Testimony from a surprise objective witness that there was an agreement, either express or implied, could also be persuasive. The arbitrator could order the NFL to produce documents that Kaepernick seeks, including the type of written communications between teams and the league that could help win him the case (if such written communications exist). Kaepernick could also seek to “depose” or examine potential key witnesses under oath from the NFL clubs or the league office. If he does win, he could receive millions in compensation. Whether he wins may largely depend on whether emails, texts, or other materials exist that could help Kaepernick to prove that there was indeed an agreement not to sign him. Given Kaepernick’s obvious talents and the rash of injuries to starting quarterbacks in the NFL, the existence of such evidence would not be surprising. Is it realistic this will win him a place back in the league? Kaepernick may never play in the league again, since no team can be forced to sign a player, but if he prevails the symbolism of such a victory would be long-lasting in the American sports landscape. If this won’t win him back his job, why is he taking this step? Kaepernick may be attempting to shift the public discourse away from a more recent discussion centered around “patriotism” and “respect for the flag” to the fundamental issue that motivated his protests initially – justice. While the grievance is probably not a clear path to resuming his playing career, the NFL has shown little willingness to engage Kaepernick on the subject, making an escalation such as this a probable outcome.

But Bluebird, Bluebird is a true original in the way it twists these conventions into a narrative of exhilarating immediacy. Darren Matthews is a Texas Ranger, working in a division of state law enforcement tasked with investigating everything from political corruption to murder. He is also a black man who must negotiate these two often conflicting identities: “He got confused sometimes, on which side of the law he belonged, couldn’t always remember when it was safe for a black man to follow the rules.” As a native of East Texas, with strong ties to home, Darren offers aid to an old friend, a move that jeopardises both his marriage and the job he loves. It is while on suspension from the force that he learns two bodies have washed up in the bayou in the tiny town of Lark – the first, that of a black male lawyer from Chicago, the second, of a local white waitress. These grisly discoveries lead him into an investigation that ultimately threatens all he holds sacred. Lark is a backwater darkened by poverty and simmering with racial tensions. It comes as no surprise that the town had once been a plantation. Locke’s treatment of its people is at once loving and shrewd. The townsfolk are ribald and secretive and quiet and cunning; they are vicious and caring and cutthroat and merciful. But they are always human. Locke has a vivid sense of characterisation, using everything from dialect to the fabric of one’s clothes to make subtle class distinctions and depict mental states. For the black men of Texas, “a pair of baggy pants or a shirttail hanging out was ‘walking probable cause’”. The white cashmere coat worn into town by Randie, the wife of the dead lawyer, is contrasted sharply with the ill-fitting slacks and worn penny loafers of those around her. It is this coat that instantly exposes her as a hapless outsider in this rougher world. When later it is lost, we understand that she has been stripped of the artificial defence of class: here, in this place that has sidestepped all progress, wealth and education are no protection. And yet it is only with Randie’s characterisation that Locke’s nuanced portrayals falter. Randie behaves exactly as we expect her to – screaming and accusatory at some points, trembling and hysterical at others. If she fails to convince as the 21st-century career woman she’s described as, it is perhaps this stock figure quality that is responsible: she sometimes feels like a mere gesture, lost among the many greater truths that Locke renders in such subtle and beautiful ways. The novel is as much murder mystery as it is a meditation on race and on being loyal to one’s roots. It takes its title from a John Lee Hooker song and reflects the bluesman’s griefs. At the heart of the plot are family entanglements, both illicit and openly exposed like wounds. The pacing is expertly measured – though there are great surprises, they feel warranted and true. Darren, when asked what drives him, given the ways in which his profession has marred his life, explains that he does not want people to think wrongly of Texas. He does not want outsiders to view it as a place with no justice for black men. “The badge was to say this land is my land, too, my state, my country, and I’m not gon’ be run off. I can stand my ground, too. My people built this, and we’re not going anywhere.” His uncles were both lawmen, and he remembers them speaking dreamily of a world in which black people would finally be safe. It is as if Darren is single-handedly seeking to redress the injustices under which his uncles were raised and continue to live. He is fighting for the right of black residents to claim a sense of ownership and home in Texas. Locke presents a world in which the divide between black law enforcers and white officials is wide. Here, differing notions of justice – who is deserving of protection, what constitutes fairness in law and who is entitled to have those laws bent on their behalf – can mean the difference between life and death. It is an anatomy of the thin blue line, and its truths are bracing. But so too is the sense of love for this place, however flawed – the beauty and variety of its trees, its gorgeous red soils, the haunting cadences of its local speech. There is deep adoration here, and understanding – which is no surprise given that the author is herself Texas-born. Locke is building a compelling body of work. In this age of enduring and renewed racial tensions, we need her voice more than ever. • Bluebird, Bluebird is published by Serpent’s Tail.

Mauro Icardi produced two devastating finishes and then calmly scored a 90th-minute penalty to complete his hat-trick. Milan played brilliantly in the second half, with Suso scoring a lovely goal of his own. Thanks for your company, goodnight! That’s it! Inter move 10 points clear of Milan after a highly entertaining derby. 90+3 min Icardi gets a standing ovation as he is replaced by Santon. The BT commentators think the penalty award was harsh. I’m not so sure; he had his arms around D’Ambrosio’s chest. 90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. You have to feel for Milan, who have performed admirably in the second half, but Mauro Icardi’s genius for goalscoring looks to have settled this match. Icardi completes his hat-trick with a lovely penalty! 89 min An Inter corner flashed across goal, and Rodriguez - who saved a goal moments earlier with that block - as penalised for manhandling D’Ambrosio. It’ll be taken by Icardi, on a hat-trick, to win the derby. 88 min Wonderful play from Inter! Vecino makes a tremendous run from the halfway line into the area before finding Icardi. He flicks the ball behind him to the substitute Eder, whose shot is brilliantly blocked by Rodriguez. And now Inter have a penalty! 84 min “Never seen the like of Icardi’s second goal?” says Geoff Wignall. “Young man, you never saw Law: that much is clear.” Ah, I should have been clearer - I meant the way he seemed to deliberately slice it with the outside of his shin. Milan have equalised again! Borini’s inswinging cross from the left somehow evaded a bunch of players in the middle of goal, but Bonaventura appeared from nowhere beyond the far post to slide the ball in! Handanovic managed to push the ball onto the post, a brilliant save, but it rebounded onto his knee and into the net. Technically that’s an own goal, which is a bit harsh on Handanovic and Bonaventura. 79 min Perisic is booked for a hand-off into the face of Andre Silva. That looked a bit harsh. 78 min Another change for Milan: Locatelli on, Romagnoli off. 77 min Borja Valero’s big, dipping corner is won emphatically in the air by Perisic, and Donnarumma makes a decent save to his right. 76 min A smart run from Joao Cancelo, whose cross deflects behind for a corner. 73 min An Internazionale substitution: Joao Cancelo replaces the excellent Candreva. 71 min Suso’s long-range shot deflects to Romagnoli, who runs out of time waiting for the ball to drop and eventually stabs it over the bar. 70 min The timing of that goal seems to have winded Milan, who have been relatively subdued in the last few minutes. 66 min Gagliardini is booked for a foul on Borini. You don’t see many unique goals in football, but I can’t remember anything quite like that second from Icardi. The magnificent Icardi does it again! This has been some second half. Icardi led an Inter counter-attack and played the ball wide to Perisic on the left. He ran at Musacchio, got to the byline and cut the ball back into the area. It came at a really awkward height for Icardi, who had both feet off the ground as he deliberate sliced a volley across Donnarumma and into the corner. That was a tremendous piece of improvisation. I think he hit it with the outside of his shin, never mind the outside of his foot. 62 min Great save from Handanovic! A cross from the right fell nicely beyond the far post for Bonaventura, who opened his body to shoot low across goal. Handanovic, who had almost no reaction time, plunged spectacularly to his left to stop the shot. 60 min That was a great chance for Inter on the break. Candreva on the right wing fizzed an excellent low ball into the the path of Vecino, who sidefooted a first-time shot just wide from 18 yards. He probably should have scored. 59 min Milan are rampant. This turnaround verges on the bizarre, because they were hopeless in the first half. 58 min “Matt Dony, you should have practiced being taken out cynically and violently from behind also,” says Simon Frank. “Garden practice apparently worked out for Matt Le Tissier- he used to bounce a ball off his wall and volley it against a 3-paneled shed. No points for hitting the middle panel.” Milan are deservedly level thanks to a beautiful goal from Suso. He came infield from the right onto his left foot, helped by Musacchio’s selfless off-the-ball run, and placed a precise curling shot into the far corner from 22 yards. There was hardly any pace on the shot but the placement was excellent. 54 min Milan continue to create chances. Rodriguez crosses low towards the near post, where Cutrone gets ahead of Skriniar and hooks a shot into the side netting. His movement to get in front of Skriniar was excellent. 53 min Milan look much livelier in attack since the introduction of Cutrone. 51 min The corner comes to Borini, who drags a left-footed shot from 15 yards that Handanovic saves down to his left. 50 min Suso hits a sweet, dipping strike from 30 yards that is tipped over by the leaping Handanovic. It was straight down the middle which made it a relatively comfortable save. 49 min Milan have a goal disallowed for offside. Andre Silva struck a low shot onto the inside of the far post, with Musacchio gleefully roofing the rebound. The flag went up against Musacchio, and replays showed he was clearly offside when Silva had the shot. 48 min Vecino, found by Perisic, drills a low shot a few yards wide from 25 yards. Donnarumma had it covered. 47 min “Liam Brady was my idol growing up too,” says Justin Kavanagh. “But I wonder if nostalgia isn’t what it used to be? Would he get into most top-notch sides today, now that everything is so much faster and the playmaker role is such a thing of the past?” He’s a rich man’s Granit Xhaka isn’t he? 46 min Peep peep! Inter begin the second half. Milan have made a half-time change, with Patrick Cutrone replacing Franck Kessie. That suggests a switch to 3-4-1-2. Some half-time reading Peep peep! Inter lead, deservedly so, through a high-class goal from Mauro Icardi. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 44 min Milan almost equalise on the stroke of half-time. Kessie turns Gagliardini neatly and slips a pass through to Borini, who gets behind Nagamoto and smashes a low first-time shot across goal. Handanovic gets down very smartly to his right to save, and Borini can only head the follow-up into the side netting from a tight angle. 42 min Vecino rakes a left-footed shot from the edge of the box that is comfortably held by Donnarumma. 41 min Skriniar, the young Inter centre-half, looks an impressive, dominant defender. He hasn’t given Andre Silva a kick, which may be why Andre Silva has just given him a very late kick. He might have been booked for that. 39 min Suso’s increasing frustration manifests itself in a petulant foul on the influential Borja Valero. 37 min Milan haven’t had a shot on target. There’s been an obvious difference in class in this first half. 36 min The voarcious Icardi shoots straight at Donnarumma from 25 yards. 33 min “I’m still some way short of 40, Simon Frank, but I initially fell in love with football thanks to S4C’s welsh language Sgorio in 1990-ish, hero-worshipping Van Basten,” says Matt Dony. “ Thanks to him, I spent hours and hours and hours practicing volleys in my garden, before accepting I’m a clodhopping defender and getting on with my life. Everything was better in the 90s.” Even nostalgia? 32 min Perisic’s stinging shot from the left of the box is blocked by Musacchio. Milan are under all kinds of pressure at the moment. 30 min That goal was so classy: the quick passing down the right, Candreva’s beautiful cross and Icardi’s finish. Mauro Icardi gives Inter the lead with a fine goal. After some snappy passing down the right, Candreva curled a superb first-time ball into the corridor of uncertainty, and Icardi got between two defenders to help it into the far corner. That was such a good finish because the bounce was awkward and he had to take it first time. 25 min Vecino is the latest man to be booked, this time for a foul on Bonaventura. Inter are angry because Biglia appeared to get away with handball a few seconds earlier. 23 min Borja Valero’s excellent free-kick from the right skims off the head of a Milan defender and goes out to Perisic on the left. He hits a deep, swirling cross that is thumped just wide by the head of Miranda. That was close. 22 min Romagnoli is booked for a deliberate block on Candreva, who was about to go past him on an Inter break. 20 min Suso has a pop from 25 yards, and screws it well wide. 19 min That corner comes to nothing. I don’t know why I bother sometimes. 18 min Bonaventura runs at D’Ambrosio in the box and wins a corner for Milan, who are slowly familiarising themselves with the concept of ‘attack’. Bonaventura’s corner leads to another corner, this time on the right-hand side. 17 min It hasn’t been the most entertaining game so far, that sweet strike from Candreva aside. A scruffy match, as Chris Perry points out on BT Sport, suits Milan a lot more than Inter. 16 min “Everyone talking about the 90s but for me Liam ’Chippy’ Brady was one of the greatest to grace Serie A in the 80s &amp; was unfairly jettisoned by Juve for some French lad Platini who was tidy enough,” says John McEnerney. “He won 2 Serie A titles in his 2 seasons with The Old Lady. Legend.” Didn’t he score a penalty to win Serie A in his final game, knowing he was going to be sold? That’s the definition of class. 15 min Miranda is booked for a hack at Andre Silva. 13 min Candreva hits the bar! It was a lovely effort, floated with his right foot from 20 yards, and it twanged off the top of the bar as Donnarumma leapt desperately to his left. He may have had it covered; either way it was a superb effort. 12 min The corner is worked short to Suso, whose ball into the box is hopeless. 11 min Rodriguez does excellently to retrieve Borini’s overhit pass and win a corner for Milan. 10 min It’ll be a long night for Milan if they continue like this. They have hardly crossed the halfway line in the first 10 minutes. 7 min It’s still all Inter, though they haven’t yet created anything of note. 4 min “I always felt Andrea Silenzi and Ruggiero Rizzitelli never got enough credit,” says Simon Frank. “They were lethal for Torino back in the days when Torino were an underperforming giant. Maybe it’s because Silenzi went on to have such a great career with Forest, their partnership got overshadowed.” You’re nothing if you haven’t proved yourself in This League™. See also the wildly overrated Shevchenko. 3 min A lot of early possession for Inter, who are the home side tonight. Icardi is just offside as he runs through on goal onto a long pass from Gagliardini. 1 min Peep peep! AC Milan kick off from right to left. “Favourite 90s Serie A player, Rob?” asks Shaun Wilkinson. “Trying to avoid the super-obvious names, I am undecided between Faustino Asprilla and, partly because I was present at his final Serie A game, Beppe Signori.” Bloody hell, what a question. My head has started spinning. I think I’m about to suffer a fatal attack of happy memories. I really have no idea, so I’ll do the modern thing of answering a different question to the one I was asked. Well, Shaun, my favourite Serie A 90s team were undoubtedly Sampdoria’s 1990-91 champions. This thing has never felt less like work than when I was researching this article. An email! “For those of us in our mid-40s, this game will always be Gullit, Rijkaard, Van Basten versus Klinsmann, Matthaeus, Brehme; Holland v Germany,” says Simon Frank. “So I assume under that logic we are all Milan fans.” I just want humanity to be the winner, Simon. (And I love that West Germany side, perhaps the most underrated World Cup winners.) Somebody should write a book on the golden age of Serie A in the late 80s and early 90s. Domestic football will never get better than that. It was immense. You could write a whole book just on Sunday 5th May 1991.

Internazionale and AC Milan have had a disappointing time in recent years, but that hasn’t reduced the status of the Milan derby - or, as I call it when I want to hint at an ocean of cosmopolitan metrosexuality just below the surface, the Derby della Madonnina.The two teams could be playing in Promozione Lombardy rather than Serie A and this match would still merit use of Donald Trump’s favourite superlative. Inter, like the publicity for each of R.E.M’s last six albums, are promising a return to form. They have won six of their opening seven games, and would be top were it not for those pesky Neapolitans. A win would take Inter to within two points of Napoli - and 10 clear of AC, who seem to be stuck in a never-ending transition. Last season’s derbies were deliciously dramatic, both ending 2-2 after injury-time equalisers. Those of us who are neutral and simply want humanity to be the winner would love something similar tonight. Kick-off is at 1945 BST, 2045 CEST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/15/emmanuel-macron-to-give-first-live-television-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T23:29:06Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron claims in TV interview: 'I am not cut off'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/emmanuel-macron-to-give-first-live-television-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/15/emmanuel-macron-to-give-first-live-television-interview","fields":{"headline":"Emmanuel Macron claims in TV interview: 'I am not cut off'","bodyText":"The French president Emmanuel Macron has angrily denied he was cut off from real life or held working-class people in disdain in his first live primetime interview after five months in power. Macron organised the rare TV appearance on Sunday night in part to counter the damaging image among his critics that he was a “president for the rich” who cares more about the wealthy than the struggling. On air, he rejected the label, saying the very term pitted French people against one another and sparked “sad emotions” in the country. In recent weeks, some of Macron’s policies, such as watering down France’s deeply symbolic wealth tax by applying it only to property, had led to him being labelled a “president of the rich” by political opponents — a negative tag that had previously damaged the rightwing Nicolas Sarkozy. But Macron stood by his easing of the wealth tax, saying he wanted wealthy French people who had fled the tax system to return and invest in business. He said: “I don’t believe in the French jealousy that seeks to tax success. That is huge hypocrisy. What was the result of the wealth tax? We lost a lot of talent.” Sitting in a new corner-office in the Élysée palace, decorated with street art and modern paintings, Macron insisted: “I’m not here to manage or reform, I’m here to transform [France].” The pro-business centrist who beat the far-right Marine Le Pen to win the presidency in May had until now shied away from traditional French presidential TV appearances. Instead, he has preferred giving lofty, lengthy speeches – typically on the future of the European Union – punctuated by occasional flippant comments during public walkabouts. But after Macron’s approval polls ratings fell this summer and then stabilised in recent weeks, the young president sought to address the voters who were struggling to understand the real meaning and implications of his political project and the nature of “macronism”, which claims to be both left and right at the same time. The 39-year-old president was under pressure to set out what his proposed “radical transformation of France” would mean for regular households in the next five years. He insisted that his loosening of labour laws in favour of businesses – which he has called the most ambitious French reform of the postwar era – did not equate to a “hyper free-market” model that would destroy rights, saying instead that it would help all workers. His next phase is to overhaul unemployment benefits and training schemes. He promised that the results would be felt in the French economy and society within one to two years. Macron rejected criticisms over his recent choice of words after he vowed to face down the “slackers” who opposed his labour law reform, or dismissed protesting workers as kicking up “chaos”. He said: “I have always opted to tell things as they are and to get close to the truth, so I name things.” He said he wanted to speak freely, warning “our elites are used to a sterilised public discourse”. Macron’s current challenge is not political. In political terms, he is comfortable: his young party, La République en Marche, dominates parliament, opposition is fragmented and Macron has managed to swiftly deliver key manifesto promises, namely pushing through labour law changes. Instead, Macron’s issue is hisimage. Like all French presidents before him, he is under scrutiny over his own personal style. The privately educated former investment banker has recently been attacked over comments that were seen, particularly on the left, as being cut off from real life. When a row erupted over his cuts to housing benefits, Macron suggested that if asked nicely, landlords might lower their rents. Critics slammed him for pie-in-the-sky notions. When another row erupted this month over Macron allegedly disparaging striking workers, he was criticised for suggesting offhand that workers in danger of losing their jobs could simply travel 140km to work somewhere else. While Macron’s poll ratings are better on the right, he wants to win back leftwing voters who supporteded him in the presidential race but are now turning away. Macron said in the TV interview that he had asked for the removal of the French Légion of honneur award from Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood film producer who is the focus of allegations of rape and sexual assault. Macron also said he would increase French policing powers to deal with sexual harassment in the street and the harassment of women on public transport. Macron is trying to shed the label he set out for himself before the election – that he could be like Jupiter, the Roman god of gods, a lofty figure speaking little in public. This notion of distance from the fray was modelled on previous presidents Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand, but he is now seeking to prove he is not deliberately cutting himself off. “When I am with French people, I am not aloof because I belong to them,” he told the German magazine Der Spiegel this weekend, adding that he was not “arrogant” but “determined”. Insisting that he didn’t see himself as a kind of republican king, Macron told the magazine: “France is a country of regicidal monarchists. It is a paradox: The French want to elect a king, but they would like to be able to overthrow him whenever they want.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/uk-lawyers-say-hong-kong-rule-of-law-under-threat-after-jailing-of-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T23:01:43Z","webTitle":"UK lawyers say Hong Kong rule of law under threat after jailing of activists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/uk-lawyers-say-hong-kong-rule-of-law-under-threat-after-jailing-of-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/uk-lawyers-say-hong-kong-rule-of-law-under-threat-after-jailing-of-activists","fields":{"headline":"UK lawyers say Hong Kong rule of law under threat after jailing of activists","bodyText":"The imprisonment of three prominent Hong Kong democracy activists earlier this year is a “serious threat” to the rule of law and violates international treaties, a group of leading attorneys has said, amid claims the city’s courts are increasingly politicised. In the open letter, the lawyers, including former lord chancellor Charles Falconer and six other Queen’s Counsel, heavily criticised the jailing of Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law in August for their role in pro-democracy protests. The trio avoided jail terms last year when they were convicted of “illegal assembly” and sentenced to community service under Hong Kong’s public order ordinance. The government appealed to have the sentences reviewed, which resulted in stiffer penalties of six to eight months in prison. “The independence of the judiciary, a pillar of Hong Kong, risks becoming a charade, at the beck and call of the Chinese Communist party,” the letter said. “Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic freedoms, at the heart of the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, now face grave threats,” it continued, referring to the arrangement negotiated between the UK and China to grant Hong Kong autonomy. The letter was signed by 11 prominent lawyers, including Jared Genser, attorney for Chinese Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, Kirsty Brimelow QC, chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales, and Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, former chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milošević. The letter also comes days after British human rights activist Benedict Rogers was barred from entering Hong Kong without explanation, and the city’s leader warned others could be banned in the future at Beijing’s whim. Writing in the Guardian after the incident, Rogers voiced many of the same concerns. “I have become increasingly concerned about the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms and the rule of law, and the threats to the ‘one country, two systems’ pledge,” he said. The lawyers also heavily criticise the law used to jail the democracy campaigners, the public order ordinance, saying it went against the international covenant on civil and political rights. The United Nations has previously said the law places “excessive restrictions” on fundamental rights. The jailings represented “a serious threat to the rule of law and a breach of the principle of ‘double jeopardy’ in Hong Kong”, the letter said. The harsher sentences were necessary because of a “sick trend” of anti-government protests, the judge argued. Last week 20 activists, including Wong, were convicted of criminal contempt of court in connection with the same democracy protests, although they have yet to be sentenced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/15/labour-says-it-will-join-conservatives-to-block-no-deal-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T06:55:20Z","webTitle":"May and Davis to travel to Brussels for urgent Brexit talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/15/labour-says-it-will-join-conservatives-to-block-no-deal-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/15/labour-says-it-will-join-conservatives-to-block-no-deal-brexit","fields":{"headline":"May and Davis to travel to Brussels for urgent Brexit talks","bodyText":"Theresa May and David Davis will make a surprise visit to Brussels for a private dinner with the European commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the EU’s top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in a diplomacy blitz before a crucial summit this week. May and Davis will visit Juncker and Barnier in the Belgian capital on Monday evening, where they are expected to make the case for EU leaders to agree to move on negotiations, to pave the way for discussions of Britain’s future relationship with the EU. Though Downing Street insisted the dinner had long been in May’s diary, EU sources suggested it may have been more last-minute, but were not able to provide confirmation. The EU, led by Germany and France, has sought to harden its position towards the prospect of trade talks beginning before Christmas. The UK has been unable to break the EU wall of unity that insists the talks about future relations cannot start until talks on the terms of departure are settled. A European commission source said Juncker would have a working dinner with the prime minister, along with Davis and Barnier, on Monday to “discuss European and geopolitical issues of common interest and prepare” for the European council summit starting on Thursday. They would also discuss the long-term agenda for the G7 and G20. Monday will be the first time May and Juncker have dined since the pair’s catastrophic meeting in April. Juncker is reported to have said May was “deluded” about the progress of Brexit, and the prime minister in turn accused Brussels of making deliberately timed attacks to interfere with the UK general election. May is said to be in the midst of a whirlwind round of “telephone diplomacy” with EU leaders before the summit, starting with a conversation with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Sunday. Documents leaked last week suggested that European leaders, on the bidding of the European council president, Donald Tusk, would present an agreed position on a transition period and a trade deal in December, should the UK make further concessions. That promise to the UK was expected to be made at the European council summit this week. However, at a meeting of key diplomats on Friday evening, EU member states discussed weakening the language in the draft statement about their intentions in December, to give themselves greater flexibility in how they respond when they assess the rate of progress. Multiple EU sources said the member states were concerned that they might be boxing themselves in, and that they should avoid promising any guidelines on how the EU foresees a trade deal and transition period working. “How detailed do we want to be about what we will do in December?” one said. “Some feel that maybe we should be more general.” The EU is both unsure about the reliability of the UK as a negotiating partner, during a time when May’s position in Downing Street is in doubt, and wary of looking too eager for trade talks, when major concessions in the financial settlement are still being sought. “We can’t control what happens in the UK,” said one EU diplomat. “We can only control what we do here.”Other UK cabinet ministers have also been wooing EU leaders before the summit. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, met eight eastern European foreign ministers at Chevening on Sunday in an attempt to break the Brexit deadlock, the first time since the negotiations started that the Foreign Office has gathered such a collection of allies in one place. In the phone call with Merkel, May’s spokesman said she stressed the importance of progress in the negotiations, in a week when her Conservative backbenchers have been pushing her to start making detailed preparations for a no-deal scenario. The prime minister is expected to make more calls to other EU leaders in the coming days but a No 10 source made it clear May was not planning on threatening to withdraw from talks, despite some of the pressure from more hardline Eurosceptics. On Sunday, the former Brexit minister David Jones said Britain should be prepared to suspend negotiations at this week’s European council meeting until the EU was prepared to negotiate further on the financial settlement and begin talks on future trade terms. “Until such time as you talk to us we will assume you are not really serious and we will of course have to prepare for life outside the EU in which we will be trading with you on World Trade Organization terms,” Jones told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend. Such a strategy is likely to meet fierce opposition from MPs on both sides of the house who oppose a hard Brexit. On Sunday the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said his party was talking to Tory MPs to block any prospect of a no-deal Brexit. However, his comments sparked concern from Labour and Conservative backbenchers who believe Tory MPs are not likely to be won over to support the amendment if it can be construed as being orchestrated by McDonnell or the Labour frontbench. McDonnell’s comments came as a cross-party group of MPs, including several former Conservative ministers, revealed plans that would give parliament the ability to veto a “bad deal” or “no deal” outcome, using amendments to the forthcoming EU withdrawal bill. The shadow chancellor said Labour was not prepared to consider the prospect of leaving the EU without a negotiated settlement. “I’m not willing to countenance that. I don’t think there is a majority in parliament for no deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “I think there are enough sensible people in the House of Commons to say: ‘This cannot happen – we cannot damage our country in this way.’” Asked if Labour would work with Conservative MPs who were also concerned about leaving with no deal, McDonnell said: “There are discussions going right the way across the house.” One Labour MP called the comments “totally counterproductive” to cross-party collaboration between MPs from both sides lobbying for a soft Brexit. “The Tories don’t want to do anything perceived to help Corbyn; this kind of chat puts them off challenging the ministerial frontbench,” the source said. On Monday, leading Conservative MPs from both sides of the Brexit divide played down the likelihood of a no-deal scenario. Kenneth Clarke, the former chancellor, who is among the cross-party group of MPs seeking to give parliament the power to veto any no-deal departure, said very few people were actively seeking this. “I do think we’ve got to make it clear, only a handful of hard rightwing Eurosceptics really think no deal is desirable,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “A majority will, I think, wish to look in the round at whatever this crisis scenario is that has arisen at the time.” Clarke said the aim of the proposed amendments to the EU withdrawal bill was not to reverse Brexit: “I’ve accepted that the vast majority of parliamentarians think they’re bound by this referendum and therefore we’re going to leave.” The leading Conservative Eurosceptic MP John Redwood also said he did not expect a no-deal scenario, but insisted the UK could “do just fine” if that happened. Redwood told the Today programme the government must prepare for the possibility of there being no deal. “But I suspect, at at the 11th hour, the EU will want a free trade deal with us, because they won’t want tariffs on all their exports to us. But if we look as if we’re weak it’s going to delay getting any sensible offer out of them.” Redwood stressed he would prefer a deal to happen. “Of course, I think that if we had tariff-free trade with no new barriers that would be better than if the EU insist on putting some tariffs and barriers in the way. “The reason I’m fairly relaxed about them doing that is there are limits to how much damage they can do because we’re both members of the World Trade Organization and we know we can trade perfectly successfully on world trade terms, because that’s what we do at the moment with the whole of the rest of the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/15/organ-reframed-union-chapel-london-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T11:26:21Z","webTitle":"Organ Reframed review – kitsch, rapture and white-knuckle intensity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/organ-reframed-union-chapel-london-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/15/organ-reframed-union-chapel-london-review","fields":{"headline":"Organ Reframed review – kitsch, rapture and white-knuckle intensity","bodyText":"In the last few years it has become fashionable for electronic musicians to renounce their computers in favour of the pre-digital delights of 60s- and 70s-style modular synths. Evidently, the next logical step is the reappraisal of the pipe organ – for what is a pipe organ but the original synthesiser, its array of keyboards, knobs and levers designed to produce an awe-inspiring barrage of otherworldly sound? This is the thinking behind Organ Reframed, a festival of new works for pipe organ by doyens of the electronic avant garde (plus the odd intrepid indie rock band), now in its second year at Union Chapel, London. Along with the flamboyant recitals of Cameron Carpenter and its appearance on acclaimed experimental releases by, among others, Kara-Lis Coverdale and Tim Hecker, it seems that the organ might be having a bit of a moment. But, as the opening night of the festival shows, it’s a tricky instrument to reframe. Of the six specially commissioned new pieces, efforts range from the kitschy (Emily Hall) to the atonal (Phill Niblock) without fully harnessing the organ’s natural heft. It doesn’t help that the Union Chapel organ (originally built by Henry “Father” Willis in 1877 and fully restored over the last few years) is completely obscured by the pulpit. Via the big screen we can see James McVinnie’s hands moving nimbly across the keys, or his brogues on the pedals, but never both at once, so you don’t really get a sense of the physicality involved. Centre stage is occupied by a small ensemble of musicians from the London Contemporary Orchestra. Musically as well as visually, it sometimes feels as if the organ has been reduced to a bit-part role at its own celebration. It’s not until midway through Hecker’s rousing contribution that McVinnie really makes his presence felt, bashing out strident but slightly wonky chords like a melting Bach fugue. Similarly arresting is the contribution of Mira Calix, who never shies away from a challenge having previously explored the musical properties of insects, paper and stones. Her piece is an angry meditation on Brexit entitled #DeHFO (The Department of How to Fuck Ourselves). Reflecting a country split down the middle, it’s made up of very high and very low notes. A tense standoff between the two eventually erupts into a scurrying baroque cacophony. Perhaps the most effective reframing comes courtesy of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith. Smith is one of those aforementioned modular synth buffs, whose beatific compositions make ingenious use of vintage machines such as the Buchla 100, eschewing their obvious sci-fi connotations for warmer, fleshier tones. She handles the transition to pipe organ with aplomb, delivering a piece of music that feels fresh and exhilarating, even if you suspect that much of that may be down to the use of flute, harp and xylophone rather than the organ itself. The following night’s concert shows the value of keeping it simple as far as the organ is concerned. Festival curator Claire M Singer plays unaccompanied except for an occasional sympathetic cello. Her cautious chord progressions aren’t particularly adventurous but she really knows how to wring the best out of this magnificent instrument, creating moments of sustained rapture. Minnesotan trio Low have never been ones for over-elaboration. They are renowned for playing slowly and quietly but with white-knuckle intensity. As a gift to the Union Chapel – a home from home for them over the years – they perform an entire set of new music, apparently inspired by Caravaggio’s The Incredulity of Saint Thomas. Low have never made any secret of their religious affiliation – founding couple Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk are Mormons – but they are constantly questioning and examining their faith, often with mordant, self-deprecating humour. At one point in this subtly theatrical performance, Sparhawk wryly bites into an apple; at another, he pours water into his glass to make wine (or possibly blackcurrant squash). Dressed entirely in black, he and Parker stand solemnly at a desk singing and operating a basic drum machine while bassist Steve Garrington handles the organ. It’s a setup that completely reinvigorates the band. While their last album Ones and Sixes seemed to lose its way in search of “proper songs”, these circular chants about doubt and faith feel vital and resonant. After an encore of old favourite Breaker, which sounds far more chilling than it ever did on record, Parker and Sparhawk exit the stage while Garrington (with assistance from Claire Singer) literally pulls out all the stops, filling the venue with a terrifying, polyphonic din. It may have stubbornly refused to be reframed, but the organ still has the power to transfix and overwhelm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/15/tobacco-companies-should-advertise-lethality-of-smoking-say-health-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Tobacco companies should advertise lethality of smoking, say health experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/15/tobacco-companies-should-advertise-lethality-of-smoking-say-health-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/15/tobacco-companies-should-advertise-lethality-of-smoking-say-health-experts","fields":{"headline":"Tobacco companies should advertise lethality of smoking, say health experts","bodyText":"Eminent public health experts have written to the Australian heads of tobacco companies calling on them to advertise the lethality of smoking, the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, and to reveal their deliberate attempts to make tobacco products more addictive. In 2012 the US federal court ordered major tobacco companies to run advertisements in the media admitting that they deceived American consumers for decades about the dangers of smoking. That decision was upheld by the court in April, and the first of the advertisements are due to air next month in leading newspapers and in and 30- to 45-second ads on the ABC, CBS and NBC television networks. The newspaper ads will be full-page. The advertisements will run weekly for one year and will cost Altria, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard and Philip Morris USA millions of dollars. It has prompted a coalition of public health experts to write to the heads of British American Tobacco and Philip Morris in Australia calling on them to tell the truth about their tobacco products in a similar advertising campaign. “We hope that you will share our view that Australians are entitled to the same level of information as the American public about these companies’ deceitful practices and the ways in which these companies and the tobacco industry more broadly have lied to the public and your consumers over decades,” the letter states. “As you will be aware, some 1.8 million Australians now alive are likely to die because they smoked, in large part because of the activities over time of global tobacco companies such as yours. We therefore call on your company to make a commitment to publishing the same corrective statements in Australia and other countries as those you are publishing in the USA and to run those advertisements for the same 12-month duration and intensity as those being run in the USA.” Signatories to the letter include CEO of the Public Health Association and president of the World Federation of Public Health Associations, Michael Moore; president of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, Maurice Swanson; and tobacco control experts Prof Simon Chapman and Prof Mike Daube. Guardian Australia has contacted Philip Morris International for comment. Moore said that British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International comprise 70% of the Australian tobacco market. “They have promoted products designed to be addictive,” he said. “And they are still targeting the young as well as low- and middle-income countries. Australian consumers, and those around the world, are entitled to the same level of information as Americans.” Daube said despite being forced to run advertisements in the US, tobacco companies continued to fight measures aimed at reducing smoking-related harm. Philip Morris has vigorously fought against the Gillard government’s plain packaging laws since they were introduced in 2011, and was in July ordered to pay millions of dollars in legal fees to Australia after its legal case against the laws failed. “We call on this most lethal of industries to tell the truth to the Australian public about the massive toll of death and disease caused by smoking, and its record of manipulating everything from marketing to the product itself,” Daube said. “Here, as in the US, they have lied for too long.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/15/adanis-carmichael-coalmine-wont-go-ahead-greens-leader-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T00:07:37Z","webTitle":"Adani’s Carmichael coalmine won’t go ahead, Greens leader says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/15/adanis-carmichael-coalmine-wont-go-ahead-greens-leader-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/15/adanis-carmichael-coalmine-wont-go-ahead-greens-leader-says","fields":{"headline":"Adani’s Carmichael coalmine won’t go ahead, Greens leader says","bodyText":"Adani’s Carmichael coalmine won’t go ahead, the Greens leader Richard Di Natale said, predicting “many, many thousands” of Australians would come together to protest any moves to stop the project. Di Natale said he believed Australians largely stood against the Carmichael coalmine, choosing the Great Barrier Reef and the environment over the construction of what has been billed as the largest coal project in the southern hemisphere. “Make no mistake, people right across the country are so motivated to stop this thing that if we can’t stop it in the parliament, we will stop it by standing in front of those bulldozers,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “It won’t go ahead. I am very confident of that. No financier wants to pay for it. It can only go ahead with massive subsidies – we talk about subsidies [for renewables]; what about the billion dollars that the LNP wants to throw at it? What about the royalty holiday that Queensland Labor has given the company? “This is a disaster no matter which may you look at it and it won’t go ahead.” Di Natale said he would “absolutely 100%” join in any on-the-ground protest against the mine, if it went ahead, predicting it would be as big as the protest movement which stopped the Franklin Dam from going ahead in Tasmania three decades ago. “I’ll be more than happy to join those activists right across the country, many of whom I know are preparing, should we fail in the parliament, to ensure that we win it by standing in front of the bulldozers.” Di Natale said it was about saving both the environment and jobs of the future, instead of a “short-term hit” he said the Carmichael mine would provide. But veteran affairs minister Dan Tehan argued Australia could have both. “The environmental protections that will be put in place means that you can continue to have those jobs on the Great Barrier Reef, and no government has done more to protect and make sure that the health of the Great Barrier Reef is in place than the Coalition government at the moment,” he told Sky News. “We can have those jobs and continue to have those jobs, plus have the Adani jobs. It doesn’t have to be one or the other and this is where the Greens get it so wrong.” Adani believes it will break ground on the crucial rail link needed to ensure the site’s coal will reach Abbot Point port soon and predicts its first coal shipment will leave in 202o."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/15/california-wildfires-jeopardize-fate-of-family-run-vineyards","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T11:32:26Z","webTitle":"California wildfires jeopardize family-run vineyards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/15/california-wildfires-jeopardize-fate-of-family-run-vineyards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/15/california-wildfires-jeopardize-fate-of-family-run-vineyards","fields":{"headline":"California wildfires jeopardize family-run vineyards","bodyText":"Will Bucklin always had “a pretty good vision of armageddon”. The owner of Old Hill Ranch in Sonoma valley – one of the oldest vineyards in the region – had imagined and prepared for a day when there would be a wildfire. The fire department would arrive, and they would battle to save the property and its 40 acres of 100-year-old grape vines. “I should have been more creative with my imagination,” Bucklin said this week, under a choking haze of smoke that blotted out the surrounding mountains. Smoke and flames continued to rise from pockets of his land and several buildings lay ruined. “I didn’t envision being out here on my own,” he said. Like so many survivors of the wildfires that have consumed at least 150,000 acres and more than 5,000 structures in Napa and Sonoma counties, Bucklin received no warning, nor any assistance. After awakening to a “dramatic glow” around 1.30am on Monday, he stayed on his property for nearly six hours, attempting to battle the flames even after the electricity failed – and with it his running water. Compared with many, Bucklin was lucky. Though he lost several structures and about a dozen vines, the houses where he and his employee live remain standing. As fires continue to ravage California’s premiere wine country – Napa and Sonoma, both about 50 miles north of San Francisco – they threaten 100,000 acres of vineyards. The industry employs more than 100,000 workers and many of the vineyards are small, family-run businesses. The harvest season has come to a screeching halt. About 90% of the grapes in Sonoma county had been picked, according to Karissa Kruse, president of Sonoma County Winegrowers, but the remainder represented wages for an agricultural workforce largely made up of immigrants. “We still have to pay this by tomorrow,” said Rene Reyes, as he stood in the parking lot of Elsie Allen high school in Santa Rosa, clutching a phone bill. Reyes, his wife and their three-year-old daughter had been sleeping at the school for three nights. Were it not for the fires, he probably would have spent the week harvesting grapes. The day labor center had called to say there was no work. He wasn’t sure how he was going to keep his phone in service. “It’s a big problem,” Reyes said. “We still have to pay the bills, the rent.” The predominantly Spanish-speaking workforce has also grappled with confusion and fear, especially for those without documents. “The national guard got called in this week to help,” said Alicia Sanchez, president of a bilingual radio station that tailors its broadcasts to farm workers and has been fielding calls from terrified listeners. “They are standing in front of the shelters in green uniforms and they have rifles. The Mexican people started calling us and saying, ‘Migration is here,’ and we say, ‘No, no, no.’” Sanchez said the station was encouraging listeners to make use of shelters but its headquarters had also turned into a gathering place. “They feel safe here,” she said. Bucklin said he would like to harvest the 15% to 20% of his grapes that remain on the vine, but he was not going to make demands of the harvest crew amid the emergency. Even if people wanted to get to work, road closures, evacuation orders and the fires that continue make accessing the fields impossible for most. Wine connoisseurs warn that grapes that remain on the vine will suffer from “smoke taint”, an ashy taste. But Bucklin is something of an iconoclast. He doesn’t irrigate his plants, and said he “liked the idea of a little smoke taint” as a sort of memorial to this year. “We’re going to remember this vintage for a long time,” he said. Rene Byck, co-owner of the Paradise Ridge Winery that lost its tasting room, most of its facilities and about 11,000 cases of wine, said he believed farm workers would be able to find work relatively easily once the recovery gets under way. More concerning was the housing farm workers rely on. The city of Santa Rosa, where entire neighborhoods were leveled, lost about 5%. Homeowners will have the backing of insurance companies to rebuild. Renters and poor people will not. “Our event coordinator lost her house and we’re not going to be doing events at the winery for some time,” Byck said. Insurance would cover some employees’ costs, he said, “but I don’t know for how long.” On Thursday morning, Pierre and Nathalie Birebent caught rides with reporters up to Signorello Estate, a family owned winery in Napa where Pierre is winemaker and vineyard manager and Nathalie works in the tasting room. Pierre, a sixth-generation winemaker from Corsica, battled the flames last Sunday night alongside two employees, but the winery’s main structure fell. As the wreckage of her workplace came into view, Nathalie cried. “It is one thing to see the pictures …” she said, trailing off into silence. Pierre, who a few weeks ago celebrated his 20th harvest with Signorello, was confident the estate would recover. Owner Ray Signorello had committed to rebuilding and was in the process of renting a temporary office in Napa. The skies were blue and the air seemed almost clear for the first time all week. The tasting room was leveled but the wicker furniture on its patio was untouched. Trees on the hillside were scorched but a shrine to the Virgin Mary erected by Catholic workers had been spared. A few hours later, the winds began to shift and the plume of smoke over the mountains dividing Napa from Sonoma began to darken and grow. Helicopters and planes could be seen flying low over the peaks. The haze thickened and the view was gone. “It doesn’t stop, it’s not going to end,” said Nathalie Birebent. “An earthquake is better. It’s bad, but then it’s over.” • This article was amended on 16 October 2017.

The details of the latest case, which follows hard on the heels of two previous cases that found against Netanyahu for wrongful employment practices, also follows a warning that she faces potential prosecution allegations of fraudulent spending in the prime minister’s official residence. The new civil suit was filed on Thursday by an unnamed 24-year-old ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman who worked as a cleaner at the official residence in Balfour Street, Jerusalem, for a month earlier this year. The suit brought by a former cleaner – identified only as SR – alleges Netanyahu verbally abused the woman, and claims that during one outburst she appeared about to strike her. The legal claim adds Netanyahu regards employees as “slaves”, preferring highly religious women from the ultra-Orthodox community, whom it suggests she believes to be harder working, as well as more introverted and compliant. Describing a dress code related to Netanyahu’s alleged concern with extreme cleanliness (also alluded to in previous court cases brought by former employees) the suit alleges: “SR was required to pack each item [of clothing] separately in two sealed and sterile bags, and at the end of each work day was supposed to take them home, wash them (even if they had not been worn) and reseal them in new sterile bags.” The claim adds: “Mrs Netanyahu emphasised in an unequivocal manner that SR must ‘take care’ to ensure that her children did not come into contact with the washed items and/or the sterile bags,” explaining “that children carry many diseases and it was feared that the items could be contaminated”. According to the claim, staff were required to wash hands on multiple occasions, were prohibited from eating while at work and also reprimanded for asking for breaks. According to SR’s deposition she was scolded by Netanyahu, who allegedly said: “I have just been to Argentina and suffered for the state of Israel. You have some nerve asking for breaks.” Matters allegedly came to a head at the beginning of October after Netanyahu allegedly became angry over a missing pair of shoes when – the claim continues – she appeared to raise her hand as if to hit the cleaner. The Facebook page for Benjamin Netanyahu – who has habitually denied any allegations of wrongdoing in the household as persecution, even after the two successful lawsuits against his wife – once again refuted the new allegations. On Facebook, the prime minister called the allegations a “blackmail attempt” and an “absurd, false claim”. He said: “An employee who worked only a few days, and for that she is trying to blackmail us for 225,000 shekels [£48,500] and get easy publicity and money, and defame Mrs Netanyahu. There is no end to the persecution. There is no end to the lies, and there is no end to the character assassination.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/27/turmoil-ahead-as-larissa-waters-and-fiona-nash-plan-for-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T09:18:56Z","webTitle":"Turmoil ahead as Larissa Waters and Fiona Nash plan for comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/turmoil-ahead-as-larissa-waters-and-fiona-nash-plan-for-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/turmoil-ahead-as-larissa-waters-and-fiona-nash-plan-for-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Turmoil ahead as Larissa Waters and Fiona Nash plan for comeback","bodyText":"The former Greens senator Larissa Waters could be back in Canberra within months, despite having had to resign because of her dual citizenship, under Greens internal processes that allow preselected candidates to take their place in the Senate before facing the voters. Andrew Bartlett is expected to replace Waters after Friday’s adverse high court decision, but it is possible Waters could return via a casual vacancy if she is preselected late this year or early next year at the top of the Greens Queensland Senate ticket. The handover, which may be pushed by members, can happen only by agreement. The swap-out could also happen in other states, such as New South Wales, where Mehreen Faruqi will run for Greens preselection for the Senate in 2019, in a challenge to Lee Rhiannon. When asked by Guardian Australia on Friday if she hoped to come back to parliament after gaining preselection, Waters said: “Hopefully yes.” For his part, Bartlett said his intention was to “hit the ground running” after the court ruling. “Having done it before I know what’s involved. We’ve had a lot of disruption and uncertainty for the last three months so we need to get on with it,” Bartlett said. “We’ve got a state election happening soon, a party preselection after that for the next election, so some time down the track after a lot of discussion with members we’ll think about things, but I’m certainly intending to take up the seat if that’s how things pan out, and get on with the job.” Asked if he would challenge Waters for the party’s Queensland Senate spot in the coming preselection, he said that was too far into the future to think about. “It’s a long way down the track, we’ve got a state election to focus on first so I’m really just wanting to get a Greens representative back in [federal parliament] and get on with the job for the moment.” The Greens are not the only party facing complicated internal pressures as a consequence of Friday’s high court decision. The court knocked out the Nationals deputy leader and New South Wales senator Fiona Nash, but she wants to remain in politics. It is understood that if Nash doesn’t return as part of the resolution of the high court decision, she is highly unlikely to contest the federal election in 2019, which will leave the Nationals short of a senior woman with ministerial experience. The Liberal party’s Hollie Hughes, who held the sixth spot on the NSW Senate ticket, will seek to retain Nash’s seat if the looming recount shows she has won it. The Nationals want Hughes to vacate that spot in favour of Nash. The looming dispute will have to be hammered out between the NSW Liberal and National parties. The Nationals want Malcolm Turnbull to intervene in an effort to shore up Nash, but the situation is delicate, given the relationships between the Coalition partners, and the government’s precarious political position in the parliament. A senior National pary member said: “We aren’t going down without a fight, but we don’t want to blow up the farm, either.” The prime minister spoke about Nash on Friday in the past tense, paying tribute to her service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/27/jigsaw-review-tobin-bell-halloween","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T08:22:35Z","webTitle":"Jigsaw review – no shock, no horror in tame torture-porn reboot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/27/jigsaw-review-tobin-bell-halloween","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/27/jigsaw-review-tobin-bell-halloween","fields":{"headline":"Jigsaw review – no shock, no horror in tame torture-porn reboot","bodyText":"Cinema’s most sanctimonious sicko is back. For six years until 2010, Jigsaw, the moralising serial killer of the Saw franchise, turned up like clockwork in a new torture-porn sequel – each one outdoing the last in vileness. Time was finally called with the bogusly titled Saw 3D: The Final Chapter. Now, with grinding inevitability, comes the reboot, a slick soulless horror flick just in time for Halloween, more trick than treat. For the uninitiated, Jigsaw is John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminally ill sadist and inventor of extravagant death traps designed to torture and kill sinners in revolting ways. Even eight films in, there’s still a hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck prickle as five strangers wake up groggily from a drug-induced sleep. Each is wearing a metal hood and chained by the neck to a wall fitted with rotating saws. Kramer’s booming voice demands they confess their crimes or lose a limb or three. What follows is an extreme version of an office team-building away day: as the five must join forces to be freed, work together nicely or drown in a giant vat of grain. When the bodies start piling up, the cops are left scratching their heads, since Kramer has been cold in his grave for a decade. Have they got a copycat killer on their hands? (Presumably one who’s been crowdfunding his seriously high-spec torture gadgetry.) To their credit, brothers Michael and Peter Spierig – joint directors and newcomers to the franchise – have reset Saw to factory settings, mostly dispensing with the self-involved franchise mythology and nonsensical, convoluted plotting that bogged down the later films. They stick with the core Saw values of zero laughs, one-dimensional characterisation, bland acting and a ta-da twist at the end. Jigsaw feels somewhat tamer than earlier Saw films, its serrated edges less sharp. Or perhaps some us watching have developed thicker-skins, and seeing a human head sliced like a pizza by lasers just doesn’t have the effect it used to. Why drag the franchise back now? The screamingly obvious answer is sheer cash-grab cynicism. Or perhaps it’s to cater to the generation of kids who’ve grown up riding the Saw-themed roller coaster at Thorpe Park. Either way, it’s depressing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/27/xi-jinping-thought-to-be-taught-in-chinas-universities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T05:29:49Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping Thought to be taught in China's universities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/27/xi-jinping-thought-to-be-taught-in-chinas-universities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/27/xi-jinping-thought-to-be-taught-in-chinas-universities","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping Thought to be taught in China's universities","bodyText":"Earnestly, resolutely, purposefully, consciously, conscientiously and, above all, constantly. That is how China’s 89 million Communist party cadres are now expected to study and implement the thoughts of their leader, Xi Jinping, after his political ponderings were enshrined in its constitution earlier this week. According to reports in China’s party-run media, they have already begun. Two university departments dedicated to the examination of Xi Jinping Thought have this week been created while “study groups” are being promoted across the country as officials scramble to follow the zeitgeist of what Xi has dubbed his “new era”. The first and most prominent of the Xi-related departments will be at Beijing’s Renmin or People’s University, one of China’s top institutions. The Beijing Daily newspaper reported that following Xi’s elevation, the university had tasked top scholars with probing what is officially called Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era. They include Ai Silin, president of the School of Marxism at Tsinghua University, Xi’s alma mater, and Han Qingxiang, a senior academic from the Communist party’s Party School. “[The department] will also help universities around the country incorporate Xi Thought into their textbooks and introduce it to their classrooms, as well as into students’ minds,” the Beijing Daily said. Liu Wei, the university’s head, told the newspaper: “The establishment of Xi Jinping Thought … is of epoch-making significance.” Liu, who will also be head of the newly-established unit, described its foundation as “a responsibility entrusted by the time to the People’s University of China.” A second centre is reportedly being set up in Tianjin, a city about 70 miles southeast of Beijing. According to E-North, a local news website, that department opened on Wednesday at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics and will focus on the “ideological and political education” of local students. Further afield, the Global Times reported that “study groups” were being organised from north to south, where cadres could “learn and implement the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”. Cai Qi, a Xi ally who is Beijing’s Communist party chief and was this week promoted into China’s 25-member politburo, said “studying, promoting and implementing the spirit” of Xi’s thinking was now the Chinese capital’s “top priority”. Skeptics question how responsive Chinese students are likely to be to Xi’s Marx-tinged musings. In an interview on the eve of Xi’s ideological elevation, Susan Shirk, a noted China expert who was US deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, said she currently saw no sign of “popular concern” about his rule. “He appears to be very popular with the public … people in China like a strong leader - just like people in America like a strong leader.” But Shirk questioned whether China’s increasingly worldly and well-educated citizens would embrace or resist having more ideology forced into their classrooms and said such opposition would be a barometer of broader feelings towards the regime. “I’m waiting to see, for example: Is there more political study in secondary schools? Are these middle class parents going to have their kids wasting their time studying the latest version of Chinese Marxism, which they think is somehow going to hold them back in their educational and career ambitions? I’m waiting to see the ways - if he pursues this kind of more totalitarian vision over society - that society may push back.” Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said she suspected a “dictatorial” and highly ideological model would not easily mesh with the realities of 21st century China. “It just seems out of step to me. It’s kind of history going backward.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/29/womens-ashes-2017-australia-v-england-third-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T07:31:55Z","webTitle":"Women's Ashes 2017: Australia v England, third one-day international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/29/womens-ashes-2017-australia-v-england-third-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/29/womens-ashes-2017-australia-v-england-third-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"Women's Ashes 2017: Australia v England, third one-day international – as it happened","bodyText":"Right, that’s it from us here. Credit to England for digging deep and getting on the board for the first time this series. It ensures the series is still alive, and that victory in the Test match (worth four points) will take them into the lead as they come into it trailing by two. With 10 points still up for grabs – each of the three T20is are worth two, like the ODIs – it’s all to play for. The Guardian will have live OBO coverage of the Test from North Sydney Oval, starting November 9th. See you then! 48th over: Australia 267-9 (McGrath 17, Schutt 6) A boundary to finish but it’s too little too late. England are on the board in the Ashes. Victory sees them head into the four-point Test match trailing by just two points. An outstanding fightback from England, who were up against it when Alyssa Healy’s opening assault got Australia off to the perfect start. She was shelled on four by Fran Wilson, before going on to make a run-a-ball 71. That seemed to have done the trick. England looked bereft of ideas, as Bolton cracked on to a half-century of her own. But some smart bowling and pro-active captaincy from Heather Knight wrestled things backs, bit by bit. Australia were 159 for one but fell in a heap – 206 for six when Ash Garnder departed in the 41st over. Alex Hartley takes the biscuit with three for 45, but it was Nat Sciver’s two for 24 from eight overs, along with Jenny Gunn’s two for 59 that helped England keep their cool in the middle overs. 4-2 to Australia after the ODIs... Teach me, Sarah Taylor. Ridiculous hands. A short window to whip the bails off as Wellington’s back foot comes off the ground. Big enough for Taylor to do what she does best. Gunn’s first wicket comes at the death as Australia go down swinging. Blackwell attempts a slog sweep, with her side needing big hits and snookers to get over the line. Sciver skips along the outfield to take the catch. 29 needed from 3... 47th over: Australia 247-7 (Blackwell 36, McGrath 15) After faffing about with dabs and sweeps, McGrath decides to hit a forceful shot through the off side and forces Heather Knight to misfield at extra cover. Four to score but nowhere near enough to give England anything to worry about. Australia require 31 from the last six balls... 46th over: Australia 240-7 (Blackwell 33, McGrath 11) Even the full tosses are only going for one. McGrath might have been better served going over the off side as there is no one out marshalling that boundary. Everyone (within reason) is out on the money-making side, where both these right-handers are trying to pepper. No dice. 38 needed from 12... 45th over: Australia 234-7 (Blackwell 30, McGrath 8) This is a pretty special comeback from England. Cutters and slower balls have done the trick, as Shrusbole upholds that attack with more variety than a bag of Revels. 49 needed from the final three overs... 44th over: Australia 230-7 (Blackwell 28, McGrath 6) Just six runs taken from the over and it nearly ends in a run out. Gunn swoops on a tip into the leg side, gathers and turns to throw at the nonstriker’s end. Out if she hits, even with Blackwell’s dive, but she’s wide by a tick. With no boundary in the over, the run rate strikes 12... 43rd over: Australia 224-7 (Blackwell 25, McGrath 3) Shrubsole back into the attack and it’s like she never left. Three runs off the first five balls means a big shot is needed... and Blackwell provides it, dropping to one knee and sweeping a length ball around to fine leg for four. 54 needed from 30... 42nd over: Australia 217-7 (Blackwell 20, McGrath 1) Pressure valve taking the strain just before Jonassen uses her feet to hit over the top and straight for a one-bounce four. The ball after, Hartley corrects her line and gets immediate results. 61 from 36 required.. Quality from Hartley! Pace off the ball and turn catches Jonassen unawares and a leading edge is plinked back to Hartley, who gets her third wicket of the innings. 41st over: Australia 209-6 (Blackwell, Jonassen 1) Jonassen gets off the mark with a clamp down on a yorker from Sciver, who has dragged England back into contention with her frugality. A tick under 10-an-over needed for Australia... Garnder snatches at one and skies a cutter from Sciver! No distance at all and the 18-year-old Sophie Ecclestone is as cool as you like at mid off, taking the ball above her eyes to complete the dismissal. Jess Jonassen moves up, too, in with 73 needed from 46... 40th over: Australia 205-5 (Blackwell 15, Garnder 3) Gardner off the mark with a well-struck two to midwicket. It would have been four but fine work between Sciver and Brunt saves two. Gunn toys with Garnder for the rest, taking all the pace off the ball leaving Garnder to swing and hoik in vain. Australia, needing 73 from 48, are now behind on DLS... 39th over: Australia 200-5 (Blackwell 13, Gardner 0) How much did England learn from that Garnder special in Brisbane? Don’t bowl at her legs, basically. Her two sixes, both hit well, came away over square leg, as she was able to swing across with the line of the ball angling into her. Cheap and easy three on offer as Sciver goes down leg for wides. 83 needed off 54... HUGE! Rachael Haynes sets herself and tries to find the fairway... instead, Brunt steadies at deep square leg and takes the catch. Here we go! Garnder in with 84 needed from 59. 38th over: Australia 194-4 (Haynes 9, Blackwell 12) Jenny Gunn back in and immediately sticking to her field. When she does veer, with a bit of movement away, Blackwell cuts delicately to beat third man, who started up in the circle. Good running from these two ensure that eight is taken from those six. It’s not enough in the grand scheme of things. Surely – surely – Ashleigh Gardner has to be given a go up the order... 37th over: Australia 186-4 (Haynes 7, Blackwell 6) Steady as Sciver goes. Little to get away as the run rate required reads “8.36”. 36th over: Australia 181-4 (Haynes 6, Blackwell 2) Not just the first run in 13 deliveries as Blakwell scampers a single with a sweep to fine leg, but Haynes then uses her feet to crack a four over the top and down the ground. 35th over: Australia 174-4 (Haynes 1, Blackwell 0) Knight ringing the changes as Nat Sciver comes back into the attack, cramping the left-handed Haynes for room with a steady stump-to-stump line from over the wicket, backed up by strong presence in the ring. And that, my friends, is back-to-back maidens! Cracking effort from England, who looked lost about half-an-hour ago. 34th over: Australia 174-4 (Haynes 1, Blackwell 0) From 159-1 to 174-4. That’s quite a collapse. Anyway, up steps Alex Blackwell, 250 games up and another match-winning hand to play. 104 needed from 84... What was that?! Alex Hartley into the attack and, first ball, Villani hits to the only fielder down the ground! 33rd over: Australia 174-3 (Villani 8, Haynes 1) Tip and run to mid off looks foolish but Perry survives with a dive and an off-target throw from Gunn, who had gathered first-time. She doesn’t make it out the over though. A big scalp. Pace off the ball does it again! Perry is far too early on a lofted drive. Gunn, at mid off, has to dive forward as the ball dies on its way to her. 106 needed from 93 and the Austrlaia captain Rachael Haynes comes out to the crease, fresh from her 89* in the second ODI... 32nd over: Australia 170-2 (Perry 21, Villani 6) It’s been a decent second spell so far from Ecclestone, who almost yorks Perry, who is itching to get down the track. So is Villani, who manages to get under another full delivery. This time, she gets distance, beating long off to the straight boundary. 31st over: Australia 163-2 (Perry 20, Villani 1) That pressure almost tells as new batsman Villani hits high and not very far over extra cover. Shrubsole is the bowler, by the way, as Knight looks to pick on the insecurity of two new heads at the crease. Perry keeps hers, running a couple own to third man. 30th over: Australia 160-2 (Perry 18, Villani 0) So then... 18 overs left, 118 to get. Australia bat deep, of course, but England need to maintain this pressure. There are a few mistakes waiting to be exploited in this batting card... Now then... Bolton, for some reason, tries to go big down the ground when she’s had most of her success square of the wicket. Winfield, running to the edge of the 30-yard-circle, doesn’t have too much to think about as she takes a simple catch. 29th over: Australia 156-1 (Bolton 62, Perry 14) That big shot has come and Perry, finally, feels one out of the screws. Brunt bowls a slower ball and Perry swings hard and through the ball, over midwicket for four. The over actually started with a review as Taylor, standing up, whips the bails off in a flash. Not out by a long shot but at least we get a few replays of a nifty bit of keeping. Anwyay, another slower ball is pumped to the boundary – this time square leg and off the bat of Nicole Bolton. Just put some heat on it and knock ‘em down, Brunty... 28th over: Australia 146-1 (Bolton 58, Perry 9) Ecclestone back into the attack. Immediately, there’s a whiff of a fume of a chance as Bolton advances, loses her footing and plinks one in the air in the direction of Hartley at square leg. Survives as it falls short and even manages a single. When Bolton is back on strike, she flips her hands and reverse sweeps with all the flexibility of a Lego figurine doused in concerete. Still gets four behind square, mind. 27th over: Australia 140-1 (Bolton 53, Perry 8) The require run rate has ticked above 6.5 by the way. Brunt knows Perry is going to play her “properly”, as it were, so the field is bang on, with little to work with through the cover or mid on. Big shot coming? 26th over: Australia 137-1 (Bolton 51, Perry 7) Perry picks up her first boundary in style. Hartley goes flat and straight and so does Australia’s premier allrounder: elbow to the sky, foot to the ball, four down the ground. 25th over: Australia 133-1 (Bolton 50, Perry 3) Knight turns to Brunt with new bat Perry on strike. Immediately, there’s something there: Perry getting away with a single to square leg as one moves in and catches the inside edge of the right-hander’s bat. The change of strike allows Bolton to punch Brunt over midwicket for her 11th ODI half-century. Comparitively, she’s taken her time – 70 balls, 38 dots – but she did her bit in assisting Healy early on and is now trying to kick things on herself. Five fours so far... 24th over: Australia 126-1 (Bolton 46, Perry 1) Bolton’s suddenly got a bit antsy. Perhaps she feels she needs to be the aggressor now that Healy is gone. But it’s a cap that doesn’t suit her well, as evidence by an attempted thump down the ground that barely makes it out of the inner ring. Lauren Winfield, chasing in from deep, can’t get to the chance and is lucky not to been sconned by the ball as it kicks off the turf in front of her. 23rd over: Australia 122-1 (Bolton 43, Perry 0) ANOTHER DROP! Tricky again but Gunn’s a good enough fielder to take that: reaching to her right at midwicket as Bolton, for a second-time, is dropped in that region. Reprieved on 24 and then on 40. 22nd over: Australia 118-1 (Bolton, Perry 0) Mark Taylor on commentary wonders aloud if Healy should have kept that big shot in the bag. It’s a comment drenched in hindsight, but he has a point. Bolton had started the over with a couple of fours. Plenty had been done. Deserved from Hartley and a fine knock from Healy comes to an end. The pressure tells as the keeper-bat, who has had things her own way since being dropped on four, tries to force one high and over wide mid on. Instead, she finds Katherine Brunt, bounding and sliding in from deep midwicket, who takes a fine catch. 21st over: Australia 108-0 (Healy 70, Bolton 30) Good from Sciver. Her variations are finding a bit of something in the pitch. It’s not huge, but it’s a bit of turn here and a touch of bounce there. Bolton nearly nicks behind as she follows an off-cutter off the pitch. 20th over: Australia 106-0 (Healy 69, Bolton 29) It’s a feather in Hartley’s cap that both are trying to walk all over the crease to try and get here away. As a result, LBW’s in play. A bit of turn squares up Healy, who then walks right across her stumps and just gets an under-edge down to fine leg to keep that dismissal at bay. 19th over: Australia 101-0 (Healy 66, Bolton 27) Hundred up for no damage. Australia romping home as it stands and look like they’re heading into the Test match with a hand already on the Ashes. A false shot from Healy results in a leading edge just short of point. 18th over: Australia 98-0 (Healy 65, Bolton 25) A second drop! This time it’s Nat Sciver at midwicket and it comes at the end of a fine over from Alex Hartley. With the pressure ramping up on Nicole Bolton, she thwacks across the line. Sciver picks it up early, moving sharply to her right and getting both hands to the ball. However, it’s too powerfully hit and it breaks through her hands for a single. A life for Bolton on 24... 17th over: Australia 95-0 (Healy 65, Bolton 24) Nat Sciver, seamers and cutters in the bag, comes into the attack for the first time today. She’s usually good for a wicket at a time like this. Bolton works a couple and keeps England interested with a scratchy looking drive that, at another time, might have found hands in the ring... 16th over: Australia 92-0 (Healy 64, Bolton 22) Ecclestone’s 13-run second over means she makes way for fellow slow southpaw Alex Hartley. These two batsmen exchange the strike and eye up a first hundred opening stand of the summer after the second ODI’s 98... 15th over: Australia 87-0 (Healy 63, Bolton 18) Tainted Love on the jukebox at Coffs Harbour after Gunn wrestles back her economy rate with a useful over that just goes for one run (a wide, no less). 14th over: Australia 86-0 (Healy 63, Bolton 18) Milestone in the bag, Healy starts to unwind. A charge and dab to Ecclestone (around the wicket) beats Alex Hartley in a race to third man. The very next ball, she drives uppishly and deliberately over mid on for another boundary. Two deliveries later and we have a contender for shot of the series so far: inside out, checked drive, over extra cover. Teach me. A swiped single to midwicket takes Healy to her ODI career-best... 13th over: Australia 73-0 (Healy 50, Bolton 18) A loose shot from Healy, as an inside edge squirts away to square leg, but it’s consecutive half-centuries for the keeper-bat, who is making that opening spot her own. The digits: 44 deliveries, nine fours. 12th over: Ausrtalia 71-0 (Bolton 17, Healy 48) Tall left-armer Sophie Ecclestone takes over from Shrubsole, whose first five overs returned 0-15. A full toss to start isn’t ideal, but Healy keeps it down to Wyatt stationed right on the square leg rope. When Ecclestone drifts one down leg, Healy cashes in: down on one knee, sweeping hard and fine for four. For a moment, the scoreboard suggests that it’s her fifty. Bolton comes down, they shake hands and then watch on as the number ticks back to “48”. A single takes Healy a step closer. 11th over: Australia 63-0 (Healy 43, Bolton 15) The value of Jenny Gunn is that she doesn’t really go for many. But on this pitch, and with Healy in this form, her margins for error are very small. As such, a ping to midwicket from a ball that looked fairly on the money gets Healy for more. A second half-century in as many ODIs in the offing... 10th over: Australia 55-0 (Healy 38, Bolton 14) With the loss of two overs, the first Power Play is done after nine, so we’re into the second phase here, with only four fielders needed in the circle. One of them, sub-fielder Danni Wyatt, misses a golden opportunity to make the breakthrough. Bolton tips and runs straight to the fielder, having missed out on a few strikes already, and gives up the goose halfway down. Wyatt, however, can’t find the stumps at the nonstriker’s end. Bolton makes it to 14... Healy finishes the over with a hoik to midwicket for a couple. 9th over: Australia 52-0 (Healy 36, Bolton 13) The fifty partnership up in controlled fashion. Bolton brings up the milestone with a four around the corner, picked up off the pads, to take her into double-figures. Meanwhile, in the Sheffield Shield... 8th over: Australia 46-0 (Healy 36, Bolton 8) England bowlers queing up to bowl at Bolton, for the sake of their figures. That being said, she’s not doing much wrong. Shrubsole keeps her in check before a nice looking drive down the ground allows Bolton to pinch the strike. Dropped on four, coming to the fore: 7th over: Australia 44-0 (Healy 35, Bolton 7) First sign of a bit of rain on the pitch as Jenny Gunn takes a tumble. No other real tells of a bit of extra juice in the pitch. After watching the first few deliveries closely, Healy decides to pick up where she left off and crunches over the top of midwicket for four. First bits of info filtering through... Australia’s chase has been reduced to 48 overs. As such, they’ll now require a revised target of 278. And the players are back out there. Gunn to finish off the seventh over. First email of my stint: “Terrible lack of urgency and downright slapstick clumsiness getting the covers on.” Yep, it really was quite comical. A good deal of rain will have got on that pitch and, to be honest, it’ll benefit England’s bowlers, who couldn’t find much in the surface in those first six-and-a-bit overs. The rain has stopped though. The brooms are out in force to get rid of the surface water that has collected during that sharp deluge. Eeeesh, really does look grim out there. Should they really be allowed to play cricket in Australia? The just don’t have the climate for it. You know what, probably best to can this series – let’s call it a draw – and the upcoming men’s Ashes, too. Who holds them, again? Just as Healy flicks new bowler Jenny Gunn around the corner for four, the rain picks up and the players are scampering off. It’s looking quite heavy from my pictures, as the groundstaff rush to get the covers on. Looks like they’ve been caught unawares. Anyway, it’s a handy time for England to get off the field and regroup. 6th over: Australia 35-0 (Healy 26, Bolton 7) Edge drawn off Bolton, but wide of second slip and away to third man. To the moral victor (Shrubsole), the hollow spoils. With Healy on strike, Knight puts in a three-quarters square leg for the pull in the air, as Taylor comes up to the stumps to keep the form woman in her crease. 5th over: Australia 33-0 (Healy 25, Bolton 6) Peculiar start to the over, as Healy flat-bats a pull down the ground for one, then Bolton’s postcard-perfect straight drive thumps into the stumps at the nonstriker’s end. Both return one run to the Australian score. Nevermind, says Healy, as she gets value from two of the next three deliveries: using width to clout off the back foot through cover for four and then manufacturing enough length to swipe through midwicket for just as many. ICYMI: she was shelled on four... 4th over: Australia 23-0 (Healy 16, Bolton 5) Nicole Bolton comes to the party. Undone by a bit of away shape from Shrubsole, she latches onto a shorter ball and, walking away to square leg, punches it along the carpet through cover point for four. 3rd over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 16, Bolton 1) Yep, that’ll do. Pristine lofted straight-drive from Healy: a hit so clean you could eat your dinner off it. Brunt unimpressed. Then again, it was off her bowling. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 8, Bolton 0) BIG DROP! Extrapolating a touch here, but considering how well Healy’s been batting, Fran Wilson has let one slip at point off the bowling of Anya Shrubsole. It was a sweetly timed hit to point, but Wilson was in position early and moving to her right – both hands out, following the ball, no dive necessary. So the fact that she could only tip it past the post instead of send Healy on her way is bitterly disappointing for England. What an early blow that would have been. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 0) Carry and shape for Katherine Brunt. Timing and poise from Alyssa Healy, even if there was a play-and-miss in among that first six. Australia’s chase off the mark with a classy inside-out drive from Healy, who covers whatever movement there is to thread four through cover. Morning and/or good afternoon, depending on your location in this wonderful world of ours. Vish here, taking you through England’s defence of their 284. Australia need to dig deep and chase what would rank as the second best in women’s ODIs. Healy and Bolton v Brunt up first... A sketchy innings in many ways, each time England looked to be ready to explore, wickets followed. It was the case with Taylor, who was slaying them until giving it away on 69. Then Beaumont, who was working towards top gear before finding her back foot out of her crease when Healy executed a handy little diving backhander. The Australian ‘keeper was outstanding, also responsible for Gunn’s wicket, but Schutt was the star. She was frutal early, then took wickets in each of her next three spells as well - twice within balls of her reintroduction. That’s what you want and need from an attack leader, her 4-44 return a well-earned return. For England, it was captain Heather Knight who kept it all together. She batted with seven partners through the course of her innings and was still there at the end, cracking a lovely inside-out drive to finish the 50 overs that summed up her resourcefulness throughout, especially when sweeping. Perry also did her job with the other new ball, trapping Winfield in the opening exchanges before coming back strongly later as well, trapping England number six Fran Wilson who became the second in a collapse of 3-9 that prevented a 300+ total. Wellington was the spinner most likely for Australia, but again went wicketless. Finger spinners Jonassen and Gardner were more expensive than usual, both picking up a wicket in the final overs. All told, it will take some getting for Australia, even if England probably missed the chance to go well above a run-a-ball. The pressure transfers to the tourists’ attack. Can they do the job and keep England in this series? Find out with Vish, who will take over from me in the middle of the night from London. Livin la vida loca, he is. Thanks for your company. Bye for now! 50th over: England 284-8 (Knight 88, Ecclestone 1) Knight belts two, in the gap between the sweepers on the legside. But only one to the fourth ball. That leaves Ecclestone two deliveries. How will the 18-year-old handle this? Get off strike for the last ball? Go for gold? Both, kind of - slapping across the line to Blackwell, who missed a direct hit. Knight to face the last ball of the innings and... it is flighted up, so Knight goes inside-out over cover to get a four! Well played. She finishes on 88 in 80 balls. Some final thoughts in a tic before I hand over to Vish. Shrubsole holes out to deep midwicket, unable to make enough contact with a sweep across the line. They did well to get Knight off strike to the first ball courtesy of a bye. Sure it wasn’t intentional from Healy, but it worked. In saying that, Knight will be on strike again now with the batsman crossing when the ball was mid-air. Four balls left. 49th over: England 275-7 (Knight 81, Shrubsole 1) Determined running between the England leadership axis eeked out five runs, but Schutt’s variety of slower balls never allowed them to reach the boundary. They could have from the last ball, driven hard to cover, but a determined dive from Gardner made sure it would only be one. Six from the penultimate over, along with the wicket. What a catch! Healy has again looked after Schutt here, to get her a fourth. It was very good bowling, winning the edge. But it was Healy who had the skills to stay low enough for long enough, coming up only when she had to, to glove it expertly. “Brilliant catch to ignore your instincts!” says her uncle on the commentary, who knew a little bit about the wicketkeeping caper. 48th over: England 269-6 (Knight 77, Gunn 16) First SIX of the match! Knight gets down on the knee again and wallops Gardner over long-on. That will do it. Singles throughout the rest, with Gunn retaining the strike with a single down the ground. 11 from it. Two overs left. 47th over: England 258-6 (Knight 69, Gunn 13) Schutt is back. Has struck in each of her three spells so far. Looks like the official ruling on the Healy wicket was a stumping, so she gets that one too. Handy. Two overs to go for her. No boundaries coming from this one, Gunn’s cover-driven three to begin the over the best of it. Seven from it. 46th over: England 251-6 (Knight 67, Gunn 7) Knight finishes off a middling over with a bang, sweeping hard behind square, one bounce over the rope. Until then four singles off Gardner, but it finishes off netting eight. She has a couple to go and probably will have to bowl them out from here, having been more effective today than Jonassen. The 250 also up. 45th over: England 243-6 (Knight 61, Gunn 5) Perry gets through her final over with seven from it - a good result for Australia at this stage. But Gunn will be happy as well, lashing a cover drive away. Could cause a bit of damage in the final few overs as she did in the World Cup group game against Australia in July. That cameo proved matchwinning, after all. The shot has was so productive for them when the runs flowed earlier, but Brunt falls to a sweep that she has top edged to Perry running around at square leg. Gardner has been popped in for an over here and an over there through the course of the innings, and she’s finally in the book. Deservedly so, she has been pretty good. And only two runs from the over. Well bowled. Six to go. 44th over: England 236-5 (Knight 59, Gunn 0) 43rd over: England 234-5 (Knight 57, Brunt 12) Shot. Knight begins Perry’s new over with a crisp cover drive through the gap, racing away for four. She’s back in the right spot by the end of the set, finishing with a well-directed yorker. 42nd over: England 227-5 (Knight 51, Brunt 11) Knight to 50, her 14th in ODIs, with a square drive out to the deep. Got a bad decision on Thursday but has bounced back well here with a 54-ball hand that continues to place her side well. Later in the over she’s again sweeping Wellington, who concedes five from her final over. Doesn’t look it on paper, wicketless again, but she’s just great. 41st over: England 222-5 (Knight 48, Brunt 9) Righto, happy hour. Gardner gets the first over of it. And after keeping it tight to date, she’s gone for ten here. Knight does the bulk of the work, pulling into the gap at midwicket for four then carving to third man for three. Perfect start to the final ten. See the Healy run out/stumping earlier. What is it, then? And why? 40th over: England 212-5 (Knight 40, Brunt 7) Jonassen back. And again she is expensive, conceding nine. Singles early on, then a wide, then Brunt tucks into a cover drive. Her batting has evolved significantly, now a legit all-rounder in a T20 context, coming in at four for the Yorkshire Diamonds in this year’s KSL and doing it well. Then made England’s first half-century of the series on Thursday night, her maiden 50 in ODIs, too. My point: if she can stick around with Heather Knight to the end of this England innings, they could still go big. 39th over: England 203-5 (Knight 38, Brunt 1) Yep, Wilson smashed it. Should prompt a discussion as to why DRS isn’t being used in this series. Bilaterial women series don’t come bigger. Unprecedented coverage. A shame the cash hasn’t been splashed to get the technology here as well. Wilson on the advance, a long way down, Perry has hit Wilson on the full so there’s little hesitation for the umpire. Some suggestion on the commentary that an inside edge may have been involved, but that’s unclear, and no DRS anyway. To be fair, she was probably out last over leg before and saved by the lack of review. So the right result. England aren’t in strife, but they their position has weakened significanly losing 3 for 9 in the space of the last four overs. 38th over: England 200-4 (Knight 36, Wilson 0) BIG SHOUT for lbw, another full ball moving a long way, but Wilson survives. Phwoar, I reckon that’s hitting. But no DRS. Big fightback from Australia, the second time they have broken England are a vital time in this innings. Pressure transfers back to Knight, who probably has to be there at the end now for anything like 300 to be tallied. Sciver got England to 200 but not a run more, done by a superb inswinging yorker by Schutt, who is having a wonderful day. Sciver threw the bat down when realising where the ball was heading, but not in time. The end of a poor series with the bat for the all-rounder. 37th over: England 198-3 (Knight 36, Sciver 5) TV is calling the Healy dismissal a stumping. Fair dinkum? Am I going crazy? Help me out here, OBO world. Help me justify my case beyond “it’s the vibe” . Into the batting power play too, Nat Sciver has taken full advantage with a dainty little turn around the corner, fine leg up. Only two other singles. Won’t take long before she’s trying to launch a few bombs. 36th over: England 192-3 (Knight 35, Sciver 0) “Cricket is not fair some times,” the assessment of England legend Charlotte Edwards on the telly. “You play so well and get out like that.” Nat Sciver joins Knight. These two did huge damage batting together in the World Cup. They have 14 overs here. Brilliant! Schutt’s introduction has brought an immediate reward again, but not conventionally. Beaumont got in position to lap, missed, and the ball spilled inside Healy’s reach, flicked back onto the woodwork with the England opener’s foot still out of her ground. That’s a very important dismissal. Beaumont tends to go really big when getting this far into an innings. Not today. HAS HEALY RUN BEAUMONT OUT? Going upstairs. 35th over: England 185-2 (Beaumont 69, Knight 33) Knight sweeps two more from Wellington before the leggie misses, adding a wide. Six runs tick over in total, Knight keeping the strike with a sweep as well. I’ve said sweep so many times that I am not sure if I know what the word means anymore. 34th over: England 179-2 (Beaumont 68, Knight 29) Gardner for her third spell. And sure enough, met with a sweep by Knight. They are sweeping four of six balls at the moment. And a reverse now - Beaumont missing. Half a shout for leg before. Gee, that’s close. Lydia Greenway would be loving this watching on in the UK, the England sweepoloist until her retirement last year. Down the ground by Knight this time to keep it ticking over, Beaumont another dancing. Knight keeps the strike. Guess how? Yep. Sweeping. Five from it. 33rd over: England 174-2 (Beaumont 66, Knight 26) AJ Wellington gets another go after the glass of cordial. Knight immediately off strike. The leggie determined to keep throwing it up at Beaumont. Great contest between these two. Oh, she should be gone! Fat top edge when again trying to sweep, but not to hand. 50 stand up through a Knight sweep later in the over. Beaumont wants to scamper down for one to finish, but sent back by her captain. Three from it. 32nd over: England 171-2 (Beaumont 65, Knight 24) Jonassen bounces back servicably after a poor previous over. She wins a false stroke from Knight early on, who gets four from the cut but could have gone to hand on another day. Only one further single from it. Drinks are called. 31st over: England 166-2 (Beaumont 64, Knight 19) Wellington back and Beaumont doesn’t miss a beat, sweeping with tremendous timing to end what was an otherwise useful over. Picks out the gap perfectly “What a shot!” says Healy on the TV. Too right. Wellington spinning the ball away from the right hander, but you would never know from that stroke. Slow to start, on it big time now. 30th over: England 159-2 (Beaumont 60, Knight 17) Jonassen back and the sweepathon continues. I asked Geoff Lemon the other night if he remembered Supermarket Sweep with Ian Turpie, and he didn’t. For shame. Will youtube? Let’s find out. It bloody does! Welcome to the OBO, Turps. Jonassen doesn’t help the situation, giving Beaumont a legit half-tracker, and she doesn’t miss out. Beyond 150 they go. Tammy has the ability to go through the gears very quickly. Watch for her going inside-out over cover sooner rather than later. 29th over: England 148-2 (Beaumont 51, Knight 15) Sweeps for both - reverse from Knight; conventional Beaumont. They play twice as many sweeps as Australia, the TV tells us. “Is it worth having a short-fine to stop them playing that shot?” asks Lisa Sthalekar on the TV, the former Aussie offie. 28th over: England 144-2 (Beaumont 50, Knight 13) Perry given a second. She bangs one into Beaumont, and she is up to it, hooking it away fine four! Really good shot, taking her to one short of a half-century. She gets it to the next ball. 73 balls to get there, six boundaries. Her fifth half-century in 47 ODIs and first against Australia. The second of England’s top six to raise the bat today; the first of the series. The player of the World Cup is now responsible for doubling up and getting England to 300 or there abouts. Have ample firepower down the list to help. 27th over: England 137-2 (Beaumont 44, Knight 12) Haynes keeps throwing it around with very short spells, Wellington now brought back for a second shift. Predicably big spin, four singles taken to sweepers with a minimum of risk. 26th over: England 133-2 (Beaumont 44, Knight 8) Villani on the mic now with the TV callers. She has a chip at Sarah Taylor for getting out: “Had a few brain fades out there, it’s as though it gets too easy for her.” She thinks the track is slightly better to bat on again than it was during the Thursday ODI, where Australia ran up 296 in the first innings. Perry is back after the successful one over spell from Schutt. She continues what has been a handy stint from Australia just when England looked like they were getting away from them. Three singles from it, including a quick one to finish where Perry has to do the fielding off her own bowling at cover, but misses the stumps by a long way with the turn-and-throw attempt. 12 runs and a wicket from the last four overs. 25th over: England 130-2 (Beaumont 43, Knight 6) Gardner goes from around the wicket to over at Knight. From both directions, she is right on the mark with ample flight. Known mostly for her clobbering in WBBL before playing for Australia, Gardner was initially first-choice spinner for NSW coming through junior ranks. Only a single from this over, Knight sweeping the final ball of the over to keep the strike. Doing a fine job. 24th over: England 129-2 (Beaumont 43, Knight 5) Also should note that Haynes is rewarded for bringing opener Schutt back into the attack. A big call given by doing that she won’t have as many overs from her at the death. Knight is away straight away, the England captain picking up two then three, excellent timing through midwicket to begin. Taylor gives it away! The ball after latching onto a reverse sweep with the high degree of difficulty, she’s spooned a nothing delivery to backward point. The end of an important innings, no doubt, but that had three figures all over it. She knows it too, filthy with herself for the error. 23rd over: England 120-1 (Beaumont 43, Taylor 65) Gardner racing thorugh from around the wicket, squeezing out an over in 75 seconds that only gives up a couple of singles to the sweepers. Needed that. 22nd over: England 118-1 (Beaumont 42, Taylor 64) Another big over, 12 from it. Taylor and Beaumont boundaries to the first and third ball of Jonassen’s set smashing past midwicket then long-on respectively. In fact, the second was a drive not a smash, the opener now into the 40s herself after a slow start. Urgent wicket required for Australia or this could get big and fast. 21st over: England 106-1 (Beaumont 37, Taylor 57) Gardner again. The ground announcer here at Coffs enjoys a chat. During the Thursday game, she repeatedly said that Kristen Beams was her favourite. Indeed, every time she came onto bowl she made mention of it. Today, she has decided that Garnder is “Coffs Harbour’s favourite.” Fair enough. Back to the middle, Taylor takes the first ball through midwicket for her tenth boundary. Rocking and rolling, a reverse attempted next, a couple coming. Alex Blackwell’s wonderful dive is just as good as Jonassen’s a couple of overs ago saving another boundary. “Centimetre perfect,” says Mel Jones on TV of the dive, channelling Dennis Cometti. That it was. Australia doing everything they can to keep hanging in there, but the 100 partnership is up now and they look well set. 20th over: England 97-1 (Beaumont 36, Taylor 51) One to square leg brings up Sarah Taylor’s half-century. 55 balls to get there, nine boundaries coming along the way. After a frenetic start, she’s worked into a very useful hand. The first of the England top six to make it to 50 so far in this series. Has to now do as she did a couple of times in the World Cup and push on to three figures. Four singles again from Jonassen, just as it was to her first over. 19th over: England 93-1 (Beaumont 34, Taylor 49) Ash Gardner does make it tandem finger spinners, another who had an impressive World Cup. Relatively new to the Australian set up, but already crucial for what she brings with both ball and bat. Lovely start here, throwing it up and getting plenty of turn. Four dot balls to Beaumont through the middle part of the over. Her response to the tidy line and length is a reverse sweep, making sound contact. But an excellent piece of fielding from Jonassen, flcking back into play just in time, saves a runs. Excellent cricket. 18th over: England 89-1 (Beaumont 31, Taylor 48) Jess Jonassen into the attack, replacing McGrath. Took more wickets than anyone during the first two-year cycle of the women’s ICC championship. Had an excellent World Cup, too, usually with the new ball. Four singles taken to the sweepers in her opening set. Both sides probably okay with that. Oi, are you watching? If you are, drop me a line. That’s how the OBO works best. If you’re not watching, pop it on. Good little contest here. Deserves your eyeballs. 17th over: England 85-1 (Beaumont 29, Taylor 46) It is Wello once more. Forces half a false stroke from Taylor, who doesn’t quite get to the pitch. But off strike next ball, using the crease to get deep before cutting. Beaumont does much the same to the next ball. Good accumulation. Oooooh, she beats Taylor with the last of the over. That’s really turned and bounced. How she only has one wicket in this series so far is beyond me. Three from it. 16th over: England 82-1 (Beaumont 27, Taylor 45) Runs, runs, runs! Four boundaries in five balls after Beaumont adds to in the first half of McGrath’s new over after Taylor did the same to finish off Wellington’s previous set. Down the ground over the head of Villani isn’t without risk, but does the job. The punch off the back foot is far prettier to watch, racing past point. Nine from it. Drinks. Perfectly timed for Australia, who need to regroup. Suspect we’ll see finger spinners Jonassen and Gardner into it very soon. 15th over: England 73-1 (Beaumont 18, Taylor 45) Wellington drops short, Taylor obliges with a single to point. Beaumont does the same with a sweep. OH!! Taylor dances and edges, straight to where first slip would be. And should be, no? She’s bowling beautifully. Deserves to be in the book for that. She goes again too, cutting in a similar direction for another boundary. To 45 from as many balls. 14th over: England 62-1 (Beaumont 16, Taylor 36) Beaumont cranking up the machine here, having plenty of time to get her eye in. McGrath doesn’t go plenty wrong landing a length delivery, but the opener swipes furiously across the line, timing it nicely to record her second boundary. 13th over: England 57-1 (Beaumont 11, Taylor 36) Wellington again. Taylor up to the task this time, down the track and over mid-on for a boundary. Only way to play the leggie when she’s landing them this well, this early. Sure enough, the Australian is back on top almost immediately, beating Beaumont’s edge. Such class. 12th over: England 50-1 (Beaumont 9, Taylor 31) McGrath bowling to her field. Taylor gets one past Haynes at cover, who can’t collect cleanly. She’s had a couple of those today. Beaumont’s turn, and she whips hard without making great contact. The single to fine leg brings up England’s 50. The opener only has nine of them, but she’s still there. I’m backing her in. On the TV, in the space of a minute Ian Healy has called both Sarah Harris (Taylor) and Laura (Lauren) Winfield. As a radio caller I feel I’m leading with my chin a bit by bringing this up, but to hell with it. 11th over: England 46-1 (Beaumont 7, Taylor 29) Amanda-Jade Wellington. The most exciting young spinner on the planet. She gets her first crack, from the southern end. Immediately giving it a big old rip with ample air. Like with Warne, it is the control that gets everyone so engaged witih this 20-year-old leggie. Every ball on the money here. Superb start. 10th over: England 45-1 (Beaumont 7, Taylor 28) Yep, Perry is off. Tahlia McGrath takes up the attack from the northern end, the same bowler who replaced the opener when she was forced out of the attack with two waist-high full tosses the other night. She picked up Taylor on that occasion. This time? She’s reverse paddling her off middle stump! High risk, high reward. To the rope for a fifth time. Make that a sixth, next ball clipping thorugh midwicket like Mark Waugh. Oh that’s wonderful. McGrath fights back well to end the set. Nine from it. 9th over: England 36-1 (Beaumont 7, Taylor 19) Healy comes up to Taylor as well. She gets off strike through midwicket again. They do well to keep it to one. Beaumont’s turn, who has been there a long time for not many. Australia sense this, bringing up the field into a tight circle around her to increase the degree of difficulty. But the player of World Cup in this year’s tournament is up to the task, striking a lovely cover drive through the gap and to the rope. That’s better. 8th over: England 30-1 (Beaumont 3, Taylor 18) Perry v Taylor again. Five times in international cricket she’s dismissed the England superstar, including first ball at Canterbury during the 2015 Test. Taylor has room to free the arms early in the over, timing past point for a third boundary. Nice shot. Brings another legside wide next ball - the fourth of the innings. Blowing a bit hot and cold now, Perry. Now a full toss. Deserved to go, but Taylor again fails to beat mid-off on the circle. Nice dive from Wellington saving the runs. Oh, that’s better, a wonderful shoooooot on the up through extra cover. Shot of the morning. Nine from the over, England’s best so far. Perry might have a breather now, I reckon. 7th over: England 21-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 12) Schutt again. Healy comes up to Beaumont, to keep her back. Immediately brings a legside wide, that the ‘keeper misses, so they rotate the strike. This is good colour: Ian Healy doesn’t like what his neice has elected to do by going to the stumps. Say it to her when she’s on mic, Heals. Taylor retains the strike with one to midwicket. 6th over: England 16-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 9) A wide to begin then a legbye, getting Taylor back on strike to Perry. Healy, still on mic, forecasts that it is about now when the former usually chops on. She’s so punchy. Perry gets better as the over matures... and just as I prepare to hit send, she oversteps with her last ball. So, a free hit to end it. Beaumont and Taylor consult. Perry goes the bouncer, Taylor perfectly up to it, putting it away with a classic pull shot through square leg. She’s leg herself down there with the overstep, costing five runs after looking right on top of the England no. 3. 5th over: England 9-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 5) Timing. Taylor drags from well outside the off stump to clip through square leg for four. Mel Jones on the telly says she wasn’t in control. Still, it’s England’s first boundary of the day. “Go Shooter!” roars Healy from behind the stumps. Such a great nickname. She’s going the job early on. Healy is on the TV too on the mic to the commentary. Says she would have been immediately sent home by her coach her she dismissed playing the ramp Sarah Taylor tried on after two balls. I think they called that #Ashes #Banter. 4th over: England 5-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 1) Taylor again, yet to score. Gets a fully from Perry first up and tries to flat-bat it down the ground, unable to beat the field. Missed out there. She’s on the advance to the next ball, and beaten! Taylor all over the shop just at the minute. One of the best players in the world, can she find a bit of composure here? A timely dive from Villani at mid-on again prevents her from getting off the mark. That’s the standard. A bouncer does get her down the other end, happy to hook with control down to long leg and keep the strike. 3rd over: England 4-1 (Beaumont 2, Taylor 0) Beaumont clips her second run, down to fine leg. She was off the mark with a bold quick single in the previous over to put Winfield back on strike, taking on Haynes at short cover. Bold, because Haynes is brillaint in there. Anyway, Taylor’s turn. And she’s beaten first up. Blimey, Sarah Taylor lapping next ball! What doing?! Ramping more than lapping, on reflection. Leg bye signalled. Not far away from being leg before as well. Well, there we have it. Australia have started wonderfully here. It hasn’t taken long, Perry beats Winfield with a yard of pace angling into the right-hander off the seam. She did exactly the same the ball before and it was sliding down the legside, but this was straight enough to win the affirmative decision from the umpire. Australia are away. 2nd over: England 2-1 (Beaumont 1, Taylor 0) 1st over: England 0-0 (Winfield 0, Beaumont 0) Excellent from Schutt, full and straight and tailing into the right handed Winfield from the get-go. She is forced to defend with a staight bat throughout. The players. Are out. On the field! I always imagine myself doing Christopher Walken’s voice swhen aying that. Beaumont and Winfield to open for England, as they have since June 2016. Schutt has the new ball from the southern end. PLAY! A lot of love for Alex Blackwell today. On the occasion of her 250th game for Australia. Really nice presentation on the big screen about her career, that began exactly 14 years and nine months ago. She’s interviewed in the package, talking about her pride as a gay woman athlete wearing the baggy green. Per my preview, it’s quite something that when she began as an international cricketer only one country recognised same-sex marriage (Belgium becoming the second, the day after her debut, as it happens). Now, it is a fortnight from when her own country could be on track to become the 24th, provided the postal plebscite goes as expected. And sure enough, Blackwell has been a persuasive voice in that campaign too. Well played. One update from my preamble. In the last quarter hour it has definitely escalated from warm to hot. Very good toss to win for England. Heather Knight spoke a lot about the importance of her top order going on with it, just as they did in the World Cup. They won’t get a better chance to cash in than this. Perfect conditions to be punishing. And good news on the broadcast front today as well. Channel Nine have moved this game from their secondary channel to the main one. Should have been the case a week ago for the first ODI if you ask me, but better late than never, and to their credit. Also, if you are in the car or having a frolic at the beach or something like that, you can grab the radio call on ABC local radio (i.e. the wireless) as well as the digital app. Same goes in England, the commentary also loud and clear on BBC Test Match Special. Australia (In: Gardner, Out: Beams) Bolton, Healy, Perry, Villani, Haynes, Blackwell, McGrath, Gardner, Wellington, Jonassen, Schutt. England (no change) Beaumont, Winfield, Taylor, Knight, Sciver, Wilson, Brunt, Gunn, Shrubsole, Ecclestone, Hartley. No surprises there. Australian captain Rachael Haynes confirms that Ash Gardner is back into the side, at the expense of unlucky leggie Kristen Beams. No news on the England side yet, but we’ll have the team sheets shortly. Good morning from a warm and glary morning at Coffs Harbour International Stadium. Adam Collins with you for the first innings of this third and final Women’s Ashes ODI. It’s not must-win, but may as well be. That’s the harsh reality staring at England, coming into this without a point to their name. Heather Knight’s side held the World Cup aloft in July, but this may be her biggest test yet since taking over as skipper. To go back over the mathematics, in this multi-format series the three ODIs are worth two points each, the standalone Test four, then three T20s also three. With 16 points available, England need ten of them to regain the trophy that they lost at home in 2015. As a result, Australia know full well that they have a chance to land a near-killer blow in the event of a 50-over clean sweep today. It would mean only a draw in the Test Match next month would be enough to retain the Ashes. They were clinical on Thursday in the second match, also here. After being sent in – a call England management later acknowledged was a poor one when rain didn’t fall forecasts suggested – they racked up 296 and defended it with ease, 75 run victors. There’s some history to draw from if they require further incentive, vice-captain Alex Blackwell today the first Australian woman to reach 250 internationals. I‘ve written about how the game has chanced during her career, that began in January 2003 (!). Australia also has a big inclusion, Ash Gardner set to return after missing on Thursday with a concussion she sustained in the series opener. Gardner hits the ball further than just about anyone in the women’s game, and bowls more than tidy off-spin. For England’s part, they aren’t quite at the point of wholesale changes, giving every indication yesterday of dancing with the ones that brought them on that mighty World Cup run. Sophie Ecclestone is the addition to that XI, the 18-year-old tweaker keeping her spot after an Ashes debut where she looked pretty much right at home. All that leaves me to do is encourage you to drop me a line through the course of the morning. I’m in the usual places, on the email or the tweet. You know you the drill. Stay tuned for the toss, scheduled in about 15 minutes. Whoever wins it will be batting. Adam will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s how the series can be won:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/28/wallabies-v-barbarians-a-league-the-cox-plate-and-more-sportwatch-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T11:27:20Z","webTitle":"Melbourne City beat Adelaide in A-League, Winx wins Cox Plate, Wallabies beat Barbarians and more: sportwatch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/28/wallabies-v-barbarians-a-league-the-cox-plate-and-more-sportwatch-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/28/wallabies-v-barbarians-a-league-the-cox-plate-and-more-sportwatch-live","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne City beat Adelaide in A-League, Winx wins Cox Plate, Wallabies beat Barbarians and more: sportwatch – as it happened","bodyText":"Well that’s me done for the day. I could tell it was going to be an odd one the moment the Barbarians tried to score a try by hiding the ball up a jumper. I’m just surprised they didn’t tie the ref’s shoelaces together or stick a bit of paper saying “I smell” on Michael Cheika’s back. Hats off to Ross McCormack for his brace against Adelaide, and a tip of the hat to Brisbane Roar for their amazing comeback in Wellington. But the day undoubtedly belongs to champion mare Winx and her Cox Plate heroics. Give the old girl a sugar cube from me. Well that’s your lot from yours truly, I’m spent. Thanks for joining me, catch you next time. Netball Well despite the setback earlier when they lost to Jamaica, the Australians bounced back in fine style to beat New Zealand in the final Fast5 game of the day in Melbourne. The final score was a thoroughly convincing 40-30. Excellent stuff. Rugby league - Fiji 52-6 USA I won’t be staying until the end of this one... but let’s face it, it’s already over. Fiji are smashing the Americans and, with 15 minutes still to play, they look well on course to eclipse PNG’s winning margin from earlier today. It’s all over. Yet another ruthlessly efficient win for City built on the back of a solid defensive display - and another clean sheet despite having 10 men. Adelaide piled on the pressure but just couldn’t find a way through. 90+4 mins: A hopeful, twisting shot slices wide from Adlung. That’s what they’ve been reduced to. Some more handbags at the death. One last FK for Adelaide. 90+3 mins: Matmour comes off for Kitto. It all seems a bit academic now. 90+1 mins: O’Doherty fires a volley just wide. Surely that’s about it for the Reds. Can’t see them getting one goal let alone two. 89 mins: It’s shaping up as a remarkable win for City. Ten men and under the cosh for most of the second half, they’ve managed to keep Adelaide at arm’s length. They’ve even had the better chances too. 87 mins: City happy to run the clock down when they’re in possession. My laptop seems to be taking the same cue, it’s taking an age to load up what I type. If it was on the pitch, it would be booked for timewasting. Muscat in the book for a handball. 86 mins: O’Doherty comes on for Konstandopoulos. Last roll of the dice for Adelaide. 84 mins: Garuccio with a free-kick 20 yards out ... but he fails to beat the wall. More frustration for the Reds. 82 mins: Mauk tries to dink it over the keeper after being put clean through ...and it trickles wide! That should have been game over. 80 mins: Adelaide probing away, trying to stretch the City defence, but there are no gaps to exploit. I have to mention Kamua, who has run himself into the ground trying to give the City defence some breathing space. It’s the sort of effort defenders appreciate the most. 77 mins: Time is ticking away for Adelaide. This is ominous stuff from City. The Reds have thrown everything at them, and have an extra man, yet City have defended solidly and kept their cool under pressure. Marrone comes off for Stamatelopoulos. 75 mins: OOOF! La Rocca with a powerful header that smashes against the post. It rebounds to Mauk who fires just wide. City still a threat. 74 mins: There’s no beating Galekovic in the air tonight. He’s held onto everything. A rare City attack leads to a corner. Well played Kamau - more than anything, it’s given his side a breather. 72 mins: On comes Cahill for McCormack. Thought he was dead-set for a hat-trick at one stage but it wasn’t to be. 69 mins: Great tackle from Schenkeveld to block another Adelaide attack. It’s one-way traffic at the minute. How long can City hold out? Galekvoic has been superb at cutting out crosses. He snuffs out two in as many minutes. 66 mins: It’s all Adelaide now. McCormack looking very isolated high up the pitch. Tempers flaring. Blackwood goes down under a challenge from Schenkeveld and there’s a bit of handbags. The crowd are getting vocal. They can sense a goal a brewing. 64 mins: Game on. Mileusnic curls the ball goalward and it flies inches wide. It’s coming, and with an extra man the Reds have every reason to believe they can get something from this. 61 mins: City playing a risky game here, inviting the Reds to do all the running - which they are. And now Malik has gone, sent off - a second booking for a flailing elbow while jumping for a header. Not sure he deserved the first one, but technically he’s right to get this one. Still seems harsh though. 60 mins: This is better from Adelaide. Good crosses coming into the box but they’re yet to make the most of them. City seem to have gone down a gear. 58 mins: Strong keeping from Galekovic to deny a Blackwood challenge in the air. Even when the Reds do get a sight of goal, Galekovic is there to clean up everything. 55 mins: Blackwood with a looping header - although Galekovic was watching it all the way. Encouraging signs for the Reds though. 54 mins: Izzo plucks Fitzgerald’s cross out of the air just as City looked threatening. That’s the risk Adelaide run as they push forward. 50 mins: It’s not bad, but the ball falls to the outside of the box and the shot skims the outside of the post. Pressure from Adelaide but nothing really to trouble Galekovic so far. 49 mins: City are giving Adelaide no space to move at all. Every time there’s a pass to a red shirt, there’s a sky blue one within a couple of yards. The Reds have got a free-kick in a good position now though. They need to use it. 47 mins: Booking for Garrucio. Dangerous sliding tackle into the back of Kamau. 46 mins: Peeeeep! Here we go. How do you dismantle a brick wall? That was the question Marco Kurz had 15 minutes to answer during the break. The City defence looks rock solid. New Zealand 38-8 Samoa - AAP report New Zealand kicked off their Rugby League World Cup campaign with a bang, blitzing Samoa in the second half of their Rugby League World Cup clash to win 38-8 in Auckland. Despite an ill-disciplined performance in which they made 17 errors and completed barely 60 per cent of their sets, the Kiwis were too good on Saturday for their Polynesian rivals. Riding out Toa Samoa’s early crash-and-bash style and heading into halftime with a 10-4 advantage, the Kiwis piled on five tries to one in the second half. Shaun Johnson, capitalising on strong pack performances from Marty Taupau and Russell Packer, controlled play at halfback with aplomb. He scored a try and laid on two assists as his side made an early play for top spot in Pool B, with Scotland and a much-vaunted Tonga to play on Sunday. Wellington Phoenix 3-3 Brisbane Roar - AAP report Brisbane battled back from a three-goal deficit to claim a 3-3 A-League draw with Wellington. Three goals inside the opening 20 minutes, including a brace to Serbian striker Andrija Kaludjerovic, looked to have wrapped up an early win for the Phoenix on Saturday at Westpac Stadium. But the Roar, winless from the opening three rounds, stormed back in the second half to secure their first points of the season. Italian striker Massimo Maccarone added a late penalty to his 45th-minute strike as the Roar fought their way back from a 3-1 halftime deficit. Both teams pushed forward in the closing minutes amid often fiery exchanges, but neither could provide the crucial finish to steal the win. Warland with a great header but it trickles inches wide. And that’s it for the half. It’s all going according to plan for City and barring a huge momentum change at half-time they’re on course for a fourth straight win. Big team talk needed for Adelaide. 45 mins: Not long to the break and Adelaide need to regroup. Apart from that excellent save from Galekovic, City look completely untroubled. A plan B is the order of the day. And it had better be a very good plan B. 43 mins: Looks like Jamieson’s game is over. Whatever’s up with his leg has proven too much. Off he comes, replaced by Brattan in midfield. Jakobsen to left back. 42 mins: Fitzgerald bursts into the box but fires his shot straight at Izzo. Poor effort. 40 mins: Have City actually been behind at any stage this season? Not sure they have. Jamieson is down at the minute, not sure what happened but he looks a little concerned with his leg. He hops off to the sideline. The game carries on and he’s still hobbling about. 37 mins: Well we’ve already seen Brisbane Roar make an amazing comeback tonight, what’s to say Adelaide won’t do the same thing? There’s just one problem - Melbourne City are no Wellington Phoenix. This piece of insightful information was brought to you by Richard ‘Sherlock’ Gadsby. 34 mins: Booking for Malik, despite his protests. Bit too forceful with a sliding tackle - not sure it warranted a booking as he won the ball. In fact if I’d done that tackle I would’ve been thrilled. Here’s that McCormack goal for your viewing pleasure. 30 mins: Adelaide have had more than enough possession yet somehow it’s City who are dominating. Not sure how that works. Every time City get close to the Reds penalty area, they look like they’re going to score. At the other end, there’s always someone in the City defence to make a crucial stop or save. 27 mins: Good work from Kamau... in defence as well. Tracking back to win the ball on the right and smother the danger. 24 mins: Corking save from Galekovic. Warland with a cracking shot that’s bound for the top corner... until Galekovic flies through the air to tip it to safety. Excellent football all round. 23 mins: Adelaide look a little shellshocked. What have they done wrong? Not much at all ... apart from punching Mauk in the back of the head of course. Bit over the top but he’s not bad I suppose... 19 mins: This is ruthless stuff from City. Adelaide haven’t started that badly but City have been clinical with the chances they’ve had. Considering City have conceded just one goal this season, it’s going to be a long slog to get back into this game for Adelaide. 17 mins: What a strike from McCormack! Shades of his previous goal from a free-kick - but arguably better. There was no stopping that, curling with power over the wall. 14 mins: Isaias hits a curling FK way too high. Galekovic barely moved. Adelaide have responded well though, passing and probing away. When City get their noses in front though, it’s hard to catch them up. They’re the Winx of the A-League. 12 mins: McCormack smashes the penalty low into the corner, sending Izzo the wrong way in the process. 10 mins: Mauk with a flicked header and Izzo flies into the back of his head with his fists. Pretty clear cut. Booking for Izzo and he should count himself lucky. Instead he’s arguing. 7 mins: Good start from Adelaide but City look unfazed. Three straight wins will do that. The visitors are knocking it around well enough but they haven’t shown much in the way of penetration so far. Not that that’s bothered them much season. With a defence as solid as theirs, they only need one clear chance. 5 mins: Garuccio gets a clean header on it but the direction is lacking. No troubles for Galekovic. 4 mins: Adelaide with the first meaningful attack. The Hindmarsh crowd are in the mood tonight. They get a FK in a dangerous position. 1 min: Aaaaand we’re off. I’m genuinely not sure which way this one will go. If they didn’t have a few key men out to injury I would have backed Adelaide - as it is, I think City might just nick it. They’ve got that knack at the minute, an ability to play just good enough to get the win. A cagey start from both sides, happy to keep possession. A-League Tonight’s main A-League game is almost upon us - Adelaide versus Melbourne City. Here are a few match stats to get you in the mood. Each of the last four games between Adelaide and Melbourne City has been won by the home team on the day, with City picking up two wins in 2016/17. Melbourne City have won two of their last four games in Adelaide and have scored at least one goal in each of their last seven visits to the South Australian capital. Adelaide United are undefeated in their last five games on home turf (W2, D3), their best stretch since they went eight games without loss in 2015/16 (W6, D2). Wayne Joyce will be looking to become the first manager in A-League history to win his first four games as a manager in the competition. Only the Jets (213) have made more passes into the final third than Adelaide United (198) after three rounds this season.o Vince Lia comes into this fixture having recorded his first ever brace in the A-League. Johan Absalonsen is the only player so far this season to have both scored (2) and assisted (2) multiple goals. Eugene Galekovic, who picked up his 100th win last weekend, boasts the best save percentage (80%) of any keeper thus far in A-League 2017/18. Rugby league - Samoa 4-26 New Zealand Breathing space for the Kiwis, they’ve been much the better side since the break despite all of Samoa’s huff and puff. They’ve matched the visitors for energy and used their extra experience and class when it counts. A-League Khalfallah comes so, so close to winning it in injury time for the Roar - but the ball gets stuck under his feet and he can’t get a clean strike on the rebound from a counter attack. It’s all over now anyway. Bizarre but entertaining stuff from two of the league’s struggling teams. Roar will be the far, far happier side - Phoenix will be left scratching their collective heads at how they blew a three-goal lead against a side rock bottom of the ladder. Boos all round from the home crowd. Rugby league - Samoa 4-14 New Zealand More video referee action over in Auckland, this time for a spill under pressure from Samoa that leads to a ‘try’ for the Kiwis. It takes a while... but it’s finally given. The Kiwis in the driving seat. A-League - Phoenix 3-3 Brisbane It’s all square - Maccarone buries the spot kick with a fierce strike. What a comeback from Brisbane. They look like they think they can win it. Seven minutes to go. A-League - Penalty to Brisbane Excitement she wrote in Wellington. Could this be a superb comeback from the Roar? A fairly clear foul in the box. Not sure why VAR was needed. A-League - Phoenix 3-2 Brisbane It’s all Brisbane as we approach the final quarter of an hour. Papadopoulos has got them to within one goal of earning what would be a vital point - more in terms of confidence than league position. Tip of the hat to them, my money was on Roar caving after that initial blitz from Phoenix but they’re on the verge of a superb comeback. It’ll all be for naught if they don’t turn their possession into one more goal though. Rugby league - Samoa 4-10 New Zealand Samoa claw themselves to within six points with a try just three minutes before the half-time break. A nasty head clash follows. It’s been that kind of game. Brutal but not dirty. They go on the attack in search of another but the siren beats them just as they’re building pressure. A-League - Phoenix 3-1 Brisbane It’s all about New Zealand at the minute. Over in Wellington, we’re closing in on the hour mark and there have been no further goals this half. Phoenix have been decidedly more defensive since the break - not that you can blame them. They’re hoping Roar will throw too many men forward in search of a goal. Neither side really finding much of a rhythm though. Krishna goes down right on the edge of the box - but the ref isn’t convinced. Rugby league - Samoa 0-10 New Zealand This is brutally enthralling stuff in Auckland. My ribs are hurting just looking at it. The Kiwis just have that touch of extra class when it matters most - although there’s nothing much in it at all and Samoa are asking all kinds of questions as we close in on the 30-minute mark. It’s been an excellent start to the World Cup so far... although the Welsh might disagree. Rugby league - Samoa 0-4 New Zealand We’re off and running in Auckland. The Kiwis have the lead but Samoa are smashing into the line close to the NZ try line. Grim defence from the Kiwis. They manage to hold one up. No mean feat considering the power of the attacks they’re facing. Rather them than me. Impressive stuff. An excellent start to the campaign for Victory, and hopefully a sign of better things to come after a poor season last time. Three points in the bag. A-League - Phoenix 3-1 Brisbane Maccarone throws Roar a lifeline, pouncing on a rebound to bang home from close range just before half-time. A-League - Phoenix 3-0 Brisbane It’s shaping up to be a long, long flight home for Roar in their game in Wellington. Just 26 minutes gone and they’re already staring down the barrel of a fourth straight defeat. On the flip side, suggestions that Phoenix have been playing much better than their one point suggests seem well founded. Krishna and Kaluderovic (adding to his earlier effort) are the latest goal scorers. Fast5 Netball - AAP report Australia suffered their first loss of the 2017 Fast5 netball world series with Jamaica claiming a dramatic 26-23 win in Melbourne on Saturday. The upsets didn’t end there. The six-time winners of the Fast5 series, New Zealand, were beaten 37-30 by England. The Australian game was in the balance until the final second with Tegan Philip’s game-tying super shot missing the mark to the delight of the Jamaican fans at Hisense Arena.Looking to build on their victory over Malawi in the opening match of the tournament, the Aussies could not find their shooting touch and committed 15 turnovers with Jamaica recording seven intercepts to Australia’s nil. “Jamaica came out really hard and put out a good performance,” Australian captain Kate Moloney said after the loss. “We didn’t probably perform well enough in our power play quarter and that really hurt us.” Neither side took full advantage of their power play quarters with Australia finishing with six points in the second quarter but then matching Jamaica’s eight points in the third to leave scores tied heading into the fourth period. But it was Jamaica who made the decisive break as Shanice Beckford landed a three-point super shot midway through the term and Jhaniele Fowler-Reid (16 for 17 from the inner circle) scoring the last three points to close out the match. Jamaica produced a fourth quarter power play comeback to beat South Africa 37-29 in their opening match of the tournament and will face Malawi in their final match of day one. Australia now face a crucial clash with New Zealand to close out day one of competition with the loser facing an uphill battle to reach Sunday’s gold medal match. Rugby League World Cup Well they got on the scoresheet in the end but I’m not sure it’s exactly a moment of celebration for Wales who have been comprehensively walloped by the Kumuls. Double figures on the try count for PNG. W-League - Melbourne Victory 2-1 Canberra United Dowie has fired Victory back in front against United. After a miserable season last time out, is this the start of a turnaround? Still another 25 minutes to go though. Rugby league - PNG 50-0 Wales The massacre of Port Moresby continues. Poor old Wales... and there’s still another five minutes to go. Can they get on the scoreboard? Surely that would feel like kind of a win at this stage. Then again, maybe not. A-League - Phoenix 1-0 Roar Well we’re off and running in Wellington - and then some. The Phoenix have scored against Roar with less than two minutes on the clock, a looping header from Kaludjerovic over the keeper. Wallabies 31-28 Barbarians - AAP report The Wallabies came from behind to record an unconvincing 31-28 win against the Barbarians in a scrappy exhibition match at Allianz Stadium in Sydney. Saturday’s five-tries-to-four win might have come at a high cost with forwards Lukhan Tui (hamstring) and Jack Dempsey (knee) leaving the field with injuries, putting them in some doubt for the tour of Japan and Europe. The Barbarians led 21-12 at halftime after out-scoring the Wallabies three tries to two in the first 40 minutes, with the second-string Australian side struggling with their unstructured play. Wallabies five-eighth Duncan Paia’aua opened the scoring with a try in the eighth minute after attacking from a five-metre scrum. Barbarians tight-head prop Taniela Tupou was denied a try in the 21st minute after they had employed the famous “up the jumper” ruse, which was banned by World Rugby after NSW Country used it in 1975 against Sydney. The Barbarians broke away from the Wallabies after scoring three tries in five minutes to hooker Andrew Ready (24th minute), winger Taqele Naiyarovoro (27th) and winger Tom Banks (29th). Winger Henry Speight pulled the Wallabies back into the game with a try on halftime, beating two defenders in a strong run out wide. The Wallabies narrowed the gap to 21-17 with a try to Dempsey in the 53rd minute. They regained the lead 24-21 with a second try to Paia’aua in the 61st minute after a big break by replacement centre Curtis Rona from a lineout. The Barbarians snuck back in front 28-26 in the 66th minute with a second try to Naiyarovoro after five-eighth Quade Cooper cross-kicked for Banks, who put the big winger away. The visitors’ chances of holding on lessened when Naiyarovoro was given a yellow card in the 70th minute for a deliberate knock down, while Cooper was sin-binned a minute later for a high tackle on winger Israel Folau. Veteran hooker Stephen Moore put the Wallabies back in front straight away, 31-28, after scoring from a rolling maul off a lineout. Rugby union Barbarians coach Alan Jones had some opinions after the Wallabies game. Asked what the he thought of the match, the usually timid and reserved* radio host replied: “Woeful, appalling I mean is this what rugby is about? The bloke (referee) was out of his depth ... Thank god I’m not involved in this game anymore.” And would he consider taking on another coaching role? “Never ever again. Why bother? I was really pleased with the way we played ... in terms of what we were allowed to do, I was very pleased with it.” *sarcasm alert Cox Plate - AAP report Winx has cemented her place as one of the all-time greats of Australian racing, winning the $3 million WS Cox Plate for the third year in a row. In joining Kingston Town as a three-time winner of Australia’s most prestigious weight-for-age race, Winx also took her sequence to 22 consecutive victories. Winx also overtook Makybe Diva as Australia’s highest stakes earner when she held off Humidor in a closer-than-expected finish. Jockey Hugh Bowman was caught wide in the early stages before easing Winx to settle fifth in the running line. Winx began to improve her position from the 900m mark and had the lead on the turn with Humidor the only horse giving chase. “She has gone down, she will go down as one of the greatest to grace the Australian turf,” Bowman said. “She would have before today but it has so much meaning to everyone in our industry.” Starting a prohibitive favourite at $1.17, Winx held off Humidor ($31) to win by a long neck with Godolphin’s English-trained Folkswood ($26) finishing 4-1/4 lengths away third. Bowman said trainer Chris Waller deserved all the credit for guiding Winx on career that has netted an Australian record 15 Group One wins. W-League It’s all square at half-time in the clash between Melbourne Victory and Canberra United. McNabb headed Victory in front early on but Heyman restored parity after 25 minutes. Cox Plate Well that was heart-in-mouth time. For a second there I honestly thought Winx was going to be pipped - but that’s why she’s a champion who will go down in history. Even my laptop seems to be struggling after that one - might be time to put it out to stud. Trainer Chris Waller: “It was close as you’d expect in a Cox Plate, you never know what’s going to happen on a race track... but gee Humidor gave us a hell a of a fight ... I’m pleased she’s done it for the crowd and most importantly for the horse.” Champion jockey Hugh Bowman on racing Winx to victory. “It’s been such a build-up. I’m lost for words. She’s made history. I was born the year Kingston Town won his first Cox Plate. To think she’s emulated the great (Kingston Town) ... but we are in the presence of greatness. She will be recognised as one of the greatest horses to grace the Australian turf.” Winx has done it! But it was a lot nervier than everyone thought it would be. A late challenge from Humidor but the champion held on. Just. Horse racing Here we go. The horses are close to the barriers. Less than a minute to go before this year’s Cox Plate kicks off. History awaits for Winx. Rugby league Just enough time before we head to the Cox Plate for an update on the Wales v PNG game. It’s all going according to plan for the Kumuls - they’re 26-0 ahead at Port Moresby. Well it’s a bit of a damp ending to what was shaping up to be an entertaining finish until those sin-bins. There’s still time for a scrum after the siren, but the Wallabies win a penalty and that’s all she wrote. 79 mins: Time ticking down... and Dempsey’s injury means there’s only a one-man advantage for the Wallabies. A chink of light for the BaaBaas. 77 mins: Bit of a break in play as Dempsey goes down with a leg injury. That doesn’t look good. Off he hobbles. In fact he’s not even hobbling, one leg is being dragged along the pitch. Eesh. 77 mins: Can the BaaBaas come back from this? In a word - no. They’re battling though, fair play. They probably feel a bit hard done by, and rightly so, but they’re just too short on numbers to get something. 75 mins: And the Wallabies make good on the conversion. Alan Jones is down by Cooper having a few words - something he’s never short of. 74 mins: A rolling maul and Moore barges over the line. It’s a shame the match is ending this way, it could have been genuinely exciting - instead we’re just waiting for the inevitable now. 73 mins: Well it’s hardly the same level of intensity as last week’s All Blacks clash, but it looks like we’re in for a nail-biting final few minutes here. Folau goes down under a high tackle from Cooper. Bit of a stoppage but no damage done - but the referee sees it otherwise and Cooper is off. The BaaBaas really up against it now. 70 mins: In the bin for try hero Naiyaravoro - perfect chance for the Wallabies to take advantage near the try line. 69 mins: Cooper adds the extras. Game on. 68 mins: Brilliant kick from Cooper to find Banks on the opposite wing. He draws his man into the tackle and hands it over to Naiyaravoro, who’s left with a simple try. 66 mins: The Wallabies just starting to up the pressure. Moore has made a difference since he came on - there’s just been a bit of extra grunt to those tackles in the middle of the park. The BaaBaas are still battling though. 65 mins: Jones making some changes. Rangi on for Ready. They were just starting to look a little tired. A scrum for the Wallabies now, who will be looking to keep up the pressure. 63 mins: The kick is good and the Wallabies have a bit of breathing space for the first time since the very start of the match. 61 mins: Rona with a great run, brought down near the line and Paia’aua is on hand to grab the pop up and cross the line. The Wallabies are ahead. 59 mins: If the first half was a pendulum this half is a stalemate, both sides struggling to create any sort of momentum. Just when it looked like the Wallabies were starting to turn the screw the BaaBaas charge up the field to turn the tables. Very little in it. 54 mins: Good, strong work from the Wallabies - nothing fancy, and Dempsey is the man who barges his way over the line. The conversion is missed though. 52 mins: It’s still a tussle in the middle, but there seems to be more intensity to it. McCalman shows his strength to aaaallmost burst through the line before being dragged down. Better from the Wallabies. 50 mins: Hunt has done OK at fullback, nothing outstanding, but then no one on the Wallabies team has really distinguished themselves. Still time though. The Wallabies just starting to edge closer to the try line. They have a scrum in a good position now. 49 mins: Moore on for the Wallabies. Replaces Uelese. Big cheer from the crowd - as well they should. 46 mins: It’s turned into a bit of a tussle in the middle of the park. Neither side taking the game by the scruff of the neck. The BaaBaas will be the happier with that situation. 43 mins: The commentators have a bit of a chat with Cheika. “Here’a a match where there’s an opportunity and I think their (Wallabies) mindset is a little bit soft... there are some little things we need to fix technically but I think more than anything it’s about mindset,” says the coach. It’s fair to say it’s not the worst thing in the world if some of the Aussies in the BaaBaas side outplay the Wallabies today. In fact it’s arguably win-win for Cheika - with the obvious drawback of having Alan Jones lording it over him if the Barnabybarians win. 41 mins: Peeeep! And away we go again. Hunt with the high kick and the Barbarians charge forward well... but then give away a penalty. Poor discipline has cost them today - although obviously not that much as they’re still nine points clear. So the Wallabies bring it back to nine points right at the death. Much needed it has to be said. 40 mins: Over it goes and that will give the Wallabies a huge boost heading into the break. 40 mins: They’re in! Right on the siren. Great footwork and strength from Speight to lose his men on the wing. They needed that. 39 mins: Bit of a stop-start finish to the half. One last chance for the Wallabies from a scrum. It’s on the halfway mark but they’re still going. 37 mins: A few wayward passes, some poor combinations... it’s all adding up to frustration for the Wallabies. The Barbarians will be thrilled if they go into the sheds with this scoreline. Hunt with an excellent tackle to cut short a BaaBaas attack. 35 mins: Can the Wallabies nick something back before half-time? They’ve spent the last five minutes in the BaaBaas half but need to get over the line. Cooper kicks it away to buy the Barbarians some time. The Wallabies look frustrated. 33 mins: Time for the Wallabies to take a breath methinks. The BaaBaas don’t even look like they’re trying very hard - just enjoying the moment. The Wallabies are the side who look like they’ve just been cobbled together. 32mins: Unerring accuracy from Cooper again. How fast things can change. 30 mins: Talk about everything clicking together. After looking disjointed in the opening 10 minutes, the Barbarians are now putting on a show. Banks this time, using his pace to sprint clear after a break from the BaaBaas from their own half. 29 mins: Cooper makes no mistake again. This game has completely swung one way to the other. 28 mins: Lovely stuff from the BaaBaas, Nanai-Williams with a great ball inside to send Naiyaravoro over the line. Good build-up work. 26 mins: Cooper slots it home and the BaaBaas are ahead. 25 mins: There it is. Ready uses his strength to bundle himself over under pressure from two Wallabies players. Good work from the BaaBaas - and they’re deservedly level. 24 mins: Well that moment of levity seems to have lifted the BaaBaas who are still battering away at the Wallabies line. Still no signs of a gap yet. Maybe they should try shoving the ball down their shorts next time. 22 mins: The momentum has swung the other way completely, the BaaBaas calling the shots. Ha! The old ball up the jumper trick from Tupou - who gets over the line but it’s all for naught as the referee explains the rules of the game. Unsportsmanlike. Funny though. 19 mins: That said it’s hardly a familiar Wallabies side either. The Barnabybarians getting a lot more of the ball now, and importantly it’s in the Wallabies half too. They’ve not really had a sniff of the line yet. It’s coming though. 17 mins: The BaaBaas look as you’d expect for a side who haven’t played together much - talented in fits and starts but struggling for a bit of consistent play. The last few minutes have been a bit more promising though, it’s possible they’ll sync up more as the game goes on. They’ve got a scrum deep in Wallabies territory. 14 mins: It’s been all Wallabies so far - although a tip of the hat to Palu for that boom of a tackle. A good charge up the right flank releases some of the pressure but an intercept from Speight stops the attack from turning into something more dangerous. 13 mins: Monster hit from Palu on Uelese. Groans all around the stadium. You love it really. 10 mins: Over they go. That has been coming. A scrum between the posts and the Wallabies are over courtesy of Paia’aua. He misses the conversion though. 9 mins: Ill-discipline is costing the Barnabybarians... although not on the scoreboard so far. The Wallabies have so far eschewed the chance to kick for goal, as you’d expect, but the pressure will surely tell soon enough anyway. 7 mins: The Wallabies with their first meaningful charge towards the try line. They test the BaaBaas line but they manage to hold them at bay. It all came from another penalty for the Wallabies. It’ll be a long day for the BaaBaas if they keep giving them away. 5 mins: Blood on the shirts already. Both sides mean business, shame it’s a small crowd although not entirely unexpected considering the ARU’s Rugby Australia’s approach to the game. 3 min: Solid hands from Folau under the high ball. He will be missed during his break. Couple of early pens to the Wallabies puts pressure on the Baabaas. Can the hosts make it count? 1 min: Peeeeeep! And we’re off. Cooper gets us under way. He’ll be out to prove a point today. He’s got that face on him. Rugby This Barbarians team has plenty of Aussies with a smattering of other nationalities thrown in ... so a bit like the Australian parliament then. The Barnabybarians would probably be a better name. Rugby Out come the sides. Anthem time. Should be interesting considering the number of Aussies in the BaaBaas side. Rugby Here are the line-ups for the Wallabies v Baabaas. All eyes on Karmichael Hunt as he auditions for the fullback spot. There are a few other players who will be hoping to put their hands up too. Wallabies: 1 Tom Robertson; 2 Jordan Uelese; 3 Allan Alaalatoa; 4 Kane Douglas; 5 Lukhan Tui; 6 Ned Hanigan; 7 Jack Dempsey; 8 Lopeti Timani; 9 Nick Phipps; 10 Duncan Paia’aua; 11 Israel Folau; 12 Billy Meakes; 13 Samu Kerevi; 14 Henry Speight; 15 Karmichael Hunt. Reserves: 16 Stephen Moore; 17 Tetera Faulkner; 18 Jermaine Ainsley; 19 Liam Wright; 20 Ben McCalman; 21 Joe Powell; 22 Curtis Rona; 23 Izaia Perese Barbarians: 1 Pekahou Cowan; 2 Andrew Ready; 3 Taniela Tupou; 4 Luke Jones; 5 Sam Carter; 6 Isi Naisarani; 7 Matt Hodgson; 8 Wycliff Palu; 9 Augustine Pulu; 10 Quade Cooper; 11 Eto Nabuli; 12 George Moala; 13 Tom Banks;14 Taqele Naiyaravoro; 15. Nanai-Williams. Reserves: 16 Anaru Rangi; 17 Ben Alexander; 18 Salesi Manu; 19 Matt Philip; 20 Kane Koteka; 21 Strang; 22 Greene; 23 Kellaway Afternoon everyone and welcome to today’s sportwatch. Grab yourself a napkin and a paper plate because there’s a veritable* smorgasbord of sport awaiting your consumption today, and yours truly will be dishing out the delicacies one morsel at a time for the next eight hours - which is only slightly longer than it took to use VAR technology in last night’s A-League game. Netball First on the menu today we have the annual thrill-fest that is Fast5 Netball. There are nine games in all in Melbourne with Australia featuring in three – in fact they’ve already trounced Malawi 34-21 in the opener. They’re back in action against Jamaica at 4pm but I might dip in and out of the other games if/when time allows. South Africa are currently 14-13 ahead against Jamaica. Rugby Today’s first big clash is the Wallabies against the Barbarians – although it’s more Wallabies-lite than the All Blacks-conquering kings of last week. Despite that, it’s still an important run out for Michael Chieka’s team as he looks towards next month’s tour, specifically with the opening game against Japan in mind. It’s also a chance to farewell Folau before his big break from the game. He’s on the wing so fingers crossed for some fireworks. Rugby league After last night’s impressive opener between the Kangaroos and England, the World Cup gets into full swing today, hopping across three countries with a trio of intriguing games. It’s the PNG Kumuls v Wales up first, then the Kiwis take on Samoa followed by the US versus Fiji in Townsville. No prizes for picking out the favourites in those three clashes. Horse racing It’s Winx. It’s the Cox Plate. I shouldn’t really have to say anything else. However I will put up this classic song by Brummie reggae popsters UB40. Godspeed Hugh Bowman. History beckons. W-League It’s back! Riding on the back of the Matildas’ many successes in recent months, the W-League returns with high expectations. Will it deliver? Well last night’s opening two games provided nine goals between them, so let’s hope for more of the same today when last season’s premiers Canberra take on wooden-spooners Melbourne Victory. A-League The Phoenix kick off today’s A-League action against Brisbane with both sides still chasing their first win of the season. They may have only one point to show for it, but the Phoenix have been impressive in their three games so far and there’s an unusual whiff of optimism in the air around Wellington. In contrast, it’s not so much a whiff as a stink around Brisbane after three straight defeats. A sniff of victory today would ease the pressure on John Aloisi. In the evening kick-off, Adelaide take on early pace-setters Melbourne City, who have been solid rather than spectacular in their three victories so far. Adelaide should provide one of their sternest tests so far, although the Reds’ cause has been hampered by a midweek game and a few knocks to key players. *Anyone who can remind me who said “why do all smorgasbords have to be veritable?” wins a free tour of Guardian Towers. Richard will be here shortly.

That they were still in with a shout of winning it themselves with six minutes remaining speaks volumes for their efforts. It might not have been pretty, but they rattled the reigning world champions with a gutsy display based on some hard-nosed defence, and for that they should be given credit. They should also be able to take inspiration from that performance into their next game, although the injury to Sam Burgess will, of course, be of major concern to Wayne Bennett. The latest is that he’ll be out for three to four weeks with a medial ligament injury. Australia, though, were just too good in the end as they ensured the defence of their crown began in winning style. As Slater alluded to, there are improvements to be made, and that will only be of concern to their rivals, but on the night, they did enough to see off England. Mal Meninga should be pleased. Right, that’s about it from me. Thanks for joining us, and see you next time. Here’s John Davidson’s match report from AAMI Park: “All in all a tough effort and a good start to our preparations,” says Billy Slater, while England skipper Sean O’Loughlin says, “We’re disappointed but there’s a lot more in us. But it’s not a bad place to stat. We’re not pleased with a loss but we can take something out of it.” 80 mins: And there goes the siren. Australia win by 14 points, probably deservedly, but credit to England who ran them close enough. A few more thoughts to follow. 79 mins: That’s it! All over now at AAMI Park as Josh Dugan picks up a cross-field kick that no one else wanted to touch and runs pretty much the entire length of the field to score and secure victory for Australia! Incredible work from James Graham though, who tries to catch him and doesn’t give up until the whistle sounds. Smith with the extras. 77 mins: That kick has taken the wind out of England’s sails. 75 mins: Well, this could, and should, be the game now! The Kangaroos get a penalty within range and Smith will go for goal. His sweet left foot doesn’t fail him and with eight points the difference now, it looks like England’s hopes are over. 73 mins: Ooh! Big defence from Australia this time! England threaten and as Hall gets the ball and looks to power into the corner, along come Gagai and Slater to barge him out of play! What a huge play what might prove to be. 72 mins: Anyway, after that break in play – likely needed by both sets of players – we back underway, with England again on the front foot. Gale ends up grubbering through and Slater can’t get out of his own in-goal! Another chance for England now. 71 mins: The play goes to the video referee, who’s interested in what happens after Morgan and Lomax both dived for the ball. The decision is that Morgan knocked the ball out of Lomax’s hands, and forward, so England start again on their 20m line. 70 mins: Gagai, under a high kick, keeps his cool and takes the ball cleanly. Australia needed that. And the hosts build on that, a move forward culminating in Morgan’s grubber ricocheting off an English leg before he attempts to dive on it in the in-goal! 69 mins: This is a tremendous encounter. Both sets of players are sucking down air, they look knackered, but there’s still another 10 minutes left. 67 mins: Drama! England are heaping the pressure on the Kangaroos! Lomax attempts a kick through that he chases himself but Australia come up with it! And with that, the hosts can take a bit of a breather. 66 mins: Slater fumbles a high ball yards from his goal line and England have a great chance to hit back! Roby gets the ball, sees a gap and barges over! He’s definitely over, but he can’t ground the ball, with Slater holding him up! 65 mins: Widdop is lucky here, as he loses the ball before he grans it back acrobatically and rather fortuitously. 63 mins: McGillvary is called up for a penalty and it gives Australia an opportunity to attack. Klemmer, with that distinctive, powerful high-stepping manner he has, pumps off towards the English goal line. The pressure increases but England’s defence, as it did for the majority of the first half, holds firm! 61 mins: Ryan Hall, who’s been immense for England, heads off on another muscular run before being brought down by Gagai. The Australians eventually gain possession deep in their own half. 60 mins: We reach the hour mark in Melbourne and the imposing figure of Josh Dugan reemerges from the sheds. Looks like he’s fine to come back into the fray. 58 mins: I’m not sure what Wayne Bennett said at half-time, but whatever it was, it’s worked. His team are a try and a kick away from levelling this up and the way they’re playing at the moment, you wouldn’t bet against it, if betting is your thing. 56 mins: England are “bossing” possession so far this half – well, the graphic on the telly tells us they have enjoyed 52% thus far. It might not be dominant, but what a turnaround from the opening period. 55 mins: Lomax nearly gets through the Kangaroos’ defence, and only an ankle tap from Holmes arrests his progress! There’s plenty of life left in the English and it’s Australia’s turn to try to get out of their own half now. 53 mins: Hill now takes a hit-up as England creep forwards, past halfway. Again it goes to McGillvary on the wing, and he again opts to kick. Nothing comes of his invention this time, and Australia can build again. 52 mins: This is much better from England. Much better indeed. They seem to have found some kind of second wind since they settled after half-time. There’s a lot more energy to their play and they’re creating scoring chances. 50 mins: Burgess update: he won’t return tonight, and will be diagnosed fully after the match. 48 mins: McGillvary, with the ball in his hands and the wind in his hair, chooses to attempt a kick through – it hits a Kangaroo player though and the move forward breaks down. That was a chance for a re-invigorated England. 47 mins: Josh Dugan’s gone the same way as Sam Burgess at the end of the first half – up the tunnel. The Kangaroo will be checked out after that earlier head knock. 46 mins: Dugan and McGillvary have a very slight tete-a-tete – and I mean slight, it’s barely anything – but it brings to mind how little aggro there has been tonight. Especially since there was pre-match mutterings that there could be some biffo, due to the relaxed punching rules at this World Cup. 44 mins: Excitement at AAMI Park! Dugan and Holmes both go down within a second of each other with head knocks and Lomax takes advantage by feeding the marauding McGillvary. He dances through the Kangaroos defence but is stopped short of the try line. 43 mins: Word is that the England staff are still assessing Sam Burgess. Which means that he’s not out of the game just yet. Don’t forget, this is a man who played pretty much an entire NRL grand final with a broken cheek bone. 42 mins: Chance for Australia! Morgan boots a high ball into the night sky and Roby can’t hang onto his catch, even without any pressure on him. He spills it and Australia will have a scrum. They nearly mess it up, but then Slater does, dropping a simple pass. Looks like both sides need a little more time to warm back up again. 41 mins: OK, here we go again. Let’s not forget it’s still a tight game – just six points in it. But of course, who scores the next try will be crucial to the outcome. England are back out first, without Sam Burgess. Time for a quick cuppa and I’ll be back for the second half in a couple of minutes. And breathe. A hectic half of rugby league, that one. The blow of losing Burgess could prove costly for England, not just tonight, but for the remainder of the tournament, if it’s as bad as feared. England’s next game is next Saturday, 4 November, against Lebanon in Sydney, FYI. 40 mins: Indeed it is. The siren goes and the first half is brought to a close. It’s been one that Australia have dominated, despite having gone down an early try, and perhaps should have ended with a greater lead than the six-point one they hold. 39 mins: Slater nearly opens up the English defence at one end, but McGillvary intercepts a pass out wide, crucially so, before stretching his long legs to take the ball up the other! He’s eventually stopped in his tracks, though, and that should be that for the half. 38 mins: Ooh! Gagai nearly gets on the end of a cross-field kick in trademark style, but a tremendous leap from Ryan Hall, who grabs the ball out of midair before Gagai can get it, puts paid to any hopes the debutant had of scoring in this first appearance in a Kangaroos jersey. 37 mins: Widdop’s pass to Lomax now is poor, and you wonder if there’s any way back for England in this one. Especially with Australia attacking once more as the first half winds down. 36 mins: Nope, Sam Burgess is done. He limps off the pitch and straight up the tunnel. There couldn’t be any worse news for England, really. 35 mins: Despite that, Burgess is back up and running. He looked cooked moments ago, but it seems like he’ll try to run it off and play out the half. 33 mins: Burgess (Sam) steps inside and goes down under a Dugan tackle. This doesn’t look good at all. There’s a problem with his knee and it looks like he won’t be able to continue. Disaster for England! 31 mins: There’s a danger now that this one is going to run away from England now. Another Australian try before half-time could well prove fatal to their (English) chances. 29 mins: Penalty to Australia, but they take the tap rather than kicking for goal. That decision is justified soon after as Slater looks towards the sideline before getting his head down and charging for the line himself. He makes it and that’s a great time to score – and a bad time for England to concede. Skipper Smith drags his kick wide of the mark and it’s a six-point game. 27 mins: Billy Slater now, full of energy, darts forward after escaping a Tom Burgess tackle. Australia look dangerous when Slater is in that kind of mood. 25 mins: Smith gets a kick away and he’s poleaxed after the event. No complaints from the veteran, mind. 24 mins: Finally the English defence is broken down. It took more than a quarter of the game, but the worry for the visitors now is that they’ve created precious little going forward. That will have to change if they are to get something out of this game. 23 mins: Australia hit back! And it’s Gillett who receives the ball from Smith before jinking this way and that before muscling his way over the line. Smith lines up the ensuing kick and lands it! Australia lead for the first time tonight! 20 mins: The longer the Australians fail to find a finishing touch, and the longer the English defence remains strong, home frustrations will build. If you’ve time have a quick read of this, which includes the prescient line: “England winger Jermaine McGillvary is one to watch”. 18 mins: James Graham has 16 tackles so far, according to the man on the telly. Burgess too, has been heavily involved for England. Good stuff from the NRL boys. 17 mins: Yet for all their pressure and possession in England’s half, the visitors are holding firm with some excellent, hard-nosed defending. 16 mins: Boom! Klemmer gets his knees pumping high for the first time tonight and rushes into a posse of English shirts. At least two of them are sent sprawling. 15 mins: England’s sojourn in the Australian half doesn’t last long though and before too long they’re back at their own 20-metre line, as Lomax takes a high kick. 13 mins: It’s a poor one from Widdop but it works in his favour, weirdly, and England reclaim possession. 12 mins: It’s all green at the moment with barely any respite for England. Graham hauls down Klemmer as the huge Australian forward line surges once more. Morgan this time attempts a kick through, and this one is better. It’ll be another drop out. 11 mins: Billy Slater now looks to find a chink in the English armour, which so far has held firm in the face of increasing Australian pressure. Still, there’s no way through. 10 mins: No suggestion from me at all that England targeted Cronk, but it’ll do them no harm to have roughed him up early doors. 9 mins: The nose isn’t affecting Cronk’s play though, and a little dink through is tricky for Graham to deal with in the England in-goal. Although the Australian can now add being winded to his list of ailments, with Sam Burgess hammering him after the ball left his boot. 8 mins: Moments later Cronk goes down with a bloody nose. That looks nasty, but he’ll carry on, of course. 7 mins: Cronk breaks through as the Kangaroos look to hit back now. No dice this time though as a desperate pass only finds an England shirt. 6 mins: Well, well, well. I’m not sure too many were expecting that to happen. Excellent for the game that it has though. 5 mins: England now advance towards the Australia goal line, with Widdop directing play. Burgess gets the ball, comes back inside and is tackled. On the last tackle, O’Loughlin finds Widdop who flings a cut-out pass to McGillvary, who leaps to catch it, before getting his feet back down on terra firma a putting down! Widdop misses the extras but we have a game on our hands! 3 mins: Klemmer now surges forward before excitement levels rise momentarily as a kick towards Gagai in the corner of the in-goal is ever-so-slightly over hit. 2 mins: Burgess sees his first defensive action of the night, forcing a spill of the ball. Australia regather and the counter re-sets. 1 min: And finally, we’re off! Game faces on! Smith kicks us off! Chris Hill has the first hit up of this World Cup before James Graham is targeted and takes a big hit himself. He’s not one to shy away though. Indeed it is. The Kangaroos lock arms and form a circle with Cameron Smith in the centre. He pays respect to the traditional owners of the land and they all then say “and we will rise as one” as they do indeed, rise as one. JT then delivers his much anticipated speech, about selflessness and unity. Great stuff. We’re looking at splitting the difference, Phil. Thurston is out on the pitch in his suit and will deliver an acknowledgement of country before we get underway. This is going to be amazing. https://twitter.com/phil_withall/status/923838189852278784 They’ll have to clear off all those flags from the pitch before we can get underway, but we’re not too far off now. And actually, not half as behind schedule as I was fearing. And right on cue, here come the teams! Cameron Smith, playing his 35th consecutive Test tonight, leads out the defending champions alongside Sean O’Loughlin and his England team. Decent renditions of God Save the Queen and Advance Australia Fair later and we’re pretty much set for lift off. And finally, we get a good look at what the next five weeks are all about as the Paul Barrière trophy is brought out and gingerly placed on a pedestal. Not a bad looking piece of silverware by any stretch. But OK, I’m ready for the game to start now. Yep, told you. It’s four minutes to kick-off and there’s no way they’re getting this game started on time. Unless the game’s actually going to be played elsewhere, recorded and then shown to viewers on delay, Carabao Cup draw style. Here comes Gary Schofield in front of the English flag, to Chumbawamba’s I Get Knocked Down. And now here’s local hero JT, Johnathan Thurston, leading out the Australian flag. Each flag has its own ambassador. Wales, Scotland and then Ireland are carried out. Pat Richards is the Irish ambassador. The great Hazem El Masri is next up as Lebanon are introduced to the crowd. So we’re going to have each team’s flag brought out onto the pitch, starting with Papua New Guinea. More singing, more dancing, more drumming. New Zealand out next. The woman singing (apologies, I don’t know who it is) has pipes. Well this is lovely. Aunty Caroline Briggs delivers a Welcome to Country. She finishes with “Welcome to our beautiful home” as the opening ceremony kicks off with some fireworks, drummers, didgeridoo playing and dancing. Still nowhere near a full house in the stands, though. OK, here’s how the two sides line up tonight: Australia: 1. Billy Slater; 2. Dane Gagai, 3. Will Chambers, 4. Josh Dugan, 5. Valentine Holmes; 6. Michael Morgan, 7. Cooper Cronk; 8. Aaron Woods, 9. Cameron Smith, 10. David Klemmer, 11. Boyd Cordner, 12. Matt Gillett, 13. Jake Trbojevic. Interchange: 14. Wade Graham, 15. Jordan McLean, 16. Josh Mcguire, 17. Tyson Frizell. England 1. Jonny Lomax; 2. Jermaine McGillvary, 3. Kallum Watkins, 4. John Bateman, 5. Ryan Hall; 6. Gareth Widdop, 7. Luke Gale; 8. Chris Hill, 9. Josh Hodgson, 10. James Graham, 11. Sam Burgess, 12. Elliott Whitehead, 13. Sean O’Loughlin. Interchange: Walmsley, 15. Chris Heighington, 16. Tom Burgess, 17. James Roby 18. Ben Currie. Or, here’s all that information in a handy tweet that could have just saved me typing all that out: Rugby league wouldn’t be rugby league without a bit of off-field scandal, would it? Never a dull day and all that. And today, the day of the opening game of the Rugby League World Cup, was no exception when, with near impeccable timing, this happened: It’ll be interesting to see what kind of crowd this matchup pulls tonight after much talk about how much this tournament has flown under the radar, both in Australia and the UK. With the opener being staged away from the rugby league heartland of Sydney, concerns over crowd size have also been raised, although that is to completely ignore the fact that rugby league crowds – including for international matches – are notoriously poor in Sydney. Anyway, it appears to be a pleasant evening in Melbourne, so no excuses on that front. That said, with nearly 20 minutes to go, there are plenty of empty seats to be seen around AAMI Park. Here we go then. The Rugby League World Cup is upon us once again. And with it the inexorable march to an 11th title for Australia, the undisputed kings of the game and nailed-on favourites to be celebrating once the other 13 nations have fallen by the wayside and whole thing wraps up five weeks from now without so much as a jot of intrigue. Nothing shall stand in their way. Or... maybe not. Yes, Mal Meninga’s side are hot favourites, yes, they have some pretty decent players, yes, they are on home soil and, yes, it’s pretty much theirs to lose, but, BUT, only a fool would suggest there is a sure thing in sport. I am not willing to be that fool today. We’ll have a much better idea of how things are going to pan out after tonight’s game at AAMI Park in Melbourne, where England are expected to provide as stiff an early test as neutral rugby league fans can hope for. Sean O’Loughlin’s side, guided by the master of coaching himself, Wayne Bennett, are, on paper at least, in the mix. If anyone can mastermind an upset, it’s old Wayne. They may not have reached a final since 1995, and their winless run against Australia stretches way back to 1995 (England) or 2006 (Great Britain) but they’re certainly capable of giving Australia something to think about. There have even been suggestions that Australia’s overwhelming favouritism may count against them and open to door to complacency. Meninga, you can be sure, will not allow that to happen, but to be honest it’s as valid as any other potential weakness the Kangaroos may have. England, and any other opposition over the next five weeks, will have to take what they can. Anyway, what we can definitely expect tonight (Australia!)/this morning (UK!)/today (other places in the world!) is that there will be 26 huge and hugely committed men scrapping tooth and nail for victory. No ground given, no prisoners taken etc etc. Do get in touch with any thoughts you may have on the game – mike.hytner@theguardian.com or with more brevity (I’m still on 140 characters) @mike_hytner. Kick-off is scheduled for 8pm in Melbourne, that’s 10am UK in the UK, so stick around (although I have zero confidence in the game actually starting on time, these things never do). Mike will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a quick look at this handy little team-by-team guide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/30/we-need-to-rethink-how-we-classify-mental-illness","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T00:19:04Z","webTitle":"We need to rethink how we classify mental illness | Tamara Kayali Browne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/we-need-to-rethink-how-we-classify-mental-illness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/30/we-need-to-rethink-how-we-classify-mental-illness","fields":{"headline":"We need to rethink how we classify mental illness","bodyText":"How do we decide what emotions, thoughts and behaviours are normal, abnormal or pathological? This is essentially what a select group of psychiatrists decide each time they revise the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), considered a “bible” for mental health professionals worldwide. But questions like this cannot be answered by scientists alone. This was famously demonstrated when homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the DSM in 1973. The decision was not based on new scientific evidence but came about due to pressure from activists. Cases such as this show the limitations of psychiatry and is where I believe philosophers, sociologists and ethicists could be of use. The DSM was first published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1952 to create a common language and standard criteria for the way we classify mental disorders. It’s now used around the world by clinicians, researchers, insurance and pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, health regulators and policy makers, to name a few. Now in its fifth edition, revisions have gradually expanded the number of mental disorders, while also removing some as understanding or values change. Over the years many of these amendments have courted controversy. These days, criticisms of the DSM are that it medicalises normal behaviour such as fidgetiness, noisiness and shyness. Currently, three temper tantrums a week, negativity, irritability and anger would qualify a child to be labelled with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The label assumes first that the child is suffering from a problem, and second that the problem is pathological. Yet one may also question why it is the child who must be labelled and not the parents. For example, why do we not have a diagnosis called inability to discipline one’s child disorder? What the “problem” is and who is judged to be the party “suffering” from it are value judgments which carry with them the cultural biases and assumptions of the individuals making those judgments. If we don’t examine value judgments properly, we risk making judgments that are discriminatory or harmful. For example, hysteria was mental disorder that supposedly only affected women and included a wide range of “symptoms” such as emotional outbursts, hallucinations, too much or too little sexual appetite, irritability and trouble-making. Although hysteria has now disappeared from official psychiatric diagnosis, there are elements of it present within other psychiatric diagnoses, most notably premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Commonly described as a more severe form of premenstrual stress (PMS), PMDD has been accused of labelling as a mental disorder normal and understandable reactions to the sort of stressful circumstances that disproportionately affect women in a modern society that still has not achieved gender equality. In this way, psychiatric diagnosis could act as a way of brushing aside indicators of social injustices. Likewise, sadness and changes in sleep, eating and so on can be normal and understandable reactions to loss (e.g. in the case of bereavement), not necessarily indicators of mental illness. In fact, behaviours like these can act as a positive sign that something is wrong, functioning as a catalyst for changing one’s situation for the better. But the DSM only focuses on these “symptoms” and does not take into account the individual’s context. This in itself is a value judgment. This is why our process of classifying mental illnesses should involve experts for whom examining value judgments is their bread and butter – philosophers. Bioethicists and philosophers of psychiatry are trained in bringing value judgments to light and analysing them in depth. The way we classify mental illnesses also has broad implications for those diagnosed and for society – something that sociologists would be well placed to consider. We could make good use of these experts by requiring each revision of the DSM to pass through an ethics assessment by an independent panel made up of philosophers, sociologists and ethicists. Philosophers could identify and deliberate the value issues, sociologists could present the possible social consequences of proposed changes, and ethicists could make the complex harm/benefit analyses and ethical trade-offs that will inevitably be involved. The panel also needs to have “teeth”, so it should have the power to veto or modify a category. This might sound like a provocative proposal, but it is similar to the procedure we already have for scientific studies. Just as these studies must gain ethics approval before they go ahead in order to mitigate harm to participants and the community, having an ethics review panel would be an extra step of “checks and balances” for the DSM. While those involved in making the DSM come from a variety of backgrounds – primarily psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and clinicians – none have been primarily ethicists or philosophers. And while some psychiatrists might have the training and experience that enables them to examine value judgments, it would be unreasonable to expect that to be the case, just as it would be unreasonable to expect ethicists and philosophers to be able to evaluate scientific judgments. The solution I propose is based on the idea that psychiatric diagnosis should serve an ethical purpose – relieving certain forms of suffering and disease. In light of this ethical purpose, we must do our utmost to consider value judgments that can cloud our view of “illness” and how it should be treated. I believe establishing an ethics review panel for the DSM can go a significant way towards achieving that goal.

It wasn’t the game we were expecting, or anyone was expecting, but the Astros will take it. I doubt anybody heading in would have tagged Brad Peacock as the winner in the McCullers vs Darvish pitching matchup. Houston are a game up, but the Dodgers absolutely are capable of a counter-punch. We’ll see how they respond to their deficit in Saturday’s Game 4, which we will be liveblogging here at the Guardian. Thanks to everybody who followed along with us for Game 3, especially those who contributed. Ciao! The Houston Astros have taken a 2-1 lead in the World Series! Dodgers 3-5 Astros, FINAL Yasmani Grandal might end up being the last batter of the game. He doesn’t help his case by taking strike one and then fouling the next pitch off for strike 2. Grandal doesn’t offer at a ball outside the zone. Peacock’s fourth pitch was close to the outside corner, but he doesn’t get the call. 2-2 on Grandal. Grandal keeps himself alive by fouling off the next offering. Still 2-2. Grandal swings and fouls off another on. The crowd in Houston is still up on its feet, trying to will one more out. Grandal hits a long foul ball that makes the seats. That’s seven pitches. Finally he hits a long but lazy fly that Reddick catches and the Astros have won Game 3! Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 9th And Chase Utey hits one back to Peacock for a second out. I’m starting to think this guy is pretty good. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 9th Hey, it’s Peacock again. I guess Hinch is keeping him in the game until it stops working out. And Peacock gets Puig to strike out swinging. I would call that “working out.” Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 8th Gurriel grounds out. Now the Astros are three outs away from securing a 2-1 World Series lead. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 8th Altuve is caught looking at strike three. Correa is up next and he hits a solid single to keep the inning going. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 8th Stripling is back out there for the bottom of the 8th. Maybe the last Dodgers pitcher of the game? He gets Bregman to fly out to right. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 8th Peacock strikes out Bellinger, increasing his World Series strikeout total to roughly 3,585. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 8th Turner pops out to McCann, who makes the catch in foul ground. Peacock getting the job done here, especially compared with how the Dodgers had to throw everything at the Astros hitters tonight. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 8th Peacock is out to start the 8th. He strikes out Seager on four pitches. Astros fans are starting to sniff the finish line here. There’s a pretty enthusiastic applause for the out. I wouldn’t be shocked if Roberts was tempted. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 7th Ross Stripling is up to face George Springer with the bases loaded. His first two pitches are off the plate. Springer hits the third pitch long but foul. On 2-1, he hits one high to center, oh my god is he going to…. Nope, Taylor makes the catch by the wall and the Dodgers are still in this one. They’re running out of outs though. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 7th Cingrani gets Gonzalez to pop out to second. Up comes McCann who grounds out to Bellinger who can’t quite make the play. They’ll call this an infield single and everybody is safe. And we have another pitching change! Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 7th Tony Cingrani is here to pitch for the Dodgers now. Reddick pops up a bunt attempt, which leaves him understandably frustrated. The Dodgers then intentionally walk Gattis. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 7th Gurriel hits a double off of Morrow. This time he does not celebrate his hit with a racist gesture, so that’s an improvement for him. Roberts comes to take out Morrow. Seventh Inning Stretch Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 7th ..And Peacock gets Taylor to ground out to first and we’ve hit the seventh inning stretch. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 7th Peacock gets Pederson to strike out. Andre Ethier is here to pinch-hit for Hernandez. Ethier manages to work a walk and, as odd as it seems, the tying run is coming to the plate in the form of Chris Taylor. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, top 7th Peacock is starting the 7th. He gets a pinch-hitting Yasmani Grandal to fly out. Oh. This is... This is uh not an incredibly great look here. I have a feeling we’re going to hear a bit about this after the game. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 6th And he gets Correa on three pitches as well. That does it for the sixth. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 6th Morrow gets Altuve to strike out on three straight sliders. Nice trick if you can do it. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 6th Morrow gets Springer to ground out, but he’s safe at first after Turner’s poor throw pulls Bellinger off the bag. Morrow then walks Bregman on four straight pitches. This is almost exactly opposite of the way the Dodgers need to play this half-inning. (speaking in a frequency where baseball traditionalists can’t hear me) Or maybe both leagues should have the DH. Dodgers 3-5 Astros, bottom 6th Tony Watson starts off the bottom of the sixth. An additional run or two here would make Houston feel a lot more confident. McCann is up first, and he works a full count before popping up. And that will do it for Watson. The Dodgers turn to Brandon Morrow. Or they would have been okay with that transaction had Peacock managed to avoid throwing a wild pitch to Chase Utley that let Turner score from third. Utley eventually fouls out, but it’s now a two-run game and it has a very, very different feel now. Brad Peacock is in the game to face Yasiel Puig. Puig grounds out to second. Seager scores, Turner makes it to third. That’s the second out though so the Astros are okay with that transaction. Dodgers 1-5 Astros, top 6th Whoa. McCullers gets Cody Bellinger to strike out swinging and that will be all for him. A.J. Hinch comes out to remove him. Standing ovation here in Houston. Can’t say he doesn’t deserve it. Now it’s time to see if the Astros bullpen can hammer this down. Dodgers 1-5 Astros, top 6th And there’s a major hit, with Justin Turner hitting a double off of McCullers. Dodgers have runners on second and third now with no outs. Dodgers 1-5 Astros, top 6th Well, the Dodgers add a walk, courtesy of Seager, to their offensive total. Dodgers 1-5 Astros, bottom 5th Watson gets Gonzalez to strike out, but the Astros pick up another run. This is starting to look a little bleak for the Dodgers. Tony Watson is in to face Gurriel, whom he gets to ground out almost immediately. Next up is Reddick, who hits a solid single. Evan Gattis gets a gift hit as Watson’s throw goes awry allowing Reddick to score. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 5th Tony Watson is in to face Gurriel, whom he gets to ground out almost immediately. Next up is Reddick, who hits a solid single. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 5th Maeda is out for another inning. He gets Correa to ground out and Maeda is gone after throwing 40+ pitches. This could end up having some carry-over effect on the Dodgers bullpen going forward. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, top 5th Chris Taylor *nearly* scores Pederson from third but Springer dives to steal a single away from him. And thus ends LA’s half of the fifth. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, top 5th McCullers is here to start the 5th, facing Austin Barnes. He hits a routine fly ball to Reddick. Up next is Joc Pederson, who manages to stretch a base hit into a double. Something of a surprise that, especially after Puig got thrown out earlier. Hernandez immediately grounds out to second, putting Pederson on third. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 4th Jose Altuve grounds out to end the inning. A thankfully uneventful inning for the Dodgers. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 4th Maeda gets Springer to strike out swinging. He then gets ahead of Bregman 1-2, his slider is just nasty here. Bregman fouls off Maeda’s fourth pitch and can’t quite connect on the fifth. That’s two straight k’s. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 4th Maeda is out to start the fourth for the Dodgers. I guess he’s here for a bit. McCann gets a bloop single to start off the Houston half of the fourth. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, top 4th Oof. Puig gets thrown out by Correa trying to get to second. Forsythe flies out. Another frustrating inning for the Dodgers. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, top 4th McCullers is back out there for the 4th. Let’s see if he can steady himself after last inning. And he gets Bellinger to strike out swinging. That’s a decent sign. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 3rd Marwin Gonzalez puts together a decent at-bat before grounding out to first to end the inning. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 3rd And Reddick also pops out to Turner. It looks like Maeda can get out of the inning quickly but has some troubles putting Gattis away, eventually walking him. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, bottom 3rd Maeda is back out there, facing Gurriel, who started all the scoring last inning. He pops up to Turner. And now the bullpen comes in somewhat exposed in a game where the Dodgers absolutely need them. Dodgers 1-4 Astros, top 3rd And it’s down to Justin Turner here to see if the Dodgers can do any more damage this inning. Nope, he grounds out to short and Houston escapes a jam with minimal damage. And Corey Seager hits into a double play. Pederson scores, but the Astros will gladly take the two outs. Hernandez is on third. Dodgers 0-4 Astros, top 3rd Chris Taylor gets ahead of the count 3-1. This is getting nerve-wracking. We might be heading into a bullpen game no matter what. Taylor fouls off another pitch. 3-2. And McCullers’ next pitch is outside and the bases are loaded with nobody out. This is not ideal. Dodgers 0-4 Astros, top 3rd McCullers throws three straight balls to Enrique Hernandez. That’s the exact opposite of what you want to see from a starter after your team gets four runs. And there’s ball four. Two on, nobody out for the Dodgers. Dodgers 0-4 Astros, top 3rd McCullers is back after a very long pitching break. He’s facing Joc Pederson who puts on a pretty nifty at-ball, finally working a walk on pitch number nine. Yu Darvish just didn’t have the command tonight, but I’m sure that Dodgers writers aren’t going to use this to make incredibly lazy accusations about his heart. I mean that would just be... (Sighs heavily.) Dodgers 0-4 Astros, bottom 2nd Kenta Maeda is in. He gets Correa to fly out to right to end the nightmare inning for the Dodgers. Well. That wasn’t what I was expecting here, I’ll say that much. Dodgers 0-4 Astros, bottom 2nd Altuve hits a double and any other baserunner who wasn’t Brian McCann would have scored. Dave Roberts takes out Darvish, but is it already too late? Bregman hits a flyball to center to score Gonzalez. At least there was an out there? Dodgers 0-3 Astros, bottom 2nd Darvish’s first two pitches are way off. There’s activity in the Dodgers pen and they might need someone very very soon. Springer takes another strike and then gets solid contact on a fastball but it’s hit right at Bregman for the first out of the inning. Welp. Darvish’s having an off-night. Brian McCann is up next, and he hits a single to knock in Gattis. Gonzalez gets to third. And here is Marwin Gonzalez who could have the most hilarious World Series home runs of all time here…. attempts to bunt at 1-1 and manages to miss. It’s 1-2. And we have another mound visit here. Gonzalez hits one…. it’s not quite out. Taylor almost makes the catch, so Reddick scores but Gattis only makes it to second. Dodgers 0-1 Astros, bottom 2nd Evan Gattis is up next, with Reddick on second. Darvish falls behind 3-1. He throws a pitch right in the zone that Gattis could hit out, but instead he fouls it off. 3-2. Gattis fouls off the next pitch. Darvish goes up-and-in and that’s ball four. Two on, still nobody out. Dave Roberts himself comes out to talk to his pitcher, not a good sign this early in a game. Dodgers 0-1 Astros, bottom 2nd And Josh Reddick hits a double and this place is very, very loud. Yuli Gurriel facing Yu Darvish. He takes a strike, and then two balls, and then laces the fourth pitch or the at-bat for a home run to left field! Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 2nd Forstyhe steals second on a 2-2 pitch to Austin Barnes. It’s a ball outside. Barnes grounds out to third on the next pitch, however, to end any potential drama. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 2nd Logan Forstyhe hits a single, and that’s the first baserunner of the night for LA. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 2nd Yasiel Puig swings at the first pitch he sees and he grounds out to second. They are, uh, not so much making McCulllers work. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 2nd McCullers’s first pitch to Cody Bellinger is a strike. As is the second one. And then he swings and misses at pitch 3. Not… not the greatest series for Bellinger. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st It’s up to Carlos Correa, who grounds out to short to end the inning. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Jose Altuva hits a hanging slider but he doesn’t get enough of it. It’s a long flyball that gets Springer to third, but there’s now two outs. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st Alex Bregman is up next with Springer on second. A good chance to score early here for Houston. Bregman keeps fouling off Darvish’s offerings, making him work here early on. Finally, he manages to get contact but it’s a groundout to third that doesn’t get Springer to third base. Wasted opportunity there. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, bottom 1st And here’s last night hero, George Springer, facing Yu Darvish. Darvish falls behind Springer 3-1 and then he knocks a double into centerfield for a lead-off double. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 1st Justin Turner hits a long fly that Minute Maid just barely contains. George Springer makes the catch and that’s it for the first inning. I’m already not confident with my home run prediction. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 1st Chris Taylor grounds out to Jose Altuva, who just throws him out for the second out. Dodgers 0-0 Astros, top 1st Lance McCullers Jr’s first pitch to Chris Tayor is a ball. As his second. He gets a strike over he plate the next pitch. Taylor takes ball 3 before hitting a super-shallow flyball. Email from Richard Woods: Hi Hunter, At the age of 50 and a lot I found myself becoming mildly obsessed with baseball, and as my wife is Canadian, my support had to go to the Blue Jays. I went to my first ever game in July - a home match up against the Red Sox at Rogers Stadium. On that day I confidently predicted that the Jays would walk it. They lost 15-1. So put all your money on the Dodgers, because I’m going for the Astros in 6 games because of their sheer cussedness, and in the future for Justin Turner’s beard to make it to the Hall of Fame completely independently of Justin himself. I am personally very pro-Justin Turner’s beard, although this is a more well-groomed World Series than those we’ve had in the past. J.J. Watt threw out the first pitch. (He’s more popular than his boss right now I would assume.) The MLB’s really laying on the patriotism this postseason. By this time next year the American flag will be big enough to act as the roof. A blast from the Guardian past here, as the legendary Steve Busfield steps in with a prediction: Extra prediction: there will only be four home runs total in this game. Yes I’m aware that it’s being played in Minute Maid Park. That’s my take as well. (Note considering my luck with predictions this may not be comforting.) Predictions Since the first two games of this series were so great, a fast-paced pitching duel and a chaotic extra-inning game featuring an improbable number of momentum-swinging home runs, I’m convinced I’m going to get stuck with a yawner here. Maybe an early crooked number here? I could see the Dodgers getting up 6-0 and the Astros bats falling back to earth. Maybe 7-2 final, Dodgers up 2-1 on the series. Your theories? Send them to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com (via email) or to @HunterFelt (if you’d rather tweet). Well even more turmoil in the world of major league managers, with Joe Girardi out of the New York Yankees. That’s after the Washington Nationals parted ways with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox replacing John Farrell with Alex Cora, who is currently the bench coach for the Astros. A lot on his plate. Houston Astros starters 1. George Springer, CF 2. Alex Bregman, 3B 3. Jose Altuve, 2B 4. Carlos Correa, SS 5. Yuli Gurriel, 1B 6. Josh Reddick, RF 7. Evan Gattis, DH 8. Marwyn Gonzalez LF 9. Brian McCann, C I would have put Gonzalez farther up the lineup just to troll Yu Darvish. LA Dodgers starters 1. Chris Taylor, CF 2. Corey Seager, SS 3. Justin Turner, 3B 4. Cody Bellinger, 1B 5. Yasiel Puig, RF 6. Logan Forsythe, 2B 7. Austin Barnes, C 8. Joc Pederson, DH 9. Enrique Hernandez, LF Before the start of tonight’s game, let’s take one last look at George Springer’s 11th inning home run that put the Astros up 7-5. Thankfully for Houston, they only allowed one home run in the bottom of the 11th and were able to hang on to a 7-6 lead. Okay I hate to start this whole thing off on a down note, but tonight’s Game 3 probably isn’t going to be as exciting as Wednesday night’s Game 2. The chances of having two of the craziest World Series games of all time in a row is pretty low. With that said, that 11-inning home run fest marked a clear notice that we’re officially in unknown terrain with this series, and it’s now officially impossible to guess where this is all going. The World Series tied up 1-1 which means that tonight’s outcome is going to go a long way as far as determining who’s going to be in control of the series. Normally you’d say that the Houston Astros, playing their first home game of the series would have the advantage, but that’s not necessarily the case today. After all, the Los Angeles Dodgers are starting right-hander Yu Darvish while Lance McCullers Jr. is the starter for the Houston Astros. Darvish has been sparkling this postseason and has a 4-1 record, with a 2.16 ERA, at Minute Maid Park. The Dodgers have ever reason to expect a dominant outing, which will help them out from a psychological perspective after they blew several chances to leave their home park with a 2-0 record. As always we’ll be taking your emails (send them to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweets (those can go to @HunterFelt) throughout tonight’s game. it’s Game 3 of the World Series at Minute Maid Park. The game is officially set to start at 8:20pm EST, but we’ll be back much earlier than that with all sorts of game-related commentary. Hunter will be here soon. In the meantime, read how the Houston Astros fought back against the Los Angeles Dodgers to win Game 2."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/13/a-pot-smoking-bus-tour-with-pat-butcher-how-did-that-show-get-made","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T10:29:00Z","webTitle":"A pot-smoking bus tour with Pat Butcher ... how did that show get made?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/13/a-pot-smoking-bus-tour-with-pat-butcher-how-did-that-show-get-made","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/13/a-pot-smoking-bus-tour-with-pat-butcher-how-did-that-show-get-made","fields":{"headline":"A pot-smoking bus tour with Pat Butcher ... how did that show get made?","bodyText":"The following transcript is taken from the pitching meeting for ITV’s Gone to Pot.

Producer: OK, so we want to do something quite different to ... Editor one: Basically, we want more like it. Producer: But you just said that nobody watched it. Editor one: Doesn’t matter. This is ITV. If we have an idea, we have to ride it until the wheels come off. Remember when we just had one singing competition? Editor two: We’ve got so many singing competitions now. So many. Editor three: People literally hate the idea of singing as a concept these days, and it’s all because we’ve got so many singing competitions. Producer: Riiight … Editor one: Same with celebrity documentaries. Can’t get enough of them. Joanna Lumley’s Japan, Paul O’Grady’s For the Love of Dogs, Martin Clunes and his horses… Editor three: Remember Stephen Tompkinson’s Australian Balloon Adventure? Christ, what were we thinking? Editor one: So basically we want to do that with drugs now. Editor two: We want loads of drug shows. Hundreds of them. Producer: I thought this was a serious show about cannabis? Editor one: You got it – it’ll be about marijuana, and it’ll be called Gone to Pot. Editor three: Great title. Editor two: Great title. Producer: Well actually, I’m really interested in what’s going on in America right now, with the legalisation and everything. There are real scientific medical benefits to cannabis use. My aunt … Editor one: Brilliant. We’ve got Pam St Clement lined up. Producer: … is undergoing chemotherapy at the moment, and she’s … sorry, did you just say Pam St Clement? Editor two: Pat Butcher, yes. Editor one: And John Fashanu. And the blonde one out of Birds of a Feather. Producer: What?! Editor one: And Christopher Biggins. Editor three: Biggins!

We’ve painted it all trippy and everything. Producer: I’m sorry, I’m not sure this is for me. Editor one: Listen, that’s just a peripheral gimmick. You can still make the documentary you want to make. Producer: Are you sure? I know this is ITV and all, but we still have a duty to be responsible about how we go about discussing … Editor three: Do you think you can film Pat Butcher smoking a doobie? Producer: Pardon? Editor two: We’ve sort of promised that the series will include footage of Pat Butcher smoking a doobie in an ironic Bob Marley wig. The social media team are saying it’ll do serious numbers in GIFS. Producer: No, listen, sorry, this whole venture is absurd. Good luck with the series, but I cannot be part of it. Editor one: Wait, we have more ideas! Ben Shepherd on Steroids!

During their team’s goalless draw with archrivals Fenerbahçe in an ill-tempered Istanbul derby on Sunday, fans displayed a poster of Stallone in the film Rocky with the words: “They look big because you are on your knees, stand up.” A pro-government daily said the caption evoked the words of Fethullah Gülen, the US-based cleric widely believed in Turkey to have orchestrated last year’s coup attempt, who closed a speech with a poem featuring the line “Rise up Sakarya,” referring to a province in Turkey. Reuters said the prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, had ordered an investigation into the incident. Galatasaray described the accusations as “pathetic” and the work of “puppets, pawns and social media trolls”. It said on its website: “We will use all our legal rights against any person or social media account that puts the name of Galatasaray beside the leader of an odious terrorist organisation.” Tens of thousands of people in Turkey have been dismissed from their jobs or detained over alleged links to Gülen’s movement. Critics say the purges have gone beyond the perpetrators to crush all forms of dissent against the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The pattern of media vilification of opponents has been repeated often in Turkey in the months since the coup attempt. Pro-government media, which now forms the large majority of the country’s local press, have often played the role of instigator, with media campaigns often followed by the opening of new investigations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/24/st-pauls-cathedral-to-host-grenfell-tower-memorial-service","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T09:33:51Z","webTitle":"St Paul’s Cathedral to host Grenfell Tower memorial service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/24/st-pauls-cathedral-to-host-grenfell-tower-memorial-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/24/st-pauls-cathedral-to-host-grenfell-tower-memorial-service","fields":{"headline":"St Paul’s Cathedral to host Grenfell Tower memorial service","bodyText":"St Paul’s Cathedral is to host a national memorial service for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and relatives of those who died on the six-month anniversary of the catastrophe, on 14 December.

Families will be given a special email address via which they can send ideas for the service to the chapter, or governing body, of St Paul’s. Shahin Sadafi, the chair of Grenfell United, said: “Our community was devastated on the 14 June 2017. Months on, uncertainty and distress are still what we feel above anything else. Nothing significant has yet changed for the bereaved families and survivors of the fire. “However, we hope that by gathering together to remember the tragedy we can begin to heal our community with the support of the whole country. United together, we can help light the way for what will undoubtedly be a long road ahead.” Graham Tomlin, the bishop of Kensington, said holding a service at St Paul’s “recognises the significance of this tragedy both for the local community and the wider nation. My hope and prayer is that it will help us remember those who lost their lives, bring comfort and strength to the bereaved and point a way to a better future.” Up to 80 people, including at least 18 children, died when fire swept through the 24-storey tower block. Most families made homeless by the fire are still living in temporary accommodation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/24/unseen-harper-lee-letters-give-intimate-view-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T13:10:19Z","webTitle":"Unseen Harper Lee letters give intimate view of To Kill a Mockingbird author","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/24/unseen-harper-lee-letters-give-intimate-view-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/24/unseen-harper-lee-letters-give-intimate-view-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author","fields":{"headline":"Unseen Harper Lee letters give intimate view of To Kill a Mockingbird author","bodyText":"A suggestion made by American president Lyndon B Johnson to the actor Gregory Peck that the US would one day have a black, female president is among a number of illustrious anecdotes in letters written by the author Harper Lee that have come to light. Thirty-eight letters, written between 2005 and 2010 by the To Kill a Mockingbird author to her friend Felice Itzkoff, are up for auction this week. Addressed affectionately to “Clipper”, Lee’s nickname for Itzkoff, the letters span Lee’s memories of her father, her apparent atheism and her friendship with Hollywood figures. In one letter, dated 20 January 2009 – the day of Barack Obama’s inauguration – Lee wrote to Itzkoff: “On this Inauguration Day I count my blessings … I’m also thinking of another friend, Greg Peck, who was a good friend of LBJ. Greg said to him: ‘Do you suppose we will live to see a black president?’ LBJ said: ‘No, but I wish her well.’” Peck, who played Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Lee’s novel, was a lifelong friend of the author. Lee also recalls her friendship with actor Vivien Leigh, describing her as “a character, and I loved her”. In another, from 14 May 2009, she likens Horton Foote, the screenwriter of To Kill a Mockingbird, to her father: “I am so proud to say that he was my friend. I loved him with all my heart and shall miss him for as long as I am aware of anything. I never knew anybody like him except for my father, they had many traits in common. He was a great gentleman, and he did look like God!” There are many allusions to Lee’s atheism in the letters. In a Christmas card from 2009, she writes to Itzkoff: “Most-loved Clipper: Don’t know if you celebrate Christmas, but it makes not a jot of difference to me. I am at heart a heathen. Much love, Harper.” There are frequent, sardonic references to the Bible passage Hebrews 13.8 – “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever” – with Lee using it as an image of mundanity. In a letter from 26 June 2009, she writes: “My dear Friend of the beautiful face and beautiful hand: It is so Hebrews 13.8 here that I nearly go crazy from boredom, but I should not complain because things could be quite different. The truth is: I am crazy anyway.” In another in 2009, she notes: “It’s strictly Hebrews 13.8 here – nothing happens on a daily basis, and if I had sense enough to be bored, I’d be long since gone off the deep end.” Lee was long thought to have written only one novel, until 2014 when the “sequel” Go Set a Watchman was controversially released. Originally abandoned by Lee when she began writing To Kill a Mockingbird, it was suspected by some that the book was released without her consent – and one letter contains Lee’s own position on how many books she had actually written. On 18 April 2009, she writes affectionately about her fellow southern US author Eudora Welty, who often criticised Lee for being a one-hit wonder: “Alas, I never had the privilege of meeting Miss Welty … She was the only person I ever ‘wanted to meet’. I once heard her say something about ‘Harper Lee’s case’ – talking about one-novel writers. I could have told her: as it turned out, I didn’t need to write another one – much xxx, H.” Lee, who died in 2016 at the age of 89, was suspected by some to have developed dementia at the end of her life, but remained protected by a small group of supporters. These included her sister Alice, who died in 2014 at the age of 103, and her lawyer, Tonja Carter, who some later accused of releasing Go Set a Watchman against Lee’s wishes. But in the letters, there are small references to Lee’s awareness of her own mental state – signing one letter as “your addled Harper” and in another from 2008, which says: “I haven’t got bat sense – I blame drugs, but it’s probably senility ... Everybody here is in dementia of some sort + I am no exception. At least I can remember major events – 9/11, for example, is also Alice’s birthday. Ninety-seven + still taking care of baby sister. Much love, H.” The starting price for the 38 letters is $10,000 (£7,580)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/24/massively-unfair-guthrie-attacks-demand-to-disclose-abc-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T07:07:51Z","webTitle":"'Massively unfair': Guthrie attacks demand to disclose ABC pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/24/massively-unfair-guthrie-attacks-demand-to-disclose-abc-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/24/massively-unfair-guthrie-attacks-demand-to-disclose-abc-pay","fields":{"headline":"'Massively unfair': Guthrie attacks demand to disclose ABC pay","bodyText":"The ABC’s chief executive, Michelle Guthrie, has labelled a push to publish the names and salaries of ABC presenters as “completely unprecedented” and “massively unfair”, and warned it would constitute a breach of the Privacy Act. Guthrie made the comments to Senate estimates on Tuesday, fiercely defending the ABC against “sectional claims, red tape and political vendettas” that she said threaten the public broadcaster’s independence. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has written to the ABC demanding it publish a list of the names and salaries of all staff who earn more than $200,000. The move follows a deal between the Turnbull government and One Nation to pass its media ownership bill in return for increased pay transparency and a “competitive neutrality” review about ABC and SBS’s competition with commercial rivals. Guthrie told estimates the ABC already published corporate accounts which show that 150 of more than 4,000 people in the organisation earn more than $200,000, “We don’t list individual names with salaries,” she said. “We were advised by the [communications] department and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that listing individual names on the website would breach the Privacy Act.” Guthrie questioned what additional benefit listing individuals names would achieve and said she did not understand why the ABC was asked to list names and salaries “in a more extensive way” than other publicly funded bodies. “It’s massively unfair to our journalists and presenters given they work in a competitive media sector,” she said. In comments to Guardian Australia, Fifield said the government had given the ABC until 13 November to respond to the “enhanced transparency policy”. “If the ABC determines it won’t or can’t comply, the government will introduce legislation to seek to give effect to the policy,” he said. Asked to explain which “political vendettas” needed to be guarded against in regulating the ABC, Guthrie noted that One Nation parliamentarians have said they are seeking journalists’ salaries because they want to find “dud presenters”. “That is a level of scrutiny not appropriate for an independent public broadcaster,” she said. Guthrie said One Nation complaints about the ABC had “absolutely not” influenced its editorial content, which has included a Four Corners special scrutinising the minor party. Asked about the addition of ensuring “fair and balanced” reporting to the obligations of the ABC board, another One Nation demand, Guthrie said the ABC was concerned about “how those words will be read by people who choose to take an aggressive view towards achieving a false balance”. The requirement for fair and balanced reporting “based on the weight of evidence” is already contained in the ABC’s editorial policies. The head of news and current affairs, Alan Sunderland, said if the standards were legislated with that context stripped out, it might imply the ABC should engage in “false balance” and “he-said she-said journalism”. In questions repeatedly referring to “your ABC”, One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts asked whether its journalists suffered from “groupthink” and why they hadn’t uncovered “what we have found out about [science agency] CSIRO” and the “whole other side to the climate debate”. Guthrie and Sunderland defended reporting by the Middle East correspondent, Sophie McNeil, that Eric Abetz claimed “impugned the reputation of Israel”. She accused Abetz of a “line-by-line attack on a particular journalist” that she described as “offensive” and “inappropriate”. After a New Daily report revealing emails from ABC staff complaining about an internal memo on remaining impartial on marriage equality, Sunderland said a “handful” of ABC staff had expressed concern. Asked about the Lateline presenter Emma Alberici’s tweets about marriage equality, Sunderland said it was an “intensely personal” issue and personal social media accounts were not ABC publications. ABC staff had to be mindful, cautious and to balance their professional responsibilities with personal opinions, but should be judged on the quality of the work on the ABC, he said. “In relation to Emma Alberici and others, where we have felt from time to time that that activity risks having the potential to undermine her work we’ve spoken to them about it, we’ve spoken to a range of staff about it,” he said. Sunderland took on notice a series of questions about tweets by the ABC contributor Sami Shah including one asking whether the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, “wakes up every morning with a hard on for abusing refugees”. Sunderland also took on notice a series of questions from the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds claiming that an ABC report on Australian federal police resourcing had coincided in timing with Bill Shorten’s question on the same subject – which she suggested indicated a “coordinated attack” on the government. Guthrie conceded the timing of an Australian Story special on the Labor senator Sam Dastyari was “a mistake” because it coincided with the launch of his book, but she defended the content of the program that did not reference the book. She said she was concerned the competitive neutrality review could instigate a fundamental restructure of the ABC charter to force it into a “market failure role”. The ABC’s charter “does not say that [it] is just a market failure broadcaster, doing only what the commercial sector does not want to do or cannot”, she said. “That has never been our defining role, nor should it be in the future.” Earlier Fifield defended the government’s media changes after Nick Xenophon said the Coalition refused to agree to a deal if Guardian Australia would benefit. Fifield said the government “makes no apology for the fact that one of the tests is it can’t be controlled by an entity that is not Australian”. “We don’t have a test for ideology,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/25/mal-meninga-commands-respect-for-kangaroos-jersey-across-state-lines","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T17:00:44Z","webTitle":"Mal Meninga commands respect for Kangaroos' jersey across state lines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/25/mal-meninga-commands-respect-for-kangaroos-jersey-across-state-lines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/25/mal-meninga-commands-respect-for-kangaroos-jersey-across-state-lines","fields":{"headline":"Mal Meninga commands respect for Kangaroos' jersey across state lines","bodyText":"Nearly two years ago, the NRL chief executive, Todd Greenberg, addressed the media to announce that the role of Australian coach would be a dedicated, stand-alone position. No longer would the Kangaroos coach juggle club or state commitments with the job of managing the national team. “We were looking for a successful coach,” Greenberg said. “One who would not only command the respect of the best players in this country, but would also command the respect of the whole game — all of its stakeholders, from fans to players all across the country who are still only dreaming of one day becoming a Kangaroos player. “We were looking for an ambassador, someone whose reputation as a player and a coach is second to none. Someone who saw this role as a privilege and something to aspire to. In Mal Meninga, we have found that figure within the game.” Meninga took over an Australian side that had been beaten by New Zealand in three consecutive Test matches, and had lost its No 1 world ranking. Since then, the Kangaroos have not lost a game and are heavy favourites to win the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. At the time of his appointment, Meninga had some of the best coaching credentials in rugby league, having famously coached Queensland to eight consecutive State of Origin series victories between 2006 and 2013. Yet his record as a club coach was less than impressive and, in 2011, reports suggested that the brains behind the Maroons’ success actually belonged to Meninga’s assistant coaches. Meninga subsequently let fly at “the faceless men of influence” and the “NSW powerbrokers” in his infamous “rats and filth” column. He was not the first Queenslander, nor will he be the last, to let fly at the New South Wales establishment. Yet since he took over as coach of the Kangaroos, Meninga has played a diplomatic role, stating that he wants to bring pride back to the green and gold jersey. “The thing that sticks out to me is the players’ respect for what Mal has achieved in the game,” said Gene Miles, a former teammate of Meninga’s and the chairman of Queensland Former Origin Greats. “He’s no super coach – he’s had great people around him … but Mal is a really good player manager. People respect him; as soon as you come into camp, the respect is there. “Every time you see the Australian squad interviewed now, it’s all about playing for that green and gold jersey. They’re happy to put aside the maroon jersey and the sky blue jersey. That’s the influence of Mal in the short space of time that he’s been there.” Meninga’s 24-man squad for the upcoming World Cup is effectively a half-and-half split between Queenslanders and New South Welshmen. The Queensland captain, Cameron Smith, is once again the Australian captain. The captain of NSW, Boyd Cordner, is vice-captain. “We’ve closed the door on all that,” said Meninga when asked about state rivalries. “If you want to play in the green and gold jersey and be part of our environment you’ve got to put those differences aside.” The late defection of Andrew Fifita to Tonga could be seen as a blow to his mission of putting pride back into the Kangaroos jersey. Yet Meninga, who is of South Sea Islander background, said he could understand Fifita’s desire to represent his heritage nation. “My view is you’ve got to be connected with your heart,” he said. “You’ve got to be emotionally engaged with the jersey you put on, whether it be club or state or country. “I admire the fact that he’s emotionally connected to the Tongans. I’d prefer to have someone that’s connected to the green and gold jersey. That’s why I’ve given it full blessing and hopefully he plays well for his ancestral country.” It is a position that has won the respect of many within the rugby league fraternity. Tas Baitieri, a development officer for the Rugby League International Federation, said Meninga’s response to the Fifita affair set “an exceptional example”. “Don’t forget, Mal Meninga’s family is of a similar background, so had he had the opportunity when he was younger to do the same I’m sure he would have done it out of sheer respect for his parents and background and upbringing,” Baitieri said. Baitieri has been working behind the scenes for decades to promote the international game, and in Meninga sees a kindred spirit. Both men are talking up the potential of the “International 40/40” concept — which involves three teams playing one 40-minute half each — to develop rugby league in new markets. “We’ve obviously got huge support around the Pacific [nations], so I’d like to see that forge ahead in various forms,” Meninga said. “We’d like to help the European game with the English and the French competitions. We want to help out as much as we can by going back to scheduling Kangaroos tours and Great Britain Lions tours back over here. The next World Cup is over in England, so we just keep on promoting the game as best we possibly can.” It is fitting that Meninga is looking to play a lead role in the next evolution of rugby league. As a player he was at the centre of four major changes that have defined the game in the modern era: State of Origin, the power game, expansion and money. Early in his career he was big enough to shift from his position as centre to the forward pack, and before the Polynesian influx in the 1990s and 2000s he was an early exponent of the power game that now characterises rugby league. “From my era, why he’s such an icon in the game is when he went over to play [club football] in England,” Miles said. “He just killed it over there. They couldn’t handle him — he was too big, too strong, too fast. That’s where his reputation started. Worldwide he was known as this big monster playing in the centres, and no one could dominate him.” And from his starring role in the first State of Origin game in 1980, when he toe-punted seven out of seven conversions to help the Maroons beat NSW on the night of his 20th birthday; to captaining expansion side Canberra Raiders to its first premiership in 1989; to his support for Rupert Murdoch’s Super League competition in the mid-1990s, Meninga has been at the coalface of Australian rugby league’s transition from a working-class, suburban game to a multimillion-dollar national industry. Baitieri believes the modernisation and professionalisation of the Australian game in the 90s left most of the other nations behind. Yet with the flexible eligibility rules and more support for emerging and minnow nations, he and many others are hoping this World Cup could be a turning point for international rugby league. Miles believes it will be “without doubt” the best World Cup yet. If Australia are successful, Meninga will have won almost everything there is to win as both a player and a coach. Already he has been enshrined in bronze outside the Canberra Raiders’ home ground and at Queensland’s Lang Park. One of his former teammates, Greg Dowling, believes the ultimate accolade — rugby league Immortality — awaits. “He’s done wonders,” said Dowling. “I played a lot of football against Mal, with Mal, and he should have been an Immortal. I don’t know why he isn’t. He deserves it — he’s a great ambassador for the game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/australia-to-help-philippines-counter-terrorists-brutal-tactics-payne-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T02:14:25Z","webTitle":"Australia to help Philippines counter terrorists’ ‘brutal tactics’, Payne says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/australia-to-help-philippines-counter-terrorists-brutal-tactics-payne-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/australia-to-help-philippines-counter-terrorists-brutal-tactics-payne-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia to help Philippines counter terrorists’ ‘brutal tactics’, Payne says","bodyText":"Australia will send mobile training teams to the Philippines within days to assist with urban warfare counter-terrorism operations in the country, the defence minister, Marise Payne, says. Payne said on Tuesday the Australian defence force would shortly provide “practical training ... which will support the Philippines defence force to be able to counter what are very brutal tactics by terrorists”. The defence minister said the Australian military had acquired significant skills to counter urban insurgencies in Iraq and Syria, which it was happy to pass on to the military in the Philippines. As part of a cooperative agreement with the Philippines that underscores Australia’s concern about security developments in the region, Payne said the Australian army would train members of the Philippines army and the marine corps on military bases in the Philippines. Australia will enhance intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in the southern Philippines, and step up maritime patrols, to help combat the activity of groups linked to Islamic State. The Australian navy will conduct ship visits to the Philippines involving “a range of cooperative activities to support the development of capacity in the Philippines navy”, Payne said, beginning with an Australian patrol boat visit next month. The new commitments build on support Australia has already provided in the conflict in Marawi. Australian P-3 Orion aircraft have flown surveillance missions gathering intelligence around Marawi over the past few months, supporting the local military.

They are nevertheless birds of a feather: affecting portraits of motherhood by way of psychological tribulation, treated with deathly, outré seriousness in the case of the former and with spoonfuls of comedy to help the medicine go down in the latter. To borrow the words of The Letdown’s co-creator, co-writer (with Sarah Scheller) and star Alison Bell, who is best known for her performance in ABC TV series Laid, both stories revolve around women in a heightened state of vulnerability. In the hands of director Trent O’Donnell, who recently helmed Stan’s boffo cop/crime comedy No Activity, story situations may be prosaic and even Seinfeldian (ie finding a carpark or investigating a knockoff pram) but carry dramatic weight, largely because they concern the welfare of a child. Originally conceived as a pilot for ABC’s Comedy Showroom initiative, and now co-produced by Netflix (which will stream the series globally outside Australia), The Letdown vividly captures the twilight zone period of new parenthood, where life feels Kafkaesque, and a baby-less past, while recent, feels like a totally separate plain of existence, never to return. Bell steers (and steals) the show as new mother Audrey Holloway, who begins attending a parents group moderated by an unsympathetic maternal health nurse (Noni Hazlehurst). Audrey craves the usual things: hits of caffeine; a glass of champagne, a rejuvenated social and sex life, the return of some semblance of normality. Jeremy (Duncan Fellows) is her longtime partner who feels helpless around their baby, Stevie. The structure of the series is a little higgledy-piggledy, the writers seemingly uncertain whether episodes should be themed (having a social life in the first, for example, or accommodating in-laws in the second) or focused on other members of the parents’ group. The protagonist is such a strong, fully-formed character, played bullishly and yet endearingly by Bell, that the focus naturally reverts, as if by gravitational pull, back to her. We enter the world of The Letdown implicitly understanding that we are meeting this character at a very particular time in her life, synonymous with things that might otherwise be exacerbated over the course of a narrative: sleep deprivation; being on the verge of physical and mental collapse; relationship issues; humiliation in various, seemingly infinite ways. The comedy often involves taking an event or concept hooked to the parental experience then lampooning its place in a wider context, ie via misunderstanding. At a dinner out with friends, Audrey, who has Stevie with her, argues with a mate (Gareth Davies) about the number of glasses of champagne there should be on the table. He says four, not five, which she interprets as insisting she shouldn’t drink while breastfeeding. Audrey cuts off his counter-protests midsentence, forcing him to suddenly exclaim that he just got out of rehab and doesn’t want to fall off the wagon. Or there is the first scene in the first episode: a very funny exchange between Audrey, trying to sleep in her car, and a local drug dealer (Patrick Brammall) who objects to her parking in his place of business. He insists on her buying something, even if that means paying for him to help roll the car forward (the going price: $20). It is one of those scenes so compact and effective, and so instantly amusing, it seems to have “viral” written all over it. The first three episodes (which form the extent of this review) don’t even attempt to maintain that kind of cracking tempo. On the upside, there is space for the characters to breathe and grow, and more time for the drama to resonate. A little too much, in fact: tighter stories, with sharper intersecting plotlines would have given The Letdown a snappier rhythm. When the comedy is a little lacking, however, the drama has its back – and vice versa. The result overall is slight, but utterly endearing. • The Letdown is on ABC TV on Wednesdays at 9.34pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/24/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-ex-assistant-breaks-nda-to-speak-of-alleged-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T10:35:08Z","webTitle":"Weinstein ex-aide breaks confidentiality agreement over alleged harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/24/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-ex-assistant-breaks-nda-to-speak-of-alleged-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/24/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-ex-assistant-breaks-nda-to-speak-of-alleged-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Weinstein ex-aide breaks confidentiality agreement over alleged harassment","bodyText":"A British former assistant to Harvey Weinstein has said she has broken a confidential agreement to speak out about alleged sexual harassment by the disgraced Hollywood producer. Zelda Perkins said in an interview with the Financial Times that she was breaking the non-disclosure agreement (NDA), said to have been made in October 1998, to shine a light on the workings of the secretive legal arrangement. NDAs have come under increased scrutiny after allegations made against not just Weinstein but also Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News, and others. In Perkins’ case, she was said to have shared a £250,000 settlement with another woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein. Perkins, who has waived her right to anonymity, alleged that Weinstein repeatedly sexually harassed her when she worked for Miramax in London, starting when he asked her to massage him while he was in his underwear. “I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement,” she told the FT, running the risk of legal action against her. “Unless somebody does this there won’t be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under.” Among the clauses designed to curtail her future behaviour were directions on what to do if she were asked to provide testimony. One stated that if “any criminal legal process” involving Weinstein or Miramax required her to give evidence, she would give 48 hours’ notice to Mark Mansell, a lawyer at Allen &amp; Overy, “before making any disclosure”. She told the newspaper that she endured days of questioning at Allen &amp; Overy’s London office to draw up the NDA, finishing with a 12-hour session in front of Weinstein’s lawyers. “I was pretty broken after the negotiation process,” she said. “I want to call into question the legitimacy of agreements where the inequality of power is so stark and relies on money rather than morality.” Perkins, who now works for the Robert Fox theatre production company, claimed that her first experience of harassment was when Weinstein asked her to massage him while he was wearing just his underwear, which she declined to do. “But this was his behaviour on every occasion I was alone with him,” she said. “I often had to wake him up in the hotel in the mornings and he would try to pull me into bed.” Weinstein, who denies allegations of non-consensual sex, has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by dozens of women. The 65-year-old is the subject of criminal investigations in the UK, Los Angeles and New York, as well as a civil rights investigation in the US state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/dissident-coalition-mps-push-for-earlier-end-to-renewable-energy-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T07:33:49Z","webTitle":"Dissident Coalition MPs push for earlier end to renewable energy subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/dissident-coalition-mps-push-for-earlier-end-to-renewable-energy-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/dissident-coalition-mps-push-for-earlier-end-to-renewable-energy-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Dissident Coalition MPs push for earlier end to renewable energy subsidies","bodyText":"Dissident government MPs, including the former prime minister Tony Abbott, are continuing to stir the pot on energy despite last week’s party room sign off on the new national energy guarantee. The chairman of the backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly, used Tuesday’s party room meeting to argue the government should cut off support to some renewable energy investments in 2020, rather than the current plan, which is to run down the scheme until 2030. Kelly was backed in his view by the former resources minister and now Queensland backbencher Matt Canavan and by Abbott who, according to accounts of the exchange, said the government needed to be prepared have a fight with political opponents about subsidies for renewables. The three MPs argued that people who entered the renewable energy scheme when John Howard set up the mandatory renewable energy target in the early 2000s only had an expectation the scheme would continue until 2020. The Rudd government later extended the scheme out to 2030. Kelly is understood to have argued on Tuesday that projects in the scheme before Labor extended it for another decade in 2010 should be subject to the Howard era rules and not be given support after 2020. But the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, rebuffed the push, telling the meeting changing the rules would trigger sovereign risk issues. He said the policy change the three were seeking would never get through the current Senate. In response to that comment, Canavan is said to have told Frydenberg that pre-2010 investments continuing through to 2030 were little more than windfall profits and Abbott told colleagues the Coalition needed to be prepared to have a fight and stare down Senate opposition. Turnbull pushed through internal opposition and secured party room support for the national energy guarantee policy last week but the continuing rumbles suggest opponents will continue to argue the toss as various components of the policy come back before the government for consideration. The government needs the support of the states to implement the new policy and it will also need to legislate an emissions reduction trajectory for the electricity sector. The dissent over energy came as the former federal Labor environment minister and Midnight Oil frontman Peter Garrett used a speech to the National Press Club to criticise the Queensland Labor government and the Turnbull government for their support of the controversial Adani project. With Queensland on the brink of a state election, and Adani a sensitive subject among Labor MPs in Canberra, Garrett used a visit to the national capital to argue good environmental stewardship meant no more new coalmines and it meant a “drastic” reduction in carbon emissions. He said Australia’s emissions reduction target for the Paris climate agreement was “grossly inadequate and will lead to 3 degrees or 4 degrees of warming”. “This is a temperature rise that will destroy all the world’s coral reefs,” Garrett said. “Good stewardship means no more new coalmines, because the carbon budget is spent.” Garrett said the UK government had committed to stop burning coal by 2025 and “good stewardship” meant phasing out coal-fired power stations by the early 2030s. He said Australia had to pursue a switch to renewables and an orderly transition in coal mining regions. He said Adani proceeding would be “a nightmare scenario for the world’s coral reefs and oceans” and he criticised both the Coalition in Canberra and Labor colleagues in Queensland for remaining “in thrall to Adani”. “Unfortunately, premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has lined up with the prime minister, both flying over to India to shake hands with Adani’s leader,” Garrett said. “This is all about being seen to support jobs in North Queensland. “The Queensland government’s first priority should be protecting the future of the existing 64,000 jobs dependent on healthy reef, most of them in regional Queensland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/24/di-natale-tells-acoss-conference-unions-should-be-politically-independent","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T08:14:52Z","webTitle":"Di Natale tells Acoss conference unions should be politically independent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/di-natale-tells-acoss-conference-unions-should-be-politically-independent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/di-natale-tells-acoss-conference-unions-should-be-politically-independent","fields":{"headline":"Di Natale tells Acoss conference unions should be politically independent","bodyText":"Richard Di Natale has criticised the union movement for “robocalling constituents” and said unions were strongest when they were independent of “one side of politics or another”. The comments were made at the end of a speech at the Australian Council of Social Services conference in Melbourne on Tuesday. Asked how he saw the union movement surviving in the future, the Greens leader said unions functioned best when they were “independent.” “It’s not for me to outline a future for the union movement except to say I think the union movement is strongest when it’s independent, making decisions that are in the interests of people and not in the interests of one side of politics or the other,” Di Natale said. “Some people will argue against that but I have always believed that the union movement is strongest when it is organising, collectively, to advance the interests of workers, and I don’t think that dedicating resources to robocalling constituents actually does much to advance that.” The 2017 Acoss conference is themed around a vision of Australia in 2030, which Di Natale said would see a country that had begun to dismantle its current political system in order to better address the challenges posed by growing inequality and climate change. “We’re not going to be able to tackle climate change, tackle inequality, unless we start to dismantle the model that we have right now, neoliberal capitalism, and to really confront the assumptions that are built into it,” he said. Di Natale said the assumption that environmental concerns must always come at a personal cost to people should be debunked, particularly around renewable power generation. “They’re heading in the same direction,” he said. “People are putting solar panels on their roofs, not because they want to help the environment – although that is often a fringe benefit – but ... because it brings the power prices down.” He also addresed the need for greater diversity in parliament, saying he was proud disability advocate Jordon Steele-John was set to replace the WA senator Scott Ludlam in parliament, after Ludlam quit during the dual citizenship saga that also claimed Queensland senator Larissa Waters. “We lost Scott and Larissa earlier this year but we’re going to see such an impressive young man, a young man living with cerebral palsy, who’s going to come into parliament to replace Scott soon,” he said. “And I tell you what, I can’t wait until I hear the sound of those saws and hammers in the Senate chamber because they have to install disability ramps.” The Acoss conference will run for two days and issued speaking invitations to all three major political parties. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, will address the conference on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, the economist Saul Eslake warned of a looming crisis in retiree incomes as a greater proportion of people enter retirement either with a mortgage or living in rented accommodation. “It’s a longstanding assumption of Australia’s retirement income system that the vast majority of retirees will have close to zero housing costs, either because they own their own homes outright, as historically more than 80% of retirees have done, or if they don’t then they will be accommodated in social or community housing where rents are fixed as a proportion of their relatively low income,” Eslake said. “That assumption has in turn allowed Australia to spend less on aged pensions than other countries with similar standards of living.” Eslake said the next 15 years would see a continued decline in home ownership, combined with a projected increase in the number of people who still owe money on their mortgage. “It will be rational for them to use what superannuation they have to pay off their mortgage, thus defeating the whole point of the tax-supported superannuation system.” Eslake said tax reforms that make the property market less attractive to investors, such as removing negative gearing and winding back the capital gains discount, would allow more first home owners into the market and reduce pressure on rental accommodation. He also advocated for removing the principal residence exemption from the pension assets test to encourage “more sensible use of land and discouraging overconsumption of owner-occupied housing by people in the final years of their life”. Eslake said intergenerational inequality was one of the biggest issues facing Australia and was driven in large part by declining home ownership among people under the age of 55. According to the 2016 census, rates of home ownership have declined to 65.5%, lower than any time since the census began in 1954. Since 1991, the rate of home ownership among households of people aged 25-34 has fallen 11 percentage points, while home ownership among households aged 35-44 has fallen 10 percentage points and home ownership among households of people aged 45-54 has fallen 9 percentage points."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/23/new-abuse-allegations-against-r-kelly-as-dj-describes-two-year-ordeal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T01:03:31Z","webTitle":"New abuse allegations against R Kelly as DJ describes two-year ordeal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/23/new-abuse-allegations-against-r-kelly-as-dj-describes-two-year-ordeal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/23/new-abuse-allegations-against-r-kelly-as-dj-describes-two-year-ordeal","fields":{"headline":"New abuse allegations against R Kelly as DJ describes two-year ordeal","bodyText":"A former radio host has alleged that R Kelly physically and mentally abused her, while controlling all elements of her life, from her clothing to when she was allowed to use the toilet. In an extensive interview in Rolling Stone, Kitti Jones alleges that for a two-year period after the pair met at a concert in her hometown of Dallas, Kelly conducted an abusive and controlling relationship with the DJ. Kelly – born Robert Kelly – categorically denies all the allegations. After meeting Kelly at the concert in 2011, Jones agreed to meet him again at the next leg of his tour. When they met in a hotel room, Jones says Kelly exposed himself and – without acknowledging her presence – began masturbating in front of her. “I’m thinking we’re going to hug or peck each other. But he plopped down on the couch and pulled out his penis and started pleasuring himself,” she told the magazine. Jones put the incident down to Kelly having “weird ways of getting off” and continued the relationship, eventually relocating to Chicago and moving in to the singer’s apartment. Before the move, Kelly cautioned her about his relationships with other women and described them as people he had “raised”. “He said, ‘I have friends and I have girls I’ve raised,’” Jones said. “I didn’t know what he meant by ‘raised’ at the time. He said, ‘I eventually want you to meet them, but I want to make sure you’re mentally ready for that.’” At that point, Jones claims, Kelly began attempting to control minute aspects of her life – including requesting that she text him to ask to go to the bathroom – and she had to “stand up and greet daddy” every time he was in her presence. Jones confronted Kelly on the phone about accusations of child abuse images, which surfaced in February 2002 and saw the singer indicted on multiple charges – he was found not guilty on 14 counts. When Jones later met Kelly at the airport, she says, the singer became violent and turned into a “monster”, slapping her repeatedly. “I was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry,” Jones says. “He would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don’t ever get in his business.” Jones says the abuse continued but calmed down when Kelly took her on the 2012 Single Ladies Tour, where he featured Jones in a part of the show in which she appeared chained to a white cage as Kelly simulated oral sex on her. “I think he knew leading up to the tour that I was just over it,” she said. “He knew that I was holding all these secrets that I had learned being in the inner circle and that I could probably be the one to nail him. So him taking me on that tour was like, ‘Let me make sure I treat this one a certain way.’” Jones says that after Kelly moved to New York, she was made to live with two other girlfriends who were punished for attempting to leave his apartment – with constant monitoring and instructions that Kelly’s male staff were not to interact with them. Jones says she eventually left in 2013 and that Kelly initially didn’t react badly to her move, but the next time they met, she alleges that he attacked her. Jones’s allegations follow a report earlier this year in which five women spoke about similar controlling behaviour and abuse by the singer, who has denied both their account and Jones’s. After Kelly was acquitted of the child abuse image charges, he settled out of court following other accusations of underage sex, and allegedly had an illegal marriage to his fellow R&amp;B star Aaliyah when she was 15. The 50-year-old Kelly is one of the most successful R&amp;B artists of all time, with tens of millions of album sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/new-zealand-kingmaker-winston-peters-deputy-prime-minister-foreign","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T04:05:58Z","webTitle":"New Zealand Labour signs coalition deal and makes Winston Peters deputy PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/new-zealand-kingmaker-winston-peters-deputy-prime-minister-foreign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/24/new-zealand-kingmaker-winston-peters-deputy-prime-minister-foreign","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand Labour signs coalition deal and makes Winston Peters deputy PM","bodyText":"New Zealand First and the Labour party have formally signed a coalition agreement, introducing a slew of new policies focusing on climate change, regional development and poverty. On Tuesday, prime minister elect Jacinda Ardern and NZ First leader Winston Peters – who will serve as deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in the new government – signed a commitment in Wellington, pledging to making sure all New Zealanders share in the country’s economic prosperity, which “must” go hand-in hand with environmental responsibility. Other major commitments include banning foreign buyers from purchasing existing New Zealand homes, reducing immigration by up to 30,000 people a year and reviewing and reforming the Reserve Bank Act. Speaking after the deal was signed, Arden said: “As a priority, we will restore funding to the health system to allow access for all, ensure all Kiwis can live in warm, dry homes, take action on child poverty and homelessness, crack down on foreign speculators, clean our rivers, and strengthen efforts to tackle climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy. “We will focus on sustainable economic development, supporting our regional economies, increasing exports, lifting wages and reducing inequality.” The deal includes NZ$1bn (£0.53bn) in funding for regional development and a commitment to plant one million trees a year. Other policies agreed include increasing the minimum wage to NZ$20 an hour by 2020, re-entering the Pike River mine, increasing funding for the department of conservation and establishing a climate commission. New Zealand First will have four cabinet positions in the new government and one under-secretary role, with portfolios to include defence, infrastructure, regional development, children, seniors and internal affairs. As deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, Peters will be taking on roles he has held in previous governments. From 1996 to 1998 he served as deputy prime minister under a National-led government, and in 2005-2008 he was foreign affairs minister in Helen Clark’s Labour-led government. Ardern is scheduled to be officially sworn in on Thursday, making her New Zealand’s third female prime minister and, at 37, the country’s youngest leader in 150 years. The Green party also signed a confidence and supply agreement with Labour on Tuesday and confirmed four of its MPs have roles in government – but not in the cabinet – working on key campaign areas such as climate change, conservation and women. Deals agreed between the Greens and Labour include making New Zealand a net zero emissions economy by 2050, a substantial investment in alternative transport options such as walking paths and cycleways, overhauling the welfare system and committing to protecting New Zealand’s 3,000 threatened plant and wildlife species. Last week Peters, whose New Zealand First party won nine seats in September’s general election, said he would form a coalition government with Labour, after weeks of negotiations that saw incumbent Bill English’s National party, which has the largest number of MPs, leave empty-handed. English confirmed on Tuesday he would remain in charge of the National party, despite losing a general election for the second time as leader. On Monday, US president Donald Trump called Ardern at her home in Auckland to offer his congratulations. A White House press release said the phone call had reaffirmed the two countries’ close ties. “The two leaders underscored the importance of the bilateral partnership between the United States and New Zealand and pledged to continue close cooperation on the many priorities the two countries share,” the statement read. But newspaper USA Today has raised eyebrows in New Zealand by declaring Ardern a “Trump-like leader”, because of her planned cuts to immigration, naming her in a list alongside the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and Andrej Babiš, next prime minister of the Czech Republic. “Call them the political offspring of President Trump if you like,” the article said. “Wealthy, controversial, outspoken and skilled at delivering electoral upsets and victories by appealing to voters’ nativist instincts.” Last month the Wall Street Journal also compared Ardern to Trump in a tweet Ardern slammed as “offensive”. “Meet New Zealand’s Justin Trudeau – except she’s more like Trump on immigration,” the WSJ’s tweet read. On Tuesday morning Ardern spoke with Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister. She has also received calls from the British and Australian prime ministers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/24/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-to-have-australian-premiere-in-2019","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T00:20:47Z","webTitle":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to have Australian premiere in 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/24/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-to-have-australian-premiere-in-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/24/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-to-have-australian-premiere-in-2019","fields":{"headline":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to have Australian premiere in 2019","bodyText":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the award-winning play and final instalment of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series, is coming to Australia. The play will be staged exclusively at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre in early 2019, with details of ticket sales and performance dates yet to be released. Set 19 years after the last Harry Potter book, 2007’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the script adaption of the Cursed Child smashed sales records after its release in 2016. The script, written by Jack Thorne and based on a story by Rowling, Thorne and John Tiffany, sold more than 680,000 print copies in the UK in three days and 2m copies in two days in the US. In Australia, it became the fastest selling book of 2016, shifting 170,000 copies in three days. The show’s London run sparked a similar frenzy, selling a record-breaking 175,000 tickets in 24 hours, on its way to becoming the most decorated play in the history of the British Olivier awards. Tickets, especially to the show’s eight-week preview period, were sold out and hotly contested. Third-party resale sites offered seats for as much as £2,950 within hours of a general release. The two-part play, which will premiere in the US in April, runs for five hours and follows an adult Harry Potter and his wife, Ginny Weasley, as their youngest son, Albus Severus, begins at Hogwarts. In Australia the Michael Cassel-produced play will be directed by the original West End director, John Tiffany, with music by Imogen Heap and Australian casting by Melbourne Theatre Company’s serendipitously named casting director, Janine Snape. In an announcement video, Tiffany said he would arrive in Australia in early 2018 to start the audition process. Series creator JK Rowling added that she was “very excited about coming to Australia with Cursed Child”. “I’ve never been to Australia in my life,” she said. “Maybe at last I’ll get there down under.” Reviews for the play have been generally positive, with the Guardian’s Michael Billington awarding it four stars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/oct/24/women-do-most-of-the-housework-and-other-surprising-census-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T00:23:56Z","webTitle":"Women do most of the housework and other surprising census figures | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/24/women-do-most-of-the-housework-and-other-surprising-census-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/24/women-do-most-of-the-housework-and-other-surprising-census-figures","fields":{"headline":"Women do most of the housework and other surprising census figures","bodyText":"The latest release of data from the 2016 census reveals the ageing population has seen a shift in the makeup of our workforce with more people employed as community and personal service workers than ever before. The census data also confirms previous data suggesting that the cutting of interest rates has made servicing a mortgage easier over the past five year. But while the shift in work has seen an increase in carers and domestic cleaners, the census also reveals that women continue to the do bulk of the housework. It will probably not come as a shock to anyone that the electorate with the highest median mortgage is that held by our prime minister. The latest batch of census data released yesterday revealed than in 2016, the median monthly mortgage in the seat of Wentworth was $3,000 – some $30 a month higher than the second most expensive electorate to have a mortgage – that of Warringah, held by the previous prime minister Tony Abbott. The census data however reveals that while Warringah comes in second for highest mortgage payments, it comes in first on incomes, with the highest median household income in the land of $2,384 a week (or $123,968 a year). But don’t feel too bad for the good voters of Wentworth – they come in second on the household income scale with a median weekly income of $2,380. Both Sydney suburbs sit a long way above the poorest electorate by income – that of Hinkler in Queensland, which has a median household income of $946. But on this score, the figures can be misleading. Hinkler is not so much poor as it is old. The median age of Hinkler is 46, compared to the national median of 38. Similarly, the second poorest electorate by income is the mid NSW costal electorate of Lyne – it is even older, with a median age of 50. So when comparing incomes there always needs to be a bit of care. Only three non-Sydney electorates are in the top 15 most expensive – Julie Bishop’s seat of Curtin in Perth, Tim Wilson’s seat of Goldstein in Melbourne and Josh Frydenberg’s seat of Kooyong also in Melbourne. But an expensive mortgage does not necessarily mean high levels of mortgage stress – because generally a high median mortgage also means you live in an area with high median household incomes. Where it becomes tough is those areas where the mortgage prices are high, but the median income is not so. And for that, a good place to look is western Sydney. While in Wentworth the median monthly mortgage is equivalent to 31.5% of the median income, in the seat of Blaxland, the median mortgage payments take up 39.9% of the median household income – making it the toughest electorate in the nation to pay off a mortgage. When we exclude the electorates with high numbers of pensioners, we see western Sydney seats such Watson, Fowler and McMahon where the median mortgage payments are well above the national average of 30.5% of median household income. To find the place where it is easiest to service a mortgage you need to look to the national capital. The seats of Canberra and Fenner have the lowest ratio of median mortgage to median income. In the seat of Canberra, the median mortgage payment is worth just 24.7% of the median household income and in the northern Canberra seat of Fenner, it is just 25.2% – a consequence of both seats being in the top 35 for size of mortgages, but in the top 15 for size of household income: Map: mortgage payments as a percentage of household income Overall however the data shows that the size of mortgages payments relative to household income has fallen in the past years in all states, and in NSW, Victoria and Queensland it is even lower than it was in 2006: Given when the 2011 census was held the standard variable mortgage rate was 7.8%, and when it was held last year it was down to 5.25%, it is not a surprise that mortgages are easier to service – but such figures say nothing about the affordability of purchasing a home. The census data also reveals the impact of the ageing population. In the past 10 years, the biggest jump in the share of the population has come among those aged 65-74 years – going from 6.9% in 2006 to 8.9% in 2016: The increase in the share of retirees has also seen a shift in the type of work being done – with the healthcare and social assistance industry seeing an increase of 183,382 jobs in the five years from 2011 to 2016 – nearly 30% of all new employed: This flows through into the growth of occupations. Easily the fastest growing occupation is community and personal service workers: This includes jobs such as child care and aged care, which the ABS has found were among the three occupations with the biggest increase in workers. The ABS also notes that from 2006 to 2016 there was a 130% increase in people working as domestic cleaners. This will no doubt be a relief to many women given the census data reveals that yet again it is women who do most of the unpaid domestic work. Nearly 27% of all women do more than 15 hours of unpaid domestic work compared to just 8% of men: Now of course this would not be too surprising given more men work full-time than do women. But the census data helpfully gives us the breakdown of hours of unpaid domestic work done by people according to how many hours of paid work they also do. This allows us to compare men and women in like for like work situations. And men come out badly. Of the 1.7m women who work 35-40 hours a week, 19% also do more than 15 hours of unpaid domestic work, compared to just 8% of the 2.3m men. Rather embarrassingly for men nearly a quarter of them who work such hours do no domestic work at all compared to just 14% of the women: As for the domestic cleaners? They are one of the just 69 occupations out of 476 where women account for more than three quarters of those employed. Whether being paid or not, if someone is doing the cleaning around home, the good bet is it is being done by a woman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/25/empathy-virtual-reality-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Empathy – the latest gadget Silicon Valley wants to sell you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/25/empathy-virtual-reality-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-puerto-rico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/25/empathy-virtual-reality-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-puerto-rico","fields":{"headline":"Empathy – the latest gadget Silicon Valley wants to sell you","bodyText":"The other week, Mark Zuckerberg visited Puerto Rico without leaving California. He stood on the roof of Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park with a virtual reality (VR) headset strapped to his face, and immersed himself in a flooded street 3,000 miles away. Zuckerberg was livestreaming the event to promote Facebook Spaces, a “social” VR app. But it backfired, badly. Using a humanitarian crisis for a marketing stunt made many people angry. So did the tasteless incongruity of Zuckerberg’s grinning cartoon avatar set against a landscape of profound human suffering. When Zuckerberg apologized the next day, he clarified his intentions. “One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy,” he wrote. By cultivating empathy, VR “can raise awareness and help us see what’s happening in different parts of the world”. It would be easy to see this statement as a canned bit of damage control, as another in a long line of half-hearted mea culpas mass-produced by Silicon Valley publicists for their frequently offending bosses. But it’s worth taking Zuckerberg seriously. When he talks about empathy, he means it. Empathy is a word that suffuses the tech industry. The ability of an engineer or a designer to put themselves in someone else’s shoes is widely considered critical for creating a successful user experience. But with VR, empathy isn’t just a design value – it’s a sales strategy. Empathy is the cornerstone of the tech industry’s masterplan for mainstreaming VR. It’s the “killer app” that Silicon Valley hopes will transform VR from a fringe curiosity into a technology that’s as deeply embedded in our daily lives as smartphones and social media. VR enthusiasts often describe it as an “empathy machine”. By creating an immersive and interactive virtual environment, a VR headset can quite literally put you in someone else’s shoes. Text, image, or video offers only partial views of a person’s life – with VR, you can get inside their head. And this high-fidelity simulation, the argument goes, will make us better people by heightening our sensitivity to the suffering of others. It will make us “more compassionate”, “more connected”, and ultimately “more human”, in the words of the VR artist Chris Milk. Now, this isn’t necessarily true. There’s no reason to assume that a virtual rendering of real suffering will generate empathy. But, as Ainsley Sutherland explains in a recent piece for BuzzFeed, it’s a very useful idea for the tech industry. Tech needs the myth of the empathy machine for two related reasons: to enhance VR’s reputation, and to expand its audience. Violence and sex have long supplied VR with its most obvious use cases. It’s an excellent platform for gaming and porn. But these specific strengths actually damage VR’s chances of becoming a mass medium, since the technology risks becoming linked with somewhat embarrassing subcultures. Silicon Valley isn’t pouring billions of dollars into VR to give nerds a better way to play games and masturbate – and if those are the only activities that people associate with the technology, it’s dead on arrival. Empathy offers a more promising approach. Rather than marketing VR as a gaming rig or a sex toy, Silicon Valley can pitch it as a catalyst of deep interpersonal connection. It also suits Silicon Valley’s oft-expressed desire to make the world a better place. By lending you the eyes and ears of someone suffering in San Juan, tech helps you to develop a greater sense of responsibility for them. You feel compelled to act. This is connectivity not merely as a technical concept, but a moral one. Lately, however, this faith in connectivity has been harder to sustain. In recent months, the media and the general public has gradually awakened to the fact that using technology to connect people doesn’t automatically make the world a better place. In fact, it sometimes seems to make the world considerably worse. Trolls, racists, and fascists are using the connective capacities of Google and Facebook to inject their poisons into the body politic with alarming success. As a result, for the first time in its history, Silicon Valley is facing something of a backlash. VR offers a way to reset the narrative. At a moment when Silicon Valley sorely needs good press, both to burnish its public image and to forestall a possible regulatory response, the myth of the empathy machine has an important role to play. It helps rehabilitate the idea that connectivity produces socially beneficial outcomes, and that Silicon Valley is an essentially humanitarian enterprise. With VR, this humanitarianism can be quite explicit. Charities are already using the technology to coax dollars from prospective donors. At black-tie fundraisers in New York, attendees have used VR headsets to travel to destinations as distant as a Lebanese refugee camp and an Ethiopian village. And the United Nations has built its own VR app that teleports users to Syria, Liberia, Gaza and elsewhere, while encouraging them to donate money or time. VR philanthropy supplies the tech industry with valuable rhetorical ammunition. Companies can point to these initiatives, and partner with the organizations behind them, to boost the technology’s reputation – and their own. But the empathy machine isn’t just about driving better PR. It’s also about selling headsets – and Silicon Valley needs to sell lots of headsets. Zuckerberg recently said he wants to get one billion people into VR. This may sound impossibly ambitious, but it expresses something of the scale required to recoup Facebook’s enormous investment in the technology. Of course, VR philanthropy probably won’t become a popular pastime. It may appeal to certain users, but it’s unlikely to spark widescale adoption. Suffering might, however. Extreme situations are good ways to demonstrate the affective capacity of a medium. A Holocaust movie shows us the emotional power of cinema; a Facebook Live broadcast of the police murder of a black man shows us the emotional power of social video. These representations of pain, by eliciting an intense response from their viewers, teach people what a technology can do. If a medium can make you cry – as VR can, famously – it works. This isn’t to suggest that crying is all people will do in VR. The purpose of a killer app isn’t to exhaust a platform’s potential, but to offer an entrypoint into it. Once you get a critical mass of people using a technology, they figure out other things to do with it. But VR needs a gateway drug – and virtualized misery can perform that function. Imagine a VR live stream of a police killing. This, tragically, will soon cease to be science fiction: within years, you will be able to experience an extremely convincing simulation of what it’s like to be murdered by a cop. Will this lead to the cop’s conviction, or to meaningful criminal justice reform? Recent history suggests the answer is no. But the content will probably go viral, as its affective intensity generates high levels of user engagement. And this virality will generate revenue for the company that owns the platform. This is a far likelier future for VR than the mass moral awakening envisioned by evangelists of the empathy machine. It’s a world where VR enables us to consume ever more realistic depictions of human anguish, whose viral circulation enriches a few big companies. It’s a world where capitalism has found yet another way to monetize its waste – where the suffering that results from a society organized for profit becomes itself a source of profit, and pain is repurposed as a site of economic production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/23/dunford-niger-ambush-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T21:36:01Z","webTitle":"Joint chiefs of staff chair says key facts still missing in Niger ambush","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/23/dunford-niger-ambush-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/23/dunford-niger-ambush-questions","fields":{"headline":"Joint chiefs of staff chair says key facts still missing in Niger ambush","bodyText":"Three weeks after four US soldiers died in an ambush in the African nation of Niger, several key questions remain unanswered, America’s most senior military official said on Monday. The US Marine Corps Gen Joseph Dunford, the joint chiefs of staff chair, said several matters must still be resolved. They include whether the US had adequate intelligence and equipment for its operation, whether there was a planning failure and why it took so long to recover one the bodies. Dunford said the four US soldiers died after a battle that started on 4 October in a “complex situation”, leading to a “difficult firefight”. At a Pentagon news conference, he tried to outline what the military knew. He said a group of 12 American forces accompanied 30 Nigerien forces to an area about 85km north of the capital on 3 October. He said the mission was originally set based on an assessment that they were “unlikely” to come into conflict with any local forces. “They did not expect resistance on their particular patrol,” he said. But when they sought the next day to return, they encountered about 50 enemy fighters traveling by vehicle, carrying small arms and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Within an hour of taking fire, the team requested support. Within another hour, a remote plane flew above. Later, French jets arrived and ferried wounded Americans to safety. The bodies of three Americans killed in the fighting were transported out of the battle scene, but one – Sgt La David Johnson – wasn’t recovered until 6 October. Dunford said the US had had up to 800 military officials in Niger recently, the largest American force anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, training and supporting the Nigerien military in fighting insurgents. And US soldiers would continue assisting local forces despite the fatal ambush, he said. “Our intent is to continue operations there.” Independent of the military’s investigation, the Johnson family’s ordeal has become a major political dispute in the United States after Donald Trump credited himself with doing more to honor the dead and console families than any of his predecessors. Then, Johnson’s aunt said Trump had showed “disrespect” to the family as he telephoned to extend condolences. In an extraordinary White House briefing, John Kelly, the former marine general who is Trump’s chief of staff, shot back at Trump’s critics, and the president continued the criticism over the weekend. Members of Congress are demanding answers about the ambush in a remote corner of Niger, where few Americans travel. Last week, the Arizona senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the armed services committee, even threatened a subpoena to accelerate the flow of information from the administration. Dunford defended the broader American mission in Niger. He said US forces had been in the country intermittently for more than two decades. Currently, about 800 US service members are supporting a French-led mission to defeat Islamic State, al-Qaida and Boko Haram in west Africa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/23/espn-barstool-van-talk-cancelled-samantha-ponder","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T21:03:20Z","webTitle":"ESPN ends Barstool partnership after one show amid misogyny claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/23/espn-barstool-van-talk-cancelled-samantha-ponder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/23/espn-barstool-van-talk-cancelled-samantha-ponder","fields":{"headline":"ESPN ends Barstool partnership after one show amid misogyny claims","bodyText":"ESPN’s decision to partner with members of Barstool Sports, a publication known for its crude humour and sexist jokes, has ended almost before it began. The broadcaster teamed up with Dan “Big Cat” Katz and PFT Commenter, the hosts of the popular Pardon My Take podcast, to produce the Barstool Van Talk show. The first episode aired last week but on Monday, the ESPN president, John Skipper, said he had decided to cancel the series. “Effective immediately, I am cancelling Barstool Van Talk,” Skipper said in a statement. “While we had approval on the content of the show, I erred in assuming we could distance our efforts from the Barstool site and its content. Apart from this decision, we appreciate the efforts of Big Cat and PFT Commenter. They delivered the show they promised.” The show was already under a cloud even before it had aired. Last week, ESPN host Samantha Ponder sent a tweet drawing attention to abuse she had received from Barstool’s founder, Dave Portnoy. “Welcome to the ESPN family @BarstoolBigCat (&amp; welcome to all ur minions who will respond to this so kindly),” wrote Ponder, along with a screenshot from a 2014 Barstool blog telling the presenter to “fuck yourself” after she wrote about the Ray Rice domestic abuse scandal. Portnoy also called Ponder “a slut” and described her daughter as a “rat kid” in another broadcast. Katz and PFT Commenter, who has never revealed his real name, were not responsible for the slurs aimed at Ponder, and are on the milder end of the views presented on Barstool. However, there were reports that Ponder was not the only person at ESPN with concerns about the partnership. For their part, Katz and PFT Commenter expressed their disappointment at Skipper’s decision. “We had a great time working on the show and were extremely excited about the future,” the pair said in a statement on Twitter. “Thank you to all the Award Winning Listeners/Watchers for supporting us, and thank you to all the great people who worked alongside us at ESPN and Embassy Row. Although we are heartbroken, Pardon My Take will continue to get bigger and stronger every single day. Please subscribe to Pardon My Take, unsubscribe and resubscribe, and leave a 5-star review to help take some of the sting off this for us.” Portnoy later posted a video statement to Twitter in which he remained bullish over Barstool’s future. “You want to see why everyone says Barstool is gonna be the next ESPN?, Portnoy said. “It’s this: because we do things our way, for better or for worse, we’ll continue to do it and people who have been with us forever know we’re not sexist, we’re not chauvinistic, we’re not any of it. We make fun of everybody. “It sucks the show is off, but for the future and the confidence of this company, there is nothing ESPN actually could have done to illustrate why we are rising and why they are falling … For Barstool, we will move on and get stronger like we always do.” Barstool is immensely popular with young, mostly male, readers and listeners, and was valued at around $15m when an investment group bought a 51% stake in 2016. Earlier this month, journalist Elika Sadeghi turned down a job with the company after being asked to agree to a contact clause saying she should expect to be exposed to “offensive speech, sexual scenarios, suggestive gestures, and references to stereotypes” in the workplace. Portnoy said the clause was standard for a publication that deals in humour. “We’re not saying you can grope somebody, we’re not saying you can sexually harass somebody, we’re saying we’re gonna make jokes and you gotta be cool with it,” he said. ESPN has experienced a rocky time of late. In April it laid off about 100 employees, including some of the network’s most popular on-air and online personalities. This month the broadcaster suspended anchor Jemele Hill after her public criticism of two NFL owners’ directives over silent player protests during the national anthem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/24/eni-aluko-colin-kaepernick-england-womens-football-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T09:23:16Z","webTitle":"Eni Aluko and Colin Kaepernick are contrasting rebels with noble causes | Suzanne Wrack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/24/eni-aluko-colin-kaepernick-england-womens-football-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/24/eni-aluko-colin-kaepernick-england-womens-football-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Eni Aluko and Colin Kaepernick are contrasting rebels with noble causes","bodyText":"In the summer of 2016, during pre-season, the NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat alone on a bench during the national anthem before the San Francisco 49ers’ friendly against the Green Bay Packers. His action marked the beginning of a remarkable season of protest in the league, in which he knelt during the anthem for all 16 games, and triggered a movement that has continued into this season. Contrary to the hysterical criticism, this was not a protest against the anthem, the flag or the military but a chance to use a high-profile platform to say something about injustices within wider society. The videoed killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling by police in Minnesota and Louisiana respectively resulted in anger on the streets and Kaepernick took the conversation into the stadiums of the national sport. The backlash was vicious – from huge sections of the media, from fans, from sponsors, from team owners and from the president of the United States. The US trade union leader Nicholas Klein said in 1918: “First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.” For sports stars who speak up it could not be more apt. There is precedent for protesting during the anthem and being driven out of sport as a result, from John Carlos and Tommie Smith raising a fist at the 1968 Olympics to the NBA’s Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf sitting out the anthem on religious grounds. Others had joined the social outcry sweeping the country before Kaepernick’s knee. LeBron James and others donned hoodies after the killing of the unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and wore ‘I can’t breathe’ T-shirts in tribute to 43-year-old Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police. Five St Louis Rams (now the LA Rams) players walked out in the “hands up, don’t shoot” pose, following the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014. But how come a blog on women’s footballhas come this far with no mention of women or football? It is because, where the stance of Kaepernick and others shows one way to air grievances in modern sport, that of the Chelsea forward Eni Aluko shows another. Aluko did not protest. She did not seek the opportunity to bring her disquiet to the attention of the football authorities. She was asked to speak up when the Football Association approached her as an “iconic England player” to take part in its culture review. Yet she, like Kaepernick – who has to all intents been ostracised by NFL teams and filed a grievance accusing teams of collusion – has felt the consequences of her decision to be truthful. She has not played for England since making her complaints of racism as a part of that review, despite winning the 2016 golden boot. She has had her five-year career as a sports lawyer cut short by a conveniently timed conflict of interest investigation. And she has found herself on the end of a barrage of criticism. From the Times journalist Matthew Syed to the former England goalkeeper David James her accused was defended and her accusations of racism were belittled. The FA’s investigations into her allegations were exposed as, frankly, farcical at the Digital, Sport and Media Select Committee inquiry into football governance. On the morning of that inquiry the FA was forced into a humiliating formal apology after a hurried second investigation by Katharine Newton, prompted by the press and public pressure, found that Aluko and her club-mate Drew Spence had been the victims of racist comments from the then England manager Mark Sampson. Kaepernick and Aluko are not the first sports people to use their positions to try to instigate a conversation and better the situation for future players in their sports or society in general. The comparison of these two may seem odd. Whereas Aluko was raising issues of internal racism and alleged bullying (the FA said Newton found no evidence that Aluko was subjected to “a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct” by Sampson), Kaepernick was protesting against the regularity with which black people are being killed, primarily by police, in the US. But they are linked by choosing to act knowing it could affect their careers. And both cases say a lot about the lack of opportunities for athletes to raise criticism, internally or externally. Kaepernick took a knee knowing full well he would likely feel the wrath of NFL bosses and team owners. In contrast Aluko played by the FA’s rules and was still thrown under the bus. However, despite the barrage of abuse and the might of the sporting organisations pitted against them, both have won. Aluko may not pull on an England shirt again and Kaepernick may not find himself leading an NFL offense, but they have opened a discussion about what is considered acceptable within their sports, challenged players to be critical and presented a better image of what a modern sporting role model should be. The FA and NFL, without proper structures to support players who are critical-thinking, intelligent, vocal and political and without providing platforms for players to speak freely without fear of recriminations, have handed the spade to their gravedigger. The FA’s failed handling of the Aluko and Sampson affairs has irreparably damaged the organisation’s image. The NFL has provoked more and more players into joining the movement Kaepernick started, resulting in the formation of ‘Athletes for Impact’, as those protesting get organised. Wider society, on the whole, has embraced Aluko, Kaepernick and those who have followed them for their stances because they reflect voices and attitudes in society better than the organisations under whose umbrella they stand. They reflect the future of sport and sport governance. They are the kind of individuals who should replace the dinosaurs at the top of the FA grappling to save themselves from extinction and the NFL bosses feigning support for the protests they once decried in an attempt to neutralise them. Talking points • Following in the footsteps of the USA internationals Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd, six further women footballers have signed up to Juan Mata’s Common Goal initiative whereby players commit to donating at least 1% of their income to football-related charities. The biggest group to commit so far includes the campaign’s first African player, Jean Sseninde from Uganda, who plays for Crystal Palace, Arsenal’s USA international Heather O’Reilly, Manchester City’s Pauline Brewer, the Colombia international Nicole Regnier, PSG’s Vero Boquete and Olga García from Barcelona – the first Spanish players to sign up alongside Mata. • Chelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, has killed off speculation linking her to the England manager position by signing a new three-and-a-half-year contract with the Blues. Hayes joined the club in 2012 and has overseen the switch to full-time professionalism and, this season, the move to their new home in Kingsmeadow. Chelsea have made a perfect start to the WSL season with three wins and three clean sheets and have progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League having fought past Bayern Munich. • Sky Blue FC’s NWSL record-breaking goalscorer Sam Kerr has been named the season’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). The Australian forward scored 17 goals, breaking the 16-goal record of Scotland’s Kim Little in 2014. • Iceland dealt the biggest shock of the World Cup qualifying games last week when they won 3-2 in Germany. The team ranked 21 in the world handed the football powerhouse a first World Cup qualifying defeat since 17 June 1998. • After the failure of the Danish FA and players to end their dispute over pay, resulting in the cancellation of a World Cup qualifying match against Sweden, the Swedish FA has rejected moves from Denmark to rearrange the fixture. However, going against their association, Sweden’s Magalena Eriksson and Hedvig Lindahl have taken to Twitter to express their solidarity with their counterparts. Eriksson tweeted: “Hi @UEFA ! I am willing to reschedule fridays #WCQagainst Denmark. The danish players have been punished enough already. #unity” Lindahl wrote: “To @UEFA : If you are yet to decide what will happen to the Danish players with regards to the #WCQ, I am willing to reschedule the game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/06/donald-trump-tweets-predictions","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-06T05:17:16Z","webTitle":"Trumpadamus: how the president's tweets have predicted his own future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/donald-trump-tweets-predictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/donald-trump-tweets-predictions","fields":{"headline":"Trumpadamus: how the president's tweets have predicted his own future","bodyText":"Donald Trump might be proving an ineffective president – see the last nine months – and by many accounts he wasn’t a great businessman – see the four bankruptcies – but one area where he has excelled is in predicting the future. The commander-in-chief’s ability to forecast upcoming events was illustrated this month, when the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was reported to have called Trump a “fucking moron”. Trump had foretold this in 2014, when he posted a cartoon on Twitter whch showed the founding fathers wondering if they needed a constitutional provision in case “the people elect a fucking moron”. It was uncanny. But it wasn’t the first time Trump had used Twitter to correctly foretell the future. Across a range of topics, the president has proved to be quite the clairvoyant. Foreign relations Trump was right – Kim Jong-un’s recent testing of nuclear weapons showed there was a need for caution. In office, however, he has been less than careful with his treatment of Kim. And the president has been the one making the “blatant threats”. Sea life Whatever the reason for Trump’s aversion to sharks, he was correct about their longevity. In August 2016 Danish researchers found that the Greenland shark may live for more than 400 years – much longer than previously thought. Elephants It turned out Trump was not alone in missing the elephants. Ringling Bros shut down on 21 May 2017, following a slump in ticket sales. Presidential impact Given the accuracy of his other prophesies, it seems likely that this was Trump predicting his first year in office. In hindsight the words “not totally, yet” now seem particularly ominous. Laughter Whether it is laughing or despairing, the way the world perceives the US has changed for the worse since Trump was elected. A Pew survey of 37 countries found that, on average, just 22% of people had “confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to foreign affairs”. Under Obama, that figure was 64%. Overall favorable views of the US have also dropped – 64% saw the country favorably at the end of Obama’s presidency, compared with just 49% under Trump. Putin perception Putin is certainly looking very smart right now, after the US intelligence community concluded Russia managed to surreptitiously interfere in the 2016 election in a bid to skew the vote in Trump’s favor. And Trump, our president, made Putin look even smarter when he subsequently fired the FBI director, James Comey, the man investigating connections between Putin’s Russia and the Trump campaign, a move which plunged the US government into chaos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/24/ten-scandals-since-2010-britain-loony-right-tory-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Ten scandals since 2010 that show Britain is ruled by the loony right | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/24/ten-scandals-since-2010-britain-loony-right-tory-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/24/ten-scandals-since-2010-britain-loony-right-tory-party","fields":{"headline":"Ten scandals since 2010 that show Britain is ruled by the loony right","bodyText":"This is what bad government looks like. Do civil servants ever dare stop it, and who is ever held to account? Evidence-free policy-making by rightwing ideologues has been the history of this government since 2010. However often the right raises scares about the “loony left”, nothing Labour proposes begins to compare with what the loony right has actually done. The list of recklessly extravagant ideological policy disasters grows – even forgetting Brexit. Labour is now the sensible party of practical policy-making, while the Tories are the evidence-free fanatics. Let’s start in Oldham. A UTC – university technical college – opened there in 2014, with a purple building, places for 600 pupils aged 14-19, and a venture capitalist as chair. After spending a stupendous £14m, the school closed in August: it attracted only 127 pupils and not one of them gained an A*-C grade in English or maths at GCSE. Meanwhile, £18m was cut from the rest of Oldham’s schools, which lost 100 teachers and £480 per pupil. Oldham’s Collective Spirit free school also closed this summer, ejecting its 210 pupils after what the local MP, Jim McMahon, said was the worst Ofsted report he’d seen. “I am sick of Oldham being the test bed for the next big idea, when at the same time basic educational needs are being cut to the bone.” No minister should be blamed for trying a new idea: how to give technical education status is a serious problem. But why roll out experiments far and wide on a whim before testing them? Far from being disqualified, the former education secretary Michael Gove is back in government, eager to try new ideas on the environment department. At least 62 free schools, UTCs and studio schools have failed, at a cost of £138.5m. But undaunted, the government has pledged another 500 free schools by 2020. Some succeed, but consider the sheer extravagance of opening schools in the midst of austerity, whether places are needed or not. And consider another astonishing scandal, revealed by the Observer this week: the collapse of Wakefield City Academies Trust, accused of “asset-stripping” funds from its 21 schools. The ideology driving all this was “freedom” from everything – from local councils, democratic accountability, regulation, even basic financial scrutiny and due diligence with public money. The National Audit Office has been strongly critical. But frankly, who cares? That’s just education. Look around, and see the same story across Whitehall. Remember what Andrew Lansley did after he was let loose on the NHS in 2010. He threw in a grenade of re-disorganisation that wasted billions – billions that will never be fully counted. Ever since, the head of NHS England has struggled to stitch back together its blasted fragments, as hosts of acronyms and new brass plates come and go. As communities secretary, Eric Pickles set to work wrecking local authorities, even dismantling the Audit Commission – which Margaret Thatcher had devised to monitor and improve councils. Under this government the Department for Communities and Local Government has overseen the biggest drop yet in housebuilding, social or private. However, it did oversee the £10bn help-to-buy scheme: Morgan Stanley reports it inflated house prices by exactly the same sum, gifting most of the gains to housebuilders. Even the Adam Smith Institute called it “petrol on to a bonfire”. But so what? The chancellor is about to do it again with another £10bn – because politically and ideologically it appeals to better-off first-time buyers of homes up to £600,000, even if it makes property still less affordable for most. In welfare to work, this government put all its trust in private companies, which Margaret Hodge’s public accounts committee found to have squandered a fortune to no particular effect, other that enriching those companies. What of the Learndirect disaster? Privatised by David Cameron in 2011, it was taken over by private equity and suffered a damning Ofsted report on its apprenticeship programmes. The Institute for Public Policy Research reported that the company received £631m of public money. A Financial Times/FE Week investigation found that after it was sold off, its parent company spent 84% of its cash generated by the operating business (most of which came from the taxpayer) on managers and financiers, with many apprentices not receiving their entitlement for training. But another multimillion-pound bung will see it through to next year. The National Audit Office is investigating. Or look at the east coast mainline railway line: handed back to the public sector by a failed franchisee, it made a tidy profit for the taxpayer. But that was too ideologically embarrassing, so the government sold it. Now Stagecoach, its present franchisee, grumbles that it can’t make enough – upsetting the government’s conviction that private enterprise trumps public management. Universal credit was another big idea – a good paradigm of this government’s mismanagement of just about everything. From the start Iain Duncan Smith was never open about its intent or effect: for all his promise of its strong work incentives, the taper rate was always going to see claimants lose 63p from every extra pound they earned. (If 63p were a top tax rate, they would call it an outrageous disincentive to hard work.) The six-week payment delay for this new benefit may be cut to four, but that still leaves those without savings debt-ridden and trapped in rent arrears, as the new Smith Institute report from the London boroughs Southwark and Croydon proves. At vast cost, what started as a minor administrative improvement leaves all families that are moving on to universal credit heavily out of pocket, many of them forced to rely on food banks. Seven years after it was conceived, the system is worse, not better. Governments make errors – none worse than Tony Blair’s Iraq war. Labour blundered on the private finance initiative and early implementation of tax credits. It wasted effort on minor value-for-money public service “reforms”. But if you hear anyone raising fears of loony-left policies, just point them to the unravelling privatisations of the Thatcher era – and to all these post-2010 failures, imposed out of pure ideology. Philip Hammond asked the cabinet for some “big new ideas” for his budget. Please, no more. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 27 October 2017. An earlier version referred to Learndirect’s parent firm’s income, when cash generated by the operating business was meant. An earlier version also said that many apprentices received no training.

That was just the government benches as the prime minister came to the Commons to make a statement on last week’s EU council. This now-ritual update on the continued lack of progress in the Brexit negotiations has become as painful for the Conservative party as it has for the prime minister. Theresa May dragged herself to her feet and tried to pretend that what had been uppermost in her mind in Brussels had been the situation in Turkey and the Iran nuclear deal. Almost as an afterthought she got on to Brexit. Her Florence speech had been wonderful. And it wasn’t just her that was saying that; it was also a couple of people in her cabinet. She wanted a deep and special relationship with the EU. So deep and so special that she said it three times. So deep and so special it might end up as barely a relationship at all. “I am positive,” she concluded in a voice that bordered on the deep and special catatonic. Jeremy Corbyn shrugged. If it was OK for the prime minister to give the same non-statement she had given on several previous occasions, it was OK for him to give the same Groundhog Day reply. The talks were at an impasse because the cabinet couldn’t even agree among itself what kind of deal it wanted. It was time for the Tories to put their squabbling behind them and to prioritise the needs of British business. He has said this so often now that no one finds it the slightest bit bizarre that the Labour leader now claims to be voice of business. Strange times. “What I set out to the EU was what I set out in my Florence speech,” said Theresa. The moment she goes off script, all her syntactical operations slide into the most basic of operating codes. About all she can manage is to repeat the things she has already repeated. On the grounds that if she has said something twice it is more likely to be true if she says it three times. There was definitely momentum because some progress had been made towards progressing the progression of the talks. But let her be absolutely clear about something about which she was absolutely clear. If no final deal had been reached by this time next year then there would be no transitional deal. Because sometimes what business really needed was the certainty that it would be out of business. Far better to know you are going to be bankrupt and 100% British than risk the prospect of not being broke with traces of the EU. While the Labour benches opened and closed their mouths in amazement at the prime minister’s cavalier approach to the economy, the Conservative benches just used the rest of the session to bicker among themselves. All pretence that there is any agreement over Brexit has long gone. Ken Clarke suggested the prime minister might be better off jettisoning half the cabinet and forming a national coalition with the opposition benches instead and Anna Soubry – trying and failing to keep the condescension out of her voice as she commended Theresa for the progress she had made – begged her to rule out a no deal. This was too much for John Redwood who urged Theresa to move straight to World Trade Organisation rules now. It hasn’t yet dawned on some Tories that there’s a very good reason why there is not one country in the entire world that has chosen to trade on WTO rules alone. Dozens of deranged Brexiters roared their approval at Britain becoming worse off than Mongolia and Mauritania. As the divisions in her party widened by the minute, the Maybot became ever less functional. Realising his leader was running on empty, Bernard Jenkin gallantly came to the rescue. Some people in the EU might think she was really weak and useless, he said. But he didn’t think she was as weak and as useless as all that. She was just a bit moderately rubbish. With this unexpected vote of confidence, what little remaining confidence the Maybot had deserted her. Where were the pot plants when she needed them? They at least had really understood her pain. All that was left to her was to talk in tautology. An implementation period was a period of implementation. The government was going for the best deal that would be the best deal the government could get. It may have been meaningless but at least no one could contradict her. Small steps and all that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/23/labour-and-rebel-tories-secure-debate-on-universal-credit-rollout","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:47:02Z","webTitle":"Labour and rebel Tories secure debate on universal credit rollout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/23/labour-and-rebel-tories-secure-debate-on-universal-credit-rollout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/23/labour-and-rebel-tories-secure-debate-on-universal-credit-rollout","fields":{"headline":"Labour and rebel Tories secure debate on universal credit rollout","bodyText":"Labour and Conservative MPs have secured an emergency debate on the new universal credit welfare system, as ministers face continued calls to reduce the six-week waiting time for claimants to receive their first payment. The three-hour debate was granted by the Speaker, John Bercow, and will take place on Tuesday after a Labour motion calling for the rollout to be paused was passed last week because the Conservatives were whipped to abstain. Since then, there have been reports that No 10 was looking at reducing the waiting time from six weeks to a month, although the Department for Work and Pensions insisted no changes were imminent. Bercow said he was satisfied the matter should be discussed in parliament again, with Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, joining opposition MPs in standing in support of Labour’s application. Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the non-binding vote last week, by 299 votes to zero, was a “serious rebuke” to the government’s flagship welfare reform. Theresa May is under increasing pressure to change the system as dozens of Conservative MPs are unhappy with the length of the waiting time. Some of the Tory rebels are expected to meet David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, this week and have high expectations that there will be some softening of the policy at, or before, the budget. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, joined those suggesting there should be a reduction in the waiting time on Monday, saying it was “not wholly necessary”. “The idea of the extra days was not something which I or my colleagues came up with,” he said. “It was a Treasury matter at the time and I think it’s certainly worth them reviewing that to see whether or not they can get rid of the waiting days.” A government spokesman said: “The government remains determined to ensure that people joining universal credit don’t face hardship which is why we recently announced significant improvements to the system of advance payments that people can get as soon as they get into the system. “As repeated this week, we will continue to monitor and take any actions if necessary. But no decisions or announcements on any further actions are imminent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/23/best-fifa-awards-2017-live-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-neymar","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T20:17:17Z","webTitle":"Best Fifa Awards 2017: Cristiano Ronaldo wins men's player of year – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/23/best-fifa-awards-2017-live-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-neymar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/23/best-fifa-awards-2017-live-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-neymar","fields":{"headline":"Best Fifa Awards 2017: Cristiano Ronaldo wins men's player of year – as it happened","bodyText":"So Ronaldo wins the Fifa player of the year award for the fourth time in five years. That’s five awards apiece for him and Messi, the Argentinian’s golden period coming when he won four in a row between 2009 and 2012. Next year will sure be interesting. Will it? Only marginally. Olivier Giroud will be pleased with his night’s work. Makes a change from sitting on the bench in the Premier League at least. And peace even broke out among the women after the shortlist caused such controversy. Martens is a worthy winner, and Lloyd showed her enduring class … Thanks for joining. Bye Ronaldo may be happy, but some pf you guys are less so. Francis Mead reignites an old debate from last season. “Mkhitaryan’s goal was better than Giroud’s,” he writes. “Similar, but faster ball, harder to execute - if Giroud’s was judged better than the others, Miki’s goal was another notch better” Ronaldo wins it. Well deserved. He had another incredible year and to lead Real to retaining the Champions League was some feat. And what a complete player. And he shares a smile with his son. Maybe he gets a bad press. He thanks everyone he’s ever met, and gives a nod to Maradona. “I’m so happy guys, thank you very much and good night,” he finishes. And now Ronaldo steps up, not that one. The old one. The goal machine who’s now rather rotund. With another tubby legend; Maradona. They share a joke and we are reminded of the genius of Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar in a video montage. What a performance that was from Neymar for Barca against PSG. Will it be enough to cause a shock. No way. Surely. Martens wins it. She was sensational in Holland’s stunning run to Euro 2017 glory. He skills were breathtaking and she’s still only 24. Here’s a reminder … Time for the best women’s player. Can the unknown Deyna Castellanos topple Carli Loyd or Lieke Martens? While we gear up for the major awards of the night Kasabian hit the stage. Ronaldo and Messi are unmoved in the front room. Surely Cristiano enjoys a little jive of an evening. Messi probably just practises his free-kicks. Ranieri gets a hug. These guys are Leicester mad. Ronaldo’s son gets a fist pump. Touch. A tweet. I fear it’s a bit of a mickey take though. I’m still injured Tom. Honest … How the world XI might line up The Fifa Dream Team has been named, and here it is (4-4-3); Buffon, Alves, Marcelo, Ramos, Bonucci; Modric, Kroos, Iniesta; Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar. Difficult to argue with much of that team. But Iniesta? Was he that good last year? At least the announcement might cheer up Bonucci though … One of my favourites next and it’s the Fifa fair play award. “This award shows more than any other the power of football and its ability to touch peoples’ lives the world over,” we are told. “And there can only be one winner”. That man is Francis Koné. For anyone who doesn’t remember, this is why he’s won … Holland won Euro 2017 in fine style so naturally Wiegman takes the Fifa award. She’s not here though, but she tells us she’s happy in a video recorded yesterday. What! I thought no one knew the results. Who do i call about this? It’s Pelé’s birthday. He’s 77 today. Or is it 78. He gets some birthday wishes before Ruud Gullit and Arsenal’s Alex Scott announce the nominations fort best women’s coach. Nils Nielsen of Denmark, Gerard Precheur of France and Sarina Wiegman of Holland are shortlisted for their work at Euro 2017. Glory for Celtic, primarily for honouring the ‘Lisbon Lions’ with stunning 360-degree card display on 50th anniversary of historic European Cup win. Next up is the fans awards. Awarded to the fans, voted by the fans. Celtic, Borussia Dortmund and FC Copenhagen make up the shortlist for this one with Samuel Eto’o doing the awards. A short break in the awards allows the audience to reflect that football is only a game. RIP Bradley … Buffon gets it. Legend. Will he ever stop? “It’s a great honour to receive this award at my age,” he says. The man’s only 39. He can go on for years. For now though he just wants to win the Champions League with Juventus and the World Cup with Italy. Aim high squire. Peter Schmeichel takes to the stage to announce the best goalkeeper awards. Gigi Buffon, Keylor Navas and Manuel Neuer are the candidates Zidane wins, and looking suave as ever in a dickie bow, Zidane flits between English, French and Spanish. In Spanish he says he loves his wife, and name checks his best players “Ronaldo, Marcelo, Toni, Luca, thank you”. Thanks to Madrid he says with a beaming smile, and strolls off Next up is coach of the year, and Claudio Ranieri will call this one. In his unique style, the Tinkerman calls Conte, Allegri and Zidane “quite simply, legends on their own touchlines”. “It’s an honour,” says Giroud, looking dashing as ever. He gives kisses to his children watching on TV and dedicates the trophy to his dad. Neymar and Antonio Conte reckon Giroud should win it, while Kane shows no bias by opting for Masuluke. The odd couple of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Diego Forlan are the ones in the know though, and it is Giroud. Great goal lad, but nothing beats this. So the first gong of the night is the Ferenc Puskas award for goal of the year. Olivier Giroud is in there for his scorpion kick, and Kevin-Price Boateng, Mario Mandzukic and Nemanja Matic made the shortlist. Personally, I love this one from Oscarine Masuluke. Idris Elba is the host for the night. Fifa thinking outside the box. Idris says “Alright, bruv” to the people of Hackney before grabbing selfie’s with the big players and shaking hands with Cristiano Ronaldo’s son. Mercifully the green carpet nonsense is over, and it’s time for the awards. Here’s Neymar’s plum suit though for anyone who cares… Everyone seems to be backing Ronaldo for the big one tonight, but if it was a popularity contest surely Messi would win. Neymar seems to be taking the Ronaldo route to superstardom though … Antonio Conte is in the house, hoping to snare the coach of the year award. He’s up against Real Madrid’s Zinedine Zidane, the first manager to lead a club to back-to-back European titles in the Champions League era, and Massimo Allegri of Juventus, who Real beat in the final. No pressure then. Whatever happens though, at least he’s made the top three, eh José. Ronaldo appears on the green carpet but blanks our hapless hosts for the night, just as Messi did earlier. Neymar, replete with dapper red suit, is more accommodating. He says he is delighted to be here tonight and is looking forward to the World Cup with Brazil. Show-stopping stuff. Sol Campbell is here. And he’s pinned his colours to the mast. “You have to recognise what Ronaldo has done this year,” he says. The conversation quickly turns to Harry Kane, and Sol says that he would have the Spurs striker in his dream XI, the name Fifa has given to their team of the year yo be named tonight. Asked which three players he would definitely put in this year’s team, the centre-back turned failed Tory candidate for the 2015 London mayoral election is unequivocal. “Ronaldo, Messi and Kane.” he says. “Harry’s done enough to get in there. He’s up on their level.” So here it is. The one we’ve all been waiting for. The annual tussle between Ronaldo and Messi for the right to call themselves the greatest footballer on the planet, or as Fifa would have us call tonight’s winner; The Best. Neymar, of course, is here in London to trail in glumly in third, no doubt adding to his funk after he was sent off against Marseille last night for having the temerity to stand up to incessant kicking. In the buildup to this event the controversy has centred on the women’s player of the year award. The fun started when Fifa overlooked Australia’s Sam Kerr for their three woman shortlist despite her incredible exploits on the pitch, and instead plumped for a teenage Venezuelan student who had never even represented her country at senior international level. More about that later. Among the other awards which will be handed out tonight are best coach, best goalkeeper, best goal, the world’s best X1 and the best fans, with the green and white side of Glasgow awaiting that announcement with baited breath. The London Palladium is bathed in the usual Fifa glitz and schmaltz. The first award will be handed out at 7.40pm BST, but the egos have been arriving for hours. The red carpet is green, in honour of the beautiful game, and already some have been turning the air blue. Here’s what Megan Rapinoe has had to say: The USA international Megan Rapinoe has attacked Fifa after it named a teenage student on its three-person shortlist for the female player of the year award. Venezuela’s Deyna Castellanos has not represented her country at senior international level, and plays most of her football for Florida State University. She is on Fifa’s shortlist alongside World Cup winner Carli Lloyd and Holland forward Lieke Martens. “The award just doesn’t hold a lot of weight when you’ve got someone on the list I’ve never heard of,” said Rapinoe, who has won an Olympic gold and World Cup with the US. She added: “It signals to us and it signals to the rest of the world that Fifa doesn’t really care.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/26/uk-high-security-prisons-officers-conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T18:00:07Z","webTitle":"UK high-security prisons lose one in four officers under Conservatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/26/uk-high-security-prisons-officers-conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/26/uk-high-security-prisons-officers-conservatives","fields":{"headline":"UK high-security prisons lose one in four officers under Conservatives","bodyText":"High-security prisons holding Britain’s most dangerous prisoners have lost one in four officers since the Conservatives have been in government, it can be revealed. HMP Belmarsh, the category-A men’s prison that has inmates including serial killer Stephen Port and extreme Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary, has experienced a near 40% drop in prison officer numbers – from 891 in 2010 to just 553. The Ministry of Justice figures, which show a drop of more than 1,700 prison officers in total across the eight highest security prisons, come as new data was released showing assaults and self-harm at record levels in jails. Other high-security prisons that have seen a significant drop in prison officer numbers include Long Lartin, where inmates rioted earlier this month. The 622-capacity category-A jail, where there have been four homicides in the past four years, has lost almost 200 prison officers since 2010. After the riot in the prison, the Prison Governors Association said the disturbance should be “ringing alarm bells at the most senior level” and called it symptomatic of cutbacks in the prison service management structure. The figures came to light in a parliamentary question tabled by Labour MP Toby Perkins, who said the steep decline in the number of officers, particularly in high-security prisons, meant prisoners were “spending their whole sentences locked up and crucial opportunities for rehabilitation [were] being missed”. He said: “The scale of these cuts to the numbers of officers, charged with looking after Britain’s most dangerous criminals, is appalling. It puts into context the riots, suicides and disorder that has terrorised Britain’s prisons this summer. “The public rightly expect that government will take seriously their duty to protect us and to rehabilitate prisoners and these figures demonstrate that they are failing that basic duty.” In his response to Perkins, the justice minister Sam Gyimah said the government had committed to recruit a net increase of 2,500 prison officers by December 2018. “In addition to the recruitment activity to fill these 2,500 new posts, there is ongoing recruitment activity to fill current vacancies, and vacancies which arise due to retention rates of existing staff,” he said. Jackie Marshall, of the Prison Officers Association, said staff shortages were costing the taxpayer more and putting officers at risk. “When there’s fewer staff, we don’t get a change to talk to prisoners, which means we’re less likely to hear about any disturbances,” she said. “Prisoners spend longer in their cells, which makes for a tense environment and it does make it more dangerous because there are fewer colleagues to protect you. It’s also costing a fortune because staff shortages in the south-east mean there’s currently up to 200 officers living in hotels to cover places that are understaffed.” The latest Ministry of Justice figures on violence in prisons in England and Wales, released on Thursday, showed a record high of 27,193 incidents until June. Assaults on staff were also at a record high – up 25% on the previous year – and over the same period, self-harm in prison also rose to record levels. The number of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults was also the highest recorded since the data series began, at 19,678."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/26/carabao-cup-quarter-final-draw-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T17:05:14Z","webTitle":"Carabao Cup quarter-finals: Bristol City host Manchester United after draw delay – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/26/carabao-cup-quarter-final-draw-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/26/carabao-cup-quarter-final-draw-live","fields":{"headline":"Carabao Cup quarter-finals: Bristol City host Manchester United after draw delay – as it happened","bodyText":"José Mourinho will take defending champions Manchester United to Bristol City in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, while league leaders Manchester City travel to Leicester City. Arsenal will host West Ham and Chelsea face Bournemouth in the other ties as the four heavyweights avoided each other in the last eight ties, which will be played in the week commencing 18 December. The draw was scheduled to be broadcast live on Twitter at 4pm BST but was delayed by nearly two hours, and eventually sent out in a pre-recorded video which had its own sound and graphics issues. Organisers blamed a “technical glitch” for the delays, the latest in a series of issues to affect the competition draws this season. In the first round Charlton Athletic were drawn twice, while the third-round draw took place at 4.15am UK time. “English efficiency at its best,” says James Boyle. “World Cup, anyone?” I think we can all agree that football was the winner. Right, I’m off for several cans of sweet, sweet Carabao. We’ll have a full report on that shambles up shortly – technical issues notwithstanding. So after all that, the draw is sent out via a pre-recorded clip, complete with bad sound, stuttering graphics and both Tuffers and Dawson “having to get off soon”. It’s an interesting draw, with José Mourinho off to Ashton Gate, but that scarcely seems important any more. Without further ado... Chelsea v Bournemouth (as per Twitter rumours) Arsenal v West Ham United Leicester City v Manchester City Bristol City v Manchester United Ties will be played w/c 18 December This is unbelievable... The draw has now been delayed for over 100 minutes – enough time to have played the quarter-final ties, never mind drawn them. This suggestion is looking better with every minute that passes: While you’re here, why not sign up for The Recap, our weekly guide to our best stuff, sent straight to your inbox? It takes less time than drawing eight numbered balls out of a bag! “Can’t they just write the eight names on a piece of paper and stick them in a hat? That used to work fine in my Subbuteo playing days,” writes Jeremy Adams. Switch ‘hat’ for ‘empty can of Carabao’ and I think they’ll go for it. Twitter are supposed to be broadcasting the draw live from their HQ, but ‘technical difficulties’ are not much of an excuse when presumably, Tuffers and/or Dawsers possess a smartphone that could broadcast the draw. That Rod Stewart business is starting to look sophisticated by comparison: And here’s a nice read from Andy Hunter on Rhian Brewster. The Liverpool youngster has led England U17s to a World Cup final despite not being born when this draw was scheduled to take place. Anyone who’s now back from listening to Football Weekly Extraaa will notice my joke has backfired spectacularly. If you haven’t yet, why not? There’s nothing else going on! “If the delay goes the full 90, do we have a replay or go straight to penalties?” asks Gary Wilson. As far as I know, the eight remaining managers will try to boot a regulation petrol station football over a warehouse. If anyone does it, their team gets the Cup. The farce continues “The hot, steamy reality of Thailand – sure I’ve seen that film…” hoots Richard Powell. The draw is now 68 minutes late. It’s been a rough day for conference rooms – Greg Clarke has been talking again, there was another angry Arsenal AGM, and now this. Catch up with today’s box-fresh Fiver: “In the hot, steamy reality of Thailand, you need energy to get you through the day.” So begins ‘The Legend of Carabao’, which also tells me the drink was invented by Aed Carabao, “Thailand’s answer to Bruce Springsteen.” So now you know. This is, incredibly enough, not the biggest hash made of a League Cup draw so far this season: Still hoping for some hot draw action at 5pm sharp, but this tweet has me worried. ‘Within the hour’? In the interests of balance... There were none of these problems when Donald Trump carried out the Rumbelows Cup fifth-round draw. In fact, it was a great draw. The best. Carabao: your reviews And viewing – this guy’s had his Carabao! Some pre-delayed-draw reading: I haven’t – and I don’t know anyone who has! If you’ve sampled it, let me know. We’ve got plenty of time to kill. “I think Tuffers and Dawson are doing the draw in the style of the charades round from A Question of Sport and nobody’s managed to guess the first team yet,” honks Andrew Papps. “They should have made sure Sue Barker turned up as well to give them the answers.” Weeeeeey! Just got an email that simply says “7”. Is this part of the draw? Still waiting. I’ve just done a mock draw myself, to see if drawing eight teams is actually much harder than I’d thought. It isn’t. I’m not going to divulge the fictional ties, but there are some corkers in there. Football Weekly Extraaaaa has landed, so go and give it a listen, and come back to me in 58 minutes for the draw: The draw comes with a Twitter feed attached, with lots of supportive and encouraging tweets flying in as time ticks on. This is probably the best one. The draw appears to have been delayed by a few minutes. So far this season, we’ve seen teams drawn out twice, a mute Facebook feed from Bangkok and the third-round draw taking place at 4.15am BST, so this is nothing new. “The whole AFC thing smacks of foreigners, what with their AC Milan and TP-47 and such like,” bellows Simon Thomas. “Once Brexit comes, Bournemouth and Wimbledon should drop the fancy prefixes and just hoof it long.” No sign of Tuffers or Dawsers yet – I’m keeping myself busy refreshing the Carabao Cup Twitter page, which has a header to remember. Carabaos all round! “Are the organisers having a dig at poor old Arsène?” asks Charles Antaki. “The list of clubs is obviously alphabetical, except that Arsenal have been demoted to second place. They might as well have got a light aircraft to fly the thing on a banner over the television studio.” The real, less amusing reason is that Bournemouth are down as ‘AFC Bournemouth’ in the official draw. Why? I don’t know. Defending champions Manchester United, 2015 winners Chelsea, and Manchester City, who lifted the trophy in 2014 and 2016, are all still in the Carabao Cup running. Arsenal are in the hat but haven’t won it since 1993, when the UK’s leading energy drink was Panda Pops. Leicester City have won the League Cup more times than the Gunners, and now have former finalist Claude Puel at the helm. West Ham, Bournemouth and Bristol City have never won it – in fact, this is only the Cherries’ second appearance at this stage, and City’s first since 1989. The draw will be made at 4pm by banter kings Phil Tufnell and Matt Dawson. It’ll be live on Twitter, and will become the first English cup draw to descend into a 500-comment row about the aerodynamics of the Mitre Delta.

Theresa May has been criticised by MPs, including on her own side, for whipping her own backbenchers not to vote on opposition day motions, such as last week’s on universal credit. Veteran Tory MP Edward Leigh had even accused the government of paving the way for tyranny by ignoring defeats on such motions. Leadsom’s announcement on Thursday was criticised by the shadow leader of the Commons, Valerie Vaz, who claimed parliament was being run like a cross between House of Cards and Game of Thrones. In a written statement issued to parliament, Leadsom said, “I am today updating the house on the government’s approach to opposition day debates. Where a motion tabled by an opposition party has been approved by the house, the relevant minister will respond to the resolution of the house by making a statement no more than 12 weeks after the debate. “This is to allow thoughtful consideration of the points that have been raised, facilitate collective discussion across government, especially on cross-cutting issues, and to outline any actions that have been taken.” Labour has been exploiting May’s fragile majority to raise pressing social issues such as the roll-out of the controversial universal credit welfare system. A motion tabled by the party calling for its roll-out to be paused was passed unanimously last week, as most Tory MPs abstained – some of them reluctantly. The government has made a series of concessions in recent weeks as May adjusts to governing without a stable majority. David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, announced last week that charges would be abolished for the universal credit helpline, an issue raised by Labour. And on Wednesday, as Labour prepared to debate the impact of changes to housing benefit on supported housing, May announced a climbdown at prime minister’s questions. Leadsom said she was responding to concerns raised on both sides of the Commons. Vaz dismissed Leadsom’s concession and complained about the government’s failure to consult with Labour about the tabling of legislation. A Labour source said: “Theresa May has decided to bypass parliament, ignore the result of the general election and the wishes of the people. “Theresa May does not have a majority in parliament so has decided just to ignore it. The prime minister is in office but not in power.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/26/worlds-witnessing-a-new-gilded-age-as-billionaires-wealth-swells-to-6tn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T15:48:31Z","webTitle":"World's witnessing a new Gilded Age as billionaires’ wealth swells to $6tn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/worlds-witnessing-a-new-gilded-age-as-billionaires-wealth-swells-to-6tn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/26/worlds-witnessing-a-new-gilded-age-as-billionaires-wealth-swells-to-6tn","fields":{"headline":"World's witnessing a new Gilded Age as billionaires’ wealth swells to $6tn","bodyText":"The world’s super-rich hold the greatest concentration of wealth since the US Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th century, when families like the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes. Billionaires increased their combined global wealth by almost a fifth last year to a record $6tn (£4.5tn) – more than twice the GDP of the UK. There are now 1,542 dollar billionaires across the world, after 145 multi-millionaires saw their wealth tick over into nine-zero fortunes last year, according to the UBS / PwC Billionaires report. Josef Stadler, the lead author of the report and UBS’s head of global ultra high net worth, said his billionaire clients were concerned that growing inequality between rich and poor could lead to a “strike back”. “We’re at an inflection point,” Stadler said. “Wealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about. The problem is the power of interest on interest – that makes big money bigger and, the question is to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?” Stadler added: “We are now two years into the peak of the second Gilded Age.” He said the “$1bn question” was how society would react to the concentration of so much money in the hands of so few. Anger at so-called robber barron families who built up vast fortunes from monopolies in US rail, oil, steel and banking in the late 19th century, an era of rapid industrialisation and growing inequality in America that became known as the Gilded Age, led to President Roosevelt breaking up companies and trusts and increasing taxes on the wealthy in the early 1900s. “Will there be similarities in the way society reacts to this gilded age?,” Stadler asked. “Will the second age end or will it proceed?” The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently said western governments should force the top 1% of earners to pay more more tax to try to reduce dangerous levels of inequality. Stadler said media coverage of inequality and the super-rich suggested there would be an “inflection point”, but he said “the perception that billionaires make money for themselves at the expense of the wider population” was incorrect. He added that 98% of billionaires’ wealth found its way back into wider society and said the world’s super-rich employed 27.7 million people – not far behind the number of people in the UK workforce. Billionaires’ fortunes increased by 17% on average last year due to the strong performance of their companies and investments, particularly in technology and commodities. The billionaires’ average return was double that achieved by the world’s stock markets and far more than the average interest rates of just 0.35% offered by UK instant-access high street bank accounts. Stadler said that the super-rich’s concerns over public perceptions that they were getting wealthier at the expense of the wider population had led them to make greater philanthropic gifts and spend their money on public art galleries and sports teams. “You could say it is about ego and wanting to show off and sit in the front row,” he said. “But it is also about giving back.” The report said billionaires now accounted for 72 of the world’s 200 top art collectors, up from 28 in 1995. “While not a fresh phenomenon, private museums are growing in number, especially in Asia,” the annual UBS report said. “Motivated by their passion for art, and often encouraged by favourable tax treatment, art collectors are setting up private museums all around the world to share their collections with the public.” Recent gallery openings include The Broad in Los Angeles, funded by Eli Broad – the world’s 65th richest person with a $7.4bn fortune. Japanese billionaire Soichiro Fukutake is building a series of galleries to house his art collection on islands in Japan’s Seto Inland Sea. “The billionaire population is concerned about [inequality] and that may be why we are seeing this acceleration of publicly displaying art collections or partnering with public institutions so more of the public can enjoy what they have,” said John Matthews, UBS head of private wealth management. “I think it’s a big part of investment in sports franchises – it’s a way for them to say ‘I made all this money and I did it in Cleveland, Ohio, I’ve got to give back to my community and one way I’m going to do that is to make sure the stadium is great’.” The report found that 140 of the world’s top sports teams are owned by just 109 billionaires, with two-thirds of NBA and NFL teams owned by billionaires. In the UK, nine of the 20 Premier League teams have billionaire owners, including Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, and Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City. “There is an acceleration of these transactions as we speak, with major buyers coming from China,” Stadler said. One of the billionaires told the UBS researchers he had bought sports teams because it opened doors to “stars, sheikhs, famous businessmen and regular guys from around the world, all in the same room, all talking only about the ball”. America’s Gilded Age The Gilded Age, from the 1870s until the early 1900s, was boom time for America, as rail opened up the country and higher wages saw an influx of millions of immigrants from Europe. The term to describe the era of rapid industrialisation and social upheaval in the US was coined by historians in the 1920s, and was derived from Mark Twain’s 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. Money from London and Paris poured into the US and fuelled industrialisation and rail development, including the first transcontinental railroad that opened up vast areas of territory to mining and ranching, and cut travel time from New York to San Francisco from six months to six days. Several industries, including oil, steel, sugar and cotton, became controlled by a few large companies, run by trusts. The trusts controlled every aspect of production, from raw materials to manufacturing and sales, enabling them to operate as monopolies in their industrial sector and keep out competitors. The trusts turned their owners into some of the richest people to ever live, and whose descendants still feature oin annual rich lists. Anger at the wealth accrued by so few people at the apparent expense of their poorly treated workers led industrialists, including Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), Andrew Carnegie (steel), JP Morgan (finance) and John Jacob Astor (real estate and fur), to be dubbed robber barons. Historian TJ Stiles said the term was adopted to “conjure up visions of titanic monopolists who crushed competitors, rigged markets, and corrupted government. In their greed and power, legend has it, they held sway over a helpless democracy.” President Theodore Roosevelt, elected in 1901, moved to break up the monopolies. John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil was split into 34 separate companies, including the predecessors of Exxon, BP and Chevron. The Gilded Age gave way to the Progressive Era, when the backlash against the excesses and inequalities of the earlier period prompted widespread social activism and political reform."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
