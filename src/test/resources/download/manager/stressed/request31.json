The former prime minister insisted he had not given up on Labour despite his concerns of it being “in the grip of the hard left”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he admitted he was trying re-energise the centre ground of British politics, which he claimed was being abandoned by the two main parties. “If you leave between the Brexit-dominated Tory party and a hard-left Labour party vast uncultivated centre ground, at some point someone is going to come along and cultivate it,” he said. At the weekend the Observer revealed that plans for a new centrist party had attracted £50m of investment. Blair denied trying to form a new party, saying: “I’m not advocating it or involved in such a one or certainly not running for its leadership at this or any stage.” But he said such a plan should not be derided by the established parties. “What is most sensible is for both of the main parties to realise they can pour scorn on people who are thinking of these things, but ultimately they’ve got to understand there is a constituency in this country which is socially liberal, in favour of strong methods of social justice, but also believes in a well-run enterprising economy.” Blair lamented the lack of political leadership from centrists. He said: “The really depressing thing about western politics at the moment is that the leadership of what I would call a strong progressive centre is just not there, it is lacking. “And the result of it is you have rightwing politics going into anti-immigration nationalism and leftwing politics going into sort of anti-business old form of statism, and neither are the answer to the problem of the future.” He confirmed that his Tony Blair Institute for Global Change was developing a platform for any emerging centrist politicians to utilise. “What we are is putting together is a policy platform … that anyone in politics could take if they come from the open-minded approach to the problem, which says that globalisation is essentially a good thing, not a bad thing, but its risks have to be mitigated … My institute is looking at things like housing, infrastructure, what’s the right tax and spending policy. “It is not a manifesto because it is not for a political party – it is for people whether they are in the Labour party, Conservative party, Liberal Democrats, wherever, who can see the way politics is developing in the is country and who think there must be a better set of policy ideas for the future.” He added: “I have got no infrastructure for building some political party. But what I fully own up to is trying to create the sort of centrist policies that I think can rekindle optimism about the future, since I think that these lurches to the right and to the left are basically the politics of pessimism. “Starting a new political party is incredibly difficult. I’m focused on one thing, which is what are the right ideas.” “We have got an old-fashioned Conservative party and a Labour party that’s got frankly reheated politics from the days I remember when I was a student. I don’t think either of those things answer the challenge for the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/10/yulia-skripal-discharged-from-hospital-salisbury-attack-nerve-agent","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:34:38Z","webTitle":"Yulia Skripal discharged from hospital after Salisbury attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/yulia-skripal-discharged-from-hospital-salisbury-attack-nerve-agent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/yulia-skripal-discharged-from-hospital-salisbury-attack-nerve-agent","fields":{"headline":"Yulia Skripal discharged from hospital after Salisbury attack","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Yulia Skripal, the daughter of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, has been discharged from hospital, doctors have said. Just over a month after she and her father were found collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, after being poisoned with a nerve agent, medics confirmed she had left Salisbury district hospital. Skripal, 33, flew to the UK on 3 March, the day before she and her father are believed to have been poisoned with the nerve agent novichok. She released a statement on Friday saying her strength was “growing daily”. Sergei Skripal, 66, is also making good progress and doctors hope he will be able to leave hospital “in due course”. Speaking outside the hospital on Tuesday, its medical director, Christine Blanshard, said: “We have now discharged Yulia from Salisbury district hospital. Yulia has asked for privacy from the media and I want to reiterate her request. “I also want to take this opportunity to wish Yulia well. This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone. “Her father has also made good progress. On Friday I announced he was no longer in a critical condition. Although he is recovering more slowly than Yulia, we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course.” Blanshard gave further insight into how the nerve agent attacked the two patients and the treatment they received. “In the four weeks since the incident in the city centre, both have received round-the-clock care from our clinicians, who have been able to draw on advice and support from world-leading experts in the field,” she said. “Nerve agents work by attaching themselves to the particular enzymes in the body, which then stop the nerves from functioning. This results in symptoms such as sickness and hallucinations. Our job in treating the patients is to stabilise them, ensuring that they can breathe and blood can continue to circulate. “We then need to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning. We also use specialised decontamination techniques to remove any residual toxins. “Both patients have been responding exceptionally well to the treatment we’ve been providing, but equally both patients are at different stages of their recovery.” Yulia Skripal’s departure from hospital comes nearly three weeks after DS Nick Bailey was discharged after he was affected by the nerve agent. The testimony of the Skripals will be crucial in establishing the credibility of the government’s claim that it was “highly likely” the Russian state targeted them with the nerve agent. Moscow has waged a furious media battle in an attempt to discredit this account. It is likely it will want to bring Yulia Skripal back to Russia. In its first response to the latest news, the Russian embassy in London tweeted its congratulations to Yulia Skripal but suggested she could be acting under duress: The embassy then went on to suggest the Skripals’ pet dogs had been burned as part of wider attempts by the UK authorities to destroy evidence. Responding to reports that the Skripals may ultimately be granted settled status in other countries such as the US or Australia, the embassy said such a move would be seen as “an abduction”: Asked for her reaction to the news, Theresa May said: “Well, obviously I welcome the fact that Yulia Skripal has been discharged from hospital and I wish her the best for her continuing recovery, and I’d like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at the hospital in Salisbury who have looked after her and her father so well.” The Russian and British governments have continued their war of words over who is to blame for the Skripals’ poisoning. On Sunday, Boris Johnson accused the Kremlin and Russia’s state-owned media of inventing 29 different theories about the Salisbury attack. “No other government devotes as much time and effort to the business of trying to sabotage or discredit international inquiries,” the foreign secretary said. Officials rejected a request from the Russian embassy for a meeting with Johnson to discuss the poisonings. In a statement on its website, the embassy said its dealings with Britain over the issue had been “utterly unsatisfactory”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/apr/10/markets-lifted-after-chinas-xi-calms-trade-concerns-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:45:17Z","webTitle":"UK interest rates should be raised without delay, says Bank's McCafferty - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/10/markets-lifted-after-chinas-xi-calms-trade-concerns-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/apr/10/markets-lifted-after-chinas-xi-calms-trade-concerns-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK interest rates should be raised without delay, says Bank's McCafferty - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stock markets are moving higher after a speech by China’s president Xi at the Boao Forum defused some of the fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. Xi said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including cars. However China is reported to have filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the proposed US tariffs on steel and aluminium. And investors still face a number of other uncertainties, not least the US sanctions on Russia which has hit the rouble hard. Elsewhere, Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said the monetary policy committee should not dally over raising UK interest rates given wage growth and the strength of the global economy. The comments gave a lift to the pound. Meanwhile European Central Bank member Ewald Nowotny said it was time to “normalise” its monetary policy. And in the US, producer prices rose by more than expected in March, giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to increase borrowing costs. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. With trade war fears easing after the overnight speech from Chinese president Xi, US markets have opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 390 points or 1.63% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.36% and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 1.65%. Commenting on the Xi speech to Reuters, strategist Art Hogan at Wunderlich Securities in New York said: The expectation was [the Xi speech] could have gone one of two ways: he could have been aggressive about US tariffs or been conciliatory, and it feels like he’s more conciliatory. Back with the Boao Forum in China, and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has also had talks with president Xi: Stronger than forecast US producer price figures for March give more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again later this year. The Fed has indicated it could increased borrowing costs another two times in 2018 but some expect another rise on top of that if the economic data merits it. So a 0.3% rise in the producer price index last month adds fuel to those expectations. That is an increase from the 0.2% rise in February, and higher than analyst forecasts of 0.1%. The year on year increase in March was 3%, up from 2.8% in the previous month and ahead of the 2.9% expected. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose to 1.6% after being at 1.5% for four months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released the data, said: A major factor in the March advance in prices for final demand services was the index for outpatient care (partial), which climbed 0.4 percent. The indexes for machinery, equipment, parts, and supplies wholesaling; cable and satellite subscriber services; airline passenger services; food and alcohol wholesaling; and hospital inpatient care also moved higher. In contrast, margins for automotive fuels and lubricants retailing fell 10.4 percent. The indexes for apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing and wireless telecommunications services also decreased. As a sign things are a little calmer on the stock markets at the moment, the VIX volatility index - which had been rising in recent days - is currently down 5% at 20.61. That is not to say there are not a number of uncertainties for investors, from the US/China trade dispute, the situation in Syria, Russian sanctions and the latest on the Mueller investigation in the US. European stock markets are holding on to their gains, and Wall Street is still expected to open sharplyhigher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones is all set to leap 320 points after the bell, a chunky jump that would take the beleaguered index to 24300, pushing it towards the top end of its recent trading bracket. However, it is important to note that the US open and close can often operate in completely different universes, especially if Trump gives into his urge to cause a bit of Twitter chaos. Brexit is getting real: The pound has hit a day’s high of $1.4179, up 0.38% on the talk of further interest rate rises. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Sterling has moved higher after some hawkish comments from BoE member McCafferty in which he cautioned fellow rate-setters against dallying when it comes to further tightening monetary policy. McCafferty was one of two dissenters who called for higher rates at the last meeting when the bank decided to keep its policy unchanged and his recent comments have pushed the pound/dollar rate to its highest level in more than a fortnight. With the bank expected to raise rates next month, remarks from the voting members will take on a greater importance in the coming weeks with the previous hike in November - the first such increase in more than a decade - being widely telegraphed in advance. Despite the slump in the rouble, Russia’s central bank has no plans to introduce any measures to reduce volatility. The bank’s first deputy chairman Sergei Shvetsov said the situation with the rouble was “adequate”, according to Reuters. And back with the effects of the US sanctions on Russian companies: At the time London stock exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet said: We warmly congratulate Mr Sokov and his management team on their successful IPO today. Welcoming En+ Group to London Stock Exchange is a significant milestone which underlines the City’s position as the leading global listing venue for international companies and investors’ appetite for Russian issuers. With 100 Russian and CIS businesses listed and traded on London’s markets, with a total capitalisation of over $550 billion, London is a strong partner to Russian companies seeking access to global investor capital, as well as an open and dynamic place to do business. And the company was invited to open trading on the day it listed in November: The average British household benefited from the Bank of England’s emergency interest rate cut in the financial crisis to the tune of almost £9,000 in pay and £90,000 in household wealth, according to its chief economist. Speaking in Australia, Andy Haldane is defending some of the benefits from low interest rates just before Threadneedle Street looks to increase them to levels unseen since the 2008 crash began. According to him, the impact of low rates and quantitative easing has been to keep more people in work - helping them with their earnings - and to keep borrowing costs cheap to help cut mortgage costs. Asset prices have also been inflated, helping those who held them - even if they got less on their cash savings held in bank accounts. The significance of the loose monetary policy from the Bank is so significant, he says, that GDP in the UK would have been around 8% lower, unemployment 4 percentage points higher and the level of consumer prices 20% lower without its package to cut rates to 0.5% and inject £435bn into the economy through QE. Just 4% of households were made £500 or more worse off when taking income and wealth effects together, he says. And here is the dramatic movement in the rouble - it shows the rise in the number of roubles needed to buy one dollar: Meanwhile the Russian rouble continues to come under pressure following the US sanctions against a number of its companies. The currency is down around 4% against the dollar to 63.28, its second day of heavy losses and its lowest level since December 2016. And there is another twist in the trade dispute between the US and China. Associated Press reports: China is filing a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminium products. The Geneva-based trade body said on Tuesday that China has requested 60 days of consultations with the United States to resolve the dispute. If the two sides can’t agree on a solution, the next step could be for Beijing to request a ruling from a panel of trade experts. China claims the duties of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on imports of aluminum products breach international trade rules. The Bank of England is not the only central bank to be considering reigning in the financial stimulus - low interest rates and quantitative easing - that have supported stock markets since the financial crisis. Speaking in London, European Central Bank policymaker and Bank of Austria governor Ewald Nowotny said it was now time to “start the gradual normalisation of monetary policy.” He said: We are at an important turning point in monetary policy. We must normalise policy not too soon but not too late. He said there was the risk of stifling the recovery if the ECB tightened monetary policy too soon, but also a risk of an asset boom if it tightened too late. Sterling has edged to a two week high after the comments from Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty that there should be no delay in raising interest rates. The pound hit $1.4168 against the dollar in the wake of the remarks, up 0.28%. Against the euro sterling is 0.13% better at €1.1485. UK interest rates should be raised again without delay, a leading Bank of England policymaker has said. After its meeting last month the Bank hinted at an increase in May, and in an interview with Reuters, Ian McCafferty said the prospect of faster pay rises and a strong pick-up in the global economy emphasised the need for dearer borrowing costs before long. McCafferty said that wage growth, which has lagged inflation for much of the past decade, could prove to be stronger than many of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee believed. He told Reuters: We shouldn’t dally when it comes to tightening policy modestly,. Reuters adds: McCafferty said he could not be certain about whether to vote again for a rate rise until May’s policy meeting, but there had been no data or Brexit developments so far to make him think he was wrong in March to vote to raise rates to 0.75 percent. The former chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry has been in the minority of BoE policymakers pushing for a rate hike previously in the past four years. Speaking in his office in the BoE on Monday... McCafferty said that as well as the boost from the world economy’s strong recovery, he thought there was now no slack left in Britain’s labour market. Unemployment at its lowest rate since 1975, skill shortages and signs that employers were resorting to higher wage offers to lure staff from rival firms or stop them from leaving would also create inflation pressure. “It’s not wages suddenly bursting away, but it gives you a modest upside risk,” said McCafferty, whose term at the central bank ends in August. And the “jury is still out” on whether the inflationary hit from the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote in 2016 would fade as quickly as expected, he said. “On balance, those three arguments give me some potential modest upside risks to the (inflation) forecasts,” McCafferty said. While the BoE had been wrong in the past about wages finally gaining momentum, labour market surveys so far this year showed that the recent recovery in the headline rate of growth of pay to nearly 3 percent looked more sustainable this time, he said. Often called one of the BoE’s most hawkish policymakers, McCafferty said there had been a case for following up November’s rate move with another hike as early as February. But he held off to avoid surprising households who had been told by the BoE that it plans to raise rates only gradually... On Brexit, McCafferty said British exporters remained in “a sweet spot”, helped by the weakness of the pound while concerns that they might lose business with supply chain customers elsewhere in the EU had so far proven overdone. But there were signs that British companies were wary about making long-term investments, and potential Brexit stumbling blocks would remain, he said. “That’s going to be a permanent feature of the landscape,” McCafferty said. Mining shares are leading the way in London, while news that US regulators have approved Bayer’s takeover of Monsanto and a positive update from LVMH have also helped sentiment. But ahead of the start of the US reporting season, the main support for the market in early trading is Chinese president Xi’s speech at Boao. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: What President Xi didn’t say at the Boao Forum matters more than what he did. There are plenty of reforms to come, including reduced auto tariffs, but no details. But the lack of any ramping-up of the US/Chinese trade-war-by-rhetoric was the key for equities to rally. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor said: President Xi’s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade. While there was already an overwhelming sense that Chinese officials were keen to achieve a negotiated settlement before the proposed tariffs do any lasting damage to either the Chinese or US economies, today’s speech was the clearest indication yet that China is prepared to take concrete steps to address some of Trump’s chief criticisms. The big question is whether President Trump will now take the olive branch offered by Xi’s conciliatory approach and dial down the rhetoric from his side too. Corporate profits have taken a back seat to trade tensions and increased volatility over the past few weeks, but as the US earnings season starts in earnest this week, they will take on huge significance. Equities received a huge boost when the US tax reform bill was signed into law in December and investors will want to see that this is feeding through to the bottom line to justify their continued faith. A good earnings season would do a lot to regain some equilibrium and provide some much-needed relief and calm for beleaguered investors. As fears of a trade war between China and the US ease - for the moment - after president Xi’s speech overnight, European markets have opened in a positive mood. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5% or 41 points, while Germany’s Dax has added just over 1%, France’s Cac has climbed 0.8% and Spain’s Ibex is 0.6% better. And the US futures are predicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which added just 0.19% in the end on Monday - will open around 360 points higher or 1.5%. More fallout from the US imposition of sanctions on various Russian companies. Glencore, which has various contracts with Russia’s Rusal for the purchase of aluminium, says it is now evaluating these contracts. Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg has resigned from the Rusal board, and a deal for Glencore to swap its shares in Rusal for global depository receipts in EN+ - which manages the assets of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska - will not now go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A keynote speech by Chinese president Xi Jinping at the Boao Asian forum overnight has eased some of the concerns about a possible trade war with the US. America had proposed slapping tariffs on $50bn - or even $100bn - worth of Chinese products which prompted a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. Weekend comments from Donald Trump seemed to suggest the two sides might be able to reach a compromise, but on Monday, in typical fashion, the US president came out fighting again: So Xi’s comments at Boao were awaited with some trepidation. Investors were hoping to hear some positive news on China opening up its markets but were also wary of what he might say about Trump’s threats. In the event Xi seemed to make some veiled criticisms of the US but also said China would take measures to widen market access for foreign investors and would lower import tariffs on products including, yes, cars. Here is our report on the speech: The news made for a positive performance on Asian stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.74%, and this is likely to translate into an opening rise in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Once again it is the background noise that is driving short term sentiment with big swings intraday making the price action difficult to predict. [Xi’s] pledges to open up China’s economy and lower import tariffs, while nothing particularly new, sent Asia markets higher and are likely to translate into a positive European open this morning. Whether they translate into anything other than words is another story but for now they appear to signal a willingness for China to move forward the discussions on trade with the US. But things are likely to remain volatile. For a start, as we know, Trump is nothing if not unpredictable, so his response to Xi’s comments will be interesting. Plus there are wider issues to unsettle investors. The imposition of sanctions by the US on a number of Russian companies sent the country’s market sharply lower on Monday, while growing tensions over Syria are also causing concern. The recent appointment of the hawkish John Bolton as the US national security advisor may not help matters. There is also the continuing dispute between the UK and Russia over the Salisbury poisoning. In the US itself, there are more uncertainties. The country faces a $1trn deficit, while Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had his office raided by the FBI. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The raid was in connection with payments to adult star Stormy Daniels and conducted by the Justice Department with help from a referral from the Mueller investigation. The escalation that people are watching out for is that Trump responds by firing Robert Mueller. Political fireworks at home would put extra pressure on delicate trade negotiations. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic and corporate front, ahead of the start of the big US earnings season later this week.

A study from the Australian Human Rights Commission in collaboration with the University of Sydney Business School, the Committee for Sydney and the Asia Society Australia examines the cultural backgrounds of chief executives of ASX 200 companies, federal ministers, heads of federal and state government departments, and vice-chancellors of universities. It also delves down a rung, looking at the cultural backgrounds of senior management at the level directly below the high flyers – group executives of ASX 200 companies, federal MPs, deputy heads of government departments and deputy vice-chancellors of universities. Despite decades of focus on multiculturalism, on Australia’s place in the Asian region and increasing economic participation and opportunity for Indigenous people, the study, to be released on Wednesday, highlights an Australian leadership cadre that does not reflect the growing diversity of the country it serves. The study finds 75.9% of the 2490 people occupying the most senior posts in Australia are from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds, while 19% have a European background, 4.7% a non-European background and 0.4% an Indigenous background. “Described another way, about 95% of senior leaders in Australia have an Anglo-Celtic or European background,” the report says. “Although those who have non-European and Indigenous backgrounds make up an estimated 24% of the Australian population, such backgrounds account for only 5% of senior leaders. “Cultural diversity is particularly low within the senior leadership of Australian government departments and Australian universities. Of the 372 chief executives and equivalents identified in this study, we find that 76.9% of chief executives have an Anglo-Celtic background, 20.1% have a European background and 2.7% have a non-European background. “There is one chief executive who has an Indigenous background (0.3%).” Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says the research “challenges Australia’s egalitarian self-image” and he has challenged organisations and institutions to take committed action to address leadership, internal systems and organisational culture. Soutphommasane says the data also “challenges Australia as a nation whose prosperity relies upon international trade, capital inflows and mobility of people”. “It would be complacent to believe that it will only be a matter of time before cultural diversity is better represented,” he said. “There remains limited cultural diversity that appears in the leadership pipeline, as demonstrated by our findings regarding non-chief executive senior leaders”. The race discrimination commissioner said the experience of gender equality also demonstrated the power of having data and public reporting on progress. “If we are committed to deepening our success as a multicultural society, there must be consideration of collection and reporting of comprehensive data on cultural diversity within Australian organisations and institutions.” The new report updates research undertaken in 2016 examining the same trends. The ongoing research series reflect the fact Australia does not yet officially collect comprehensive data on cultural diversity within organisations and institutions. Currently, there are no official statistics on the ethnic or cultural composition of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, during the census, collects data on place of birth, languages spoken at home and self-identified ancestry but that data does not comprise a comprehensive measure of Australia’s cultural diversity. The independent research is an effort to drive a public conversation with the ambition of shifting organisational and institutional attitudes to leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/10/sex-workers-fear-violence-as-us-cracks-down-on-online-ads-girls-will-die","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:00:24Z","webTitle":"Sex workers fear violence as US cracks down on online ads: 'Girls will die'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/sex-workers-fear-violence-as-us-cracks-down-on-online-ads-girls-will-die","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/sex-workers-fear-violence-as-us-cracks-down-on-online-ads-girls-will-die","fields":{"headline":"Sex workers fear violence as US cracks down on online ads: 'Girls will die'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Phoenix Calida’s friends are preparing for death. Some are sending photos of tattoos to make it easier to identify their bodies. Others are giving instructions for eulogies. Calida, 35, is a Chicago-based sex worker who has depended on websites that host classified ads, such as Craigslist and Backpage.com, to meet and screen clients. But the US government’s recent crackdown on those platforms has abruptly eliminated many workers’ primary source of income, forcing some to turn to the streets or to rely on abusive pimps, greatly increasing the risk of violence. “Girls are going back to the streets and they are going to die in the streets, and nobody cares,” said Calida, a mother of two, who said she used to do street work and fears she will have to start again to make ends meet. “Everybody is terrified.” Congress recently passed legislation with bipartisan support that purports to combat online sex trafficking by making websites criminally liable for users’ content. But some say the Online Sex Trafficking Act (Fosta) and Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (Sesta) will have the opposite effect. Critics argue that the legislation broadly censors online speech, takes income away from people who engage in consensual sex work, and helps traffickers get away with crimes by pushing the industry underground. Emily Benavides, a spokeswoman for Senator Rob Portman, Sesta’s sponsor, defended the bill in an email, saying it was “narrowly crafted” and “gives state law enforcement the tools they need to go after criminals who traffic women and children online”, adding: “This bill was widely supported on a bipartisan basis, and we’re proud that it will become the law of the land.” Donald Trump is expected to sign the law this week, but sex workers across the country told the Guardian they were already suffering consequences. Craigslist shut down its personals section, and federal authorities seized Backpage.com, releasing an indictment this week accusing its founders of money laundering and “facilitating prostitution”. The list of charges did not include trafficking. “It’s devastating,” said a sex worker who goes by the name Jala Dixon. “They just took everything from me.” Dixon, who is based in Georgia, said she chose to do sex work to help save money for school and that she was now considering turning to the streets. “This is really not doing anything but making us unsafe and putting us at risk.” Sex worker rights groups have long argued that initiatives targeting child trafficking end up hurting the most marginalized workers by broadly criminalizing the industry. That includes queer and transgender people, the homeless and others who have been excluded from traditional employment. Defenders of Backpage and Craigslist say those sites gave workers control over their jobs and allowed people to detect and report traffickers. When Calida worked on the streets in her 20s, she said, she would face abuse from clients and police. Some men would demand sex without condoms, cross her boundaries, refuse to pay, or physically hurt her, said Calida, who asked to be quoted under the name she uses for online writing and activism. She said passersby had thrown garbage at her. “I really, really, really don’t want to have to do this,” she said, explaining that on sites like Craigslist and Backpage workers could negotiate terms in advance, request that clients provide references, run cross-checks on clients’ email addresses, and communicate with other sex workers about dangerous or violent people to avoid. Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the Sex Workers Outreach Project of Sacramento, said her phone had been ringing off the hook since the seizure of Backpage: “The fear is astronomical.” One woman told her she was forced to return to an abusive client due to the lost income, she said. Others have resorted to taking on “managers” who have leverage over the women and their income and could exploit them, she added. “Very easily, you can lose control of your own life.” “This bill is creating an actual market for pimps,” Calida said, adding: “People don’t know if they are going to be able to pay rent … how they are going to afford food.” DiAngelo said she also feared the crackdowns could extend to organizations like hers that focus on harm reduction initiatives, such as handing out condoms. Could prosecutors accuse her of facilitating prostitution? “They’ve just unemployed massive amounts of marginalized people,” she added, “They’re taking away life-saving resources.” Kit, who is in her late 20s and works as an escort, said that she chooses to do sex work because it has provided sustainable income. Under the law, however, she could be treated as a trafficking victim, even though she said she was not being coerced: “Sex work is the thing that gives me an ability to make a living wage and kind of do OK for myself … It’s what works for me.” Jackie Monroe, a 25-year-old California woman, said she was previously a victim of trafficking and was forced to do sex work. But Monroe, who asked to use her nickname to protect the privacy of her children, said she didn’t believe shutting down the websites and arresting people for prostitution would help victims like her. “It hurts my heart,” she said, thinking of women she knows who will now work on the street. She noted that law enforcement never helped her when she was a victim, instead charging her with prostitution and loitering offenses. “How is this protecting us? How is this saving us?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/apr/10/family-justice-wider-reform-cafcass-outstanding","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:31:13Z","webTitle":"Family justice needs wider reform, says Lib Dem peer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/10/family-justice-wider-reform-cafcass-outstanding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/apr/10/family-justice-wider-reform-cafcass-outstanding","fields":{"headline":"Family justice needs wider reform, says Lib Dem peer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The successful turnaround of Cafcass, the once-troubled agency responsible for representing children’s interests in England’s family courts, will count for little unless the wider system is reformed, the agency’s former chair is warning. Claire Tyler, the Liberal Democrat peer who led the Cafcass board since 2012, says the agency – the UK’s biggest employer of social workers – is one of three critical strands in the welfare of children caught up in family disputes. Attention must turn to the family justice process itself, and to children’s social care. “We need some kind of campaign, some grouping or alliance to put a new focus on this whole issue,” says Lady Tyler, who stepped down at the end of March to be succeeded by former Conservative children’s minister Edward Timpson. “It’s something that really struggles to get anywhere at the top of the political agenda.” Cafcass, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, has just achieved an outstanding rating from Ofsted. Set up in 2001, the agency endured a torrid early existence and, as recently as 2010, was condemned by MPs on the Commons public accounts committee as unfit for purpose. Tyler attributes the turnaround to the consistent leadership of Anthony Douglas, Cafcass’s chief executive since 2004, who Tyler says has patiently built a strong and values-based organisation from the divided and chaotic team he inherited. “At one stage, its future looked very dodgy indeed,” she says. But Tyler cautions that the success of Cafcass is only half the battle: the greater advance for children will come if the family justice process is reformed so that fewer cases end up in court, and if relentless cuts to children’s services are stopped and begin to be reversed. Demand for Cafcass’s services has soared in recent years. The number of care applications it dealt with rose 31% between 2014-15 and 2016-17. The annual total appears to have peaked for now at more than 14,000 applications, but the number of private law cases has topped 40,000 a year. Tyler, who was chief executive of relationships support charity Relate before joining Cafcass, thinks it is essential to “get upstream” of many more of these cases and seek to resolve them informally, often by drawing on the expertise of local not-for-profit groups. Cafcass has recently launched a pilot project in Manchester, supporting parents to reach arrangements for child custody and access without going to court. Tyler is also impressed by Australia’s network of family relationship centres, developed since 2006. While Tyler remains in no doubt that the English system needs more funding as a whole, she has been struck by the skewed allocation of resources. “It so often seems to be feast or famine,” she says. “You can have too many people in the room at care proceedings – social workers, solicitors, children’s guardians, independent reviewing officers – yet in other cases there can be simply not enough support available.” At Relate, Tyler chaired a short-lived initiative which sought to highlight the needs of children caught between parents living apart or feuding. At the time, hopes were high that the family justice review in 2011 would lead to lasting reform of the system. Measures enacted in 2014 under the Children and Families Act aimed to do so, but Tyler believes the results – so far – have fallen short. “We need to move much more towards the vision of that review,” she says. Does she have plans to revive Kids in the Middle now she has stepped down from Cafcass? “I’m taking some time to think about what’s next,” she says. “But for the sake of the children in these cases, we desperately need something to happen.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The environment secretary has launched a consultation into a ban and called on industry experts and campaigners to submit evidence. The consultation will also look at the possibility of introducing higher welfare standards for the transportation of live animals. Current rules of the European single market currently stop the UK from preventing the export of live animals for slaughter. Last year up to 20,000 live sheep, but no cattle, were exported to Europe, according to the National Farmers’ Union. Live exports count for only a small proportion of the UK’s £2.4bn trade in meat and livestock products with the EU. Launching the consultation, Gove said the UK already had some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world but the government was committed to a manifesto promise to improve them further. “All animals deserve to get the respect and care they deserve at every stage of their lives,” he said. “With all options being considered, I am keen to hear from industry, the devolved authorities and charities on all possible options and evidence on this vital issue.” Campaigners against live exports of livestock welcomed the move. Marc Cooper, the head of the RSPCA’s farm animals department, said the charity had been calling for a ban for decades. “It’s unacceptable and completely unnecessary that live animals are exported and transported over long distances for slaughter or further fattening,” he said. “We would like to see live exports from the UK banned and a maximum journey time of eight hours introduced. This is a chance to end the practice for good and we look forward to contributing to the review.” Animals should be slaughtered as close to farms as possible, said John Fishwick, the president of the British Veterinary Association. “It is vital that we maintain the UK’s current high standards of animal welfare post-Brexit and seek opportunities to improve them. We look forward to contributing to this call and seeing the results once the evidence has been collected,” he said. The shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, called the announcement weak and said Labour’s plan went further by proposing a ban on transporting live animals for slaughter or fattening. “It is just the latest in a string of desperate attempts by the Tories to portray themselves as animal-friendly,” she said. “Over the last year the Tories have supported a free vote on bringing back fox hunting and overseen the largest number of badgers culled across England on record.” The Farm Animal Welfare Committee has also launched a review into existing welfare standards for animals during transport and further research on the issue is being carried out by Scotland’s Rural College and the University of Edinburgh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/video-appears-show-cheers-israeli-sniper-shoots-palestinian","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T14:24:56Z","webTitle":"Video emerges of cheering as Israeli sniper shoots Palestinian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/video-appears-show-cheers-israeli-sniper-shoots-palestinian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/video-appears-show-cheers-israeli-sniper-shoots-palestinian","fields":{"headline":"Video emerges of cheering as Israeli sniper shoots Palestinian","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Footage has emerged of an Israeli sniper shooting a seemingly unarmed and motionless Palestinian man in the Gaza Strip, followed by exuberant whooping from an onlooker. Israel’s military said an initial inquiry found the shooting had taken place on 22 December, when one of its soldiers injured the man in his leg during what it called violent riots. The grainy video comes after almost two weeks of daily protests by Palestinians on the Israel-Gaza border in which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have fatally shot more than two dozen people and wounded hundreds more, according to Gazan health officials. The short clip, which was widely shared on social media and shown on Israeli prime-time television, appears to have been filmed through a pair of binoculars. It shows several young men in the distance, metres from the fortified wire perimeter fence, including one in a pink top. “Do you have a bullet in the barrel?” asks a voice off-camera in Hebrew. A crack is heard and the man falls suddenly. “Wow, what a video. Yes! Son of a whore!” another person says as people are seen running towards the victim to help. “Wow. They hit someone in the head,” says an off-camera voice. In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, the IDF said its troops were responding to “a violent riot, which included rock hurling and attempts to sabotage the security fence”. The film, less than a minute-and-a-half long, did not show stone-throwing or people damaging infrastructure. The IDF said it had issued verbal warnings, used riot dispersal methods and fired warning shots. “After none of these were successful, a single bullet was fired towards one of the Palestinians, who is suspected of organising and leading this incident,” it said. “He was hit in the leg and injured.” It asaid the footage was filmed, without authorisation, by a soldier who was not part of the unit that fired, adding: “[The statements made] do not suit the degree of restraint expected of IDF soldiers and will be dealt by commanders accordingly.” Ayman Odeh, a politician from Israel’s Arab minority, said: “It is a clip that terrifies the soul, rejoicing over the taking of a life and what appears to be the execution of someone who endangered no one.” The video was reported extensively in the Israeli press. The Jerusalem Post had compared the attack to the case of a military medic – nicknamed the “Hebron shooter” – who was sentenced to 18 months in prison last year for killing an already incapacitated Palestinian attacker. “Unless there is more than meets the eye, this could easily be the start of a whole new saga of an IDF soldier on trial,” the paper reported. Israel’s army has been the focus of intense international scrutiny for its lethal response to demonstrations by Gaza’s residents along the frontier. Soldiers killed at least a dozen Palestinians in December during confrontations in Gaza and the West Bank after Donald Trump announced the unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital on 6 December. On 30 March, the “Great March of Return” kicked off, a planned six-week protest in Gaza culminating every Friday and calling for refugees and their descendants to be allowed back to their family homes in Israel. Tents have been set up to accommodate women and children. Groups of men closer to the perimeter have burned tyres and thrown stones. The Israeli military has stationed sharpshooters to enforce a no-go zone within Gaza that straddles the fence. No Israeli has been wounded. The United Nations and the European Union have called for an independent investigation into the killings, requests that were promptly rejected by Israel’s defence minister. Israel has accused Gaza’s rulers and protest supporters, Hamas, of using violent riots to camouflage terror. An IDF spokesperson has said anyone approaching the fence could potentially be shot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/10/great-barrier-reef-conservationists-campaign-for-net-free-zone-to-protect-dugongs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T07:19:03Z","webTitle":"Great Barrier Reef: conservationists campaign for net-free zone to protect dugongs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/great-barrier-reef-conservationists-campaign-for-net-free-zone-to-protect-dugongs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/10/great-barrier-reef-conservationists-campaign-for-net-free-zone-to-protect-dugongs","fields":{"headline":"Great Barrier Reef: conservationists campaign for net-free zone to protect dugongs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Conservationists plan to establish a commercial fishing net-free zone in the northern Great Barrier Reef by buying and retiring the area’s last remaining licence. WWF-Australia will launch a crowdfunding campaign to buy the 600m net operating out of Princess Charlotte Bay in the far north, which would effectively end gillnetting in an area spanning 700km from Cooktown to the Torres Strait. The move would create one of the world’s largest dugong havens. About 50 dugongs a year are entangled in nets along the Queensland coast. To succeed, WWF needs donations from the public to buy the licence from an operator approaching retirement, who could otherwise sell it to a new fishing venture. Some negotiations have already taken place. The push also needs Queensland government backing to prevent the holders of existing commercial fishing licences from moving into the area. The conservationists believe that buying out the last regular operator can pave the way for the government to declare 85,000 square kilometres of the north “net free”. The WWF-Australia tropical fisheries and aquaculture manager, Jim Higgs, said the last licence was responsible for about 80% of the catch in the area. “By buying this licence, WWF would make it easier for the government to achieve a net-free north because taxpayers wouldn’t have to fund a payout to the fisher,” Higgs said. “Once WWF retires the licence, it’s crucial the government ends gillnetting in the far north because there’s nothing currently to stop other licence holders from moving in. With no local knowledge they may struggle to minimise interactions with protected species.” Higgs visited the licence holder last year and WWF is in the process of valuing and negotiating a price to effectively retire the 600m net. Dugongs are listed as vulnerable. Because dugongs are slow to breed, small losses can badly impact the population. Conversely the end to netting could have a significant impact on the species. James Cook university dugong expert Helene Marsh said the northern part of the reef was the most important area for dugongs. “They are very important feeding grounds, we must do everything we can in that area to conserve dugongs,” she said. “Fishermen don’t want to catch dugongs but they can do accidentally. The dugong doesn’t see the net and gets tangled. Unless the fishermen are sitting right on the net and cut it out quickly, the dugong drowns.” WWF-Australia estimates dugong numbers have fallen to fewer than 10,000. The population was significantly reduced, from about 72,000 in the early 1960s, mainly due to human-made pressures between Cairns and Brisbane. More than half of that population lives north of Cooktown. Higgs said the area was “the last stronghold” and there was no place for gill netting to continue. WWF estimates it will cost a six-figure sum to purchase and retire the licence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/10/qantas-boss-accuses-abc-of-anti-business-bias-over-emma-alberici-tax-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T03:39:36Z","webTitle":"Qantas boss accuses ABC of anti-business bias over Emma Alberici tax stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/10/qantas-boss-accuses-abc-of-anti-business-bias-over-emma-alberici-tax-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/10/qantas-boss-accuses-abc-of-anti-business-bias-over-emma-alberici-tax-stories","fields":{"headline":"Qantas boss accuses ABC of anti-business bias over Emma Alberici tax stories","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has accused the ABC of having an anti-business bias in a letter of complaint about the “slanted analysis” and “poor reporting” in economics correspondent Emma Alberici’s company tax stories. In the letter to the ABC managing director, Michelle Guthrie, Joyce wrote: “Any reasonable person consuming the ABC’s coverage would incorrectly be led to believe that Qantas (along with other large corporations) was in some way shirking its tax responsibilities and not contributing to the Australian economy. This could not be further from the truth.” Joyce’s letter, along with letters of complaint from the prime minister’s office and the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, were tabled in the Senate on Tuesday in response to questions on notice at estimates. “Emma Alberici’s story – ‘Tax-free billions: Australia’s largest companies haven’t paid corporate tax in 10 years’ – is not only grossly inaccurate and unbalanced, it implies these reputable Australian companies have broken the law,” Westacott wrote. “The leading companies under attack in Ms Alberici’s report employ thousands of Australian workers, pay taxes, pay dividends, make other contributions, and invest heavily in the Australian economy. “Equally, Business Council member companies provided material information to Ms Alberici but it was not included in the story. “Despite our members providing detailed and important context to Ms Alberici, much of this was ignored in order to give the impression that business was somehow acting in bad faith. This is despite the very same member companies being mentioned in the story multiple times. “Nationwide, business provides five out of every six jobs, the private sector is responsible for 80% of Australia’s economic output and paid $71bn of company tax in 2016-17.” The ABC has detailed nine errors in Alberici’s news story for the first time in answers to previous questions on notice. At Senate estimates in February, Guthrie and her editorial policy adviser, Alan Sunderland, declined to pinpoint a single error, but the ABC has always maintained there were errors in the news story. The errors included a misleading headline that was not written by the reporter and mistakes such as calling MYOB a “corporate advisor” rather than a software company, a point Alberici disagrees with because the company does offer an advisory service according to its website. “ABC News and the editorial team identified errors in fact as well as omissions of fact that required editing,” the ABC said. One error was that it was “not clear what the author means by ‘generous tax concessions’ in relation to Qantas. Depreciation, amortisation and operating losses are not tax concessions”. Another said “Etihad, Emirates and Qatar are not Australian airlines” in relation to a line in the story that called them “Australia’s biggest airlines”. However, the sub-editor introduced this mistake not Alberici. The ABC told the Senate no factual errors were identified in the initial post-publication review. “The key editorial findings identified possible breaches of the ABC’s editorial standards in relation to impartiality. The ABC’s Audience &amp; Consumer Affairs investigation is ongoing,” it said. The ABC removed Alberici’s analysis piece on 15 February. The answers to questions from Labor senator Kristina Keneally reveal the director of news, Gaven Morris, raised concerns with news executives about Alberici’s news and analysis stories at 7.06am on 14 February, only a couple of hours after they had been published and before the ABC had received the letters from Westacott and Malcolm Turnbull. An email from Morris to his deputy, Craig McMurtrie, read: “Are we sure about this? Did we give the companies listed a chance to respond? It’s a great story if true. My worry is it sounds too sensational to be true – and it’d be good to know we had a rock solid process of checking and vetting the facts.” “At 9.54 on 14 February, Craig emailed Emma saying that it was a strong story but that he had questions about whether she had consulted the Australian Taxation Office and the use of the term ‘exclusive’,” the ABC told the Senate. The ABC amended the news piece but did not remove the analysis piece from its website until late on 15 February, after receiving the complaints. It was extensively rewritten and republished a week later. In a 12-point letter of complaint to Guthrie, Turnbull’s office said “the Alberici ‘Analysis’ piece should not be labelled ‘Analysis’. It should be labelled ‘Opinion’. This is a frequently repeated ABC mistake.” Keneally had also asked the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, if he had ever complained about reports by journalists from other publications, including Greg Jericho of Guardian Australia and Ian Verrender of ABC Online. “The treasurer’s office regularly provides clarifications, context and feedback on articles by journalists of all stripes and, yes, both genders,” the answer said. The ABC confirmed that the headlines for the analysis piece and the news story were not written by Alberici, who also had no input into the selection of photographs or captions. The photograph of Joyce alongside his salary was a matter of contention. “However, the final versions of both stories were shown to Emma prior to publication for review,” the ABC said. But Alberici says she was not shown the final version with headline before publication at 5am. “Both the analysis piece and the news story were reviewed by Deborah Auchinachie from ABC Legal prior to publication. The stories did not give rise to any legal issues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/10/chicken-salt-we-find-the-creator-of-an-australian-classic-and-he-tells-us-everything","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T02:47:16Z","webTitle":"Chicken salt: we find the creator of an Australian classic – and he tells us everything","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/10/chicken-salt-we-find-the-creator-of-an-australian-classic-and-he-tells-us-everything","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/10/chicken-salt-we-find-the-creator-of-an-australian-classic-and-he-tells-us-everything","fields":{"headline":"Chicken salt: we find the creator of an Australian classic – and he tells us everything","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Brinkworth was born in 1942 in Tumby Bay on the east coast of South Australia’s Eyre peninsula. It’s home to some of the best seafood in the world, but his momentous contribution to Australian cuisine has very little to do with fish. Peter Brinkworth is Jodie’s dad. Peter Brinkworth invented chicken salt. Last week I wrote in the Guardian about the origins of Australia’s most beloved seasoning. It involved a story that swirled around my childhood, that my schoolfriend Jodie’s dad might have had something to do with it. The machinery of the internet began to whirl. At the weekend I received a Facebook message from Helen Brinkworth, Jodie’s mum, that seemed to confirm the rumour. Separately, an unverified user calling himself “Peter Brinkworth” commented on the piece offering that the chicken salt on sale today bears “little resemblance to the original”. Then came the final piece of the puzzle – an email from Jodie herself, who had recently returned to Australia after more than a decade in France. Mildly indignant to discover I’d spent the best part of 30 years quietly questioning her honesty, she sent me her father’s phone number and encouraged me to get the story “from the horse’s mouth”. I was straight on the phone. “G’day, Adam,” came Peter’s voice on the end of the line. “I’ve been waiting to hear from you.” Peter’s parents, Ron and Ivy Brinkworth, were broadacre farmers growing cereals on the Eyre peninsula, and he has always stayed close to his farming roots. He was a stock agent for Elders for much of his working life, farmed poultry for a while, and in the early 1970s found himself as proprietor of Brinkworth Poultry, Game and Seafood – a wholesale food supplier in Gawler. The Brinkworths had a small shop attached to the wholesale warehouse where Peter and his daughters roasted chickens over charcoal and fried chips in beef tallow for direct sale to a hungry public. It didn’t have a name or even a sign, but Peter says most people just called it “The Gawler Chicken Shop”. At the time, Australia was just finding its feet when it came to the idea of a quick chicken dinner. Broiler chickens raised specifically for meat had only started to gain popularity in the 60s and, before that, chickens in Australia had been dual-purpose birds providing both eggs and meat. Those earlier breeds took months to mature, so chicken was a relatively expensive meat more suited to a Sunday roast or special occasion. Broilers matured faster, lowering the cost of chicken, and those favourable economics gave rise to the local chicken shop. Chickens were seasoned lightly in the early days of chicken shops – a bit of bread stuffing inside, just salt and pepper outside. If you were one of the many customers for whom stuffing wasn’t to taste, there was little option other than a bland bird. Peter says he has always suffered from a tendency to try too hard to do things a little bit better. It was this instinct that led him to try his hand at improving the recipe of his chickens. He mixed his original chicken salt in the shed where they prepared the birds for roasting. It was a blend of ingredients from his kitchen, as well as a few wholesale products from his warehouse. His original chicken salt included onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, paprika, chicken bouillon and monosodium glutamate. The vibrant orange-yellow colour came from the addition of curry powder. He can’t remember the specific brand but, as a lifelong Keen’s man, he suspects it might have been that. Keen’s is an interesting addition. It’s an Australian blend developed in Tasmania in the 19th century and, while curry powders abroad usually contain cumin for its distinctive “curry” taste, Keen’s does not. This may explain why its mild blend of sweet spices doesn’t dominate when chicken salt is used as a chip seasoning. I ask Peter if he remembers the exact quantities. “Not after all these years,” he says, “But it wouldn’t be hard to work it out. I still remember how it tastes.” The seasoning was an instant hit at the Brinkworths’ chicken shop, and soon Peter was making batches in his back shed, pouring it between two red 10-litre buckets to mix it. The bouillon was particularly problematic, Peter recalls. If the quantities weren’t right it would clump and clog the shaker. Peter would shake the salt all over the chickens, inside and out, before roasting. Peter’s eldest daughter, Tina, worked at the chicken shop after school, and says they received so many requests for the salt that they started selling small plastic bags of it over the counter for just a few cents, so people could add it to their own chickens at home. It wasn’t long before it progressed to the chips. In the late 70s the Brinkworths were hit by tragedy. Peter lost his middle daughter to cancer and the turmoil led him to simplify his business holdings. He sold Brinkworth Poultry, Game and Seafood to the Mitani family, primarily as a wholesale business, but the retail shop went along with the sale – which included Peter’s recipe for his original chicken salt. Peter is retired now, and these days he steers clear from the commercial varieties of chicken salt. He prefers instead to mix his own version as he always has, which he always keeps on hand in his kitchen. “It’s great on anything!” he says. “Steaks, chicken … even on eggs in the morning.” He’s a little bemused by his place in Australian food history. It’s one that might have been forgotten if it hadn’t been for Jodie. “Jodie wouldn’t even have been born when we first made the chicken salt, but she’s always been fascinated by it – telling her friends about the salt we used back in the day.” After speaking for an hour, its time for Peter to go. He has to pick up Jodie’s kids from school but he invites me around for dinner next time I’m back home in Adelaide. “We’ll get Jodie and the families around and cook something,” he says. “I’ll even mix you up a batch of chicken salt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/10/the-rule-everyone-hates-how-goalie-interference-could-ruin-the-nhl-playoffs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"The rule everyone hates: how goalie interference could ruin the NHL playoffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/10/the-rule-everyone-hates-how-goalie-interference-could-ruin-the-nhl-playoffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/10/the-rule-everyone-hates-how-goalie-interference-could-ruin-the-nhl-playoffs","fields":{"headline":"The rule everyone hates: how goalie interference could ruin the NHL playoffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The NHL playoffs begin on Wednesday, as the remaining 16 teams get set to begin what they hope will be a two-month journey towards the Stanley Cup. It’s a great time to be a hockey fan. But this year, there’s a cloud hanging over everything. A controversy over the league’s goaltender interference rules has flared up periodically all season long, especially down the stretch. And that has fans wondering when – not if – a key game is going to be determined by an interference call that everyone hates. So what’s the problem, and what if anything can the NHL do about it? Let’s dig into it, Q&amp;A style. So what is goaltender interference? Goaltending is a tough job. You’re expected to stop pucks that can be traveling 100mph. Opposing players are constantly buzzing around you, or planting themselves in front of you to block your view. Those players will also occasionally hack at a puck you’re trying to cover, or bump into you as you’re trying to establish position. And occasionally they’ll just slam right into you at top speed, knocking you flying. Some of that is legal. But a lot of it isn’t, and the goaltender is supposed to be given a certain amount of protection by the referees. For that reason, there are various rules about what the opposing players can and can’t do, and if they violate those rules in the course of scoring a goal, it’s not supposed to count. So far so good. Where’s the problem? For years, goaltender interference was a call that could only be made by the referee on the ice. That generally worked fine, but there were cases where it felt like a call got missed. For example, here’s a play from 2010 in which a player outright steamrolls a goaltender, and the goal somehow still stands. Those sorts of plays were rare, but when they did happen there was no remedy. Surely, many of us figured, there had to be a better way. And so, beginning with the 2015-16 season, the league added replay review for goaltender interference. Coaches could ask for a review if they felt an interference call had been missed, at the cost of a timeout if the play was upheld. The idea was that this was a way to catch those obvious misses. It’s a tough call to make in real-time and we have the technology to take another look, the thinking went, so let’s get it right. And did the new review rule do that? Sort of. There certainly were some bad calls that were overturned on a challenge. But it quickly became apparent that the challenge was going to be used far more often than most of us thought. Goals are crucial, especially in today’s low-scoring NHL. And since losing a timeout is a relatively small penalty for being wrong, it made sense for coaches to challenge just about anything that looked like it had any hope of being overturned. In theory, that should have meant that we had to sit through a bunch of failed challenges. That would have been annoying – these things can drag on for a while and suck the momentum out of the game – but we could have lived with it. But that’s not what happened. Instead, the officials started overturning calls fairly often. And many of those reversals came on plays that were far from obvious. Instead of only catching the clear misses, calls were being changed on what amounted to nit-picking. Eventually it started to feel like there was a goal being reviewed somewhere almost every night. And often, nobody knew what the result would be until it was announced. Wait, all this sounds familiar. Didn’t we already do this “replay review is going to ruin the playoffs” thing? You may be thinking of the offside review, which was also introduced for the 2015-16 season. We covered the offside review controversy back in 2016, when fans were worried it would screw up a key playoff game. And sure enough, that’s what ended up happening. So the interference problem is as bad as the offside review? Oh no. It’s far worse. When instant replay works well in sports, it’s for calls that are black-and-white. The shot crossed the goal line, or it didn’t. The ball was fair, or it was foul. The receiver’s foot came down in bounds or out of bounds. The NHL’s offside rule would seem to fit into that category too. In practice, the review rule was so broad that it led to goals being waved off for plays that had little or nothing to do with the scoring play. But at least in theory, offside makes sense as a reviewable play. But goaltender interference is different, because the rule as currently written is almost entirely subjective. Officials have to make determinations like whether contact with a goaltender was intentional or incidental, whether it was forced by the actions of a defending player, and whether it prevented the goaltender from making a save he otherwise would have. Replay doesn’t help you much there, because with the rare exception of the very obvious blown calls, almost all the decisions fall into a grey area. They’re the sort of calls that two fans can view from the same angle and come to very different conclusions (especially if they’re biased because their teams are involved). Making those calls in real-time will always get you an occasional controversy. But when you subject them to frame-by-frame replay breakdowns that fans have been told will result in “just getting it right”, you’re setting expectations that are impossible to meet. The closest comparable would be the NFL’s use of replay to determine what is or isn’t a catch. That one also features a moderately complicated rule with a subjective component. And it’s no coincidence that NFL fans hate it, and are constantly complaining about it. The NFL has been trying to fix that rule for years. And the NHL’s goaltender interference call is far more subjective than the NFL’s catch rule. It was inevitable that everyone would end up hating it. But wait, if the replay rule has been in place for three years, why is everyone only mad about it now? Well, plenty of fans were mad all along, especially when a weird call screwed over their favorite team or happened in an important game. But it certainly feels like something shifted this season. Maybe it took a while for the bad calls to reach a tipping point. Maybe fans just got bored of complaining about offside review and decided they wanted to move onto to something else. Or maybe we’ve just had the bad luck of having some really high-profile calls this year. Whatever it is, we’ve been hearing about the rule all season long. And once everyone started paying close attention, the flaws in the process was obvious. The rule is so subjective that two similar plays will yield different results on different nights, if not in the same game. And to make matters worse, some of this year’s calls really were hard to understand. For example, here’s a Boston goal from February that sees St Louis goalie Jake Allen get pushed out of his crease. The Blues challenged, but the call was upheld and the goal counted. Here’s Winnipeg goalie Connor Hellebuyck getting slashed in the face before a Vegas goal; that one counted too. But when Toronto’s Auston Matthews or Edmonton’s Connor McDavid made comparatively minor contact with goaltenders, the plays were reversed and the goals were taken off the board. With every new controversial call, frustration around the league grows. Complaining about each and every interference call became mandatory around the hockey world, with pundits and fans alike competing to see who could summon the most outrage and feigned confusion. Even Kiefer Sutherland is mad. And through it all, everyone from fans to media to coaches were demanding that the league do something. And did the league do anything? They did try. In January, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman acknowledged that officials were “overthinking” the calls, and reminded them that the reviews were only intended to catch obvious errors. That helped a little – fans still weren’t always clear on how the rule worked, but at least they could assume that most calls would confirmed. And in March, the league changed the process for the reviews themselves so that the final call would be made by an off-ice official instead of the referee, in an effort to get more consistency. People seemed to like that change. Then it went into effect, and one of the first major calls came in a crucial recent game between the Panthers and Predators. A dramatic last-second goal was reviewed for interference, and ultimately waved off despite plenty of fans thinking the evidence wasn’t strong enough to overturn the call on the ice And so here we are, days before the playoffs start, and nobody trusts the system. So how do you solve this? That’s the problem. Everyone says things like “the league needs to fix this”, but nobody seems to actually thought through what that would look like. Some have suggested that the league change the interference rules to remove the subjectivity and make the calls black-and-white. In theory, that sounds great. In reality, it gets you the skate-in-the-crease rule the NHL had in the 1990s, the one that ruined the 1999 final. Going back to that approach should be a non-starter for anyone who remembers those days. That leads to the more effective, albeit extreme, solution: Just get rid of replay review for goaltender interference altogether. Treat the play like any other subjective call: Let the referee on the ice make it, understand that you won’t always agree, and learn to live with it. If an especially bad blown call slips through, well, that’s life in pro sports. It will happen, but rarely enough that it’s not worth making everyone miserable with constant coin-flip reviews all season long jut to avoid it. And can the league do any of that before the playoffs? Nope. Any major change would have to wait until the offseason. In terms of changes they can make today, the league has already done all it can. And it sure doesn’t seem to have been enough. So hockey fans are screwed. Pretty much, yes. At some point during the playoffs, we’re going to get more of these grey area reviews where half the audience is guaranteed to disagree with the result. That’s pretty much a sure thing at this point – these calls are coming so frequently that making it through two months without one is basically a pipe dream. The question is when they happen, and to who. The best case is that they all come in games that have already been decided. But if one of these things happens in a game seven, or overtime, or both, look out. And if, hockey gods forbid, it costs one of the league’s marquee teams a series, we’ll never hear the end of it. So in a few days, when every hockey fan you know is seething over what they swear was an obvious miscarriage of justice while angrily freeze-framing YouTube clips, you’ll know why. Don’t engage in conversation or make eye contact. And whatever you do, don’t make any comments about the importance of “getting it right”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/dont-have-a-cow-the-simpsons-response-to-apu-racism-row-criticised-as-toothless","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T02:41:13Z","webTitle":"'Don't have a cow': The Simpsons response to Apu racism row criticised as 'toothless'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/dont-have-a-cow-the-simpsons-response-to-apu-racism-row-criticised-as-toothless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/dont-have-a-cow-the-simpsons-response-to-apu-racism-row-criticised-as-toothless","fields":{"headline":"'Don't have a cow': The Simpsons response to Apu racism row criticised as 'toothless'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Simpsons has responded to controversy over Indian character Apu in an episode aired in the US on Sunday night with a short message to its audience: “Don’t have a cow”. The scene, however, was immediately criticised as “toothless” and “sad”. The character of the Kwik-E-Mart owner, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, has been voiced by white actor Hank Azaria since he debuted in 1990 during the show’s first season. But a recent documentary by Indian-American standup comic Hari Kondabolu, The Problem with Apu, criticised the character as an example of harmful and widespread stereotyping of south Asians on American television, which “reflected how America viewed us: servile, devious, goofy”, and which has fuelled bullying of and racism towards people of colour. Sunday night’s episode, No Good Read Goes Unpunished, was the first time The Simpsons creators acknowledged the controversy, but their response has not gone down well. In the scene, Marge Simpson wants to read Lisa a book she loved when she was a girl, but realises it is filled with racist stereotypes. She then edits it to feature a “cisgender girl named Clara” who fights for “horse rescue and net neutrality”. But Lisa complains that by making the story “inoffensive” and its lead character “perfect”, Marge has stripped Clara of her emotional journey. “Well, what am I supposed to do?” Marge asks. Lisa turns to face the viewer: “It’s hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?” She then gestures to a photograph of Apu by her bed, inscribed with Bart Simpson’s catchphrase – “Don’t have a cow” – a directive to relax. “Some things will be dealt with at a later date,” Marge promises. “If at all,” Lisa deadpans. The Simpsons executive producer, Al Jean, pre-empted a social media maelstrom, tweeting just before the show aired: “Twitter explosion in act three”. He wasn’t wrong. Kondabolu himself was among the first to respond, criticising the scene as dismissive and “sad”: “Wow. ‘Politically Incorrect?’ That’s the takeaway from my movie &amp; the discussion it sparked? Man, I really loved this show. This is sad.” He continued: “I used Apu &amp; The Simpsons as an entry point into a larger conversation about the representation of marginalized groups &amp; why this is important. The Simpsons response tonight is not a jab at me, but at what many of us consider progress.” Others have called it “completely toothless” and “a callous and resentful shrug”, and have pointed out the irony of having the lines delivered by Lisa, one of the show’s more progressive characters. But some fans have defended the scene as satirical, and the show as one which revels in “equal opportunity” stereotyping. Azaria himself weighed in earlier this year, telling reporters that the show would “definitely address” the controversy after “a lot of thought”. “The Simpsons over the years has been pretty humorously offensive to all manner of people: Republicans, Brazilians, presidents, high school principals, school principals, Italians, you name it,” he said. “And they take a lot of pride over there in not apologising for any of that. I think, over the years, they’ve done a really good job of being, shall we say, uniformly offensive without being outright hurtful.” Azaria also said the fact that it had caused any kind of harm and suffering was “disturbing” and “distressing” to him, adding: “The idea that anybody was marginalised based on it or had a hard time was very upsetting to me personally and professionally.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/10/us-casts-doubt-on-australias-claims-of-permanent-trump-tariff-exemption","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T02:46:33Z","webTitle":"US casts doubt on Australia's claim of permanent exemption from Trump's tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/10/us-casts-doubt-on-australias-claims-of-permanent-trump-tariff-exemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/10/us-casts-doubt-on-australias-claims-of-permanent-trump-tariff-exemption","fields":{"headline":"US casts doubt on Australia's claim of permanent exemption from Trump's tariffs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"US customs officials say Donald Trump has yet to issue any order extending Australia’s exemption from steel tariffs beyond 1 May, despite the government’s claim the exemption would be made permanent. On 8 March the US president signed proclamations imposing a 25% tariff on imports of steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium. On 22 March the plan was qualified with a new instrument that stated Australia was one of a group of countries to be granted an exemption until 30 April “pending discussions of satisfactory long-term alternative means to address the threatened impairment to US national security”. “By May 1, 2018, the president will decide whether to continue to exempt these countries from the tariffs, based on the status of the discussions,” the White House said. Late on Friday, a spokesman for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that until 30 April the orders under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act would not apply to Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil and member countries of the European Union. “CBP will enforce the remedies imposed by the president under section 232 on imports of steel and aluminum from covered countries into the United States,” he said. “The exemptions are currently only effective through April 30. As of May 1st, if no presidential proclamation is issued, all countries listed will no longer be exempt.” Earlier, US Customs advised it would “issue additional guidance on entry requirements for any products excluded from these measures, as soon as information is available”. “CBP will also issue updated guidance if there are any changes to these measures, including any changes to exempted countries and any new requirements, such as quota requirements.” No further CBP guidance or presidential proclamation has listed Australia as permanently exempt. On Thursday the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said Malcolm Turnbull had “secured an agreement with the US president that Australia will be exempt and that continues to be the case”. He said the US had included Australia in the proclamation of a temporary exemption because it could not put in place separate instruments for every country. Ciobo said the agreement was unconditional and it was “hard to imagine” a better deal that could be struck between the US and Australia. Guardian Australia has contacted Ciobo and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ask when and how they expect an unconditional exemption to be formalised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/concerns-china-in-talks-with-vanuatu-about-south-pacific-military-base","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T05:03:22Z","webTitle":"'Impossible': China denies planning military base in Vanuatu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/concerns-china-in-talks-with-vanuatu-about-south-pacific-military-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/concerns-china-in-talks-with-vanuatu-about-south-pacific-military-base","fields":{"headline":"'Impossible': China denies planning military base in Vanuatu","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Chinese embassy spokesman has said the idea that China is planning to establish a military base in Vanuatu is “ridiculous”. Australia’s Fairfax Media reported on Tuesday that China was eyeing a base in the Pacific nation. “That’s impossible,” said Chen Ke, a spokesman for the ambassador to Vanuatu. A senior Vanuatu government adviser concurred: “That conversation was never on the table.” The adviser claimed detailed knowledge of relevant matters in two key ministries and insisted that the topic was never even hinted at. They went on to suggest that the source of the Fairfax story was not the government of Vanuatu. Fairfax reported there had been informal discussions between China and Vanuatu, but no formal offer, about a military buildup. China has diplomatic relations with many Pacific nations and is a major backer of development projects in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, told the ABC on Tuesday morning she remained “confident that Australia is Vanuatu’s strategic partner of choice”. “It is a fact that China is engaging in developing infrastructure and investment activity in places around the world, but to date there is only one military base that China has built, and that’s [in] Djibouti in northern Africa,” she said. “We must remember that Vanuatu is a sovereign nation and its foreign and defence relations are a matter for Vanuatu.” Chen insisted that China’s naval presence in the Pacific islands was humanitarian in nature. He cited an upcoming joint disaster response exercise between New Zealand, Vanuatu and China. Chen said the next scheduled Chinese naval visit to Vanuatu would be in September, when the full-service Chinese naval hospital ship Peace Ark will carry out on a humanitarian visit. The ship contains equipment and facilities that are otherwise unavailable in Vanuatu, including a CT scanner and advanced surgical facilities. A large chunk of Chinese infrastructure funding has been directed to strategically significant assets, including a large wharf facility on the island of Espiritu Santo, site of one of the largest military bases in the Pacific theatre during the second world war. The recently completed 300-metre wharf project was contracted to the Shanghai Construction Group and can safely accommodate two mid-size ships or one large vessel. The head of the national security college at the Australian National University, Prof Rory Medcalf, said any foreign power establishing a foothold in the South Pacific would represent “a long-term failure of Australian policy”. “For the first time since the 1940s, a foreign power with the potential to put Australian interests at risk would have a military presence in the South Pacific,” he said. “I think there’s no question that Australia needs to redouble its efforts to persuade Vanuatu and other Pacific island nations that Australia is and should remain their preferred security partner and development partner. “Perhaps it’s time for New Zealand to get more worried about the implications of Chinese power in the South Pacific as well.” On Tuesday morning the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said “New Zealand is opposed to militarisation of the Pacific”. Her foreign minister, Winston Peters, said: “This is hypothetical as Vanuatu have stated that they are not aware of a military base being built. More generally the militarisation of the Pacific is something we’ve been seriously concerned about as there are certain things that are not good for the long term peace and security of the Pacific, or for democracy itself.” Medcalf said a Chinese military base on Vanuatu would pose significant problems for Australian interests. “I don’t think China would be doing this specifically or solely to harm Australian interests, but there would be harm to Australian interests as a major side-effect of this presence,” he said. “[Vanuatu] would be useful for China if it got itself in a strategic confrontation with the US … to be able to outflank the US and the Japanese. It would allow them to have some forces positioned behind the US base in Guam and would allow China to monitor and patrol the South Pacific Ocean.” Medcalf said China was increasingly seeking to exert influence in the South Pacific. He said establishing a military presence could be a sort of payoff for development aid. Chinese activities in the Pacific have been increasingly viewed through a military lens since the US “pivot” to the region in 2009. The US has a series of bases and training locations – running from Busan in Korea to Darwin in the Northern Territory – that many analysts believe is designed to demonstrate an ability to isolate China and block shipping supply routes. Analyst Charles Edel, a senior fellow at the University of Sydney’s US studies centre, is concerned about the potential that China has been engaging in “debt-trap diplomacy”. “We’ve seen variations on this in other parts of the world,” said Edel, who was an adviser to the former US secretary of state John Kerry. “China does not import [energy] from the South Pacific, which begs the question why are they there. There are a number of other reasons, but one of them is clearly a strategic play, given the US bases in the Pacific. It increases the risks and challenges to the US. “Vanuatu is a sovereign nation that makes its own decisions. But it also makes decisions that it sees in its own interests. The fact is they are one of two pacific nations that recognise China’s expansive claims to the South China Sea and that says something.” Prof Sam Bateman, a professional research fellow at the University of Wollongong’s Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security and a former Australian navy commodore, said Vanuatu would offer “some strategic advantages” for China, but that a military buildup in the country remained unlikely. He said China’s economic interest in the South Pacific was “really only fish”. Bateman said Chinese involvement in the South Pacific could upend the status quo, where Australia and New Zealand take a lead role in the Pacific Islands Forum. “It would be interesting to see what would happen, for example, if China was to play a role in those institutions,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/us-police-killings-kern-county-sheriff-donny-youngblood","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T01:21:55Z","webTitle":"US sheriff once said it was 'financially better' to kill than badly injure suspects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/us-police-killings-kern-county-sheriff-donny-youngblood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/us-police-killings-kern-county-sheriff-donny-youngblood","fields":{"headline":"US sheriff once said it was 'financially better' to kill than badly injure suspects","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The sheriff of a county profiled by the Guardian after it was found to have the highest rate of killings by police in the US once said it is “better financially” for local authorities if officers kill suspects rather than badly injure them. Sheriff Donny Youngblood of Kern county, California, who is currently running for re-election, made the remarks while addressing rank-and-file officers during his first campaign in 2006. Video of the meeting was recently found by an officers’ union. “You know what happens when a guy makes a bad shooting on somebody and kills them? Three million bucks and the family goes away after a long back and forth,” Youngblood said. He went on to say: “Which way do you think is better financially – to cripple them or kill them – for the county?” An unidentified man offscreen said “kill them”, to which Youngblood replied: “Absolutely. Because if they’re crippled we get to take care of them for life. And that cost goes way up.” The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kern county was the subject of a Guardian series after 13 people were killed there by law enforcement officers during 2015. During the same period, nine people were killed by the NYPD in all of New York City, which had almost 10 times as many residents and about 23 times as many law enforcement officers. The series prompted inquiries by California’s attorney general and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which are ongoing. The number of killings by police in the county subsequently fell sharply. The Guardian found five people were killed there in 2016. The Mapping Police Violence project found six deaths in 2017. The Kern County Detention Officers Association posted the video to its Facebook page on Monday. The group, which represents about 300 of Youngblood’s deputies, called for the sheriff to be replaced, saying that their department was in “desperate need of positive changes” and urging voters to select a sheriff with new ideas. Chris Ashley, a director of the association, told the Guardian that the group was “disgusted” by the sheriff’s remarks. “But we have been disgusted with Donny Youngblood’s leadership for more than a decade,” he said. Ashley said the entire discussion lasted more than an hour and covered other “concerning things” but that the group was not yet prepared to release the full tape. Youngblood is running for re-election against his chief deputy, Justin Fleeman – the first time that he has faced an opponent since entering office. The contest is also the first that Youngblood has faced since the Guardian’s series in 2015. Fleeman has been endorsed by all three unions of officers at the sheriff’s department. Ashley said his group was concerned primarily about understaffing and mandatory overtime shifts. “Our personal feeling is that [Youngblood] doesn’t care about our families, and it has taken a toll on all of us,” he said. “People are leaving for jobs as gardeners, bus drivers, janitors, truck drivers, and other law enforcement agencies. People are just worn out. We’re exhausted. We can’t take it any more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/10/greater-wages-boost-from-investment-subsidy-than-company-tax-cut-study","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T00:19:02Z","webTitle":"Greater wages boost from investment subsidy than company tax cut – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/greater-wages-boost-from-investment-subsidy-than-company-tax-cut-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/greater-wages-boost-from-investment-subsidy-than-company-tax-cut-study","fields":{"headline":"Greater wages boost from investment subsidy than company tax cut – study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A subsidy for companies would increase investment in Australia by two to three times more than corporate tax cuts, with larger flow-on benefits to wages, a new study has found. The study by two Victoria University academics, released on Tuesday, measures the effectiveness of investment stimulus policies in Australia. It gives some support for Turnbull government claims a company tax cut can boost employment and wages, but concludes that an investment subsidy is the superior option. In March the Turnbull government delayed cutting the tax rate from 30% to 25% over 10 years for companies with revenues over $50m, after failing to secure support from senators Derryn Hinch and Tim Storer. The impact of tax cuts on the economy is central to the lobbying on both sides. Opponents argue almost half the benefit of tax cuts will flow to overseas investors, while Treasury officials estimate the tax cut would boost wages by just $750 over time. The study by Janine Dixon and Jason Nassios to be presented at the Melbourne Economic Forum found that for a fixed budgetary cost of $5bn, the government could cut company tax by 3.8% or give an investment subsidy of 1.6%. The researchers concluded that “the investment subsidy is between two and three times more effective as a stimulus to investment than the company tax rate cut”. The investment subsidy “enables the full $5bn package to be deployed on increasing post-tax rates of return on capital and inducing a relatively large investment response”, the researchers wrote. The company tax cut “has limited effectiveness in changing the post-tax rate of return for domestic investors, because of the impact of dividend imputation”. As a result, “the response to the company tax cut is strongly skewed toward foreign investors”, whereas the investment subsidy leads to a “relatively evenly spread response” from both local and foreign investors. The study found both policies lead to increases in gross domestic product, employment and real pre-tax wages. But it suggests a company tax cut would boost wages by 0.3% by 2036, half the expected boost of 0.6% from the investment subsidy. In addition to stimulating higher investment, the study also found an investment subsidy would protect the revenue stream on legacy capital so it “is not a drain on national income”. Labor has pledged to repeal tax cuts for big businesses if they pass the Senate, but is holding out on the prospect of future tax relief for businesses prepared to invest locally. It has also argued, based on research by the shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, that companies that pay less tax create fewer jobs. Despite the Turnbull government’s claims that the $30bn cost of the second phase of company tax cuts is fully funded, the Victoria University study argues the government has no “decisive proposal” of how it will be financed. “Bracket creep – an effective increase in the personal income tax rate – appears to be the most likely source of funding,” the researchers wrote. The study explores options for funding either policy, including Labor’s plan to deny cash refunds for franking credits or a combination of discounting franking credits and a one-off increase in personal income tax of 0.2%. It finds that “fully funded, the investment subsidy is still an effective means by which to raise investment, employment, GDP and the real pre-tax wage”. “In terms of improving the material welfare of the Australian population, the impact on gross national income is positive for the investment subsidy, but not for the company tax rate cut,” the researchers wrote. While the government is confident it can win Hinch’s vote, Storer is holding out for a broader tax reform debate, including a boost to the Newstart unemployment benefit, although he insists he won’t horse-trade for his vote, which could be decisive for the fate of the tax cut package."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/09/ferrari-had-pace-all-weekend-at-bahrain-grand-prix","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T20:35:44Z","webTitle":"Bahrain talking points: Ferrari had pace all weekend and a trusted driver | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/09/ferrari-had-pace-all-weekend-at-bahrain-grand-prix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/09/ferrari-had-pace-all-weekend-at-bahrain-grand-prix","fields":{"headline":"Bahrain talking points: Ferrari had pace all weekend and a trusted driver","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ferrari are fired up The Scuderia might have been fortunate to win in Melbourne but victory in Bahrain was anything but a fluke. The team had the pace all weekend and their car proved, at the Sakhir circuit at least, to be superior to Mercedes. But they also had to be willing to take a risk and trust their driver. Switching to a one-stop mid race was a bold move and Vettel had to put in a superlative performance to turn it into a win. He made his tyres last 39 laps when Pirelli’s predicted lifespan was just 30 and did so without going off despite the deteriorating grip. Had he spilled it just once, it would likely have cost him the win. The team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, was rightly effusive. “Today’s result is confirmation of the great job done by the team, of an effective car and of a driver who drove like a true champion.” Hamilton still sharp Ninth to third was a fine result for Lewis Hamilton, although he was disappointed at now trailing Vettel by 17 points in the world championship. It was, however, an impressive recovery drive on many levels. He played the percentages from the start, cautious in avoiding contact, with his eye on the bigger prize of the world championship. Then, with a little more room to manoeuvre, he attacked. His pass up the inside of turn one to overtake Fernando Alonso, Esteban Ocon and Nico Hülkenberg – three cars in one – was a grandstand move and a reminder of why the four-times world champion is held in such high regard across the paddock. “It’s not an easy manoeuvre to pull off; it’s quite risky,” he said. “But I’d lost so much ground [because] I was trying to be cautious.” This ability to measure risk and reward will be crucial to the title fight and is an object lesson to Max Verstappen. Gasly makes his mark For the 22-year old Toro Rosso driver Pierre Gasly fourth place in only his seventh grand prix was a remarkable achievement. It confirmed the promise he has shown in junior formulae and put down a marker for his promotion to the senior Red Bull team. The young French driver had qualified in sixth and then drove a race that entirely belied his lack of experience. But there was import beyond his performance. He did it with the Honda engine with which McLaren struggled so for the past three years. If this is a sign that the manufacturer finally has its power unit on track, Red Bull, whose current deal with Renault ends this season, will be looking long and hard at their performance. Honda, too, might finally allow themselves a smile. It is the manufacturer’s best finish in a grand prix since Rubens Barrichello was third at the British GP in 2008. McLaren’s investigation begins Toro Rosso’s fourth was one better than the fifth which was the best McLaren achieved with Honda over those three years, which will have been difficult to swallow. It was exacerbated by a weekend in which they were really struggling. Optimism was severely shaken after they could qualify only 13th and 14th, which left the racing director, Eric Boullier, saying he was “astonished” and that “there is a need for a big investigation”. Fernando Alonso ultimately finished in seventh but admitted the place flattered their car. “A pretty difficult weekend saved by the bell at the last moment,” he said. The team have to discover where they are losing pace with what they had touted as a very strong chassis. Red Bull and podiums were their stated targets this season – on this form they may be in a serious scrap with Toro Rosso and a schadenfreude-inspired Honda. Liberty have work to do Over the weekend F1’s owners, Liberty Media, revealed their plans for the future of the sport when the regulations change and the new contract with teams is drawn up in 2021. What they presented was broad brush strokes – simpler, cheaper, louder engines, more competitive racing with emphasis on the driver, a budget cap and fairer redistribution of revenue. All are laudable goals but, publicly at least, the detail of how they would be achieved was not forthcoming. The teams received more information and their response was generally positive. But the real work is now to be done. Liberty must find consensus, crucially including Ferrari and Mercedes. Or, if they are serious about changing F1, be willing to face down both manufacturers. It is a crucial juncture. Decisions made now will shape the next decade of the sport."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/15/shed-the-size-of-town-what-britains-giant-distribution-centres-tell-us-about-modern-life","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:30:07Z","webTitle":"​A shed the size of a town:​ what Britain’s giant distribution centres​ tell​ us about modern life\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/shed-the-size-of-town-what-britains-giant-distribution-centres-tell-us-about-modern-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/shed-the-size-of-town-what-britains-giant-distribution-centres-tell-us-about-modern-life","fields":{"headline":"​A shed the size of a town:​ what Britain’s giant distribution centres​ tell​ us about modern life\r\n","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When you click on a product, something, somewhere, moves. The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed. You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before. These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond. Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points. Dirft and the Magna Parks are within what, with unexpected romance, is called the “golden triangle”, a land of sheds, roads and marketing gerunds (such as Eddie Stobart’s “delivering sustainable distribution”) laid over the fields and towns of old England. In some accounts the triangle’s points are Leicester, Coventry and Milton Keynes and in others its sides are the M1, M6 and M42 motorways, but in either case it describes an area from where 85% of the population of Great Britain can be reached in four and a half hours, which is the maximum time an HGV driver can travel without taking a break. In other words, if you order a set of John Lewis bathroom towels in Southampton, Cardiff or Manchester, it will come from the same big box in Milton Keynes. The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now divided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords. The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way. Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn. You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality. The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway. Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.” But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters. There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky. It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well; if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour. Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time. The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place. Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape. Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good staff. Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day. Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users. It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English; “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank, giving almost no clue of their busy inner lives. Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions? For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic. Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume that the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between what was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become more stark."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/europes-longest-heated-cycle-path-to-connect-dutch-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:51:17Z","webTitle":"Europe's longest heated cycle path to connect Dutch cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/europes-longest-heated-cycle-path-to-connect-dutch-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/europes-longest-heated-cycle-path-to-connect-dutch-cities","fields":{"headline":"Europe's longest heated cycle path to connect Dutch cities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The longest heated cycle path in western Europe, and possibly the world, is set to be built in a Dutch beauty spot to cut the commuting time between two of the country’s cities all year round. The new 1.7km “cycle highway”, which forms part of the route linking Wageningen and Arnhem in the east of the Netherlands, will be kept warm by residual heat from a local paper plant. Concerns have been raised that frogs might find the warm path a little too comfortable, putting them and cyclists in danger. But Gelderland council has promised to monitor the impact on the local wildlife, which includes many water birds and beavers. Towns across the Netherlands have been investing in heating stretches of cycle paths, but nothing on the scale proposed in Gelderland has been constructed. Cutting through the Jufferswaard, a nature reserve near the Nederrijn in Renkum, the two-way cycle path is also likely to be one of the most idyllic, and is due to be completed in time for the winter of 2019. De Jufferswaard, a nature area of 31 hectares (77 acres), is located in the floodplain along the Nederrijn river, between the factory site of the paper mill Parenco, one of the area’s biggest employers, and the Rhine bridge at Heteren village, 7.5 miles (12km) south-west of Arnhem. Petra Borsboom, a spokeswoman for Gelderland council, said they believed the path would be the longest of its type in western Europe. “We don’t want to make the claim that it is the longest in the world because there might be one in China we don’t know about,” she said. The cycle route will shorten the riding distance between Wageningen and Arnhem by 600 metres. The biggest gain of the route would be “time, safety and experience”, the council said. Borsboom said the project would be put out to tender soon. “We want to work with companies developing new techniques,” she said. “The company who [wins the contract] will have a great influence on how they do the heating.” She added: “This path is mainly for commuters. It is a beautiful protected area and that is the reason we wanted to do this. We don’t want to use salt there to keep it snow-free. “There was a lot of fear that frogs in the road would want to stay there but we will follow the impact on the smaller animals very closely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/the-perfect-shepherds-pie-recipe-felicity-cloake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"The perfect ... shepherd’s pie | Felicity Cloake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/the-perfect-shepherds-pie-recipe-felicity-cloake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/19/the-perfect-shepherds-pie-recipe-felicity-cloake","fields":{"headline":"How to cook the perfect shepherd’s pie","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I once made a formal, if ever-so-slightly slurred, complaint in a Kansas City bar regarding a shepherd’s pie that arrived filled with best US chuck steak. That’s how strongly I feel about this homely lamb dish and its beefy cottage cousin, even if, according to Clarissa Dickson-Wright, they’re less “rustic inventions” than “part of the post-industrial nostalgia for the countryside”. (The older of the two, cottage pye, gets its first mention in the diary of Parson Woodforde in 1791, though without further explanation, it might refer to anything, even a cottage wrapped in pastry. After all, the good parson was said to be a man of famously prodigious appetite.) Though they may not boast ancient pedigree, the two dishes are not as interchangeable as the likes of Martha Stewart – or indeed, and embarrassingly, the youthful me – would have you believe: just as roast lamb is not cooked in the same way as roast beef, shepherd’s and cottage pie deserve individual attention. Having tackled the latter way back in 2010, when this column was still wet behind the ears, it feels high time we gave the shepherd his moment in the spotlight. Is this one of those dishes that’s so familiar you don’t need a recipe, or is there anything new to learn about shepherd’s pie? The meat Originally, this was a dish designed to make the Sunday roast go further – the thrifty cook could stretch out the joint until Friday with clever cooking, and such pies were, and still are, often a Monday treat. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham regard this as a second-best option, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years that “there is no reason why a shepherd’s pie cannot also be made from a cooked lamb joint, but it turns out better and juicier when made from raw minced meat”. Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver clearly disagree, because they roast meat for the purpose: Oliver a lamb shoulder, cooked long, though not particularly low, and then slowly braised in its cooking juices; and Kerridge lamb shanks. The testers are excited about these pies after I tell them how long they’ve taken to make, but confess themselves slightly thrown by their consistency, which is, they think, a bit stringy, though both lamb joints had plenty of fat on them. The juicier mince favoured by the Prawn Cocktail pair, Harry Eastwood’s Carnevale, Russell Brown and Jonathan Haley’s new book Well Seasoned, and The Ivy restaurant’s famous version meets with far more favour – there’s no need to bake it before use, either, as Kerridge suggests: easier to brown the lamb well in the pan before slow-simmering it. After a recommendation from my butcher, I try one recipe with goat mince instead, which has an even better flavour – mutton or hogget would no doubt have the same effect. Even lamb mince can vary, however: Eastwood calls specifically for minced lamb shoulder, which she and my butcher explain is a fattier cut than some – and certainly better marbled, darker in colour and stronger in flavour than generic supermarket lamb mince. Whether this is down to the quality of the meat, the cut, or a bit of both is impossible to tell, because the packet stuff doesn’t specify origins, but this dish is certainly worth sourcing decent mince for: it’s never pricey (unless you go down the Ivy road and cut it with minced rib of beef, of course). If you don’t have any lamb drippings handy to cook it in (which you’re unlikely to, unless you’re making it with leftover meat), beef dripping makes a far better, meatier substitute than oil, adding an unmistakable whiff of animal to a dish that was never really going to make the vegetarian heart sing in any case. The vegetables You can go rogue, if you like – the Ivy puts in shallots, Oliver red onion and Kerridge goes as far as garlic, but I prefer to keep things simple with the time-honoured trinity of yellow onion, celery and carrot, the last cubed, rather than grated as Hopkinson and Bareham suggest, because testers prefer the texture – though, sadly, they’re not keen on Oliver’s swede. I think it seems rather in keeping with the spirit of the dish, though I’d be tempted to bake it first to make it less watery. The Ivy and Eastwood both include mushrooms in their sauces, with the latter writing that many shepherd’s pies lack “depth of flavour. In poncy chef terms, it lacks umami. The mushrooms and mushroom ketchup give this recipe a savoury boost, as do the sun-dried tomatoes.” I agree with her: many recipes do indeed lack a bit of punch, but the testers aren’t keen on the texture of mushrooms here, however finely they’re chopped; and the sun-dried tomatoes, though delicious, seem to belong to another dish entirely. “Too fancy,” apparently. Gravy flavourings But how to add umami without mushrooms or tomato? Meat stock seems the most obvious candidate: slow simmering the mince in lamb stock, as Brown and Hayley and Eastwood recommend, will deliver more savoury flavour than Bareham and Hopkinson’s water. If you can’t find good lamb stock, then beef stock is better than nothing (the Ivy’s veal stock will be, too). Tomatoes are also high in those all-important glutamates – the Ivy uses chopped tomatoes and tomato puree, and Eastwood, Bareham and Hopkinson ketchup, which has its fans, though I find it too sweet and vinegary. Everything ketchup touches ends up tasting of ketchup, so I’m going to use puree instead, plus a good dash of the Ivy’s Worcestershire sauce in place of the Prawn Cocktail Years’ anchovy essence and Kerridge’s red-wine vinegar, which gives his pie a tanginess that works very well with the richness of lamb and potato, but seems at odds with the culinary comfort blanket that is shepherd’s pie. A similar simplicity also seems wise in the herbs and spices department: Eastwood’s exotic star anise, Kerridge’s mace and the Ivy’s oregano are all great options, but you can’t beat thyme and rosemary with lamb. The mash A good shepherd’s – or indeed cottage – pie, needs a solid, but fluffy top: too much milk or butter, and you’ll end up with a sloppy puree instead. Make sure you steam the potatoes dry before mashing, and season generously; I like Bareham and Hopkinson’s nutmeg as well as the usual salt and pepper. If you’d like to increase the vegetable content, Eastwood’s butternut squash mash is wonderful, especially with the maple syrup to play off the natural sweetness of the meat, though there should be enough savoury flavour in the filling to negate the need for added cheese (though her parmesan works better than Oliver’s cheddar, and, inspired by Kerridge, I think a hard goat’s cheese would work best of all). Oliver lines his dish with potatoes, too, which I’m excited about – you can never have too much of a good thing – but the panel thinks it makes the dish too claggy, soaking up the gravy and blurring the satisfying distinction between molten filling and dense top. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, if you think it needs extra crunch, but for me a shepherd’s pie needs no other adornment than its traditional crispy furrows, satisfyingly described by Dickson-Wright as “a ploughed field” of potato. And you don’t get much more rustic than that. Perfect shepherd’s pie Prep 15-20 min Cook 2hr 15 min Serves 4-6 2 tbsp good beef dripping (or lamb, if you happen to have some) 800g minced lamb, goat, hogget or mutton, preferably from the shoulder, but anyway not “lean” 1 large onion, thinly sliced 2 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 celery sticks, diced 2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped 1 tbsp flour 300ml good lamb stock (or beef stock) 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato puree 1.5kg floury potatoes 100g butter 1 tbsp whole milk Nutmeg, to grate Heat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish over a medium-high heat, then fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over (not just beige). Transfer the browned meat into a bowl and repeat with the rest. Turn down the heat, add the onion to the pan and cook until it begins to soften. Add the carrots, celery and herbs, and cook until tender but not soft. Sprinkle over the flour and stir well to distribute, then add the stock, Worcestershire sauce and tomato puree, and scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any stuck bits. Return the lamb to the pot, bring everything to a simmer, then cover, turn down the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer uncovered for a further 15 minutes, then set aside to cool. While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks. Boil in well-salted water until tender, then drain well and return to the hot pan to steam dry. Mash with the butter and milk, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Spoon the meat mix into a 30cm x 20cm ovenproof dish, then cover with the mash. Smooth out the top, then use a fork to make furrows over the top – do not skip this stage. Bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden on top, then serve with greens. • Are shepherd’s and cottage pie interchangeable (having written this recipe without looking at my cottage pie of eight years ago, I find to my embarrassment the two are remarkably similar) and if not, what changes do you ring between the two?

The talks were positive and Tuchel is one of two frontrunners, together with Chelsea’s Antonio Conte. The club’s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, is also keen on seeing whether there is any possibility of prising José Mourinho or Massimiliano Allegri from their respective clubs, Manchester United and Juventus, but there is a realisation within the club that that will be extremely difficult. Mauricio Pochettino has also been mentioned as a possible replacement for the Spaniard, whose contract runs out in the summer. The club have already held talks with Conte’s reprentatives, although no formal approach or offer has been made to the Chelsea manager. The Italian has endured a frustrating season at Stamford Bridge, with the team in danger of losing out on a Champions League place for next season. Chelsea were eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League and their only chance of silverware is the FA Cup, in which they play Southampton in the semi-finals on 22 April. Conte has hinted at his frustration with the club’s transfer policy throughout the season and recently said he was “very angry” and “very sad” about the current situation. “Those who know me very well know I am trying to put all of myself to change this situation because I have great responsibility,” he said in the buildup to Sunday’s 1-1 home draw against West Ham. “I feel great responsibility for my work, for my family, for everything. When I go to my house, it’s not that I am relaxed but I know that I gave everything and am giving everything for this club, 120%, every day, every day. Sometimes, it’s very difficult to sleep with these types of problem.” Tuchel, meanwhile, has been without a club since leaving Borussia Dortmund in May 2017. He spent two years at the Bundesliga club, following five at Mainz, and was widely admired for the job he did in replacing Jürgen Klopp at the Westfalenstadion. The team played attractive football and reached two cup finals, winning the second one, as well as being Bayern Munich’s main challengers in the league. The manager’s second season at the club, however, was marred by the attack on the team coach before the Champions League quarter-final against Monaco in April 2017. Tuchel, when testifying about the attack last month, said he thought there was a direct link between the incident and his leaving the club. “Aki [the Borussia Dortmund chairman, Hans-Joachim Watzke] has already said publicly that there was a major discrepancy,” he said. “This is true. The essence of the discrepancy is that I was sitting on the bus and Aki wasn’t. That’s why there was a major discrepancy about how to go about things – without wanting to hold it against Aki.” Tuchel added he was “absolutely convinced” that the attack had an effect on the performances of his players."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/10/facebook-notify-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:52:35Z","webTitle":"How to check whether Facebook shared your data with Cambridge Analytica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/facebook-notify-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/10/facebook-notify-users-data-harvested-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"How to check whether Facebook shared your data with Cambridge Analytica","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook has started the process of notifying the approximately 87 million users whose data was harvested by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

That means that their public profile, page likes, birthday and current city were likely shared with the company, as well as potentially the contents of their news feed at the time. Around 300,000 people – including 53 people in Australia, 10 people in New Zealand, and an unknown number of users in the UK – will receive a message informing them that they installed the This Is Your Digital Life app. This means they almost certainly handed over the personal information of all their Facebook friends at the time, as well as formed part of the core group for the psychometric profiling that Cambridge Analytica carried out during the US election campaign. Facebook has promised widespread changes to its platform to prevent further “abuse” of the sort it attributes to Cambridge Analytica. “These actions would prevent any app like [This Is Your Digital Life] from being able to access so much data today,” the company said in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/spanish-politicians-urged-to-resign-over-fake-degree-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:19:37Z","webTitle":"Fake degree claims dog prominent Spanish politicians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/spanish-politicians-urged-to-resign-over-fake-degree-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/spanish-politicians-urged-to-resign-over-fake-degree-claims","fields":{"headline":"Fake degree claims dog prominent Spanish politicians","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two leading Spanish politicians are facing calls to resign over claims they faked their master’s degrees. Cristina Cifuentes, the Popular party (PP) president of the Madrid regional government, and Pablo Casado, an MP and the party’s deputy communications chief, are accused of obtaining master’s degrees from the King Juan Carlos University in Madrid without ever attending classes or writing a dissertation. When Eldiario.es broke the story on 21 March, Cifuentes refuted the accusation and threatened to sue the news website. She then produced a certificate. However, two of three people whose names appeared on the certificate said their signatures had been forged. The university has said it can find no trace of Cifuentes’s dissertation and she has not produced it. Casado, meanwhile, told a press conference on Monday he was never expected to attend class or sit exams. Laura Nuño, the deputy director of the Institute of Public Law, the university department in which Cifuentes alleges she studied for her master’s, resigned on Tuesday after saying she had discovered her signature had been forged on documents purporting to show that Cifuentes took the course in 2012. “I never even taught a single class to Cristina Cifuentes, not even on that course,” Nuño said, citing “an absolute lack of trust”. The case has caused consternation in academic circles. “Cases such as this give the impression that there is favouritism and, even though this is not generally the case among universities here, it’s damaging,” said Pablo Simón, a professor of political science at University Carlos III in Madrid. “The good news is that it shows that people are much less willing to tolerate corruption,” he said. “A few years ago it wouldn’t have attracted any attention. On the other hand, it shows that our political leaders are still unwilling to take responsibility for their actions and refuse to resign.” Despite opposition demands for Cifuentes to quit, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is standing by her and she has so far refused to go. “The Cifuentes case follows a typical PP strategy,” said Simón. “First they deny everything, then they say it’s a conspiracy, then they offer the accused their full support, then they let them fall on their swords. I’m convinced that in the end Cifuentes will resign.” If Cifuentes falls, the PP could lose control of the Madrid regional government. The scandal is another setback for Rajoy’s conservative government, already dogged by the Catalan question. Last week a German court refused to extradite the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on charges of rebellion. Meanwhile, Rajoy is unable to get his budget approved because five Basque MPs will not vote for it until direct rule, imposed on Catalonia last October, is lifted, and that can only happen once a Catalan government is installed. On Friday, Catalan secessionists will once again attempt to invest Jordi Sànchez, currently remanded in jail in Madrid on charges of sedition, as president. If, as expected, the courts refuse to release him, the investiture will not happen. If nothing is resolved by next month, Catalans will go to the polls for the fourth time in less than six years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/15/objects-of-desire-eight-people-name-their-favourite-things","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Objects of desire: the design delights of my favourite things","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/objects-of-desire-eight-people-name-their-favourite-things","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/15/objects-of-desire-eight-people-name-their-favourite-things","fields":{"headline":"Objects of desire: the design delights of my favourite things","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Will Self, writer: ‘This old typewriter used to belong to my mother’ The Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter This is widely regarded as the greatest typewriter of all time. It’s the best ergonomically; it has a light action on the keyboard, but it still has a rhythm. It has an amazing set of features for a tiny machine. It has a half space insertion so you can delete a five-letter word with Tippex and then type it in again; if it’s one letter longer you can do a half space and squeeze up words. It’s also got much more sophisticated tabulation I didn’t take possession of this olive green one until 1988 after my mother died. I have two of them and they were both hers. One my eldest brother in America sent to me. I think he had the one with the US keys rather than the UK keys. I move between the two. This one is from the early 50s so it’s nearly 70 years old. That’s a hell of an age for a machine to be in regular use. As a kid I was always going out to get typewriters. When I started to get obsessed about “writing” when I was nine or 10, you could go to a charity shop and get an old Underwood for a quid, at the point people were getting rid of them. I used to have a little collection of typewriters. I had three or four Imperial Good Companions, which is the typewriter Beryl Bainbridge used – a beautiful machine from the late 30s that really looks steam punk. Then I got obsessed by Groma Kolibris, which are in the film The Lives of Others. I love the thinness of it. It’s a beautiful machine. I was seriously thinking of getting a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball – Nietzsche had one. It looks like a porcupine with the keys in a ball all around it. I was becoming obsessed by super-early typewriters, super-tiny typewriters. But then I got rid of them all. I could see the beginning of the end of the whole typewriter shtick. They’re great machines, but they’re old. The Olivettis are the only two I have left. Shalom Simons really is the last typewriter repairman left in London. I haven’t been in touch with him for three or four years so I’m not even sure if he’s retired. This Olivetti does need work now, and may not last me the next book. I think: “Come on, Will, you’ve got to reconcile yourself with moving on and writing some other way.” It would be fine to write longhand and then type it up on a non-wireless enabled computer. I never learned to touch-type – I still have to peck to this day. The problem with writing on computers now is that it’s unbounded – you feel that the world is with you in your creative life and that’s not helpful. I like the noise of the typewriter and then the silence. When you work on a computer you have a continual ultrasonic whine of some kind. When you’re working on a typewriter you have these little bursts but then you stop and… silence. I’m not given to sentiment, but I felt very moved to be working on James Ballard’s old Olympia machine a few years back, to be channelling him to some extent. I’ve written a novel about my mum, How the Dead Live, and I’m always thinking about my mum in one way or another – she’s always lurking around and, just as with our parents we’ve got phrases that come up all the time, I’m sure there are lots of phrases in my novels that relate to her on the typewriter. It’s very evocative. Ashish Gupta, fashion designer: ‘The tap has quite a Liberace vibe to it’ Solid brass swan kitchen tap I like finding unique things and surrounding myself with objects I’ve collected. A lot of my kitchen, which I renovated myself, is salvage. The cupboards are butterfly cabinets from the Museum of Natural History and the tops are from an old chemistry lab – there’s a section that has some rude graffiti on it, which I love. I got the handmade Portuguese tiles while I was in Lisbon. They were once in the Ritz Hotel there. When the kitchen was nearly finished, everything was held up by the tap. I didn’t have one. I didn’t want a modern, clinical tap, I wanted something weird. I’m quite a control freak, for want of a better word, and I must have spent two weeks visiting every single bathroom shop in London and going on eBay at 2am. I was like a crazy person. Then I saw a picture of a golden swan tap in an old fashion shoot somewhere and I thought: “That’s the tap!” It was only about $30 on eBay. I think it’s 1970s or 80s. It’s got quite a Liberace vibe. Water comes out of the beak. Swans are quite aggressive and there’s something quite sexy about that. Of course, the builders said they couldn’t fit it because it wasn’t compatible with the pipes, but they had to sort it out because I said: “This is the only tap I’m having.” It’s solid brass and ornate and feels a little Indian. I grew up in India and my family is there. There is a famous Indian painting by Raja Ravi Varma with a swan in it and the tap always reminds me of that. The swan is the vehicle of Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and creative arts. I have an image of her in the hallway. As a kid I used to read a lot of mythology and fairy tales so it reminds me of my childhood. After the kitchen was finished I bought the flat downstairs. But I loved everything about the kitchen upstairs so the builders had to move it all down, piece by piece. They told me the swan tap was broken on the inside and I totally panicked. I found a second one. This time it was almost £200, but I didn’t care. Then it turned out the other one wasn’t broken, so now that one is in the laundry room and I have two golden swan taps. Ashish Gupta’s fashion label is Ashish Julia Peyton-Jones, curator and gallery director: ‘To live with this chair and table is a joy’ Medici chair and table by Konstantin Grcic and MEME CCLII 2013 by Antony Gormley My abiding mantra is Gilbert and George’s “To be with art is all we ask,” and I have chosen three objects which I live with and look at every day: a Medici chair and table by Konstantin Grcic, an incredible designer, and a beautiful sculpture given to me by Antony Gormley when I left the Serpentine Gallery in 2016. To live with this chair and table is a joy. It is a gorgeous design and made of American walnut. If you live in London, as I do, it is very nice to see nature transformed into this glorious structure. I have two Medici chairs. They sit against the window in my sitting room, which looks on to playing fields, the table between them. My daughter’s toys sit beside them. I sit in one of the chairs every day, to read or write. There are no arms; the chair feels very expansive. It is very comfortable, and that is unexpected; it makes you do a double take. I am continually amused and surprised by that. When I look at it, I play with the angles. I think of constructivism and the great abstract artists and how they play with form. The chair is one of the most basic utilitarian objects, yet Konstantin has made it sublimely different. The Gormley lives in the same room. The figure, taken from the series MEMES, 2009-2015, is kneeling with its head on the ground and its arms crossed. It is contemplative – homage, that is the word that comes to mind. There are 33 positions in this series, called MEMES after Richard Dawkins [who coined the term “meme” in The Selfish Gene]. It comes from the Greek word meaning “imitated thing”. It is 39.5cm in length and made of solid iron, which naturally degrades. It is incredibly heavy relative to its size – its weight is a shock every time and somehow appropriate, given its incredible trajectory from ancient Greece to now. I am fascinated by the formal aspects of the sculptor’s work, its completeness and its scale. There is a novel, a short story, a poem, a haiku. This is a haiku – an extremely difficult thing to be able to do. I never touch it, partly because the weight of it makes it rooted, but I tweak the chairs. I want them to look their best, to show their better angles. The iron is a rich burnt red, but it is not uniform. The surface is slightly pitted; it feels kind of gravelly. It is rough to the touch in the same way that the Medicis are silky smooth, like glass. The Gormley is tender. Can a chair be tender? No. But it can be so sensitively made that it gives the user an optimum experience of using it. That takes enormous consideration and care and sensitivity. Genevieve Fox Julia Peyton-Jones is Senior Global Director: Special Projects at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac (ropac.net) Isamaya Ffrench, make-up artist: ‘The person who gave me this became my boyfriend’ Fungi in resin An old specimen of a bug trapped in amber, that’s what my two mushrooms preserved in resin look like. I love fungi. With these two, you can still see the soil at the base of each, and their gills, too. They are like fine, golden hairs. The resin block is 9cm high and 5.5cm wide. The colour is a bit de-saturated – it’s a sort of yellow. It catches the light. Mushrooms have mysterious qualities and a very interesting symbiosis with trees and plants. They grow like a neural network; the mushroom itself is just the fruiting body of the organism that lives beneath the ground. These two were sent to me in the post by a mystery person. I opened up the parcel and I was shocked. It was like a gift from beyond. It was the best way to woo me. The sender, who I’d only met on Instagram, later became my boyfriend. When I first got into make-up, after studying industrial design at uni, I read a lot about fungi’s psychotropic effects and their possible links with the birth of religion, and also about Carl Jung and the symbolism of objects. Fungi seemed to be a bridge between life and death. Because of their mind-expanding properties, they also represent new ways of looking at the world. I am not into drugs, but my own work is an organic process and this object is also symbolic of a connection between it and nature. I absolutely love nature. My resin mushrooms live in my bathroom on one of three shelves filled with objects I have collected from around the world. It’s a little museum space. My work is concept-led and it’s about building a character and having a narrative. I use make-up as a tool to communicate a person and their life. It’s why this object is one of the most precious things I own – there is such a big back story to it. Tom Ford Beauty’s Extrême Collection with Isamaya Ffrench is available at Selfridges Renni Eddo-Lodge, writer: ‘I like my things to be clean, tidy and functional’ Kitsound Ribbon in-ear wireless headphones I am a restless person. I’m on the move a lot, even in my house. I like to be entertained at all levels of life and to take in information via news programmes and podcasts and things like that. I don’t really like silence, unless it’s filled with my thoughts. Design is something that seamlessly slots into your life: my clothes, the tech I use, the bike I ride, kitchenware. I try to prioritise function; I am not someone who thinks about beauty that much. I like things to be clean, tidy and functional. If it looks good, that’s a bonus. What would I feel lost without? Headphones. I carry them with me every day. But they break after a while, as my old ones did, and it’s normally the wire. I’d been thinking about getting a wireless pair for a while, but I didn’t want to sink a whole lot of money into them. These cost me less than £15. They make life easier for me. I no longer feel restricted. They are moulded plastic and black. Incognito. I don’t like my things to stand out. They are super small and super convenient; they slip into a pocket. I’ve noticed that if I am listening to something really interesting I won’t take them out when I get home, like I used to do with my old headphones. I keep listening. They are part of me. Renni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I Am No Longer Talking to White People About Race is £7.64 from guardianbookshop.com Hannah Weiland, fashion designer: ‘I can’t sleep without him. Weird, as I’m quite old now’ Teddy dog cuddly toy DogDog is a teddy dog, my sleeping toy, and my most prized possession ever. I got him when I was five. I find him aesthetically very pleasing. I like his shape – the simplicity of his roundness, and of his markings. I sleep with him in between my neck and my shoulder. Every night. I can’t sleep without him. Weird, as I’m quite old now. DogDog inspires my work 100%. He’s in my 2018 Resort collection, he’s embroidered on a PVC biker jacket, he’s printed on silk. You’ve got to find him in there. Faux fur is the basis of my brand. DogDog had a plush fur coat back in the day, like a fluffy sofa. Now it feels like very short sheepskin. I like the transition, the wear of him. He’s very textural. As a designer, I love symmetry – asymmetrical hems are my pet hate. DogDog has a patch on one eye, but otherwise he is very symmetrical and pleasing to the eye. He’s never had a plastic nose or hard, plastic eyes – his are far apart, which is a sign of beauty. If you took him apart, you could make a beautiful pattern, a huge cut-out with fluid lines. I love my designs to be out there and quirky, but I have a limit to how many things I put together. I might design something in aqua blue and black, then put in a cream lace. Looking at DogDog, he is perfect like that: he has a two-tone element, his sandy, camel body, and the surprise of his eye patch. Otherwise, he is quite simple, quite chic. I can imagine him in a beautiful apartment in Tokyo, or in a calming villa in the south of France with whitewashed walls and lavender dried in bags. He would wear a straw hat in the sun. People say I should to go Tokyo, that there I would be normal. Everyone walks around with their teddies. On the shoot I changed positions with him. I got really excited that I could sit in his lap for once, in his arms. Hannah Weiland’s fashion label is Shrimps David Morrissey, actor: ‘My mask is slightly quizzical, which I love’ Venetian brass mask This little mask is so small you could hold it in the palm of your hand. It has nil value. It has no function. But whenever I look at it, I remember the time I slept in Venice railway station at the end of a long trip – a time of introspection. During my first summer break from Rada I decided to go Interrailing. I must have been about 21. I’d moved to London from Liverpool – I knew from early on in my life that I needed to get away from home, which was not a particularly happy place for me – and I found London difficult. It was expensive and unfriendly. I had one of those wonderful tickets where you could go anywhere and I planned a route through Holland, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany. I had the Rough Guide with me but when I got to Venice, I couldn’t find anywhere to sleep. There was a sort of homeless section outside the station, so I stayed there. I felt vulnerable. I worried about closing my eyes. Walking around Venice, there were strange masks everywhere, flat-faced masks with big noses, masks worn with monkish robes. They were almost scary in their absence of design. I didn’t know anyone in Venice. I had to make myself known to people, step outside of myself. When you are travelling, you are finding out who you are and trying on different personalities and attitudes to life. I bought the mask to remind me of that time. It’s about the size of a decent pebble, and there’s something about its weight I like. It lives in a large printer’s drawer that’s hung on the wall of my study. This mask really has character. Its surface is not smooth – it has real crinkles – and its inside is unfinished and sandpapery. Its expression is surprised, slightly quizzical, which I love. Its eyes are far too close together. When it looks at me, or when I look at it, rather, its expression changes, depending on my mood, or the light, or what day it is. Taking it down for the shoot felt really terrible. I felt sort of disloyal to the other objects. Like, why take that? I took it because I knew it would survive. It is the most solid thing there. Also, it marked the furthest point I got to in Europe – though it was not the end of the journey. I know exactly how to put it back – there is a patch of dust around its place – and I can’t wait to take it back, to complete the picture.

It’s an old-fashioned aluminium stove-top percolator. You put the boiling water in the bottom and the coffee on top, then you turn it upside down, and the water percolates through – basically it was a long-drip style coffee-maker before its time. My grandmother was Italian and I grew up drinking coffee so I’ve been using this since I was a teenager. I’d much rather have an espresso than a cup of tea. My grandmother moved to Wales from Bardi when she was 19, so I imagine she bought it on one of her trips back to Italy. I’m not into new gadgets. My kitchen is full of old clutter. I’ve just bought a load of Richard Ginori plates from Florence and an antique turbot cooker. I collect Poole Pottery and Elizabeth David cookbooks, too. We’re such a throwaway society. Things aren’t built to last a lifetime and I think it’s a tragedy. It’s nice to pass things on.

Appearance: Red, round and wrinkly, with a little tail. Strength: 1,641,183 Scoville units, give or take. What? Scoville units. That is how people measure the heat of chillies. And the average for the Reaper, as measured in 2017 at Winthrop University in South Carolina, is 1,641,183. Is that a lot? Well, you know those pimientos you get stuffed in olives? Uh-huh. They measure 100-500. Jalapeños are about 5,000, the same as Tabasco sauce. Scotch bonnet chillies can measure up to 400,000 units. So the Carolina Reaper is … Holy mother of God. It’s arguably the hottest chilli in the world. Who argues about things like that? Chilli breeders, who are locked in a perpetual arms race over new varieties. The Reaper dethroned the Trinidad Scorpion “Butch T” in 2013, and has been challenged recently by the Dragon’s Breath and the Pepper X. Sounds mature. Yeah. And it’s complicated, because heat always varies from chilli to chilli. One Carolina Reaper, for example, has been measured at 2,200,000 Scoville units. That’s about the same as the stuff that police spray on rioters. I try to avoid eating anything that is also a weapon. It’s just a little rule I have. A wise rule. So what’s the point of a chilli so hot that nobody can eat it? Oh, people eat it all right. Generally for a bet. I suppose I quite like the idea of watching someone stupid enough to eat a Carolina Reaper suffering the consequences. You’re not alone. It is a common challenge in chilli-eating contests around the world, and on YouTube. Cripes. Don’t people end up in hospital? Yup. The British Medical Journal has just published a case study of a 34-year-old man who ate a Carolina Reaper in a contest in the US two years ago, then ended up in casualty suffering from “thunderclap headaches”. Where do they measure on the headache scale? High. They are a sudden and very severe pain that develops over a few seconds. In this man’s case, several major blood vessels had narrowed dramatically. He ate a chilli so hot that the arteries in his brain squeezed shut in panic? That’s the theory. His doctors had never seen it in response to a chilli before. Is he now dead? No. He’s fine, thankfully. And presumably a little wiser. That wouldn’t be hard. Do say: Is there a “going to the toilet afterwards” competition? Don’t say: We need a scale of stupidity units, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/will-emmanuel-macron-enforce-red-line-syria-chemical-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:30:54Z","webTitle":"France calls for strong and united response to Syria chemical attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/will-emmanuel-macron-enforce-red-line-syria-chemical-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/will-emmanuel-macron-enforce-red-line-syria-chemical-attack","fields":{"headline":"France calls for strong and united response to Syria chemical attack","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has called for a “strong, united and resolute” reaction from the international community to the chemical attack in Douma, a Syrian rebel-held town on the outskirts of Damascus. Philippe said Paris’s response to the attack – currently being decided – would define France as a nation. “The use of these weapons is not neutral; it says things about the regime and our reaction to the use of these weapons will say things about who we are,” he told parliament. Philippe said allies of the Syrian regime bore “particular responsibility in this massacre”, alluding to Russia. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly promised that proven chemical weapons use is a “red line” that would prompt French strikes on Syrian government forces, and that Paris is prepared to act alone. Last summer, a freshly elected Macron sat on the sunny terrace of the Élysée Palace and told the Guardian: “When you fix red lines, if you don’t know how to make sure they are respected, you’re choosing to be weak. That’s not my choice.” He added: “If chemical weapons are used on the ground and we know how to find out their provenance, France will launch strikes to destroy the chemical weapons stocks.” Syria has provided Macron with his red line moment. Barack Obama’s red line over Syrian chemical weapons in 2013, and his lack of intervention, came at a time when France’s then president, the socialist François Hollande, had wanted to act but would not go it alone. Macron’s electorate has always seen his most positive quality as his perceived strength on the international stage. On the home front he is facing difficult strikes over a reshaping of the railways and the government has vowed to stand firm. Internationally, as he has often said, France cannot show weakness. Macron has been at pains to style himself as a man of his word. “On every issue, I do what I say, and that’s something new,” he promised this autumn, attempting to claim the moral high ground over career politicians’ doublespeak. A French military response would depend on its intelligence proving both the use of deadly chemical agents by the Syrian regime, and fatalities. Although France would be prepared to strike Syria alone – and recently defence sources said it was logistically possible – it is much more likely to act alongside the US and other international partners. Macron has previously said France would be “perfectly aligned with the US” on this issue and he has spoken to Donald Trump by phone every day recently. But the pressing question for France is what form any military action might take: what kind of strikes are possible and with what long-term aim? Macron criticised the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy’s Libya intervention in 2011 and the mess it left. He has stressed he does not want a “failed state” or “neoconservative” interventions abroad. He has altered France’s conditions for talks on Syria’s future, saying the deposing of the president, Bashar al-Assad, is not a prerequisite, but the Syria question remains his toughest foreign policy challenge. French public opinion is already sensitive to airstrikes that could be perceived as making little difference. “We can no longer be content with symbolic strikes, there have to be efficient strikes that show not only our resolve but that the point of no return has been established,” Jean-Paul Paloméros, the former French air force chief of staff, said on Tuesday. The issue of airstrikes is more complex now than when France wanted to intervene with the US in 2013, because of Russia’s presence and Iran’s role. Paloméros said time was needed for careful strategising. He argued that France needed to plan how to “go far enough without going too far”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/10/youtube-hackers-target-music-videos-taylor-swift-drake","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:35:46Z","webTitle":"YouTube hackers target music videos by artists including Taylor Swift and Drake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/10/youtube-hackers-target-music-videos-taylor-swift-drake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/10/youtube-hackers-target-music-videos-taylor-swift-drake","fields":{"headline":"YouTube hackers target music videos by artists including Taylor Swift and Drake","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A number of high-profile music videos disappeared from YouTube and had their titles and hold images defaced, after the video streaming website was targeted by hackers. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito is the most viewed YouTube video of all time, with more than 5bn views, but temporarily disappeared from the site and had its hold image replaced by a photograph of a masked gang holding guns. Hackers calling themselves Prosox and Kuroi’sh replaced the description beneath the video with: “Free Palestine.” The hackers also defaced videos by artists including Taylor Swift, Adele, Katy Perry, Iggy Azalea, Eminem, Maroon 5, Shakira, Selena Gomez, DJ Snake, Drake and Chris Brown. All the affected videos were uploaded to YouTube artist accounts associated with the video hosting service Vevo. It is unclear whether hackers accessed individual accounts or Vevo as a whole. One of the hackers claims they used a script to change the video titles. The hacker Prosox tweeted at Vevo suggesting that their security protections were weak and claimed that they did not delete Despacito. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee have not responded to Despacito’s deletion. The Hacker News reports that Kuroi’sh is the same hacker who recently targeted Now This news and the BBC’s Arabic news Twitter feed. The videos appear to be back online.

She lives in Rugby, with her parents, and her 16-month-old son, Elijah. Every day she shows Elijah a picture of his father, her partner Biniyam Tesfaye. It’s the best she can do: he lives over 3,700 miles away in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. “He’s missing out on his son, and his son’s missing out on him,” she says. “We show Elijah pictures, but he’s not actually seeing him, so he’s not even using the word ‘Dada’ or ‘Daddy’. The longer this goes on, the more it will affect him.” Clarke and Tesfaye first got together when she was teaching English at a primary school in Addis Ababa; he was one of her colleagues: “We met on my first day. We were friends for about a month, and then after that, things started to develop,” she says. When her job came to an end, Clarke came back to the UK, assuming he could soon join her. “Then about three weeks later, I found out I was pregnant,” she says. “I thought, ‘This is going to make life very difficult, but it’s still a gift – I’m happy. We’ll get through it.’ And that’s what we’ve been doing ever since.” Elijah was born in October 2016. There was no mobile reception in the maternity ward, so Laura’s mother, Michelle, called Tesfaye to tell him his son had been born. “I was in hospital for two days afterwards,” says Laura. “I saw people with their husbands, and I thought, ‘I should have that opportunity.’” What kept her going, she says, was the fact that Tesfaye had applied for a visitor’s visa and was meant to arrive for a six-month stay that Christmas. But then they heard that the Home Office had turned him down because he couldn’t supply the six months’ worth of bank statements it said was necessary. “That was hard. Really hard,” she says. “You can’t get that time back.” Seventeen months have passed since Elijah was born, and they’re still apart. Elijah is one of an estimated 15,000 children living without a parent because of restrictions on family visas. Tesfaye would like to live with his family in the UK, but in order to apply to bring over a foreign partner, you must earn at least £18,600 a year. Clarke’s work as a college teacher and PR for a charity brings in an income that is usually “a few hundred a month” short. Theresa May first announced the idea of a specific income requirement in May 2012, when she was home secretary. Having settled on the idea of doing away with the old insistence that couples and families simply had to live without “recourse to public funds”, she had initially floated a minimum earnings figure for UK citizens of £25,700, before deciding on £18,600, thought to be the amount of money at which people do not need benefits. About 40% of working people in the UK do not earn the required amount. The details of the rules are bafflingly complex. If a husband, wife or partner wants to bring a child who is not a UK citizen with them, the £18,600 figure rises to £22,400, with an additional £2,400 for each further child. These numbers do not include the fees – which often exceed £2,000 – that the Home Office charges for applications, the equally sizable legal costs many people see as essential to success, or the £400 annual charge people granted visas now have to pay to use the NHS. A mountain of paperwork is also obligatory: among other items, people must prove that a relationship is genuine by sending print-outs of emails, texts and online messages. Shared savings in excess of £16,000 can be used to slightly dilute the income requirement, and if you’ve amassed £62,500 or more, there is no income requirement at all – but for most people affected, these caveats represent cold comfort. The Home Office explanation is short and sharp. “Those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family must work hard and make a contribution,” a spokesperson says. “Family life must not be established here at the taxpayer’s expense.” In the early days of her relationship with Tesfaye, Clarke says, she wasn’t aware of the new rules. “Not the £18,600 figure anyway. I just knew that I needed to work. I’d always travelled freely and assumed other people could travel freely. I knew there had been changes, and it was strict, but I didn’t realise it was so restrictive.” As she sees it, there is a particularly glaring injustice at the heart of the rules. Parents with babies or toddlers, she says, simply can’t put in the kind of working hours that the income requirement demands without running the risk of damaging the development of their children. She currently works four days a week between her two jobs, which obviously pains her. “Elijah’s nursery have said I need to develop his speech more. So I’m working, but every little bit of time I get with him before putting him in the bath, or bed, I’m trying to talk to him as much as possible. Children need one-on-one.” After Clarke got help from their local MP, Conservative Mark Pawsey, Tesfaye was finally granted a visitor visa, and came to Rugby in April 2017. For six months, he lived with Clarke and Elijah at her parents’ house. “That’s when he really bonded with Elijah, and that’s what I wanted. That’s the most important thing for me,” she says. They held a christening. Tesfaye joined a local five-a-side football team. They also thought about getting married while he was in the UK, but found out it would break the terms of his visa. He went back to Ethiopia last October, and resumed a relationship with his family almost entirely through Facebook Messenger. “Internet access is limited in Ethiopia,” says Clarke. “We can’t do video – it just cuts off.” Six months before Tesfaye left the UK, the supreme court ruled that parts of the spouse visa rules threatened to breach Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which sets out the right to a family and private life. The government eventually responded by allowing for new considerations including “credible guarantee of sustainable financial support from a third party” in “exceptional circumstances”, relating to “unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, the partner or a child under the age of 18 years old”. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) says it “has seen no evidence that these changes have had any effect on decision-making at the Home Office”. But Clarke and Tesfaye think they offer a glimmer of hope, and are planning to put in an application for a six-month fiance visa, which would lead in turn to a spouse visa that can be renewed after 33 months (after five years, a husband, wife or civil partner from abroad can apply to settle in the UK). “We’re stressing the fact that Elijah doesn’t get to Skype with his father, that my parents are willing to support us financially, so Tesfaye wouldn’t ever be using public funds,” she says. She points out that as a graduate and experienced teacher, he would easily find work. I speak to Tesfaye on the phone. His English is perfect; his reflections on their predicament are stoic. Being apart from Clarke when their son was born, he says, was “really hard for me – I had to imagine everything”. His earnings from teaching, he says, restrict how much they can talk on the phone, and even messaging is fraught with difficulty. “Sometimes there’s internet, sometimes not,” he says. When martial law was introduced last year, he couldn’t get online for a month. Of course, he recalls with fondness the six months he spent in Rugby. “There was no chance for me to work, so I stayed with Elijah most of the time. It was a really happy time. But knowing I had to go back really hurt,” he says. “Now, I have to dream about him.” The JCWI’s campaign against the visa system and its effects on families has the hashtagged slogan #BringThemHome. Many of the affected families are also members of two Facebook groups: I Love My Foreign Spouse, which has 12,000 members, and UK spouse settlement visa, with just under 10,000. The JCWI wants the government to repeal the “inhumane” minimum-income requirement policy “in its entirety”. “Forty per cent of people who work in this country are too poor to marry who they want,” says the JCWI’s chief executive, Satbir Singh. “The law has been written to make people unequal. It divides them into groups that have rights and privileges, and groups that don’t.” Singh, who was born in Essex, has direct experience of the system’s unfairness. His wife is an Indian national, and for a while, the two of them lived and worked in Washington DC. Changes to the immigration system instigated by President Trump meant they had to leave. He went to London; she travelled to India. They soon decided to try to settle in the UK, but the fact that he was working as an independent consultant meant a delay to his wife joining him: if you’re self-employed, the Home Office demands that you have been earning the required amount for at least a year before an application for a spouse visa is even considered. He then got his current salaried job, but there were problems even then. The Home Office lost the couple’s paperwork and eventually refused his wife’s case. Singh wrote a blogpost, comparing his situation with that of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who had just announced their engagement. The article, titled As Meghan Markle Chooses To Become A British Citizen I Just Wait For My Wife To Be Able To Come Home, went viral. Three days later, the Home Office reversed its decision. “That’s obviously great,” Singh says, “but it’s not how the system is supposed to work. Most people won’t be able to do anything like that.” Mandy Williams and George Okoth have a two-year-old son, Eric. Williams lives with Eric in Highbridge, a 6,000-population town next to Burnham-on-Sea, on the Somerset levels. Okoth is in Mombasa, Kenya, 4,500 miles away. “I think about it all the time,” says Williams. “Silly things, like going to the shops: it’s like, ‘If George was here, we’d be doing this together. We should be cuddling up on the sofa and watching a movie.’” They send each other 40 or 50 WhatsApp messages a day, in an attempt to create the rhythms and rituals they would follow if they lived together. “He knows I’m home safe, he lets me know he’s home safe – all of that. He’s always asking about Eric. I send photos when I can: ‘He’s walking, he’s talking.’ Because George missed all of that. He missed Eric’s first walking, his first teeth coming through. It’s not the same when you text somebody and go, ‘He’s walking now.’” The couple first met when Okoth was in charge of a national tour by a Kenyan youth choir who spent time near where she lives. “It was quite a quick romance, really. We just clicked.” She realised things were serious when the choir left for Scotland and she missed him terribly. Just after he returned to Kenya, Williams found herself unexpectedly pregnant. She was 42. While we chat in the sitting room of her compact house, Eric entertains himself with a picture book, the TV and a new Google Home speaker that occasionally emits animal noises. “There’ll be times when he’s playing, and all of a sudden, he’ll just come up to me and say, ‘Daddy’,” she says. “And we’ll pick up the phone and look at pictures. He’ll sit and swipe through the photos and always point him out: ‘Daddy.’” Eric has met his father only once: in October last year, Williams, her 18-year-old son, Archie, and Eric went to Kenya, and lived with Okoth as a family for three weeks. When they left, she says, Okoth “went into a depression. He struggled for the first month or so, just to get out of bed”. Okoth has applied for three UK visitor visas, and been turned down each time. Their best hope lies in applying for a fiance visa, getting married, and then going for a spouse visa. But the minimum salary requirement makes this almost impossible: in her job as the finance manager of a primary school, Williams gets a salary of about £12,000. “I’m far off,” she says. “Far off. I work part-time, and childcare costs are just horrendous. There might be a full-time vacancy available, but if I work full-time, Eric has to go into childcare longer, and I’m not ready for that. He’s already missing one parent: it’s not fair for me to put him into childcare so he’s missing two.” The earliest she might be earning enough, she thinks, might be in 2020. So in the meantime, she, Okoth and their son will have to carry on trying to sustain their online imitation of family life. “What can I do?” she says. “It’s hard. We even had a little dispute this morning about something. And the worst thing is, it’s all by text.” Okoth tells me from Kenya how hard it was to miss Eric’s birth. “It was very difficult to be so far away. I felt helpless. I wanted to share that wonderful moment and hold my newborn son,” he says. How is he now? “I try to keep positive. I don’t know if I will ever live in Somerset but I really hope so. Hopefully I can get a job, support Mandy and Eric; be a real family and be a role model for my son.” Tom Shelton is 42. He married his wife, Annie, in 2014, and began life as a family with her son, Dandan, who’s now five. For the moment, Shelton lives with his mum in her terrace house in the former steel town of Consett, County Durham. The day I arrive to speak to him, a dusting of snow lies on the pavement. His wife and her son, meanwhile, are stranded in the Philippines. In his 20s and early 30s, Shelton worked as a builder and plasterer. But in about 2008, when work dried up in Consett, he fell into the footloose life of an expat, first finding a job selling wine in Singapore, then getting involved in the property trade in the Seychelles. He met Annie on a between-jobs break in the Philippines: after an eight-month relationship, they got married. Dandan is her son from a previous relationship, but was only a toddler when Tom became part of their lives. “By birth, he’s not my son, but in every other respect, he is,” says Shelton. “He speaks great English. It’s wonderful being his father.” Soon after the wedding, Shelton made plans to take a job in Mauritius. His thinking was that Annie and her son would move there with him. But confirmation was delayed – and in the meantime, he temporarily returned to County Durham. “We assumed it’d be very easy for Annie to come to the UK, see all the sights, meet my family, and then we’d relocate to Mauritius,” he says. But her application for a visitor visa was rejected. “She didn’t have property in her name. She didn’t have a job at that time. They thought there was insufficient evidence of her intending to return to the Philippines.” They applied twice more, spending £10,000 on Home Office application fees in the process. In the meantime, the job in Mauritius fell through. On their third try for a visitor visa, Shelton says, the reason for refusal changed: this time, it was because the Home Office thought he didn’t have the financial means to support Annie and Dandan. “It put a massive strain on our relationship,” he says. “And at that point, I said, ‘I’m going to pack my bags and come to the Philippines. That’s it.’” He pauses. “I never really wanted to go and live in the Philippines. It’s a beautiful country, but it’s got its issues, right? I knew it wasn’t going to be a comfortable place to live. You get various warnings: ‘Don’t go to this place, don’t go to that place.’” Annie’s family are from the island of Mindoro, which has an economy split between tourism and farming. She and Shelton both had savings to draw on, and thought they could see a viable future. “We decided to buy some land,” says Shelton. “We bought a coconut plantation, two hectares – beautiful land, with a river running round it. The plan was to build a house there, and start a farming business, with some pigs, and live the good life.” Things started to go wrong when a local trader bought 60 of their pigs, promising to pay them within two weeks, and then failed to honour the agreement. Then, near Christmas 2015, disaster struck. Annie’s father was due to transport a lorry-load of the couple’s pigs to a coastal resort, where they would be sold. But they lost contact with him and his co-driver for five days, only for the police to find them horribly beaten up, and abandoned in woodland. The lorry and its load, says Shelton, had been hijacked; the people responsible were later found guilty of attempted murder and jailed. To make things worse, at around the same time, Typhoon Melor had nearly destroyed their home. “It was incredibly difficult to deal with,” he says. “Emotionally, we were at a very low ebb. I knew I had to do something drastic, to pull us out. So I made a decision to come back to the UK.” This was in early September 2017: he has been in Consett ever since. “It was hard,” he says, welling up. “But I knew I could get some work, and look after my family.” Having resolved to apply for a spouse visa so Annie and Dandan could live with him, Shelton began looking for work. He says he applied for about 50 jobs – in sales, mostly – but found that the big hole in his CV left by his time in the Philippines always counted against him. He is now self-employed, working as a plasterer – and, he says, earning enough money to meet the £22,400 threshold required if Annie and Dandan are going to come to the UK. But there is a snag: self-employed people have to submit a record for a full financial year, which means they will have to wait for at least 14 months to apply. Now, online conversations seem to provide a flimsy approximation of contact, and intimacy. “We Skype as much as we can, and I’m working every day I can,” he says. “They’re eight hours ahead. I wake up at 6.30am, and get ready for work, and we catch 10 or 20 minutes. And that’s pretty much it. “I don’t know if I can do a year without my family,” he says. “Emotionally, I don’t want to be separated from them for another day.” He would like to visit the Philippines more often, “but how many times can I do that? It eats into everything”. Two weeks later, I chat on Skype with Annie. Over 20 minutes, the sound occasionally dwindles to a watery burble, and her image often becomes hopelessly pixelated. For two months, she says, she has been working in a resort on the island of Parayan. “It’s safer for me and Dandan here,” she says. Dandan appears on the screen. “He misses his daddy, every single day,” she says. “He cries, especially when he wakes up in the morning. He asks for Tom.” The picture degrades to coloured blobs again; her voice starts to fade. “I’m very upset,” she says. “It’s very unfair. It shouldn’t be like that. The government should let families be together.” • Commenting on this piece?

It’s madness.” She hopes the thousands of travellers arriving every day by Eurostar from mainland Europe into the soaring 19th-century station will read her words, which were unveiled on Tuesday, and feel the love. “I don’t personally want to leave Europe at all – and this is my message to all Europeans. I love Europe. I’m not saying there are no problems with Europe, of course there are, so many of them, but it’s so much easier to sort problems from the inside.” Emin said the sentence had come straight into her mind, but it had taken a year to create the largest so far of what have become trademark works spelling out her texts in her own handwriting. “It looks effortless, it looks really simple but health and safety … believe me, it was really difficult. The main thing is the train drivers coming in must not be shocked, and so you can’t use some colours, no red or green or yellow.” Health and safety meant the letters had to use LEDs rather than her usual neon, but they were always going to be pink, she said. “At night the whole station will be bathed in a pink light, and it will make people happy, I promise you, it will make people smile because pink will make them feel good.” Interviewed on the BBC’s Today programme, Emin gave no more clues about her weekend revelation that she had once been sexually assaulted by “a well-known female artist” who had attempted to grab her crotch at a party. Emin had responded by threatening to “punch her lights out”. Women should have the confidence to respond to any such assault at the time, she told John Humphrys: “I shouted and I caused such a scene, and I told everybody what she had done, much to their humiliation and embarrassment. I don’t think they’ll be doing that again in a hurry.” “Everybody is making accusations and saying things about men, but it happens with everybody in many different circumstances – people don’t seem to be seeing the whole picture that harassment is actually bullying in a lot of cases as well.” The St Pancras light work is a commission from the station owner and the Royal Academy, and will be seen by an estimated 50 million travellers over the year. Tim Marlow, the artistic director of the Royal Academy, called Emin one of the most important and influential artists in the world. “Her work is intense and compelling and blurs the boundaries between the personal and the public and between art and life,” he said. After time in the station Emin said she hoped the piece might find a home in Europe – or in her native Margate. Apart from wrapping her arms around Europe, Emin said she hoped one day her words could have a more personal resonance: “I desperately hope to be met at the train station in a really romantic way – one day.” The headline of this article was amended on 11 April 2018 in order to more fully convey the artist’s own words about the intention of the artwork"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/10/medicine-pus-milk-brexit-trade-chlorinated-chicken","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:49:58Z","webTitle":"Costly medicines and pus in milk: a Brexit trade deal that’ll make you sick | Nick Dearden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/medicine-pus-milk-brexit-trade-chlorinated-chicken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/medicine-pus-milk-brexit-trade-chlorinated-chicken","fields":{"headline":"Costly medicines and pus in milk: a Brexit trade deal that’ll make you sick","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British public is already scared about a trade deal with the US. They don’t care for chickens washed in chlorine, nor for cows stuffed with hormones. But this week, an epic US document setting out the barriers to foreign trade it would like to remove shows that these concerns are just the tip of the iceberg. Not only do the 400-plus pages detail a stomach-churning list of foods the US would like to import into Britain – more pus in your milk and more pesticides on your vegetables – but they also uncover the US government’s distaste for the way the EU regulates big pharmaceutical corporations generally. The US would certainly ask us to strip away these regulations as part of a post-Brexit trade deal, which in turn poses a direct threat to NHS budgets and our ability to get our hands on life-saving medicines in the future. So a US trade deal could be both bad for our health, and bad for helping us get better again. In its report, the US government is clear that it hates the EU’s food policies. It wants to export chlorinated chicken (meat rinsed in antimicrobial wash as an alternative to keeping and killing animals in healthy conditions), and meat from animals stuffed with hormones, steroids, ractopamine, and endocrine disrupters (chemicals that mess with animals’ hormones and can cause cancer and birth defects). The list goes on, with the US unhappy about the EU’s “cautious” approach to approving genetically modified goods, chemical flavourings in food and the amount of pesticide residue allowed in fruits and nuts. They even think the amount of “somatic cells” allowed in milk in the EU is too restrictive. The US allows more white blood cells in milk than anywhere else in the world, even though this often indicates infection in the cow. The US argues that this is a matter of customer choice. But that’s disingenuous, both because importing this food will inevitably drive down standards here, and because, as we discover in the document, the US dislikes the sort of food labelling that allows the consumer to make an informed choice. If all of this is starting to make you feel queasy, it gets worse when you look at the “treatment” side of the equation. Medicines in the US are vastly more expensive than they are in Europe. So it’s little wonder that the US, batting for big pharma, disagrees with the (still very moderate) limitations many European governments place on pharmaceutical corporations. For starters, the US complains that there is “a lack of meaningful stakeholder input” into these policies. In turn this creates “uncertainty and unpredictability” and can “undermine incentives to market and innovate further”. In Britain, for instance, the NHS has some limited power to negotiate the price of medicines. It also has a framework for what is and isn’t “value for money”. None of this is to the taste of the US administration. Indeed, it even has a problem with the (again very limited) transparency the EU forces on pharmaceutical corporations to disclose drug trial dates. Drug trials are notoriously opaque, with vital information routinely withheld from the public, making it harder to scrutinise prices or even the real efficacy of medicines. This is the same agenda that the US has been pursuing in other trade deals. The American campaign group Public Citizen shows how the US routinely pushes for greater monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies in trade deals. On the government’s list are demands to make it easier to renew patents on medicines, allow an even greater degree of corporate control over clinical test data, grant new patents on biological medicines (including many new cancer treatments) and give corporations a greater say in healthcare policy. All of this amounts to a simple reality: if the US successfully pushes through these top-line demands in a trade deal with the UK, the NHS would either have to spend more money on drugs each year, or more patients would be denied access to those drugs. The secretive US-UK trade working group, led by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, met two weeks ago. We are not allowed to know much about the talks, but we do know that “services, investment, intellectual property rights and enforcement, regulatory issues” were discussed. That means: all of the above. Changes in regulatory standards on food and healthcare will be the price Trump charges for a trade deal with the UK. And we know that Fox himself has few qualms about lower food standards. So public attention is urgently needed here. But there is some good news too. First, Fox is wildly out of step with the British public. An opinion poll released over the weekend shows that a whopping 82% of Brits would rather not have a trade deal with the US than sacrifice decent food standards. Only 8% would put a trade deal first. Second, the trade bill, shelved for the time being as Theresa May fears losing a vote on the customs union, will have to return to parliament soon. MPs must take this opportunity to vote for powers to properly scrutinise the trade secretary and to have the right to stop trade deals they don’t like. The stakes couldn’t be higher. If we don’t want to give in to Trump’s trade demands, we must make trade policy democratic. • Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/10/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-face-class-action-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T15:45:24Z","webTitle":"Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face class action lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/10/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-face-class-action-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/10/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-face-class-action-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face class action lawsuit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British and US lawyers have launched a joint class action against Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and two other companies for allegedly misusing the personal data of more than 71 million people. The lawsuit claims the firms obtained users’ private information from the social media network to develop “political propaganda campaigns” in the UK and the US. Facebook, it is said, may initially have been misled, but failed to act responsibly to protect the data of 1 million British users and 70.6 million people in America. The data, it is suggested, was first used in the British EU referendum and then in the US during the 2016 presidential election. As well as Cambridge Analytica, the two firms named in the legal writ are SCL Group Limited and Global Science Research Limited (GSR). Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former campaign and White House adviser, led Cambridge Analytica in 2014, when the data was collected and extracted, the legal papers state. The Cambridge University neuroscientist Aleksandr Kogan, a founding director of GSR, is also named. Cambridge Analytica was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of SCL Group, which offered similar services to businesses and political parties. All the companies and Kogan have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Cambridge Analytica on Monday again rebutted many claims made about the company’s business. It argued, among other things, that it only ever received data on 30 million US citizens; that it did not use the data at all in the Trump campaign or the Brexit referendum; and that the Facebook data it received was legally obtained through a Facebook tool. “It has become open season for critics to say whatever they like about us based on speculation and hearsay,” the acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, said. The claim, the first involving British citizens, has been lodged in the US state of Delaware where Facebook, SCL and Cambridge Analytica are all incorporated. Seven individual plaintiffs, all Facebook users, are named in the writ; five American and two British. The numbers may expand as the case proceeds. It has been brought under the US Stored Communications Act. US lawyers said the legislation provides for a minimum $1000 (£700) penalty for any violation found by a court, meaning that, if the case goes against Facebook, it could face damages in excess of $70bn. Jason McCue, of the London-based McCue and Partners, which specialises in data privacy and human rights law, is leading the UK arm of the claim. He said: “The defendants effectively abused the human right to privacy of ordinary Facebook users and, if that were not enough, then the fruits of that abuse are alleged to have undermined the democratic process. This case will go some way to ensure that neither of these things can happen in the future.” The extracted data included names, phone numbers, mail and email addresses, political and religious affiliations, and other interests. It was used, it is said, “to accomplish Cambridge Analytica’s driving principle: to build psychological profiles of voters to affect election results in the UK and the US”. While Kogan’s GSR was granted permission by Facebook to collect data for academic research, the lawsuit maintains, it ended up being used for political and commercial purposes. Kogan created a personality quiz that required individuals to use their Facebook login credentials to take part. Approximately 270,000 Facebook users installed the application and gave their personal information to Kogan and Cambridge Analytica. The design of the application, however, allowed Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to harvest the personal information of more than 72 million Facebook users who were friends of the original 270,000 users. In the US, Robert Ruyak, the co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, said: “Facebook utterly failed in its duty and promise to secure the personal information of millions of its users, and, when aware that this … information was aimed against its owners, it failed to take appropriate action.” Richard Fields, of the Washington law firm Fields PLLC, said: “Facebook has made billions of dollars selling advertisements targeted to its customers, and in this instance made millions selling advertisements to political campaigns that developed those very ads on the back of their customers’ own … personal information. That’s unacceptable, and they must be held accountable.” News of the lawsuit came on the day Facebook started to notify individual victims of Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting operation, allowing the specific group of affected users to come forward for the first time. In early April, Facebook released aggregate figures of those it believed to be affected. Worldwide, it estimated that 87 million people had had their information harvested by the app, This is Your Digital Life, created by Cambridge Analytica and Kogan. The social network has since broken that figure down by country: the vast majority of those whose information was “improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica” were in the US (more than 70 million people), but substantial numbers of those affected were in the UK (1.1 million), Canada (600,000), India (550,000) and Australia (310,000). Most of those users will have had their information – including their public profile, page likes, birthday and home town – uploaded through no direct action of their own. Instead, one of their friends would have logged in to Kogan’s app and gave it permission to extract their friends’ data, probably unknowingly. Just 300,000 people worldwide – including 56 people in Australia and 10 in New Zealand, as well as an unknown number of users in the UK – were sufficient to gather the full data set. Facebook has made a commitment to proactively inform those whose data was taken by Cambridge Analytica, and on Tuesday the company made available a tool to allow users to check for themselves. As the scandal has grown, the systematic weakness of Facebook’s access controls in the first half of this decade has prompted concerns that Cambridge Analytica may just be the tip of the iceberg. Facebook has confessed to another unrelated data leak, with more than a billion profiles being “scraped” due to a feature that allowed users to look at pages by entering a phone number or email address. The company has not yet made a commitment to informing users of whether they were caught up in any of these other data leaks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/10/nhs-humanist-chaplain-religious-belief","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T14:48:43Z","webTitle":"The NHS’s new humanist chaplain is a welcome sign of our shifting spirituality | Andrew Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/nhs-humanist-chaplain-religious-belief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/nhs-humanist-chaplain-religious-belief","fields":{"headline":"The NHS’s new humanist chaplain is a welcome sign of our shifting spirituality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The appointment of 28-year-old Lindsay van Dijk as a humanist chaplain at the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust, leading a team of three Christians, is a rather overdue acknowledgment of the changing religious nature of Britain. It should also make us think about the nature and function of religion, and how little this has to do with belief. Humanism is increasingly the default position in England when people don’t want to think about theology or religious questions. It has replaced “C of E” as the translation of a muffled “don’t know” in questions about religious identity. It’s not the same as atheism, which implies a much sharper-edged conception of identity. Humanists, you might say, don’t believe in God but think it’s rude to say so, just as traditional Anglicans did believe in God but thought it rude to talk about Him. It can be difficult to tell the difference in practice. Humanists and C of E congregants are both nice people, who believe in the value of decency – but humanists are likely the children or grandchildren of Anglicans. It’s seldom the other way round. The reason this shift doesn’t much diminish the amount of spirituality in the world is that religions are not really about belief at all. They are about identity, morality and myths. Because we imagine that religions proceed from doctrine to practice, we tend entirely to misunderstand the way that they work. In fact we get it precisely backwards. Religions become incredible not as a result of scientific progress, but because the small, taken-for-granted habits and rituals that sustain them fall out of use. But the human needs that sustained them remain. In part, these are for rituals to mark birth, death, marriage and other major events. Humanism supplies all of these in modern Britain, as do its religious competitors. Beyond these special occasions, there are ordinary day-to-day needs in any community that have traditionally been filled in this country by Christians and in particular by the Church of England, but are increasingly filled by humanists and others who offer services of a religious nature to people who are uncomfortable with the idea of “religion”. This idea has been explored in a series of works by the Lancaster University sociologist of religion, Linda Woodhead. She says that the meat and drink of chaplaincy is emotional healing; the management of personal relationships, which might be called counselling; and divination, or advice about the future. None of these require a belief in God, of course; but none are defensible on grounds of strict rationality, either. They are a central part of Pentecostal Christianity and of some forms of Islam, too. In a humanist guise, they are immediately attractive to young people in this country because they seem not to require allegiance to anything ridiculous. The job of a chaplain in a multifaith environment is to meet people where they are and minister to all of them, regardless of their views. Again, this was the traditional self-understanding of the Church of England, and it could be argued that this is how some evangelical Christians interpret their role in society. But the ability of the Christian churches to carry out that mission in modern Europe has been badly damaged by the breakdown of traditional gender roles: institutional resistance to giving women power as members of the clergy led to a huge disenchantment among the generation of middle-class women, now in their 50s and 60s, as tracked by the sociologist Abby Day. They tended to abandon organised religion themselves and certainly did not transmit the habit of churchgoing to their daughters. Much of the story of religion in the past 50 years has been about the rise of fundamentalism, and other forms of belief that define themselves in opposition to the societies around them. The spread of humanist chaplaincies is a reminder of the importance of the opposite tendency: forms of belief that sacralise the practices of society around them. In the long term this will always be much more popular. • Andrew Brown is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/10/david-squires-on-manchester-citys-difficult-week-manchester-united-liverpool","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T10:38:04Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … Manchester City's difficult week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/10/david-squires-on-manchester-citys-difficult-week-manchester-united-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/10/david-squires-on-manchester-citys-difficult-week-manchester-united-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … Manchester City's difficult week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/11/choreographer-william-forsythe-enb-ballet-voices-of-america","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"William Forsythe: 'Ballet demands strength that few would be willing to muster'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/11/choreographer-william-forsythe-enb-ballet-voices-of-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/11/choreographer-william-forsythe-enb-ballet-voices-of-america","fields":{"headline":"William Forsythe: 'Ballet demands strength that few would be willing to muster'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the age of 68, choreographer William Forsythe finds himself coming home. After more than 45 years working in Europe, changing the face of dance, he has returned to his native America. “Just in time for the Trump spectacle,” he says, with his low, rolling laugh. More significantly, since he left his own company in 2015, he has turned his attention back to the ballet studio. After a journey that took him to the outermost shores of contemporary movement, where he has reimagined the classical vocabulary, turning it around, taking it apart and examining it from every angle, he is back working with pointe shoes and traditional forms. The significance of his double homecoming does not escape him. “I am now a native English speaker living in an English-centric country. In the same way, I feel like a native ballet speaker. It is interesting to look around and see what these very talented people such as Justin Peck, Alexei Ratmansky and Christopher Wheeldon are doing. I think I can contribute to the conversation. And I want to contribute but also to throw down the gauntlet, questioning the choices that contextualise ballet. The music, for example. The visuals.” At the moment, he is in London, putting his thoughts into practice while creating a new work for English National Ballet, his first for the company, which will have its premiere in a programme called Voices of America, at Sadler’s Wells from Thursday. Called Playlist (Track 1, 2), and choreographed for 12 male dancers, it combines batterie, a virtuosic display of leaping while beating the feet, with music by contemporary artists such as Lion Babe (remixed by Jax Jones) and Peven Everett. Performed alongside his thrilling 1996 piece Approximate Sonata – which he describes as “an essay on the nature of pas de deux in the mid-20th century” – it asserts his desire to promote ballet as a relevant cultural force and one that should never embarrass its practitioners. “When we started to work on it, I said to the guys: ‘do you have that nano-second of pause before you say you are a ballet dancer?’ It’s a cultural thing. All these dancers are Olympic-level athletes, true Olympians. Ballet demands reserves of strength and focus that very few people would be willing to muster. “So we need to own it and demonstrate it. Once you see it supported by this other kind of musical framework, then young people might have fewer reservations about the form, just because it has been placed within a context that is familiar. The music that I have chosen is something they might listen to and it is good. Like Tchaikovsky, in 4/4 time and rigorous. “You have to remember when the big ballets were being made in the 19th century, they were contemporary art. I think you must speak to the future, to the next generation.” Forsythe, bearded, slim and full of energy, has the air of a prophet. It’s the first time he has worked with ENB, a company he got to know when they were performing in Paris in 2016 just as he was making Blake Works (to the music of James Blake) for the Paris Opera Ballet. “Even the French étoiles were impressed,” he says with a grin. “I think Tamara Rojo is doing an amazing job [as artistic director of ENB],” he adds. “I want to work where there is a really good community. There are companies and there are communities. This is a community. It breeds a different approach to work.” His words land in the wake of reports that the company has been unhappy and unsettled under Rojo’s directorship. “I have seen zero of that,” he says, firmly. “Indeed, I have experienced exactly the opposite feeling. I have the sense that everyone is so relaxed, so willing, able and ready to participate in a creative process.” He is particularly incensed that Rojo’s relationship with the principal dancer Isaac Hernandez has been held up to scrutiny by the anonymous complainers. Forsythe himself married two of his dancers: Tracy-Kai Maier, who died of cancer, and Dana Caspersen, still his wife and now a world expert on conflict resolution. He knows the territory. “I had the exact same kind of jealousy come up. It’s just the nature of the beast. People don’t have explanations for their own success or lack thereof and so scapegoats are easy to find. It is where people are most vulnerable so why not attack the most vulnerable part? “I find it unbelievably rude and disrespectful of Isaac. Tamara is a director so she has to deal with that stuff. It’s part of being a director. But to bring Isaac into it and question his skills. He is a world-class dancer, a person who works extraordinarily hard. In my opinion his work is impeccable. What a cheap shot!” Forsythe’s long experience gives him perspective. He ran his own company – known first as Ballet Frankfurt and then as the Forsythe Company – in Frankfurt from 1984 to 2015. Before that he was a dancer with Stuttgart Ballet, working with choreographers such as Kenneth MacMillan and Glen Tetley. He relished their collaborative approach. “Me being me, I always had suggestions,” he remembers, smiling. “And they were incredibly generous to me. Now I am in the position those artists were in and what I do is consciously and sincerely thank people for helping me out. “I am working in a way that replicates the best practice I have experienced. One of the big goals I have is to model the best leadership possible. In some senses, I’d like to be the person who I wish my own children would encounter at work.” Forsythe describes himself as a “complete bunhead”. He has always been obsessed with the history of ballet. “My idea of a good time is to go on YouTube and watch the 23 greatest female variations of all time,” he says with a laugh. Yet he came to ballet relatively late. From childhood he choreographed and performed in high school musicals and became a club dancer. But it was only at the age of 17 that he actually began to study dance. Once started, there was no stopping him. He performed with the Joffrey Ballet and then at Stuttgart, where he made ballets in the neo-classical vocabulary of his idol George Balanchine. By the time he choreographed In the Middle Somewhat Elevated for Sylvie Guillem and the young stars of Paris Opera Ballet in 1987, it was clear that he was a man who was ready to push ballet into new worlds, making its angles sharper, its balances more precipitous, and its impact more daring. As he went on, he treated his company as a laboratory of movement, drawing an entire world of thought, philosophy and art into his creations, but moving further and further from what most people recognised as ballet. He says now that this was, to some extent, based on pragmatism. “I didn’t have the money for pointe shoes,” he says. “It was prohibitive. So you adapt. On the one hand the budget we were given was wonderful and you knew what you had but it wasn’t designed to accommodate cost of living increases. So over 10 years our money went down. At the end there was no artistic budget. People said ‘oh you have such a bare aesthetic’.” His words die away, and he laughs. But although practicalities may have forced his hand, there is a sense in which the radical work he produced in those years has a deep richness of exploration that enables him to look at dance, and ballet in particular, with the clearest of eyes. Now, he is at a point that represents an interesting culmination of all that has gone before. In October, he brings A Quiet Evening of Dance to Sadler’s Wells, a collection of intricate, absorbing pieces, performed a capella. In May, he will be working in New York for the first time in decades, creating a piece for the new arts centre The Shed. He teaches for up to eight weeks a year at the newly opened Glorya Kaufman dance department at the University of Southern California. “It has proved to be very, very nice.” Returning to his roots is just part of his ongoing journey. “I don’t feel there is any break in the work I have made. But I am back on board with ballet and how I can help valorise this deep, deep knowledge that ballet people have. It’s a big historical thing. I am very interested in what will keep it relevant.” English National Ballet: Voices of America is at Sadler’s Wells, London, 12 to 21 April.

The west can do nothing, theguardian.com, 9 April)? Syria is smashed, its cities in rubble, half its population displaced, and to bring this about Assad has had to mortgage his country’s independence to Russia and Iran. Turkey is helping itself to a new security belt in the north. Assad has failed his country and people, and should be held accountable for this and his myriad crimes. Merely pointing the finger at western failures in Syria misses the full picture. No country and no actor comes out of this hell with any credit at all. Moreover, the most damaging external interventions in Syria in terms of destruction and killing were non-western, those of Russia, Iran, Turkey and Islamic State. The Gulf states ran a largely inept proxy war as well. The question now is, after so much destruction and suffering, how can we give some meaning to the hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians killed in these wars? Reconstruction and reconciliation are vital, but so too is political change and more inclusive government. Chris Doyle Director, Caabu (Council for Arab-British Understanding) • Maintaining hope and faith in humanity is hard enough these days. And now Patrick Wintour’s article about the ineffectiveness of the UN has sent a chill down my spine (Regime will regard American attack as a price worth paying for victory, 9 April). The Russian vetoes (against sending Syria’s crimes to the international court), marginalisation of the special envoy, obstructing efforts to outlaw chemical weapons, the institutionalisation of impunity – the last few nails have been hammered into the UN’s coffin. These are dark times. In its founding charter the UN declares that it will strive to achieve international cooperation in solving global problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion. Countries that regularly commit human rights abuses (eg no women’s rights, persecution of religious minorities, lack of freedoms of the press) are violating this charter. Why are they allowed to remain as members? The UN is not fit for purpose. It should get rid of the veto, a device used by bully states to the detriment of vulnerable people – the very people the UN is supposed to be protecting. Alison Hackett Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin, Ireland • To describe Ed Miliband’s refusal to back the Cameron government’s call for action following the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013 as “shameful”, as Matthew d’Ancona does (Don’t expect the west to act on Assad’s latest atrocity, Journal, 9 April), is to suggest that there was a realistic and sensible option. Should we have sent one of our nuclear-armed submarines? An unfinished giant aircraft carrier (without aircraft)? Some of our elderly aircraft to engage modern Russian-made fighters? Boots on the ground (what a ghastly phrase), which lead all too often to bodies in the ground? It is time to recognise that we are no longer a great power and that the idea of “punching above our weight” is not sensible for a boxer let alone a nation. D’Ancona correctly identifies a UN-based approach as the right one: we should thank Miliband for preventing a kneejerk reaction with extremely uncertain (but almost certainly not good) consequences. Dr Peter B Baker Prestwood, Buckinghamshire • Matthew d’Ancona suggests that but for “sanctimonious procrastination” caused by memories of the Iraq war, the UK could be part of a righteous western military effort to confront the regime of Bashar al-Assad. It must surely have occurred to him that if Britain and the US had not led the attack on Iraq then Syria might well not be where it is today. And if the west charges gung-ho into yet another major Middle Eastern conflict the unforeseen consequences may be even greater and more grotesque than those of the 2003 invasion.

After cutting his teeth at the Glasgow Herald, he moved south to the now defunct Morning Telegraph daily in Sheffield, and then to the Daily Telegraph magazine near Fleet Street. Later, he joined the Radio Times, and was working there when in 1989 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an illness that forced him to retire a few years later. Jim cut an exotic figure in the monochrome newsrooms of the 1960s. He wore green corduroy jackets and elegant suits, smoked cigarettes in long holders and often sported a bow tie. He had also lost all his hair shortly before his history finals at St Andrews University, so in the days of Beatlemania he stood out from the crowd long before shaven heads became a fashion statement. He loved cooking and socialising, gave sparkling parties at his Barbican flat, and in the early 90s surprised several of his large circle of friends by coming out as gay. Eldest of three children of Marie (nee Smith) and Capt James Davie, Jim was born in the coastal town of Montrose, just north of Dundee, and went to Montrose academy before the family moved to Edinburgh, where Jim attended Daniel Stewart’s college. Following the death of his father, a captain in the Merchant Navy, when Jim was nine, the family spent a year in his mother’s native Australia before returning to Scotland. Jim could turn his hand to most forms of print journalism. At the Glasgow Herald he was a features writer, but he switched effortlessly to writing editorials at the Morning Telegraph. At the Daily Telegraph magazine, his versatility was put to the test by its mercurial editor, John Anstey, who made enormous demands on his staff. Jim enjoyed the challenge of colour printing – an accomplished amateur painter, he had a good eye for photographs – and was known for sharp headlines and pithy captions. But although he liked the variety involved in producing a weekly magazine, he was uneasy with the atmosphere of perpetual change and left for the Radio Times. He was to stay there for almost 20 years, most notably as letters editor and regional features editor, commissioning and editing pieces with good humour and tact. Meanwhile he was producing a broad range of freelance work – reviewing fiction and cookery books, contributing features to a number of newspapers and writing regularly for the Guardian from 1977 on a range of subjects, which included a restaurant column, Eating Out. In involuntary retirement he remained an enthusiastic member of as many organisations as his MS would permit. First on crutches, then in his wheelchair, he kept up with the opera, his old school, his university, his City of London ward and, above all, the Parish Clerks, the 15th-century Guild whose members represent the ancient City parishes. His firm religious convictions helped him cope with his illness. He never complained about his MS, but as the condition eventually confined him to his wheelchair, he became increasingly dependent on his civil partner, Michael, who cared for him to the end. He is survived by Michael, and by his sisters, Marie and Ann."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/s-it-in-bad-taste-even-to-talk-about-having-good-taste","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Is it in bad taste even to talk about having good taste?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/s-it-in-bad-taste-even-to-talk-about-having-good-taste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/s-it-in-bad-taste-even-to-talk-about-having-good-taste","fields":{"headline":"Is it in bad taste even to talk about having good taste?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The interior designer Nicky Haslam has produced a new tea towel listing “Things Nicky Haslam Finds Common”, which include, but are not limited to: scented candles, celebrity chefs, Ibiza, not eating carbs, confidence, personal trainers, pronouncing the “e” in furore, expensive bikes, Halloween, jazz and saying “bye bye”. I sat with this for a while, as I encourage you to do too (further down the tea towel is “jet lag” and “loving your parents”) and considered the trouble with taste. It’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot since we decided to paint our kitchen cupboards. I mean, it didn’t feel like a decision that should cripple me, leave me wondering quite who I was, simply looking at colour charts and wondering what a person like me should like, but there I was, wobbling. I got over it of course – I took a photo of the horizon when I came out of the tube station after work and matched the top cupboards to the sky and the bottom cupboards to the silhouettes of the trees, bish bash bosh, lovely – but it was shaky for a moment there. I’ve felt it before, this instability, this awareness of the flimsiness of my identity, especially when faced with the purchase of something that faces outwards, or something so expensive I knew I would be stuck with it as a crucial component of my domestic personality for years to come. A sofa. A child. Haslam used to write a newspaper column called How Common, discussing the problem with, say, “Complaining about being ill” or “Specifying red wine” – “You should say: ‘Will you have some wine, or would you prefer white?’” – which he reprised for the Daily Mail in 2014, updating it with things like, “Going somewhere hot for Christmas”. One of the reasons his commentary on commonness continues to run is not just because class, bound so stickily to taste, is ingrained in our culture yet taboo to discuss, but because taste itself is almost impossible to navigate. In theory, good taste no longer exists. The idea of good taste today has a bitter tang, associated as it is with a historically skewed imposition from those that shouted loudest – usually rich white men with their own unwritten tea towels of things they believed to be common. No one opinion today is worth more than another. Pop music is given as much weight and attention as classical; artists have found huge diverse audiences on Instagram. In fact in art right now, it’s not just that the vast reach of social media means good taste is no longer dictated by the few, but in galleries we can see a conscious veering towards the naive, towards wonky figurative painting of the sort that 20 years ago would be dismissed as something a child could do. It’s “bad taste” art, in that it’s too easy to look at, and can hang on a wall, and requires no formal education. And yet taste matters. We feel safe hiding within it. It’s one of the few visible signs of class, of our standing in the world. The only issue I have with the wonderful Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, with its commentary on communication and the limits of modern masculinity, is the team’s imposition of their own understated middle class “good taste” on these men. It feels corporate and a bit grim. Every home they enter they leave with grey walls and a cluster of framed photographs, every wardrobe with a slim trouser, every kitchen with an avocado. Taste is used here like a plug-in air freshener, to neutralise these hapless straight guys, if not quite neuter them. How have I become a person that cares about a kitchen enough to publish the colour of my cupboards? I disgust myself, honestly, and often. Because I know I’m overthinking it. I yearn to be a person who knows exactly what they think about carpets, or designer logos, or the size of TVs. But I’m doing it in part, maybe, because the kitchen has become such a pivot of taste anxiety. Once, everybody would leave home at the end of their teens and go and find their own kitchens, their own cabinet of mistakes. But increasingly people are finding themselves unable to leave their parents’ sides, which adds a whole other dimension to the state of taste, where people have no room to rebel, no space to change and discover what they really like. And in this growing crack of tension a whole industry of Queer Eye-style corporate taste is growing. Until recently, only clothes were allowed to be fashionable, in and out across a season. Now those boundaries of taste have spread to interiors too, including the correct pot plants, colours and nostalgic inspirations. It’s easy to laugh at Haslam’s shameless snobbery, but we all have our own secret lists of taste. To unpick them would involve more than just dismantling the sponsored ads that follow us home. It would require a tearful exploration of our families, our ambitions and our anxiety about who we are. It’s easier then, to sit gently stewing in kitchens vibrating with messages of identity, and mop up spillages with whatever tea towel we have to hand. Good taste – this is not au revoir, this is bye bye. One more thing… This week the Ritz Hotel Paris auctions off 10,000 objects including brass toilet paper holders and plates for salad, bread, main course, cheese, dessert and asparagus. My new life awaits. The latest scandal to get the glossy nostalgia treatment is the story of Lorena Bobbitt. And, instead of focusing on the penis punchline, it will be a serious investigation of domestic abuse. Produced by the brilliant Jordan Peele, no less. Someone at US Marie Claire zoomed in on a photo of Meghan Markle’s head and spotted a story: headline, “Meghan Markle Has a Single Gray Hair.” But because it’s 2018, when glossy mags can no longer get away with shaming women for failing the Barbie test, it seems they quickly tried to spin it into a story of feminist victory. So, after they’d written “Meghan Markle Has a Single Gray Hair,” they followed it with, “And It’s Magnificent.” These are odd times to be female.

It was also award-winning. Now, it’s back on ABC for an initial eight-episode run (a second series has already been commissioned). Why wouldn’t old fans like me herald the return of Roseanne? The answer: Roseanne. Roseanne Barr was known as a colorful character long before her show’s debut. But though some on the left might have found her behavior distasteful – crotch-grabbing after singing the National Anthem badly at a baseball game, for example – in general, she was regarded as a card-carrying, Obama-voting Hollywood liberal. Sometimes, an extreme one: she ran for president in 2012, losing the Green Party nomination to Jill Stein. Also in 2012, she tweeted the home address of the parents of George Zimmerman, the killer of Trayvon Martin. But in the run-up to the release of the new show, it became apparent that Barr had changed sides. She’s embraced Trump and expressed far right views about everything from economics to immigration. She’s an enthusiastic retweeter (and sometimes deleter) of conspiracy theories, from Pizzagate to slurs about Palestinians to doctored photos of school shooting survivors doing Nazi salutes. And since the relaunch of the show, an old photoshoot of Barr dressed as Hitler baking cookies meant to represent Jewish people has been doing the rounds again on Twitter – Barr is Jewish, and the shoot was done for the satirical Jewish magazine Heeb in 2009, which maybe makes it slightly less antisemitic. But it was still in unquestionably bad taste. After the debut of the show, the president himself called her with his personal congratulations – “It was very sweet,” Barr said – and claimed credit for the show’s ratings at a rally in Ohio: “They were unbelievable. Over 18 million people. And it was about us.” Sean Hannity promptly invited her to guest host his show. On the other hand, many on the left pointed out that Trump has failed to find time to call many other people, such as family members of victims of the Parkland shooting, families of military people fallen in combat, and his own secretary of state. His admiration of Barr is in keeping with his admiration of himself. But does all of this mean that folks who loathe everything about the current president should boycott the new series on ethical grounds? In 2018, Roseanne Conner, like her creator, is also a Trump supporter. But unlike Barr, her support of Trump is driven less by belief in rightwing conspiracy and more by the belief that he’d do more for her white, working-class Illinois family than Hillary Clinton. Does this normalize Trump supporters? Maybe. Or maybe it gives a valuable and realistic glimpse into how families deal with politics in 2018. In the first episode, we learn that the rest of Roseanne’s family are not necessarily in agreement with her. She and her sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) have become estranged because of Jackie’s ardent support of Hillary Clinton. Darlene (Sara Gilbert) is also not on board with her mother in the political sense, but she’s been forced by the loss of a job and a husband to bring her two children back to live with her parents. Becky’s (Lecy Goranson) life has also not gone smoothly: her husband died, she’s working as a waitress because she didn’t graduate from college, and she’s trying to make money by serving as a surrogate mother to a woman who looks just like her (played by Sarah Chalke, who shared the role with Goranson throughout various seasons). Watching the first three episodes of the reboot, I listened to the laugh track with suspicion: is the studio audience laughing with Darlene and Jackie or at them? Do their sympathies lie with Roseanne’s politics or simply her character? In the second episode, Roseanne and her husband Dan contend with their grandson’s gravitation to a sterotypically feminine wardrobe. Roseanne threatens the other kids at his new school if they bully him. Dan arms him with a knife (unrealistically, Mark is not expelled from school for this) but then concedes that it’s OK for young Mark to wear a skirt “but he really needs to wear underwear”. Their acceptance of Mark’s gender-fluidity feels like it harks back to old school Roseanne. On the other hand, the next episode features Roseanne and Darlene battling over the best way to discipline Darlene’s sassy teen daughter Harris. It culminates with Roseanne pushing her granddaughter’s head down in the kitchen sink and spraying her with water. Here, when the studio audience laughs, I cringe: maybe I’m a snowflake, but that strikes me as abuse. “There’s Roseanne Barr and then there’s Roseanne Conner,” according to the showrunner Bruce Helford in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. Roseanne Conner is just a white working-class grandmother who wants the best for her family; Roseanne Barr is a woman who exchanges admiring tweets with the president. This has included an endorsement of a disturbing pro-Trump conspiracy theory about what a New York Times writer sums up as “an inconceivably evil and powerful network of coup-plotters and child sex traffickers that includes Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros”. In time, this new series of Roseanne may well be regarded as a seminal example of Trump-era culture. In time, whether we regard the people who make it as creatives or colluders will also become clear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/11/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-slim-macbook-pro-rival","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Huawei MateBook X Pro review: the slim, do-it-all MacBook Pro rival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-slim-macbook-pro-rival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/11/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-slim-macbook-pro-rival","fields":{"headline":"Huawei MateBook X Pro review: the slim, do-it-all MacBook Pro rival","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The MateBook X Pro is Huawei’s more powerful follow up to last year’s excellent MateBook X, and as the name might imply it is aimed squarely at Apple’s MacBook Pro. PC laptops have come a long way in the last few years, with good design, build and performance – all hallmarks of Apple’s laptop line – now common in the £1,000-plus category. It would be fair to say that the MateBook X Pro has more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s top-end laptop. It’s not that it’s a carbon copy, more a machine that takes just the good bits. With the lid closed it looks like a fairly generic thin-and-light aluminium laptop with a gentle taper and a Huawei logo on the top, available in “space grey” and silver. Open it and you find a MacBook-like backlit keyboard, large trackpad, a power button and two side grilles. But the screen is the star of the show. It’s a beautiful and crisp 13.9in 3:2-ratio screen squeezed into the frame with very slim bezels all round. It’s easily one of the best on the market and is quite large by modern laptop standards, housed in a smaller body typically associated with a 12in-screen laptop. The build of the machine is generally very good, with chamfered edges and a good fit and finish. There’s no give or flex in the keyboard, but there is a little in the rest of the deck and at the sides. The screen also has a little bit of give when squeezed when closed, or twisted when open. Specifications Screen: 13.9in LTPS 3000 x 2000 (260 ppi) Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (8th generation) + Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU RAM: 8 or 16GB Storage: 256 or 512GB Operating system: Windows 10 Camera: 1MP pop-up webcam Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 3.0, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, headphones Dimensions: 217 x 304 x 14.6mm Weight: 1.33kg Power on tap The MateBook X Pro is available in a couple of configurations, with a choice of 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, 8 or 16GB of RAM and 256 or 512GB of storage. Most of that is par for the course, but the Huawei machine also comes with a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory, which is rare for a machine of this size. The MX150 won’t set the gaming world alight, but it is a significant step up in performance for things like editing photos and video, or even powering a 4K display over your typical integrated graphics chips. It’s worth noting that the MX150 comes in two versions and the MateBook X Pro is fitted with the lower power 10W version, which is less powerful but more frugal than the 25W version that some other machines have fitted. Overall the MateBook X Pro was one of the best performing laptops I’ve ever used, easily handling anything and everything from video editing and advanced photo editing, to a bit of light gaming and Chrome with as many tabs as you can fit on one screen. Ports The MateBook X Pro might be thin, but it still has a single full-sized USB 3.0 port along side a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port. Either of the USB-C-shaped ports can be used to charge the machine, while there’s a traditional headphones socket, but no card reader. Battery Huawei is well known for its battery life in smartphones. Unfortunately, while the MateBook X Pro has reasonable battery life it isn’t anywhere near class-leading. It will get you through a work day without needing the charger, but if you want to watch a video on the commute home you’ll be out of luck. In my testing the MateBook X Pro lasted just over eight hours between charges while performing regular office duties, which includes lots of email, around 15 browser tabs open in Chrome, some photo editing, listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and lots of writing into lightweight text editors. Heavier things such as gaming affected the battery life quite a bit, but generally speaking most users will plug the laptop in to game or perform similarly demanding tasks for any extended period. Using it Performance aside, the MateBook X Pro is a lovely machine to use. It’s whisper-quiet for the most part, with its fans only spinning under sustained heavy load, and its brilliant screen is matched by an equally excellent keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard looks like a MacBook Pro keyboard, but with real key travel. It’s a satisfying typing experience that is rarer than you might think on even expensive laptops. The keyboard also hides one of the most interesting tricks I’ve seen on a laptop in a while. The key between F6 and F7 is actually a pop-up webcam. Press it and it reveals a one-megapixel camera, which certainly has a tendency for the up-the-nose shot, but simply doesn’t get in the way during normal use. If you’re one of the vast majority of laptop users that barely ever turn on their webcam, this is a great compromise and it means no one is going to be able to hack your webcam and spy on you. There’s even a mute switch for the microphones, so no one will be able to listen to you either. The large trackpad is silky smooth and responsive, making it one of the best in the industry – at no stage did I end up zooming when I tried to scroll, which is something many PC laptops still struggle with. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner and will recognise you and log you into Windows when switching on with one momentary press, taking about eight seconds to power on and be useable. The MateBook X Pro has a Dolby Atmos sound system with four speakers built into it: two tweeters at the back and two bass speakers at the front, not that there’s any visual indication that they’re there. I was sceptical, but the four-speaker system actually works very well. It’s louder, clearer and has a smidgeon more bass than most of the best of the rest, although the audio is less direct than it might be on a machine with front-facing speakers such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro. They’re still laptop speakers, so don’t expect true room-filling sound or the quality of a set of external speakers, but they’re capable of being clearly heard while cooking and provide solid impromptu movie-watching experience. Observations Huawei says the keyboard is spill-proof, but that’s not something I tested The keyboard lacks media keys, missing pause/play and track skip buttons The included power adapter is one of the smallest 65W USB-C chargers around and will charge pretty much anything with USB-C The screen is touch-sensitive unlike last year’s MateBook X The automatic backlight control can be a bit aggressive making the screen dimmer than it should be There is some confusion as to whether the machine will ship with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in every country – I would not recommend buying one without as it is crucial to enable Bitlocker drive encryption Price The Huawei MateBook X Pro will cost €1,499 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, €1,699 for the same processor and RAM but 512GB of storage, or €1,899 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage – as tested. A UK launch and pricing has yet to be determined. For comparison, For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a comparable screen and 8th generation Core i5 starts at £1,399, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, the Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249. Models with discrete graphics cost more, with Microsoft’s Surface Book 2 starting at £1,999 and Apple’s 15in MacBook Pro starting at £2,349. Verdict The MateBook X Pro shows that Huawei has what it takes to build a great laptop. The screen is brilliant and the tiny bezels mean you get a very good sized display in a pretty small body – 14in, it turns out, is a great size for both work and play on a thin and light laptop. It’s not a one-trick pony, either. It has one of the best keyboards on the market, an excellent, large trackpad and solid connectivity, it is a do-it-all machine in a beautiful case. It’s not perfect, though. There’s give in the aluminium where I don’t think there should be, and the battery life is good but not class-leading. But on the whole Huawei has created something quite special here. Pros: beautiful screen, tiny bezels, slim, compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, regular USB port, fingerprint scanner, discrete GPU, pop-up webcam, Dolby Atmos speakers that are good Cons: battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, webcam has an up-nose angle, only two USB-C ports of which one has to charge the machine Other reviews Microsoft Surface Book 2 review: a powerful yet pricey laptop-tablet combo Microsoft Surface Laptop review: a USB-C short of the best Windows 10 laptop Apple 13in MacBook Pro (2017) review: battery life to get through a working day"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/10/pumarosa-isabel-munoz-newsome-smear-test-embarrassed-cervical-cancer","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"Pumarosa’s Isabel Munoz-Newsome: ‘I didn’t get a smear test because I was embarrassed.

Stupid’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Almost exactly a year ago, I watched Pumarosa flood the cavernous Oval Space in east London with a swell of moody psych rock, heady and hypnotic on the eve of releasing their debut album, The Witch. The rest of the European tour, followed by festivals and a worldwide slot supporting Depeche Mode, was on the horizon. The band were giddy and, after the gig, their friends celebrated by putting on a warehouse party. “It was great, everyone was going totally wild,” says frontwoman Isabel Munoz-Newsome, picking at poached eggs in a Brighton cafe. But she had been for some tests at the doctor’s a few days before and, at the back of her mind, a tiny voice nagged. Two weeks later, as the album picked up a string of stunning reviews, Munoz-Newsome was diagnosed with cervical cancer. “I want to talk about it because I’d never had a smear test until then and that’s the only reason I found out,” she says, with quiet urgency. We have spent half an hour chatting about rave culture, small towns, sisters and Patti Smith before she admits awkwardly that the last year of Pumarosa’s success has been the weirdest of her life. “At a time when everything should have been pure magic and everyone was happy and congratulating us, I was so angry. It was surreal. Doing the Jools Holland show and all that stuff, I just thought: ‘What the fuck am I doing here?’” She had not felt unwell beforehand, but within a month of the diagnosis Munoz-Newsome was operated on and her cervix was removed. “It was pretty gruesome, but [my] womb and everything is still intact, so I’m still getting periods and that’s still functioning, but …” She laughs bleakly. “But getting a smear test every three years is so important.” She can’t emphasise this enough, she says, because she knows so many women make excuses or miss appointments or believe a lack of symptoms means they don’t have to bother; attendance for cervical screenings in the UK was reported in January to be at a 20-year low. “I was so angry at myself that I just hadn’t gone because I was embarrassed. Isn’t that ridiculous? I was embarrassed by my own body. Stupid.” Munoz-Newsome founded Pumarosa three years ago with her boyfriend Nick Owen, the band’s drummer. The couple left behind the inner-city squat and DIY scene to move to the quieter, outer edges of London last year. She has more space to paint there (the band’s artwork is all hers) and write their songs in a less claustrophobic setting. While the cancer has now gone and she is OK, it has forced her to think about new things and to ask new questions. “It’s harder to get pregnant,” she says, by way of example. “And once you are pregnant it’s just harder for it to not have complications because you don’t have a cervix. The other thing that was quite weird, which I’d never thought about is: if I do get pregnant, I won’t be able to give birth – it would have to be a caesarean, because [my uterus] is stitched up.” Her hands swoop for emphasis and her chest rises with her voice. “I’d never considered that I’d never do that thing that’s so primal, and part of me really wanted to; I was super sad about it. When I read that, going through all the implications of the operation, I just broke down. And I was so shocked, because it’s not something I would’ve thought of, and they don’t tell you that stuff at the hospital – I was reading it on the internet, finding out for myself.” She didn’t know beforehand? “They don’t tell you,” she shrugs. Munoz-Newsome’s mother is an artist who marked the birth of her elder daughter with an extensive photography project. “The whole of my birth is documented in photos. And when I was little we weren’t allowed to watch scary movies, so we’d look at that album. It’s really progressive and really radical and they’re beautiful photos, but we just thought: ‘Blood! Eurgh!’” She laughs, softening the stiff irony hanging in the air. Munoz-Newsome grew up in Bath with her sister, Fernanda, in a spirited, creative household; their Chilean father is an illustrator and their mother now lectures part-time in fine art. Both daughters moved to London for art school: Fernanda has become a dance artist and something of a muse to her sister; Isabel studied theatre design and helped create sets for plays in pub theatres and the National before music became full-time. “Fernanda is a big point of gravity in my life, I suppose – loads of stuff revolves around her. Even without realising it.” The two share circles of friends and explored London’s hedonistic elements together in their 20s. Priestess, the seductive lead single from The Witch, was inspired by her sister’s performances, with a nod to Victorian occultism and pagan folklore. The concept of the album itself came via a copy of Silvia Federici’s cult Marxist-feminist text, Caliban and the Witch, which Isabel had borrowed from Fernanda. “It’s an incredible piece of work about the transition from feudalism to capitalism from the female perspective,” she says. Federici centres on the dark saga of the 15th-century witch hunts that consumed Europe with terror for more than 200 years; the book challenges the idea that capitalism was a progressive or necessary development by revealing its reliance on spectacular violence against women. “It was just completely eye-opening to read that, prior to that, women had actually occupied quite a different place in society in England, France, Italy. They were metalworkers, they worked in fields and were strong – we are strong – and men did lots of things that have now come to be traditionally seen as women’s work. The idea that the church was at one point setting up more and more brothels to push the idea of the woman as a whore is mindblowing, but learning it as a woman is so powerful – it’s freedom.” The book became a source of energy for her, she explains; it also inspired the band’s current single, Lions’ Den. “It’s empowering to realise that this isn’t just the natural order of things, it didn’t naturally occur – it was horrifically pinned on us. Men, too.” Federici writes about the multiple ways women have been vilified in history, “accused of being unreasonable, vain, wild, wasteful”. “Especially blamed was the female tongue, seen as an instrument of insubordination,” Federici argues. The tropes of the disobedient wife, the witch, the shrew, pervaded popular culture of the period; Shakespeare’s works could be read as a manifesto of the age. Munoz-Newsome is beguiling on stage – all limbs and joyful abandonment – but enthusiastic, unpretentious company. She talks about growing up in love with “tacky dance music like Baby D, N-Trance, fairground music”, grateful that Somerset felt a less self-conscious place to be a teenager, compared with the capital. The night before we meet, the band play a sellout show in Brighton to a largely male audience. Today, they have been announced on the bill for Robert Smith’s pleasingly doomy but inescapably blokey Meltdown. How does she feel about the way she is inevitably objectified as ‘the sexy frontwoman’? “It’s strange,” she admits. “When you’re a teenager, that’s all you want, so you kind of have to try and enjoy it. Last night felt fine, the energy was nice, but occasionally it’s gross and there are certain gigs where I feel I’m responding to it on stage but don’t feel so good afterwards.” Munoz-Newsome catches herself sometimes, uncomfortable at the pressure to look the part of the enigmatic, beautiful, blond waif. “It would be so much cooler just to be, like: ‘Fuck this.’ But I’ve always loved dressing up and playing with costumes; I don’t want to limit that for myself. Earlier on, I was more conventional in what I was trying to do and it was boring.” Ultimately, women are conditioned to worry about the way they look. “Yes. It’s like having a radio on in the back of your head all the time saying something that’s completely unintellectual and not very interesting, but you can’t help listening to it.” We come back to Federici: “It’s just a symptom of capitalism; apparently, women spend something mad like up to 30% of their income on their appearance. There’s a huge industry playing on our insecurities. It’s disgusting.” Outside, a jagged wind and rain whip against the cafe windows. It is resolutely gloomy, but Munoz-Newsome is sanguine. “I used to be quite obsessive with certain things to do with the band and so anxious about not being exploited as a woman and as artists – that’s just the way the industry has been set up – but I can’t worry about it any more,” she says. The shock of cancer hasn’t changed her outlook, but it has offered perspective. “Now I find a way to constructively get over [anxiety] – when I feel it creeping up, I just think: ‘Breathe! And do something else.” Pumarosa play Meltdown festival at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 23 June. Their new single, Lions’ Den, taken from the album The Witch, is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/09/get-more-migrant-workers-to-offset-strain-of-ageing-population-warns-imf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T16:27:54Z","webTitle":"More migrant workers needed to offset ageing population, says IMF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/get-more-migrant-workers-to-offset-strain-of-ageing-population-warns-imf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/09/get-more-migrant-workers-to-offset-strain-of-ageing-population-warns-imf","fields":{"headline":"More migrant workers needed to offset ageing population, says IMF","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The International Monetary Fund has said advanced economies such as Britain, the US and Japan risk being overwhelmed by their ageing populations, and calls on them to throw open their borders to more migrant workers in response. Within the next few decades, working-age adults will need to support double the number of elderly people than they do now, putting immense pressure on welfare systems and wiping out as much as 3% of potential economic output by 2050, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report. The Fund’s comments come as the number of migrant workers arriving in Britain from Europe is already in sharp decline following the Brexit vote almost two years ago, and as populist parties in many western countries push their governments to curb immigration. The analytical chapters of its report, published on Monday, said: “Dramatic shifts in demographic structure projected in advanced economies could overwhelm the ability of policies to offset the forces of ageing. “[This] underscores the need to rethink migration policies to boost labor supply in advanced economies.” Without government intervention, the IMF said the current labour force participation rate, which estimates the number of people eligible for work who are in employment, could fall by as much as 5.5% on average across advanced economies over the next 30 years. Net annual migration of EU nationals to Britain fell by 75,000 in the year to September, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, hitting the lowest level for five years. Company bosses have raised growing concerns about labour shortages as a result. Without more doctors and nurses from abroad, there are also fears that the NHS could increasingly struggle to cope with the rising demands posed by an ageing population. The government’s own economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimates healthcare spending in the UK will need to almost double from 6.9% of GDP in the early 2020s to 12.6% by the mid-2060s because of the demographic shift. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates the public purse will be out of pocket by about £160bn by the mid-2060s as the number of people over 65 grows by almost a third, while the working age population is expected to only increase by about 2%. The IMF said governments could attempt to counter the demographic timebomb through better policies to help people balance family life with work. It also called for more investment in education to get people into work and boost their chances of staying in a job longer. There have been steady increases in the number of women entering the workforce in recent decades, as shifting cultural norms and government policies encourage them to stay in work after childbirth and for longer into their careers. The IMF said for the median advanced economy, the female labour force participation rate had increased by close to 10% since 1985. It said, however, that more women and older workers alone may not be enough for economies to solve the problem. It said labour market participation would still eventually decline even if gender gaps are fully closed, and that it was also likely to remain below current levels even if more older people stay in work for longer. “Unless technology delivers offsetting productivity gains, these findings highlight the need for many advanced economies to rethink immigration policies to boost their labor supply, alongside policies to encourage older workers to postpone retirement,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/09/raising-eyebrows-how-evolution-gave-us-expressive-faces","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T15:27:11Z","webTitle":"Raising eyebrows: how evolution gave us expressive faces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/09/raising-eyebrows-how-evolution-gave-us-expressive-faces","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/09/raising-eyebrows-how-evolution-gave-us-expressive-faces","fields":{"headline":"Raising eyebrows: how evolution gave us expressive faces","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Modern humans might never have raised a quizzical eyebrow had Homo sapiens not lost the thick, bony brows of its ancient ancestors in favour of smoother facial features, a new study suggests. Researchers at the University of York believe early humans bore prominent brow ridges as a mark of physical dominance, and as the human face evolved to become smaller and flatter, it became a canvas on which the eyebrows could portray a much richer range of emotions. “We traded dominance or aggression for a wider palette of expression,” said Paul O’Higgins, a professor of anatomy and lead author on the study. “As the face became smaller and the forehead flattened, the muscles in the face could move the eyebrows up and down and we could express all these subtler feelings.” The York team stress their conclusions are speculative, but if they are right, the evolution of smaller, flatter faces may have unleashed the social power of the eyebrow, allowing humans to communicate at a distance in more complex and nuanced ways. “We moved from a position where we wanted to compete, where looking more intimidating was an advantage, to one where it was better to get on with people, to recognise each other from afar with an eyebrow flash, and to sympathise and so on,” said Penny Spikins, a palaeolithic archaeologist at York and co-author on the study, published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution. The scientists set out to investigate why ancient humans had such prominent brow ridges in the first place. Over the years, researchers have put forward a range of hypotheses. One idea states that the ridge simply filled the gap that would otherwise exist between the protruding face and the braincase. Another argues that a prominent brow served as structural reinforcement, ensuring the face could take the stress of powerful chewing. Working with their colleague Ricardo Godinho, the researchers obtained a 3D x-ray scan of an ancient skull belonging to a human ancestor called Homo heidelbergensis that lived in what is now Zambia between 300,000 and 125,000 years ago. Known as Kabwe 1, the skull displayed a thick brow ridge that was even more prominent than the ones seen on Neanderthals. Using computer models, the scientists performed a series of experiments on the virtual skull. First, they looked at how much brow bone was needed if its purpose was to plug the gap between the face and the braincase. “We shaved away the bone to get the minimum needed to fill the gap and found we could reduce its size dramatically,” O’Higgins said. “The skull has far more bone than is needed to fill the gap.” Next, the researchers looked at how the stress of chewing spread over the face with and without the brow ridge. Again, it seemed to make little difference. “We fully expected serious consequences for the face, but nothing happened. It’s clear that this is not about resisting bending in the face,” O’Higgins said. “What we are left with is the plausibility of a social explanation.” It is unclear what factors led the human face to become smaller over time and lose its thick brow ridges, but a flatter face may have paved the way for richer human communication and with that the greater collaboration that emerged with the rise of Homo sapiens. In Homo heidelbergensis and other ancestors, the thick brow signified physical strength at the apparent expense of eyebrow gymnastics: in those early humans, the muscles that moved the eyebrows simply pulled them back and forth over their brows. Given the importance of eyebrows in human communication, it is not clear why other primates do not use them more, said Robin Dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University. “It is plausible to suggest that it has something to do with increased need for more complex communication in the larger social groups that evolved late during the course of human evolution,” he said. Rachael Jack, who studies human social interaction at the University of Glasgow, said the expressive value of eyebrows made them “strong candidates for evolution to pick them up as social signallers.” But she added: “The human face has many more muscles though, which are likely to have contributed substantially to the development of socially sophisticated communication, group cohesiveness and functioning, and therefore survival and progress. So I’m not totally convinced that eyebrows are the missing part of the puzzle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/no-kidding-goat-meat-ethical-new-lamb-healthy-sustainable-flavour","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T15:05:22Z","webTitle":"No kidding: goat is the (ethical) new lamb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/no-kidding-goat-meat-ethical-new-lamb-healthy-sustainable-flavour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/no-kidding-goat-meat-ethical-new-lamb-healthy-sustainable-flavour","fields":{"headline":"No kidding: goat is the (ethical) new lamb","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some years ago, sitting on a train somewhere in West Bengal, flicking through a dog-eared Indian guidebook for the hundredth time, it dawned on me that the mutton we had been happily eating for the past three months was probably goat, rather than the sheep we’d assumed. I still remember the shock – after all, in the provincial Britain of the 1990s, goat’s cheese still seemed pretty exotic. Last month, I went into my local butcher’s looking for lamb mince for a shepherd’s pie and was persuaded to try goat instead – and very nice it was too. Not long afterwards, I finally made it to Kricket, a wildly popular “Indian-inspired” restaurant in Soho, London, whose goat dishes include a rich, offal-spiked keema and a curry described by Time Out as the best thing on the menu. Why has goat, which has long been popular with Caribbean, Middle Eastern and Asian cooks, suddenly found favour with British chefs such as Fergus Henderson, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jeremy Lee, who reckons it makes “faggots to die for” – and should the rest of us follow their lead? Sustainability There are 45,000 commercial dairy goats in the UK, with demand predicted to rise by 500%. That means an awful lot of male kids that can either be raised for meat – or euthanised at birth. If you eat goat’s cheese or drink goat’s milk, you should consider eating goat meat as well. Health Goat is lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than most red meat, which makes it a good choice of protein for us omnivores. Flavour Although it is often dismissed as tough or unpleasantly strong, not all goat is alike. Kid, like lamb, is tender and delicate, while older animals are ideal for long, slow cooking and stand up well to strong spicing. James Whetlor, the supplier responsible for bringing goat to the attention of many chefs, recommends buyers ask for kid or nanny goat – “they behave quite differently in the pot”. Though supermarkets are yet to embrace the trend (Morrisons is the only one to stock it in selected branches), goat can increasingly be found at farmer’s markets and online, as well as in butcher’s catering to communities that have long appreciated it. The thrill of the new As Whetlor explains in his book, Goat: Cooking and Eating, because goat is central to so many cuisines around the world, it is the perfect meat for the novice cook – “cooking with goat almost compels you to broaden your cooking repertoire”. Not only can it be swapped in for lamb in familiar recipes such as the aforementioned shepherd’s pie, but Whetlor’s book includes dishes from Spain, Somalia, Mexico and Milan: different goats for different folks, and something for everyone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-commits-a-serious-of-gross-incompetence","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T14:41:28Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd commits a serious crime – of gross incompetence | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-commits-a-serious-of-gross-incompetence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/09/amber-rudd-commits-a-serious-of-gross-incompetence","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd commits a serious crime – of gross incompetence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amber Rudd could clearly picture the briefing document that had been left on her desk in February. Perhaps she ought to have taken a quick peek at it after all. But back then the home secretary hadn’t been entirely sure she had the necessary clearance to read something stamped “official – sensitive” and she had been awfully busy working on other things. So she had just left it in the pile marked “embarrassing documents to be leaked to the Guardian”. That decision clearly haunted Rudd as she took the platform at a central London community centre to launch her serious violence strategy. This was meant to be her big day out. Her chance to dominate the news agenda for the day and show that the government meant business in tackling the rise in violent crime. Instead it had all gone pear-shaped long before the start. Only the previous day she had gone on TV to assert that the 14% fall in police numbers since 2010 was entirely coincidental, but now it had emerged that the policy wonks in her own department had come to precisely the opposite conclusion. Somehow she was going to have to try and muddle her way through. Even on her better days, the home secretary can frequently sound if she has been dosed with large quantities of valium, her delivery a deadened monotone and her expression disengaged. This most definitely was not one of her good days. Rudd looked and sounded as if someone had increased her medication. If she couldn’t physically remove herself from the torment of the ordeal, she could at least remove herself from any of the feelings associated with the experience. She began by reading out a list of people who had been killed in recent weeks. Names to which she couldn’t put a face as she hadn’t made the time to meet a single victim’s family. “People are asking ‘Why? Why? Why?’,” she said. “And as home secretary, I have been searching for an answer.” Though not so hard as to actually bother to read all the evidence that her researchers had made the effort to compile for her. Rather, after highlighting some other key social issues, she chose to press on by doubling down on her insistence that there was no correlation between violent crime and police numbers. “We can’t be distracted by political tit for tat,” she mumbled. “I want to hear solutions from other parties, not just cries of ‘cuts, cuts, cuts’.” By now Rudd was so lost she was unable to make the connection that reversing cuts both to police and social care budgets might go some way to making the situation a little better. In little more than 10 minutes – or 12 seconds for each person who had been knifed to death in London this year – the home secretary had faltered to a close. A hint of panic crossed her face as she invited questions. Inevitably, the first one was on police numbers. How come she had not read the documents, and how come there was no mention of the police in her entire 140-page strategy document? It was like this, she said unconvincingly. She wasn’t at all sure that the document she hadn’t got round to reading had even been a Home Office document. It could have just been a rogue piece of disinformation slipped in to the department by Russian sleeper agents. Besides which, she wanted her strategy to be be informed by evidence not anecdote. At this half the audience did a double-take. They could have sworn the document she hadn’t read and they had was called “Violent Crime: Latest Evidence of its Drivers”. Now the home secretary went for broke. There weren’t actually more crimes taking place. All that had happened was that more crimes were being reported as previously no one had ever bothered to count the bodies. So we were all actually a lot safer than we had been because we just hadn’t known how much danger we were in. And as this had all happened through a reduction in police numbers it made sense to try to abolish the police force entirely. Rudd wisely chose not to take any more questions from the media and scuttled off as quickly as indecently possible. In the time she had been standing, the crime figures had just gone up by one. Though this had been more of a white-collar crime. A crime of gross incompetence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/09/france-police-officer-questioned-2016-terrorist-murder-jean-baptiste-salvaing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T14:07:21Z","webTitle":"French police officer questioned over 2016 terrorist murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/france-police-officer-questioned-2016-terrorist-murder-jean-baptiste-salvaing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/09/france-police-officer-questioned-2016-terrorist-murder-jean-baptiste-salvaing","fields":{"headline":"French police officer questioned over 2016 terrorist murder","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"French detectives are questioning a police officer about the double murder of a police commander and his partner by a convicted Islamist terrorist. France’s anti-terrorist brigade took three men and three women into custody on Monday in connection with the fatal knife attack on Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and his partner, Jessica Schneider, in June 2016. According to multiple reports in French media, one of the suspects being questioned is a police major who was arrested with her allegedly radicalised daughter and members of their entourage. Le Monde and L’Express magazine cited sources naming the officer as Maryline Bereaud, 48, a former delegate for Alliance, the French police officers’ main trade union. There was no suggestion that she was directly implicated in the killings. L’Express alleged that Bereaud had been at the subject of an internal police inquiry in 2016 after she was said to have allowed a young woman on the fiche S list of people considered a potential security risk to stay at her home. The investigation cleared Bereaud of any wrongdoing, but she was asked to resign from her union role. At about the same time, she was promoted to major and has since been working in an administrative retention centre for illegal immigrants in Plaisir. On Monday, police said an investigating judge had signed the order for the six people from the Yvelines department, in Paris’s western suburbs, to be taken into custody. A police source told L’Express: “We have to remain careful; these people are presumed innocent. By taking them into custody, we aim to shine some light on a still unanswered question: why was the Salvaing-Schneider couple targeted by Larossi Abballa?” Larossi Abballa, who declared his allegiance to Islamic State, stabbed Salvaing, 42, a deputy police commander, then slit the throat of Schneider, 36, a police administrator, in front of the couple’s three-year-old son. Abballa, 25, who had previously been convicted of taking part in a jihadist recruitment network, streamed a video of the attack on the family home in a quiet residential area of Magnanville, 34 miles (55km) west of Paris, on Facebook Live. Police negotiators attempted to talk to the man, who said he was a soldier for Isis and had sworn allegiance to the group. Holed up inside the house with the couple’s toddler son, with police attempting to negotiate with him, Abballa indicated that he knew the murdered police commander, the French daily Libération reported. “He came to my home, now I’ve come to his,” it reported him as saying. Abballa was killed as special forces stormed the property. The then French president François Hollande described the killings as “odious” and “undeniably a terrorist attack”. In 2013, Abballa, who was French, was sentenced to three years in prison, with six months suspended, for “criminal association in view to preparing terrorist attacks” for his role in a recruitment network of jihadists to Pakistan and Afghanistan. He was freed in September 2013 after serving most of his sentence on remand. Before then, he was known to police for crimes including theft and violence. In 2009, he was convicted of theft for stealing €157 (£137) from a hairdresser’s till. Three men are under official investigation for links to the attack, two of them for “association with terrorist criminals” and one for “complicity to murder public servants in connection with a terrorist organisation”. The third man’s DNA was found on a laptop used by Abballa inside the house to claim responsibility for the double murder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/10/tech-companies-data-online-transactions-friction","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Here’s why tech companies abuse our data: because we let them | Brett Frischmann","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/tech-companies-data-online-transactions-friction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/tech-companies-data-online-transactions-friction","fields":{"headline":"Here’s why tech companies abuse our data: because we let them","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We live in an e-commerce utopia. I can call out orders and my demands are satisfied through an automated, seamless transaction. I just have to ask Alexa, or Siri, or one of the other digital assistants developed by Silicon Valley firms, who await the commands and manage the affairs of their human bosses. We’re building a world of frictionless consumerism. To see the problems with it requires you to stop and think, which itself runs against the grain of this technology. Utopia is in the eye of the beholder. One person’s utopia is another’s dystopia. Take the obese humans in Pixar’s Wall-E: never having to move from their mobile chairs with screens they use to get their food delivered to them. The point is not that Alexa will make us obese. Rather, it’s that intelligent technology can manage much more than isolated purchase orders of books, or the devices and systems in our homes. It can manage our lives, who we are and are capable of being, for better or worse. Silicon Valley’s pursuit of frictionless transactions in our modern digital networked environment is relentless. It has given rise to surveillance capitalism – the extraction and monetisation of our data – and the creeping use of such data to “scientifically” manage most facets of our lives, in order to efficiently deliver cheap bliss and convenience. Yet there is much more to being human than the pursuit of such shallow forms of happiness. Flourishing human beings need some friction in their decision-making. Friction is resistance; it slows things down. And in our hyper-rich, fast-paced, attention-deprived world, we need opportunities to stop and think, to deliberate and even second-guess ourselves and others. This is how we develop the capacity for self-reflection; how we experiment, learn and develop our own beliefs, tastes and preferences; how we exercise self-determination. This is our free will in action. We don’t want too much friction, either: it is, after all, costly. Paralysis by analysis is a frightening prospect. It’s easier to abandon such deliberations and accept defaults, often set by others. The insights from behavioural economics tell us we choose not to choose. This convenient “choice” is only made easier in our modern data-rich economy. Consider, for example, Facebook users’ relationship with Facebook. The relationship begins when users click through to Facebook’s sign-up page, which forms a binding legal contract and authorises Facebook’s extensive data collection and sharing practices. The transaction costs are minimal. Trust is essential. Yet it is and has been unwarranted. As the recent Cambridge Analytica debacle highlights, Facebook has enabled third parties – and there are many – to use Facebook users’ data to develop sophisticated psychological profiling and personalisation algorithms, to influence their beliefs and votes. In the end, the debacle is merely a symptom of a diseased digital networked environment optimised for frictionless data flows, advertising and e-commerce. Some digital tech cheerleaders like to describe data as “the new oil”, the raw material that will drive economic growth. But data is oil-like in more than one way: it eliminates friction and has the potential to re-engineer the environments within which we live – our workplaces, schools, hospitals and homes – so we risk becoming increasingly predictable and programmable. Consider a simple example. Modern electronic contracting often depends on a seamlessly designed human-computer interface that creates a binding contract through the simple act of clicking or tapping a virtual button. Some economists celebrate this mechanism for minimising transaction costs and eliminating friction in the formation of a contract. This view is dangerously myopic. It focuses on efficiency gains and ignores subtle but powerful impacts on human autonomy. It makes it rational for a user to blindly accept terms of use. To read the terms would be a waste of time, an irrational and futile exercise. Even if you’re a glutton for punishment, how would you choose which e-contract is worth the time and effort? After all, you enter into so many of them, and they’re spreading like wildfire, from apps and smart TVs to all the devices in your workplace, car and home that are destined – according to e-commerce gurus – to be integrated into the Internet of Things. So people just default to clicking “I agree”. This is not only a predictable response, it is arguably a programmed one. Frictionless e-contracting makes a mockery of contracting, which is premised on parties genuinely exercising their autonomy when deciding to enter into a binding legal relationship. At best, it generates the illusion of consent through automatic and even programmed behaviour. Repeat interactions with this and other similar mechanisms risk habituation to mindless clicking. One response to this social dilemma is to deliberately engineer friction into modern consumer choices – to design transaction costs into technology. How should we do this? Too much would probably cause the digital economy to grind to a halt. It needs to be more a case of introducing some digital speed bumps that prompt consumers to slow down and think about the transaction they’re about to undertake in a way that preserves their autonomy. Ways of doing this include courts refusing to enforce automatic contracts and requiring evidence of actual deliberation by consumers about the most important substantive terms of a contract. Software could require a user to scroll over the most important terms and conditions before clicking the “I agree”, or it could even require consumers to answer substantive questions about the contract. Technology enthusiasts celebrate the idea of frictionless commerce in the home with no trace of second thoughts. Consumers like instant gratification and convenience. And, of course, it’s super-exciting for the marketing folks just waiting to nudge people to make purchases. But how will such seemingly perfect transactional efficiency affect how we behave in our own homes? How might it impact our willpower? Psychologists have shown that if we anticipate feelings of regret, that can moderate our behaviour in the face of temptation. But to what degree does anticipated regret depend upon the opportunity to reflect upon one’s preferences? As convenient as it may be, we should worry about technology creating a consumer world without friction.

He throws it to the first Baltic leader, played by Kate McKinnon. “Don’t say anything about her hair,” he thinks to himself. “Thank you so much for the great speech, and by the way your hair is insane,” he says. Then, questions from the press corps. “Why are you sending the national guard to the Mexican border?” asks a Baltic journalist, played by Beck Bennett. “Do you want me to come to the shoe that you live in and slap the potato out of your mouth?” Trump asks. Live from New York, it’s Saturday night. Chadwick Boseman of Black Panther is the host, but he says, “there’s only bad ideas left”, because SNL has already done so many sketches about Black Panther, such as “a sketch where Black Panther has sex with Leslie Jones – that was a Leslie Jones idea”.“Somehow, Black Panther has become a historical figure,” he continues. “I hope that maybe we’ve inspired a new generation of black actors and film-makers.” Kenan Thompson wanders on camera dressed as Panthro from the Thundercats. “I know you’re doing a sequel, hook a brother up!” “Is this another one of the bad ideas?” says Boseman. “It was Kenan Thompson’s idea,” says Thompson. Boseman cuts a little rug: Cardi B is here! Advertisement: the new Nike Pro-Chiller leggings, “for what most women do in leggings”, which is sitting on the couch. “Women can do anything I want, and I want to do … nothing,” says Kate McKinnon. “My FitBit says I’m dead.” Black Jeopardy: the categories include “Grown Ass”, “Girl, Bye” and “White People”. Boseman as T’Challa is playing against Leslie Jones and Chris Redd. Kenan Thompson is the host. “Y’all must have no mean streets in Wakanda,” Thompson exclaims when T’Challa delivers one of his reflective, thoughtful answers. “I think you haven’t spent much time in America.” Boseman is a doctor in the next sketch, at a press conference announcing the impending birth of a baby from “the world’s first pregnant man”. (Another press conference sketch? Oh, dear.) The father – played by Mikey Day – looks a bit concerned when Boseman says: “The baby must be delivered naturally through Mr Matson’s urethra.” They make a lot of vivid jokes about what will happen to his penis. Aidy B: Aidy Bryant does a pretty impressive Cardi B impression. “I’m from the Bronx!” she cries. “She’s from North Central Phoenix,” says Beck Bennett. “Cardi, your music has changed my life,” she finally says to Cardi B herself. “I’m pretty much your best friend.” Cardi looks uncomfortable. “Just get the fuck outta here!” Cardi says. Bryant beams. This is the most pure moment of the entire episode. Cardi comes on stage to sing, wearing an incredible black and white marabou feather ensemble and surrounded by four dancers in what look like pleather pants. She performs a medley of songs from Invasion of Privacy and she is terrific. Weekend Update: Colin Jost shares the news that Trump has sent the national guard to the border with Mexico, even though illegal border crossings are at an all-time low since the early 70s, but it’s in keeping with Trump’s approach: “If it ain’t broke, I’ll break it.” New tariffs include taxes on “dried nuts, something that the Trump administration is already familiar with”, says Michael Che. Alex Moffat appears as Mark Zuckerberg, here to talk about calls for his resignation with Jost: “According to our data sets, I don’t have to and you can’t make me,” he says. “Unlike my facial expression, Facebook is going to change,” Zuckerberg says, “Sure, maybe Facebook sold out on democracy to Russian troll farms, but on the other hand – Farmville!” Heidi Gardner appears as “every boxer’s girlfriend from every boxing movie ever, Angel,” here to deliver the “good news”. “You think you’re marrying a prince on a white horse,” she says of Meghan Markle, “until my horse rode in on a white stretcher.” It’s like she’s auditioning for a role in a Soderbergh movie set in New Jersey. She’d be good in it. Women queue up at Disney World to look in a magic mirror that will show them who their Disney princess counterpart is. But Leslie Jones’ princess is … R Kelly? I’m not sure he should be seen as a source of comedy any more. A team of FDNY firefighters are getting ready to extinguish a fire, but the fireman played by Boseman is going home because his shift is done. “This is for me, and I’m going to get it.” What’s he going to do? He doesn’t want to say, but, “it involves dogs, and dolls” and if it goes well, “I won’t have to work here ever again.” But when fire chief Thompson reveals that his big idea – lifesize dolls that look like you to keep your lonely dog company – has already been done, Boseman’s fireman agrees that he’ll have to pivot to making sex dolls with adult dog faces. And good luck to him. Cardi B comes out to perform her second tune of the evening, Be Careful, and then the camera pans out and shows that she’s pregnant. Iconic! I hope she comes back for the gender reveal. McKinnon, Cecily Strong, Boseman and Thompson sing a jazz song about their dinner at a restaurant to bemused management played by Mikey Day and Beck Bennett. They’re good singers and it’s quite sweet, if not exactly acute. An advertisement for The Game of Life: Daca Edition, which is actually acute: “you’ll wander aimlessly down the path to citizenship” that leads to “immigration court system expansion pack”. This is rather more acute. And finally: Chris Redd and Leslie Jones have just seen Black Panther for the third time, but then Pete Davidson and Beck Bennett ruin their vibe by doing the Wakanda salute. Boseman joins them. “I believe I can explain – the problems is that we as black people know that the salute comes from Egyptian kings … and all white people are aliens who came to earth in sleep pods.” “Why can’t we do the salute?” says Bennett. “Because we know your history,” says Jones. “You don’t give stuff back.” And that’s Saturday night! Cardi B looks so thrilled as she claps it out, and she should be. Boseman was correct when he warned at the top about some of the writing, but overall – a decent week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/10/minister-attacks-barnaby-joyce-on-qa-for-turnbull-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T21:04:52Z","webTitle":"Minister attacks Barnaby Joyce on Q&A for Turnbull comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/minister-attacks-barnaby-joyce-on-qa-for-turnbull-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/10/minister-attacks-barnaby-joyce-on-qa-for-turnbull-comments","fields":{"headline":"Minister attacks Barnaby Joyce on Q&A for Turnbull comments","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, has criticised Barnaby Joyce’s foray into the Coalition’s simmering leadership debate and insisted there is no “artificial deadline” for Malcolm Turnbull to turn his fortunes around. Speaking on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, Tudge said Turnbull could quickly fix the government’s performance, despite recording his 30th consecutive Newspoll loss. Earlier on Monday, Joyce said Turnbull would need to consider a leadership transition if his performance didn’t improve by Christmas. Tudge was critical of Joyce’s comments. “I don’t think it was a particularly useful contribution from Barnaby this afternoon,” Tudge said. “Listen, we’re not into setting artificial deadlines, and I am very confident as we get closer to the election, the Australian people will start to focus very much on the alternative.” Issues of multiculturalism, racism, integration, crime and police brutality dominated Monday night’s Q&amp;A, which was held in Dandenong, Victoria, a town with a highly diverse community. The lawyer and community activist Nyadol Nyuon gave a disturbing account of what it was like to live in the state during public reporting of alleged African youth crime. Nyuon said the reporting was at odds with crime statistics, which showed overall offending had gone down, and offending associated with the South Sudanese community had remained stable and accounted for a fraction of total criminality. Some of the language used in the media, she said, had significant consequences for African communities. “What some people don’t understand is that for the majority of African people, this has been a really tough time,” Nyuon said. “It’s been a time where we’ve questioned whether we can be safe going to the shopping centre. “We’ve been made to feel like criminals, honestly. I give advice to my young brothers who are very tall, 6ft boys, because I am afraid that the three of them walking together constitute a gang. “I tell them to behave nicely. I tell them to dress nicely. I tell them to minimise their presence in public because I am afraid that unfortunately, things can get really bad. Particularly when we’ve had, at least in Victoria, far-right groups coming out and saying they will take things into their own hands.” Debate had earlier turned to allegations of police brutality in Victoria, including excessive use of force against a man with a mental illness. Stuart Bateson, a commander with Victoria police, urged the public not to generalise about the police from the actions of a few. He said police were effective at dealing with misconduct in their ranks. But he resisted the notion of further external oversight other than that provided by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission. “We do not want to outsource our own integrity,” Bateson said. “Interestingly enough, since 2010, which is the same time period for the incidents investigated by the Age in recent weeks, 210 police have left the police force while under investigation, 26 have been sacked. So we do have an accountability framework that works. Is it perfect? No, and we need to continue developing it.” Tudge said there were “bad eggs” in every organisation, but it was particularly important to weed them out in policing. He also said he believed young people were not showing enough respect to police. He wanted to see “police empowered again to command that respect”. He was not pressed on how they could do so. Tudge was later attacked by both Labor’s Clare O’Neil and Nyuon over plans to toughen the English language tests for migrants. Nyuon said the tougher test would disproportionately affect those who were without formal educations, most likely migrant women. “I think it’s cruel, and I don’t think that’s inclusion, and I don’t think that’s integration, I actually think that’s just marginalisation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/what-could-the-us-target-in-syria-and-how-might-russia-react","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:23:36Z","webTitle":"What could the US target in Syria and how is Russia likely to react?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/what-could-the-us-target-in-syria-and-how-might-russia-react","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/what-could-the-us-target-in-syria-and-how-might-russia-react","fields":{"headline":"What could the US target in Syria and how is Russia likely to react?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What are the potential targets?

The 59 cruise missiles launched from US warships in the Mediterranean damaged runways and hangars at Shayrat but they were quickly repaired. That attack was largely symbolic. If Trump orders a second strike, it will probably be more comprehensive. The US president will be keen to assert himself as a strongman if he feels his own red line has been crossed (comparisons to Barack Obama are too much for him). France too has previously said it would be prepared to act if the use of chemical weapons is proven. Probable targets a second time round would be other Syrian airbases, and perhaps what remains of the air force itself. Whittled down and battered, the Syrian jet fleet has been heavily propped up by Russian fighters. Syria’s air defence system has been heavily damaged by Israeli attacks. What are US-western capabilities? The US maintains a naval battle group in the eastern Mediterranean, well stocked with over-the-horizon missiles. It has a large number of jet fighters in Qatar and on carriers in the Gulf, which are deployed to bomb Isis. The politics of flying over Iraq or Saudi Arabia to bomb the Syrian regime may prove tricky. Missiles are a more likely option. They’re harder to shoot down and it matters little if they are. Striking from the west poses fewer problems all around. French jets could hit Syrian targets after taking off from French airfields. If Britain joins the fray, it has a base on nearby Cyprus, a short hop from Syria. What could the UK contribute to any retaliatory effort? The RAF has a large contingent in the Middle East still engaged in action against Isis remnants and could easily divert planes and drones to Syrian military targets if required. It has Tornados posted in the region that have a reputation for flying low and precision bombing, and Typhoons armed with Paveway lV guided bombs. It also has Reaper drones equipped with Hellfire missiles. All were in action over the last few weeks in either eastern Syria or Iraq against Isis. However, the main value of the UK to any military action by the US – which is not short of firepower or expertise – would be in allowing the US to say it isn’t acting unilaterally. How are Russia and Syria likely to react to military action? Though the Syrian air defence system was heavily damaged by Israeli attacks in March, it remains a threat. Its ageing missiles still fly faster than modern jets – a 45-year-old SA-5 missile brought down an Israeli F-16, prompting the Israeli counter-strikes. However, the air defence battery offers little defence to ground-hugging missiles. And more than 100 Israeli strikes had previously been launched without a plane being hit. The bigger question is whether Russia would activate its more formidable S-400 system, which has been in place in Syria for more than a year. This poses a lethal threat to the world’s most modern jets. During previous attacks, Russia has sometimes briefly turned the system on, but it has not yet used it. A warning by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to Trump not to attack could indicate a different approach a strike is ordered this time. What does the Syrian opposition want? What remains of the opposition is on its knees. It has no defence against air attacks and has lost most of its strongholds. Only Deraa in the south and Idlib in the north remain under its control, and the latter it shares with jihadists who have a very different view of what a postwar Syria should look like. For the past six years opposition leaders have been calling for no-fly zones or airstrikes to weaken the regime. Russian and Syrian jets have battered anti-Assad forces into submission, eastern Ghouta being the latest example of that. With Russia dominating the skies across at least two-thirds of Syria, a no-fly zone is not an option. The opposition pipe dream remains the ousting of the regime. But with that not a consideration for even Assad’s foes these days, the best the opposition can hope for is a weakened Syrian air force.

The Homelessness Monitor says the explosion in the placement of homeless families in temporary homes, often many miles from where they work and go to school, is driven by a dwindling supply of social and private rented housing. A combination of high rents, the loss of social homes through right to buy and the impact of welfare reforms means councils in many parts of the country struggle to access settled housing as they try to tackle escalating homelessness, it says. Councils are left with limited resettlement options, especially in high-rent areas in the south-east, the report says, because benefit-reliant tenants are either priced out or informally barred from available stable housing. Since 2010 the numbers of homeless people in temporary accommodation has grown by 61%. Council spending on this form of housing has increased by 39% over the same period, at a cost to the taxpayer of £845m in 2016. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, said: “It’s truly terrible that, across England, councils are finding it increasingly difficult to find homeless people somewhere to live. This means ever more people are ending up trapped in B&amp;Bs and hostels, with no stability and often in cramped conditions. “Today’s report makes it clear that, unless we take action as a society, this problem will only keep getting worse”. Temporary accommodation, including hostels and B&amp;Bs, is provided by councils as interim housing for homeless households, but it is not uncommon for tenants to be stuck in it for years, sometimes in overcrowded, insanitary and unsafe conditions. The report identifies the government’s four-year freeze on local housing allowance introduced in 2016, which has left rent support for private sector tenants lagging far behind actual rents, as both a major driver of homelessness, and a barrier to rehousing homeless households. The monitor says it is striking how homelessness has shot up the political and media agenda over the past year. “It feels like it is, finally, an issue that can no longer be ignored as ‘collateral damage’ in the course of welfare reform and retrenchment,” it says. Last year an all-party committee of MPs called rising homelessness a national crisis, while the National Audit Office criticised the government for failing to get a grip on the problem. There has been increasing public concern over a growth in rough sleeping, the most visible form of homelessness. The monitor notes the government has devoted “energy and profile” to the issue, introducing the Homelessness Reduction Act this month and promising to eradicate rough sleeping by 2027. But it questions whether the political will exists to tackle structural causes of homelessness such as welfare reform, poverty, and cuts to health and social care budgets. Strikingly, the report notes that social housing – once the main source of homes for people owed a homelessness duty – is increasing hard to access, with two-thirds of local authorities reporting difficulties in this area, not least because of the long-term erosion of social housing stock under right to buy. But the report also says some housing associations are reluctant to supply homes to tenants reliant on benefits, or those with complex health needs. Some now demand that prospective tenants nominated by councils must pass a financial risk test before they are offered a tenancy, putting homeless people at a disadvantage. The private rented sector is even harder to access, with nine out of 10 councils reporting that they found it difficult to source suitable and affordable settled housing from private landlords, many of whom are reluctant to let to people on benefits because of the perceived financial risk. Caps on housing benefit have seen an exodus of low-income tenants from wealthy areas, the report says. In Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster councils in central London, numbers of housing benefit claimants have dropped by more than 40% since 2011. Although the increase in homelessness over the past few years initially showed up most strongly in London, the monitor says the problem is now growing much faster in the south and the Midlands as issues of housing affordability and supply spread. Although traditionally high levels of rough sleeping in London are stabilising, the report notes, the capital has seen an increase in hardcore entrenched rough sleepers who are resistant to support. The monitor is commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Crisis, and compiled by a team of academics primarily from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The report is based on a review of official data and research, alongside a survey of councils and interviews with housing experts. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “Every day we see the bruising toll that living in unstable temporary accommodation – especially B&amp;Bs and hostels – takes on people’s lives. We see children routinely fall behind at school and their health and happiness left in tatters, while their parents suffer with the heartbreaking belief they’ve failed their children.” A spokesman for the housing and communities department said: “Everyone deserves a safe and decent place to live, and we are providing more than £1.2bn to ensure homeless people get the support they need. “To ensure they can access permanent accommodation, we are also investing £2bn in social rent housing and allowing councils to borrow more to build homes. “In addition, the Homelessness Reduction Act came into force last week, requiring councils to help those at risk of being homeless sooner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/apr/11/aid-early-years-education-opportunity-sarah-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T09:30:01Z","webTitle":"Spend more aid on early years education for a life of opportunity | Sarah Brown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/11/aid-early-years-education-opportunity-sarah-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/apr/11/aid-early-years-education-opportunity-sarah-brown","fields":{"headline":"Spend more aid on early years education for a life of opportunity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A child’s most important steps happen before they set foot in a primary school. By their fifth birthday, their brain will already be 90% developed and the foundations for success at school and in later life will be in place. However, despite all the evidence that pre-primary education is vital, millions of children continue to miss out on the chance of a great start in life. Access to pre-primary education continues to be a lottery, dependent on where a child is born. In 2016 World Bank experts said money spent on early childhood development is “the smartest investment a country can make … If a child gets the healthcare, nutrition, affection, stimulation, and education that she needs – the gains she makes in those early years are hers for life.” But research published on Wednesday by children’s charity Theirworld reveals that development spending – aid – is missing out education for young children. Despite increases in funding for early childhood development, just 1% of aid for under-sixes goes to education, putting millions of children at a disadvantage before they even start primary school. Support for learning is the best investment a government can make, for the child, their community and country. It reduces inequality in education and leads to better outcomes for all. This is why governments around the world agreed the sustainable development goal target that by 2030 all children should have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary learning “so that they are ready for primary education”. But the reality is that the lack of equitable access to pre-primary education means more than 200 million children aged five and under in developing countries are at risk of failing to reach their full potential. This means inequality within a country starts at a very young age. For example, in Ghana, a boy from a wealthy household and urban area is more than twice as likely to attend pre-primary school than a girl from a poor household who lives in a rural area. The evidence also shows that the benefits of early years education are greatest for the most marginalised and disadvantaged, including children with disabilities, those with HIV and Aids, or those caught up in conflict or disasters. These young people are often the least prepared for primary school or most likely to miss out on the opportunity completely. It’s time to end this inequality. And when we do, the benefits will be obvious, not just to the children, but to society as a whole. Children from marginalised backgrounds who attend quality pre-primary care are more likely to enrol and stay in school, which has a positive impact on learning all the way into secondary education. In Mozambique, for example, children in rural areas who enrolled in pre-school were 24% more likely to go on to attend primary school, and to show improved understanding and behaviour, compared with children who had not. Many countries have already committed to getting every child into pre-primary but more can take this step. International aid donors can do more to support such efforts. If national governments, aid donors and World Bank and other institutions set a target of 10% of their education budgets going to pre-primary projects, we would start to see the commitments to the youngest children matched with actions. In the past 15 years, high-profile global initiatives have led to transformations in the funding going to health and nutrition for children from birth to five years, with ground-breaking research, commitments of world leaders at the G8 and top international donors becoming champions of these causes. The results are showing in the lives of children around the world. But pre-primary education has seen a conspicuous lack of support both in terms of attention and financial support. It may be because the results of this investment are not as immediately visible as those for health and nutrition. However, every country that has provided free, quality pre-primary education for all as the foundation of a child’s learning journey has seen the results, in educational attainment, future earnings and wellbeing of their family – especially for those girls and boys from the poorest backgrounds. If the international community is serious about tackling inequality then they need to start investing in pre-primary education.

The day before the man died, his daughter had gone to Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, doused herself in kerosene and tried to self-immolate in protest against the alleged unwillingness of police to pursue her allegations. Uttar Pradesh is a state of 200 million residents with poverty and malnutrition levels close to those of sub-Saharan Africa and a reputation for lawlessness. The allegations have shocked Indians and prompted renewed scrutiny of the power wielded by politicians in small-town India. The mother of the girl, who court documents say is 15, has alleged in a handwritten note to police that her daughter was raped on 9 June last year by two men one of whom was Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a member of the Uttar Pradesh parliament with the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. Her family had been unsuccessfully trying to convince police to register a case against the politician for months until last Tuesday, when the family allege Singh Sengar and his brother Atul Singh Sengar barged into their home at about 6pm with a group of men. “My two young girls were molested and when my husband protested he was tied to a tree and was beaten,” the woman alleged in her note. On Sunday, in front of the residence of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the girl tried to burn herself to death in protest against the official inaction. Police managed to stop her, but early the next morning, her father died in police custody after being admitted to hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Footage has been circulating on social media of the man in the police station lifting his shirt to show deep cuts and bruises on his face and along his legs and back. A toxicology report released to the media on Tuesday said he had died of “shock and septicaemia”. Police have suspended six officers and on Tuesday arrested Atul Singh Sengar. They have established a special investigative team to probe the rape allegations against his brother. Kuldeep Singh Sengar told the Guardian the allegations against him were “nonsense”. “I have been included in this case for no reason,” he said. “I am very innocent.” He has given a series of defiant interviews to local media including one on Monday in which he referred to the alleged victim and her family as “low class” people conspiring against him. Speaking with a scarf around her face, the girl told the India Today television station on Tuesday that police were present at her father’s alleged beating “but did nothing”. “[They] took him to the police station and put him in jail,” she said. “They did not take him to hospital – maybe if they had he could have been saved.” Her mother told the Indian Express newspaper the family were too afraid to return home and were staying in government accommodation in a nearby town. Singh Sengar, whose wife is also an elected official, has held his seat since 2002 and switched parties several times. “He is a party unto himself, which is the case with a lot of politicians in India,” said Sharat Pradhan, a journalist and political analyst in Uttar Pradesh. A report from Human Rights Watch last year found that Indian laws against sexual assault had substantially improved since a 2012 Delhi gang rape that prompted nationwide protests and became a catalyst for reform. But sexual assault victims’ efforts were frequently stymied by local officials who refused to implement the law, the report said. The chief minister of the state, Yogi Adityanath, called the incident “unfortunate” and promised a thorough investigation. “Whosoever is guilty will not be spared,” he said. The leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, said the events mocked the government’s high-profile campaign to improve the welfare of girls and young women, called “Protect your daughter”. He tweeted in Hindi: “Protect your daughter and get killed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/14/holly-willoughby-used-to-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Holly Willoughby: ‘We're so used to sexism that we're desensitised to it'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/14/holly-willoughby-used-to-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/14/holly-willoughby-used-to-sexism","fields":{"headline":"Holly Willoughby: ‘We're so used to sexism that we're desensitised to it'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Holly Willoughby thinks most people see This Morning as a total mess. “The clips that are shared online tend to be us making mistakes,” she says. “So I think everybody assumes that it’s a complete shambles, that just descends into giggles every five minutes.” On the day we meet, a few hours after she’s clocked off from presenting duties, the show had begun on a sober note, launching Project 84, a campaign dedicated to raising awareness of the staggering number of male suicides in the UK. Later, the pair interviewed three women sporting extreme breast enlargements. “That is the beauty of This Morning right there,” she nods. “There’s total variety. We had our ladies with the humungous boobs, then Project 84. Opposite ends of the spectrum.” This Morning is the kind of daytime magazine show that will cover the warning signs of coercive relationships in one segment, then the supposed resurrection of a pet cat in the next. It’s in its 30th year, and ever since its Richard and Judy days in Liverpool, it’s been a TV institution. Today, it pulls in more than a million viewers daily. Willoughby joined Phillip Schofield on the sofa in 2009 and their easy partnership has become one of the most fondly thought of on TV: Mel and Sue, Ant and Dec, Phil and Holly. Willoughby, 37, smiley, open, skirting prim but never quite landing on it, so wholesome-seeming in real life that I call her wholesome three times during our conversation, has, in turn, become a kind of nation’s sweetheart. She’s been on TV for the best part of two decades, moving from Saturday morning kids’ shows through big-hitters like Surprise Surprise and Streetmate. She’s now one of the best-paid female presenters on TV, balancing This Morning and Dancing On Ice with her duties as a team captain on the ITV2 quiz(ish) show Celebrity Juice, where she’s spent 19 series batting away filthy innuendo from host Keith Lemon (Leigh Francis). She can cause a rush on the high street if something she’s worn on screen that day strikes the right note. She’s been the subject of fake reports that she’s leaving This Morning, and fake weight-loss ads using pictures of her running to promote a “cleanse”. The tabloids are now so obsessed with her life that one story recently guessed at what her west London home probably looked like, based on glimpses of it in the background of her posts on Instagram, where she has 3.5 million followers. Her popularity seems quite new to her, though she’s careful to point out that I’m the one saying she’s popular, not her. “Funnily enough, the only thing that I used to read in articles was that I was blond and I was vapid. So it’s nice that you say that, but actually I’m the same person I was when being blond seemed to be the only thing I had going for me, to the same person I am now, to the same person I will be in five years’ time when everybody is bored and has moved on.” She is unflappable, professional, and a little brisk; she leans towards presenting, even when she’s the one answering questions. On-screen, she’s a master of the disapproving raised eyebrow, whether directed at Katie Hopkins explaining on This Morning why she won’t let her children socialise with other children if she considers their names to be “working class”, or letting Lemon repeatedly entice her to kiss Kelly Brook on Celebrity Juice. Willoughby’s voice contains a touch of gravel that starts to waver whenever there’s a particularly emotional story on This Morning. She wells up regularly, at a young carer being treated for looking after her family, say, or a man discussing the loss of his wife, or even when breaking the news about the death of her beloved pet cat. It endears her to an audience who may be feeling the same way. “You can’t not get involved,” she shrugs. “When I first started, I used to try not to let that emotion come out. But it’s impossible. If I was watching at home, I’d be crying, and you know, you look at Twitter, and everyone’s like, oh God, me too, we were all set off.” Does that empathy come easily? “I guess so. I like real-life stories better than anything else. Talking is the only thing I can do. I can’t play an instrument, I could never have been on the West End. I don’t have anything else.” Previously, Willoughby has said she’d never experienced sexism in the TV industry. “I mean,” she says now, “I’ve never experienced sexism that has caused me pain or hurt me, and I don’t know whether that’s because we are so used to it being in our everyday worlds that we’re desensitised to it.” She mentions an Instagram post she put up following the Brit awards in February, a collection of paparazzi attempts to “upskirt” female celebrities who had been out celebrating together. There were four shots – of her, Rita Ora, Louise Redknapp and Abbey Clancy – taken from a low position, in an attempt to snap underneath their dresses. “At the beginning of the night we held white roses and walked down a red carpet full of the hope and pride that comes with the #timesup campaign... at the end of the night, cameras were held low to get a photo up our skirts... times apparently up on #timesup,” she wrote. It has more than 260,000 likes. “It happens every time you go out for a night, and has done since day dot,” she says. When she’s out with famous friends and they leave a party, she tells them, “‘Right, ready to run the gauntlet?’ And out you go. Actually, what a stupid phrase! The scariest thing about it is that you’re saying phrases like, ‘Ready to run the gauntlet?’ as if it’s the most normal thing in the world. That’s the worst bit.” The reason she decided to finally object, she says, is because of the Time’s Up sentiments that had defined the rest of the evening. “It just suddenly wasn’t OK. And it never was OK. And it shouldn’t be OK.” Still, it was a break from her usually cheerful, fashion-led Instagram fodder, and she was nervous about posting it. “That was a scary one for me. It took a lot, because I knew what the response was going to be.” As with most things she does, it launched countless news stories. “But that’s great. That was the whole reason for doing it.” Some, however, had a different reaction. “The thing that terrified me was the comments. ‘Well you shouldn’t be wearing such a short skirt, then.’ My Instagram was full of it. Men and women. That’s when you go, we really do have a long way to go.” In an otherwise relentlessly upbeat conversation, she seems genuinely disappointed. In August last year, there were reports that Willoughby had been paid £200k less than Schofield for This Morning, news that emerged only after ITV announced that it had adjusted her salary to match his. She is reluctant to talk about the details, not because she’s being cagey, she insists, flustered, but because they have an ITV package that encompasses different presenting gigs, and it’s difficult to directly compare. “I feel like I’m speculating and it’s such a sensitive area and I don’t want to get it wrong. I feel like I might be putting my foot in it.” She shouts into the next room to her PR to clarify what the situation is, and he confirms that they’re on equal pay now. “Right, OK, fine. The first person that would be outraged is Phil, actually!” She relaxes the instant she talks about Schofield, and her affection for him is obvious. “He’d be devastated. He would be the first person to make a stand. He protects me in every other area of my life, so there’s no way he wouldn’t do that.” She and Schofield have never had an argument, she claims. “And now we’ve got to the stage where we’ll say the same things at the same time on screen, in the same way. It’s really weird. The only other person I’ve got that with is my sister.” The pair found themselves on the receiving end of rare criticism when they seemed to pass over Ant McPartlin’s arrest for drink-driving on that day’s edition of This Morning. Willoughby has known him since their Saturday morning TV days. Did they deliberately avoid discussing it? “Not at all. Everybody knows that Ant is a very good friend of mine and I’ve known him for a very long time,” she sighs. “To be honest, on that first day, nobody knew what had happened, and you know, it’s an ongoing police case right now. It’s not something anybody should be talking about. Out of respect for him, I love him to bits, it’s not something that I find very easy to talk about. Because it’s a friend. His is not my story to tell.” She lowers her voice. “He’s just got to look after himself, that’s all.” There’s an appeal common to both McPartlin and Willoughby; they’ve been on screen for so long, in so many different incarnations, that the public feels an ownership of them or, at the least, a close familiarity. Willoughby’s everywoman appeal has made her the face of a number of ad campaigns – for fashion websites, for hair dye, for a soft drink – and she is about to set up her own e-commerce site, Truly. It will launch in a few months, and is both a lifestyle brand and a blog, and the idea came from a series of baby books that she wrote with her sister. Is it a British Goop? She laughs. “So the only things I’ve heard on This Morning about Goop, we had some sort of vagina steamer thing that you put on the toilet with herbs and stuff. As yet, on our list, there’s no vagina steamer.” That’s disappointing. “I’m so sorry. I’ll bring it up in the next meeting.” Truly will also oversee a charitable foundation, she says, and an online community where people can talk and share. “For me, being a woman, it’s nice to have a space where you can have that honest, open conversation that isn’t too militant or frightening or one-way. It’s going to be very open and welcoming.” Open and welcoming is Brand Willoughby in a nutshell. Does she think she’s wholesome? “I don’t know! Christ! And if I am, I don’t know how! If wholesome is having a family that you cherish and love, and liking to go home, and being content – yes. If wholesome is rocking up to This Morning after the NTAs having been out all night? I don’t know what your level of wholesome is.” She’s referring to the time that she and Schofield received a National Television Award in 2016, and presented the show, the next day, a little worse for wear, having not been home. The clip was watched more than 3.5m times on YouTube. (This year, having won another, they presented some of the morning-after show from a bed, and ran a viewers’ poll to find out who was handling their hangover best.) To see the co-hosts bleary-eyed and even more giggly than usual, acting out a near walk-of-shame on morning TV, only added to the show’s reputation for (polite) chaos. So there’s no need for a certain degree of decorum to present daytime TV? “I don’t think so. I don’t think I’m any different on Celebrity Juice or daytime telly. It’s what’s going on around me that’s different. I don’t suddenly become all outrageous and rude on Celebrity Juice.” Willoughby’s husband, Dan Baldwin, is an executive producer on the show, a raucous blend of Never Mind The Buzzcocks, Shooting Stars and the untamed imagination of a randy teenage boy. Willoughby is one team captain, Fearne Cotton is the other. She recalls a task where she had to suck a sock that had a chicken pie in it, to guess the contents, and that is by far one of the cleanest challenges the show has seen. On one birthday, Lemon gave her a card inscribed, “Even though you are up the duff and getting old, I would still smash your back doors in…” (“The answer’s no,” she replied, raising a stern eyebrow.) Its humour is defiantly puerile, and sneakily contagious. In the early days, her nickname on it was Willoughbooby, which has morphed into Willoughboozey, after she appeared to be slightly drunk on set on one episode. “That was Halloween, yeah? I think I was a little bit tipsy. Shall we go back to the wholesome question?” she laughs. She is, she says, as if preempting an attack, very good at defending Celebrity Juice now. “It’s really good fun, and I’m with Fearne and Leigh and Gino [D’Acampo], and we have a really good time.” The humour can be quite to the bone… “Again, I get asked this quite a lot.” She has a way of briskly jumping on to a question, to get to the end more efficiently. “Yes, he’s cheeky, and yes, he’s naughty, but he’s actually the butt of our jokes. It’s us that are the empowered two.” So you don’t think… “I know what you’re going to ask. Sexist. It’s a good opportunity to say – no.” She shrugs. “Because I think we are so in control and so in charge of that situation. It’s light, it’s cheeky, it’s not offensive. Occasionally [Francis] can say the odd thing, and even he goes, oooh. But it’s quite a unique show, actually. There’s not many shows that have that sense of freedom.” *** Willoughby grew up in Brighton and was a teen model before ending up on the small screen. Like Erin O’Connor, Vernon Kay and Cat Deeley before her, she was spotted in the crowd of the Clothes Show Live, and signed up at 16 by the agency Storm. She became the kind of “commercial girl” who did shoots for mags like Just Seventeen and Mizz. “I loved Just Seventeen. Imagine being on the cover at that age! It was the best feeling in the world.” Her experience of modelling was positive, largely, she thinks, because she wasn’t a fashion model doing catwalk shows. Her world was “age-appropriate, almost. It wasn’t the environment to see that darker, seedier side”. She was hired as the fashion expert for a series of S Club TV, a Sunday morning show that aired in 2000, when she turned up expecting it to be a casting for a modelling shoot. She spent the next couple of years behind the scenes, working as a receptionist for a production company, then as a runner for a late-night TV auction channel. What did they sell? “Oh, lapis lazuli globes. Diamonique rings,” she hams. In the end, it was while working as a barmaid on Kings Road in Chelsea (“I could do a really good shamrock on the top of my pints”) that led to her big break when one of the regulars asked her what she wanted to do with her life. She mentioned her S Club days; it turned out that he worked in TV, for Endemol, and asked to see her showreel. Eventually, that led to a stint on CBBC. At 23, she co-hosted Ministry Of Mayhem, ITV’s Saturday morning children’s show. She still has a sheen of that TV style. “There was no other training ground like kids’ telly for becoming a TV presenter,” she explains. “Ant and Dec, me, Phil, Reggie [Yates] and Fearne [Cotton, one of Willoughby’s closest friends] – we all came from kids’ telly.” It means, she thinks, that they can all deal with the hectic pace of live television, and that they can pick up the slack if it all starts to fall apart. “I say this very much as the one who lets it descend into utter chaos,” she laughs, “but I like it to be organised chaos. Having a laugh and giggling is OK. Technically messing up, or just dropping the ball, is not.” That efficiency is part of why live TV appeals to her. “It suits my get-in, get-out mentality. I’m very much, get to work, do my job, go home. One of my worst phrases in the world is, ‘Just one more for luck.’ I can’t bear it. If it’s done and everyone’s happy, then I just want to go home.” One of the producers on Ministry Of Mayhem was Baldwin, whom Willoughby married in 2007, when she was 26. They have three kids: Harry, nine, Belle, seven, and Chester, three. She refers to Baldwin as “my Dan” and says they were friends for a couple of years before they got together. “We had this ridiculous friendship,” she recalls. “It went from not knowing each other, to being the best of friends. I adored him. Didn’t fancy him, he didn’t fancy me. There was one moment when we cheersed, and I just looked at him, and went” – she inhales dramatically – “Oh my God, I fancy him. And that was it.” Did he really not fancy you? “He says he didn’t,” she says, then pauses. And you believe him? “Well, he either played an absolute blinder, or… maybe he did, who knows,” she laughs. “He had a very good way of hiding it, if he did.” When they had Harry, it made her choosy about the jobs she took. “They constantly call me Little Miss No at work. If I’m going to be away from the kids and doing something, it has to be for a good reason.” Like Davina McCall before her, who occupies a similar place in the public’s affections, Willoughby is well aware that attaching her face to an ad campaign can make people want to buy something. Most days, she posts her outfit to Instagram, with the hashtag #hwstyle, which started, she claims, because it was an efficient way of fielding inquiries. “Because every day, our online team would come running in and go, ‘Sorry, I know you’re in the middle of the show, but where’s your top from?’” Posting it saves time, but like Nigella using certain kitchenware or fancy spices, it can also shift units. It’s put her into a position of unexpected power when it comes to the high street. Why do people like what she wears so much? “Sometimes when you see clothes online you don’t quite believe those clothes: you think they’ve been airbrushed. On This Morning, it’s a really good opportunity to see how clothes work in real life. You believe that if you bought that skirt, you’d look like that, too.” A new stylist, Angie Smith, has recently helped her hone a sharper, cooler style. “Some things she has to push me on, because I’m a bit safe,” she says. I ask if she ever turns up at the studio in… “This?” she jumps in, gesturing with faux modesty. What she’s wearing – a blue jumper, black skinny jeans, squeaky clean white trainers – is immaculate; I was going to say a full tracksuit. “No. It has been known though!” she smiles. “I get the bike to and from the studio, so I have to make sure I can hop on the back.” The motorbike is waiting outside for her now. She’s got to go. She says goodbye, crisply, and she’s off. For a talker, she’s not one for much small talk. As she said, she likes to get in, do the job, and go home. • Commenting on this piece?

The Dominican American author, who has explored the subject of sexual abuse in his fiction, has not previously spoken publicly about his own experience. But in an essay titled The Silence, Díaz addresses a reader who approached him years earlier at a book signing and asked if he had been sexually abused himself. At the time, Díaz did not reply. “I’m still afraid – my fear like continents and the ocean between – but I’m going to speak anyway,” he writes. “Yes, it happened to me. I was raped when I was eight years old. By a grownup that I truly trusted. After he raped me, he told me I had to return the next day or I would be ‘in trouble’. And because I was terrified, and confused, I went back the next day and was raped again. I never told anyone what happened, but today I’m telling you. And anyone else who cares to listen.” Díaz, who won the Pulitzer for his debut novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, writes of how “that shit cracked the planet of me in half, threw me completely out of orbit, into the lightless regions of space where life is not possible. I can say, truly, que casi me destruyó.” He didn’t tell his family, and found his childhood scarred by fits of depression and rage. “While other kids were exploring crushes and first love, I was dealing with intrusive memories of my rape that were so excruciating I had to slam my head against a wall,” he writes. At college he reinvented himself, but he continued to keep the sexual abuse a secret – although he touched on it in his fiction: “Somehow I was still writing – about a young Dominican man who, unlike me, had been only a little molested. Someone who couldn’t stay in any relationship because he was too much of a player. Crafting my perfect cover story, in effect.” Díaz writes of reaching “rock bottom” after a woman he loved discovered he had been cheating on her repeatedly, so he went to therapy. He has since told his friends, “even the toughest of my boys”, about the abuse; previously, he had been “afraid that the rape had ‘ruined’ me; afraid that I would be ‘found out’; afraid afraid afraid. ‘Real’ Dominican men, after all, aren’t raped.” “I had to lose almost everything and then some. And then some. Before I finally put out my hand,” he writes, to his unnamed reader. “I think of all the years and all the life I lost to the hiding and to the fear and to the pain. The mask got more of me than I ever did. But mostly I think about what it felt like to say the words – to my therapist, all those years ago; to tell my partner, my friends, that I’d been raped. And what it feels like to say the words here, where the whole world – and maybe you – might hear.” • In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Henry Vincent, 37, died following a struggle when confronted by Richard Osborn-Brooks, the owner of the house he had entered. Last Friday Osborn-Brooks was told he would face no further action after he was arrested on suspicion of murdering Vincent. On Tuesday an inquest into the death was opened and adjourned at a coroner’s court in Borough, south London. Outside the home of Osborn-Brooks in Hither Green, two women returned to the street on Tuesday evening to replace flowers and cards pinned to a wall that said Vincent was “a good man” and insisted that the flowers were being put up to remember him as a father, brother and friend. “You don’t know the real version of the truth – nobody does,” said one of the women, who identified herself only as ‘Elvina’. “Flowers get up and they stay up whenever a bike rider dies. This is no different.” Trampled flowers and soiled cards had littered the street on Tuesday morning after they were torn down in the middle of a night. They were replaced shortly before midday but less than an hour later, a man who described himself as a local arrived and cut the flowers and cards back down. The two women arrived back at the scene at around 5pm and spent close to an hour putting the tributes back up, surrounded by camera men and reporters as several police officers stood nearby. “Do you think that he would be remembered in this way if he was such a bad man, or that people would pay for all these flowers if he was?” Elvina asked those gathered. The women denied that the tributes were meant to intimidate anyone, including Osborn-Brooks. He remains under police guard with his wife, Maureen, amid reports that friends of Vincent have threatened to take violent revenge. “What does he have to fear? Who does he have to fear?” said the women, who identified themselves as gypsies and said that they were being treated differently because of their backgrounds. “Why is it that everyone has a chance to have their say, but we don’t get our chance.” The re-erected tributes elicited an angry response from some local residents. A women and her teenage daughter stopped to read the cards after Vincent’s relatives departed the scene in a car. “I think it’s disgusting that old people have to live in fear. There are too many burglaries and people have a right to defend themselves,” said the daughter. “They shouldn’t come to put this stuff up. It’s an insult.” Nikita Hill, who lives nearby, told the Press Association: “I don’t think they should have put it outside his home. Maybe they could have done it further away. But he’s got loved ones and family too so I understand why they did it.” Officers have spoken with Vincent’s family about their reasons for not taking any further action against Osborn-Brooks, according to the Metropolitan police. DCI Simon Harding, of the Met’s homicide and major crime command said: “This is a tragic case for all of those involved. As expected with any incident where someone has lost their life, my officers carried out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the death. “We have approached the CPS for early investigative advice, as required under the guidance. We have received and considered that advice, and, at present – on the evidence available – we will not seek a charging decision. Therefore, no further action will be taken against the man. “Whilst there might be various forms of debate about which processes should be used in cases such as this, it was important that the resident was interviewed by officers under the appropriate legislation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, not only for the integrity of our investigation but also so that his personal and legal rights were protected.” At the inquest, two female relatives, accompanied by a police family liaison officer, were present during the brief inquest hearing in which the police authorised the release of Vincent’s body to his family. The 37-year-old, who died at University Hospital Lewisham, was single and not in work, the hearing was told. Harding said: “The facts are that on Wednesday 4 April, two males including Henry Vincent entered a residential address at about 12.40am whilst committing a burglary. “During this burglary the male resident stabbed Henry Vincent, that ultimately led to his death.” The hearing was told that Vincent was identified at the hospital mortuary by his sister. His place and date of birth were given as Sidcup and 15 April 1980. Sarah Ormond-Walsh, an assistant coroner for south London, briefly explained the role of an inquest, and told the relatives: “I know you are having a dreadful time.” The Met have released an image of the man alleged to have been Vincent’s accomplice in the aggravated burglary, which took place on a quiet residential street in the borough of Lewisham. The man was named as Billy Jeeves, who the force said had links to Orpington and Swanley in Kent, and Cambridge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/10/peter-rabbit-digs-in-for-a-fourth-week-on-top-at-uk-box-office","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:57:37Z","webTitle":"Peter Rabbit digs in for a fourth week on top at UK box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/10/peter-rabbit-digs-in-for-a-fourth-week-on-top-at-uk-box-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/10/peter-rabbit-digs-in-for-a-fourth-week-on-top-at-uk-box-office","fields":{"headline":"Peter Rabbit digs in for a fourth week on top at UK box office","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The winner: Peter Rabbit The Easter school holiday is the gift that keeps on giving – at least to Sony, which once again ruled the UK box office with its live-action/animated hybrid Peter Rabbit. The family friendly Beatrix Potter adaptation scored a fourth consecutive weekend at the top spot, with takings of £3.15m taking the tally up to £32.2m. In the past seven days, Peter Rabbit added a mighty £10.6m. Most kids are still on holiday this week, so look for the box-office bonanza to continue. Few films achieve four weeks at the chart summit. Last year, it was a feat that eluded box office giants Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast, and was achieved in 2017 only by Dunkirk. This year, Peter Rabbit follows four straight weeks at the top spot for Black Panther – which with £48.4m has just overtaken Avengers: Age of Ultron to become the second biggest Marvel film ever at the UK box office, after Avengers Assemble (£51.9m). The buzzy newcomer: A Quiet Place The highest new entry in the chart – in second place – is A Quiet Place, the high-concept horror directed by John Krasinski. The Paramount-backed film debuted in the UK with £1.99m over the weekend period, and £2.70m including previews. The obvious comparison for A Quiet Place is Jordan Peele’s Get Out: the surprise breakout genre hit from March last year. Get Out debuted with £2.16m in the UK, on its way to a total of £10.3m. A Quiet Place was also released in North America at the weekend, opening with a mighty $50.2m. Worldwide, it’s at $71.2m. Given that its production budget was just $17m, the film is on track to become a profitable hit, even allowing for significant marketing costs. Breaking the mould: Love, Simon Films featuring LGBT characters have been hits in the past, notably Brokeback Mountain, which reached $178m worldwide. In the case of teen movies, films with prominent LGBT storylines have tended to exist firmly in the indie sphere – Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader, for example. Love, Simon is something different. A bright, glossy and unapologetically mainstream US teen movie, Love, Simon has opened in the UK with a robust £1.01m for the weekend period, and £1.18m including previews. Not only is that a record for a gay-themed teen comedy – it’s also the best result for any US teen comedy for quite a while. The genre has been in the doldrums, with teen-targeted hits instead coming from YA adaptations (such as The Maze Runner and The Fault in Our Stars), and before that from dance movies such as the Step Up franchise. The last notable US teen comedy hit was The Hannah Montana Movie, back in 2009 (£8.5m). From the UK, of course, we’ve had The Inbetweeners Movie (£45.0m) and its sequel. The flop Eli Roth’s Death Wish remake, starring Bruce Willis, has bellyflopped at the UK box office, landing in 14th place with £157,000 from 209 cinemas. Death Wish debuted in the US in early March with $13m – by accepted rule of thumb, an equivalent result in the UK market would be around £1.3m, so the achieved outcome is way below that number. Also performing poorly is US indie drama-thriller Thoroughbreds, starring Olivia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy as two disaffected teens plotting a murder. The film struggled to define its audience, and has opened with a lacklustre £51,000 from 128 sites. The market What a difference a week makes. Last week we reported that box office for the year to date (to 29 March) was down 9% on the equivalent period in 2017. A very robust performance during the Easter school holiday has narrowed that gap, and the market is now down just 4% on 2017 for the year to 5 April. For the weekend just ended, box office is down 9% on the equivalent session from 2017, when The Boss Baby was the top new title. For the coming frame, cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on Rampage – star Dwayne Johnson is just coming off huge hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (£38.2m). Also in the mix is Truth or Dare from genre hit-maker Jason Blum. Top 10 UK films 6-8 April 1. Peter Rabbit, £3,152,269 from 671 sites. Total: £32,223,317 (four weeks) 2.

The three-time gold-winning Paralympian could only repeat his silver medal of Glasgow in the men’s T54 1500m final, with a time of 3:11:92. Fearnley looked set to overtake surprise winner Alexandre Dupont in the final sprint, but the Canadian held out to upset the local hero, 3:11.75. “It was bloody tough,” said Fearnley on the race. “I was up there and gave it all, [gave] everything in the last 80m.” Despite his disappointment, Fearnley praised the integrated nature of the Gold Coast Games, which has given para athletes unprecedented exposure by weaving para and able-bodied events together in scheduling. “Let’s make sure we do something positive with what is happening here because it’s working,” he said. “Inclusion is working, we’re nailing this, the crowd is loving it. “Let’s use this as a pivotal moment. Let’s have the same conversation at home about what is happening here; about our education facilities, about our transport, about employment. Let’s talk about it further for the guys [who] don’t have the stage and don’t have the opportunities – let’s get them into the workplace.” In the women’s T54 1500m event, Madeline de Rozario made up for a devastating end to her Glasgow campaign with gold (3:34.06) from teammate Angela Ballard (3:36.85) and Canada’s Diane Roy (3:36.97). de Rozario, favoured for a medal in 2014, was unable to compete due to developing deep vein thrombosis on the flight to Glasgow, and was contained in the UK for several months before being able to return home. And, while Sally Pearson may have been ruled out of the Commonwealth Games, an Australian still medalled in the 110m hurdles, Nicholas Hough winning bronze for Australia in the men’s event. Hough, who lists Pearson as his hero on his athlete’s profile, lit up the Carrara track to better his fourth at Glasgow and set a personal best time of 13.38. He was beaten by the Jamaican pair of Ronald Levy and Hansle Parchment but was visibly pleased to medal, having come into the final ranked sixth. In the hammer throw, 20-year-old Australian Alexandra Hulley was thrilled to take out silver with a distance of 68.2 metres, holding off teammate Lara Nielsen who managed bronze with 65.03m. Gold went to New Zealand’s Julia Ratcliffe, who bettered her silver at Glasgow with a distance of 69.94m. Two final events, the javelin and 1500m final, also rounded out the decathlon program, with Australian Cedric Dubler taking overall bronze with 7983 points (thanks to seventh in the javelin and fourth in the 1500m). Linden Hall looked set to round out Sunday’s athletics program with another medal for Australia, but was overtaken just before the line by Wales’ Melissa Courtney and finished fourth. Caster Semenya, in her first Commonwealth Games, was the star of the race, setting a new Games record of 4:00.71 for gold. It was over at the Aquatic Centre where Australia’s athletes truly shone, winning eight of nine available gold medals. In the men’s 200m individual medley, Mitch Larkin stunned onlookers to win his fourth individual gold of the Games with a Games record time of 1:57:67. Larkin had already collected all of the 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke gold medals of the Games, and finished off an extraordinary night with gold in the men’s 4x100 medley relay final. In the final event of the night, the Australian relay team set a new Games record with 3:31.04 in a photo finish with defending champions England (3:31.13). Kyle Chalmers hauled in his English counterpart Ben Proud, who had won the 50m freestyle earlier in the night, to hit the wall in what looked a dead heat. Chalmers’ touch would prove superior, rounding out a special night for the home nation. Another contender for success story of the Games, Ariarne Titmus continued her brilliant Commonwealth debut, setting a Games record of 4:00.93 in the women’s 400m freestyle, edging out Holly Hibbott and Eleanor Faulkner of England. It was the 17-year-old’s third gold on the Gold Coast, after she also won the women’s 800m freestyle on Sunday and was part of Australia’s winning 4x200m freestyle relay team on Saturday. Despite what seemed like a fearless performance, Titmus admitted to nerves like she’d never felt before. “I was the most nervous I have been the whole meet. I felt like I was going to be sick... I didn’t want to fail on the expectations that I had set myself.” Titmus added that being Commonwealth champion hadn’t quite registered yet. “I haven’t really let that sink in. I am sad I have to go back to school after this. I am still a normal person,” said the teenager. Emily Seebohm, meanwhile, avenged her silver in Saturday’s 100m backstroke with gold in the 50m. This time she edged out Kylie Masse – who beat her narrowly in the 100m final – with a time of 27.78. Masse had set a new Games record in the 100m, defeating Seebohm by only 0.03 seconds. Seebohm then fronted up again for the women’s 4x100m medley relay, joining fellow gold-medal winners Bronte Campbell and Emma McKeon, as well as Georgia Bohl, the foursome setting a new Games record of 3:54.36 to take gold for Australia from Canada and Wales. Campbell, something of a surprise inclusion after upstaging her sister the night before in the 100m freestyle, powered home in the final leg to surpass Canada’s Taylor Ruck. Lakeisha Patterson then added her second individual gold for Australia in the women’s S8 50m freestyle, continuing her excellent debut Games. Patterson blew her competitors out of the water with a time of 30.14, nearly two seconds ahead of Morgan Bird (32.03) and Abigail Tripp (32.49), both of Canada. A wonderful showing by the host nation’s para athletes then continued in the men’s S9 100m backstroke final, Brenden Hall, Timothy Hodge and Logan Powell rounding out an all-Australian podium. Hodge led for most of the race, but swam into the lane rope on the second-last lap, allowing Hall to level and eventually overtake him. As Fearnley did at Carrara Stadium, all three took the opportunity post-race to reflect on competing for the first time in a fully-integrated program (with non-para athletes). “It’s a dream come true,” the 17-year-old Hodge said. “Every time I go to school, everyone’s saying he’s a Paralympian. But to be able to say that I’ve raced next to able-bodied athletes, some of the best in the world, is definitely a real privilege.” Mack Horton had been favourite to take out gold for Australia in the 1500m swim, qualifying fastest and looking to go one better on his silver in Glasgow. He, however, was upstaged in one of the surprises of the night, with Jack McLoughlin taking gold in 14:47.09, ahead of Wales’ Daniel Jervis (14:48.67), leaving his more-fancied team-mate to take bronze with 14:51.05. Cameron McEvoy could not better his silver in the men’s 50m freestyle in Glasgow, however, finishing third behind England’s Proud and South Africa’s Bradley Tandy. Nonethless, McEvoy said he was happy with bronze considering he had spent the week unwell.

The last time I saw her, she was being taken to a different care unit after giving birth to her first child at the age of 14. I later learned that she was made to give up the baby for adoption. Now 29, Lucy has had four more children, who still live with her. When we meet, she is accompanied by her four-year-old son. Despite mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, she is coping well and is a good parent: all her children are in full-time education and well looked after. “I want to make sure that my kids have a better life than we had,” she says. When I decided to track down the people with whom I was in care, I did so with reservations. The very fact that I entered the care system is a painful subject for my immediate family, especially my mother, who says she won’t read this story. Whatever I write, she believes, people will say it was because of her failure as a parent that I ended up in care at the age of 12. But for me it has always been more complicated. There are many reasons families break down and children go into care. It is not always down to abuse or neglect. I want to stress that I don’t blame my parents. I was a troubled child; the psychiatrist who diagnosed me with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when I was six said I was one of the most severe cases he had ever seen. I had dramatic mood swings and a violent temper. I was also extremely hyperactive and didn’t really sleep. My parents, who had problems of their own, were not equipped to cope. I wanted to tell this story because life is difficult and distressing for many people who have been in care. An estimated 74,000 of us are homeless, while young people who have been in care are six times more likely to enter the criminal justice system than those who have not. I was sure that a lot of the children I grew up with during my five years in the system would have had similar experiences. I also hoped to hear some success stories. But I have since learned that almost everyone has been in trouble with the police, had stints in prison or struggled with drugs and alcohol. Almost all the girls had had children before or around their 18th birthday. The first placement I was sent to was a foster home in Longsight, central Manchester, when I was 12. Before this, I had spent two years in a residential unit attached to Rossendale school, a special school near Rochdale for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, but I returned home at weekends and holidays. The fact that I was in care did not register at first. The place in Longsight was a normal family home and the first few weeks were fascinating. The city was very different from Oldham, where I had lived before, and I was captivated by its faster pace. The family I lived with was also interesting. The woman who fostered me was in her early 50s and white; her husband was a slightly older man from Jamaica. I was introduced to 70s reggae and taught to make West Indian cuisine, including fried dumplings, rice and peas. But the placement fell apart when I got in trouble with some other kids from the estate. I would also regularly abscond to my grandmother’s and ignore the curfew I had been given. From Longsight I moved to another foster placement, followed by two children’s homes. It was in the homes that the separation from my family hit me. I saw less of my younger brother and infant sister, who was born when I was in Longsight. The children’s home in Chadderton was a huge red-brick building; the bars on the windows and the almost sterile interior made it clear that this was an institution. “This place will either make you or break you,” said the staff member who took me to my room. He then supervised me while I unpacked, checking that I had not brought in drugs or weapons. That night, I heard the other children returning home late and shouting abuse at the staff for not letting them into the kitchen; after they made their way upstairs, they carried on yelling into the early hours. For the first few nights, I cried into my pillow. I even moved my bed against the door, scared someone might try to break in. But, as the months rolled by, I got used to the home and started to bond with the others. I got on with Andrew, whom I first met while he was stoned in the kitchen. He was laughing hysterically into a bowl of Coco Pops. There was John, with whom I used to play tig around Chadderton, including in the local B&amp;Q, from which we were banned on more than one occasion. Graham loved trouble and enjoyed nothing more than roping me into his schemes. Georgina, two years older than most of us, was generally aloof – unless you got on her bad side. Finding them a decade and a half later has been very difficult. Like me, many of the people I met during my years in care moved between placements, sometimes beyond Greater Manchester. In some cases, the last time I saw them, they were getting into a police van. During my time in Longsight, the family fostered another boy. The last I heard, he was being treated for an overdose. When I left care aged 17, Facebook did not exist and I could not afford a mobile phone. Over the years, I bumped into my fellow care-leavers occasionally in the town centre or on public transport, but we did not keep in touch. Many have experienced tragedies that they don’t want to be reminded of. Others have changed their names, often after getting in trouble with local gangs or drug dealers. Most of us have struggled to settle down: at 30, I have had 23 addresses. One person who proved impossible to locate was Luis. The two of us were inseparable when we were younger; neither had a school or college to go to, since I had been expelled from Rossendale and he had passed school-leaving age. So, we would wander around town, begging for cigarettes and getting into trouble with shopkeepers and security guards. I suspect one of the reasons he was impossible to track down is that I did not know his real name. Friends of his who we bumped into back then would call him Leo, Manuel or sometimes just Portugal. Portuguese by birth, he seemed older than the rest of us and once confessed that he was older than we thought. Looking back, picturing his bulging biceps and facial hair, I think Luis might even have been in his early 20s. He may have been lying about his age so he could stay in care; he had nowhere else to go and care-leavers were expected to fend for themselves after turning 18. The story of why Luis came to the UK and ended up in care was vague and some of his stories would have made Walter Mitty roll his eyes. One particularly absurd yarn was that he was a sniper, on the run from the Portuguese police after shooting one of them in a notorious Algarve slum. When our paths crossed over the years, Luis would usually inform me of his latest scam. He told me, for instance, that he had invested in a candle company, hollowing out the candles to smuggle drugs into the country; this was making him thousands, he said. Then he would ask to borrow a tenner. I later found out that he was indeed selling drugs, but for a local dealer, receiving only a few bags of skunk for his troubles. A mutual friend recently told me Luis was in prison for drug dealing; without knowing his real name, that has proved impossible to verify. Kieran, a boy I lived with briefly in Chadderton, was equally elusive. After he left that home, we met again at Hawthorn Crescent in Oldham, a “semi-independent unit” designed to prepare older children for life after care. He was known to staff there as Tom. He only stayed at the unit briefly; he would run away to the notoriously rough Limeside estate, known to locals as “Crimeside”. I last saw Kieran/Tom when he appeared on the TV programme Amir Khan’s Angry Young Men in 2007, in which Khan worked with troubled youths to place them on the straight and narrow through “boxing and faith”. Now going by another name, he talked about his violent upbringing and a recent stint in prison for stealing a car. Of the roughly 25 people I grew up with in care, I managed to track down only a handful. Luke said he would talk to me, but he wanted to be paid “for the trouble”. Luke was always trying to make cash out of someone. He was reclusive when we were growing up and seldom ventured out of the unit, but because of a learning difficulty he had a bus pass that allowed him to travel for free. He would hire this out to other kids at half the price of a weekly pass. I told Luke that I could not pay him for an interview, but that I would happily buy him lunch; he did not get back to me. I gathered from our brief chats online and his Facebook posts that he had just left a drug treatment centre. Lucy was the only one who agreed to talk on the record. When we meet, it is slightly awkward at first, but then we start reminiscing about the trouble we got into and it is as though no time has passed at all. “Some of the staff were horrible, but we were little bastards, to be fair,” she says, giggling. She recalls the time when we removed all our furniture from our bedrooms and threw it down the stairs. Then there was the evening when Lucy’s boyfriend visited the unit and passed around a gun he had brought with him. The gun’s barrel was soldered shut, but it looked dangerous enough that when we waved it around the staff dialled 999. By the time the armed police arrived, Lucy’s boyfriend and another boy at the unit had viciously assaulted the two male members of staff on duty. We did not hang around; Lucy went missing for three weeks. She is reluctant to go into detail about her life after care: “I don’t like to think about it that much. It just makes me depressed.” But we stay in touch and over the next year she gradually opens up. Did she receive enough support when she was in care, I ask her. Was enough done to protect her? The boyfriend with the gun was in his 20s and Lucy was only 14. She feels the staff at Chadderton should have done more to stop her seeing him. She tells me that her boyfriend would take her out in his car and, although she was never coerced into having sex with other men, there were a lot of other young girls who were seeing men far older than them. “We used to go chilling in this guy’s shop and they had a bed in the back of the shop where they used to chill with loads of young girls.” Were they being trafficked? She does not know. “It was normal for us. We thought it was fun; we thought they were our friends. They’d take us out in their cars and buy us drinks …” Were the staff at our home aware of any of this? “They saw me get into taxis and other men’s cars, but they didn’t do anything. I thought nothing of it at the time, but I shouldn’t have been allowed out. I was just a kid. They took me off my mum because they said she couldn’t take care of me, so they should’ve taken care of me. But they didn’t.” The Rochdale sexual abuse scandal did not surprise either of us. Lucy says the support did not improve much when she left care, even when she was looking after two younger brothers. I share her disillusionment. At one children’s home, most of the staff had a casual attitude to us attending school. We were never prompted to take care of our personal hygiene and they tolerated children smoking and drinking. Crisps, instant noodles and plates of biscuits were often our only meals. The homes I lived in were mixed, and the staff’s casual attitude to our welfare included our sexual health. Many of the girls I grew up with became pregnant, sometimes by other boys in the unit. I lost my virginity to a girl I was living with when I was 14. Not all of the staff were negligent. One of my old care workers, Anne, was adored by most of the kids; we felt she was one of the few staff who genuinely cared about us. Some of the others, she agrees when I speak to her, should never have worked with kids. “I gave the job up because of the staff I worked with. Too many of them saw how little they were making, so they came in and went home and that was it.” Anne says she witnessed staff “winding up children” and that there was physical abuse in the home where she worked. “I remember once I was there with two male members of staff and this lad was kicking off. They sat on his chest, and I’m thinking: ‘My God – this lad is going to die if they don’t get off him.’” She was later interviewed about it by the manager. “They said: ‘Are you sure it was his chest? Are you sure it wasn’t his stomach?’ And I told them that they shouldn’t have even sat on his bleeding stomach. I felt as if I was in the wrong because I was complaining,” she says. When I turned 17, I was moved on from Hawthorn Crescent into a place of my own, a two-up-two-down terrace in Oldham. A private care management provider had taken over my case and I was assigned a key worker to visit me a couple of times a week. I had lived in homes or foster placements since I was 12. Although these could be chaotic, sometimes frightening places, the presence of other people was comforting, especially at night. I went from this to living on my own and I don’t think I was ready. A semi-independent unit such as Hawthorn Crescent is meant to prepare you for life outside the system. It can teach you to manage bills, cook meals and budget. What it can’t prepare you for is loneliness. Before this, I had lived at 11 addresses, attended six schools and left education when I was 15, after being expelled. This is not the best way to build a strong support network. I felt the need to plug the loneliness and my new home rapidly became a doss house where other kids from the estate could drink, smoke weed and act out away from adults. Like many care leavers, I drank heavily while living alone and had regular panic attacks so severe that I often called for an ambulance. Later, in my 20s, I experienced homelessness and long periods of unemployment. Many of the mistakes I have made are my own and many of them were avoidable, but I can’t help feeling that I would have had more of a chance if I had received better support when I left the care system. Lucy agrees. “We were just thrown in at the deep end,” she says. In 2013, the government extended the age at which a child could remain with foster carers to 21, but that change did not extend to children living in children’s homes, who still have to leave at 18. Ian Dickson, a care leaver, a retired Ofsted inspector and one of the founders of the campaign group Every Child Leaving Care Matters, believes the deadline should have been extended for everyone in care. “Kids should have the chance to stay put if they want to,” he says. “One of the first and key things the government needs to do is to listen to the people who have been there.” If a child is taken into care, it is usually because their family is incapable of looking after them. It is not a child’s fault if they have been neglected or abused, if their parents have died or if their family has broken down. The average age for children leaving home in the UK is 22 and most people receive long-term support from their parents, so why should care leavers be treated differently? The fact that I have lost contact, irrevocably, with so many of the people with whom I grew up tells me we are not doing enough to ensure the future of care leavers. People who feel loved and cared for, who are full members of society, do not simply drop off the map. “There’s a whole range of people who are successful care leavers,” Dickson says. “When you sit down and talk to them about why they made it, it always comes down to: someone, somewhere believed in them.” I guess no one believed in Andrew, Kieran, Luis, Graham or Georgina. • Some names in this article have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/12/pollutionwatch-bicycles-take-over-city-of-london-rush-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T20:30:17Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: bicycles take over City of London rush hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/pollutionwatch-bicycles-take-over-city-of-london-rush-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/12/pollutionwatch-bicycles-take-over-city-of-london-rush-hour","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: bicycles take over City of London rush hour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"City workers are swapping their pinstripe suits for cycle helmets and hi-vis jackets.

A five-year study on 260,000 UK workers as part of UK Biobank showed that the 16,000 people who cycled as part of their commute had lower rates of heart disease and cancer and were living longer compared with those who largely sat in their cars or on public transport. For the first time, the City of London data also included walking, which is often overlooked in transport planning. Walking was found to make up half of the people movements in the City, but pavements make up only 25% of street space.

Three times, Damian Collins, the head of the parliamentary fake news inquiry, has asked him to answer MPs’ questions. Three times, he’s refused. Instead, his chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, will appear on 26 April. Here are some questions for Zuckerberg that we have in Britain have no hope of ever telling us the answers to. 1) You have turned down parliament’s request to answer questions about Facebook’s role in our referendum three times. What gives? It was a polite request. If you were a British citizen or a British company, parliament could compel you. That you’ve refused – three times – raises urgent questions about the use of your platform as a political campaign tool in this country. You are a foreign asset. You may have played a hugely significant role in our democracy and you are refusing to co-operate with our legislators. Why? You will answer to US lawmakers but not to ours? Why should we allow you to operate within our borders if you won’t respect our institutions? If we can’t hold you to account? Do we need to treat you like any other hostile actor? You’re more powerful than most nation states and you may have played a consequential, maybe pivotal, role in the most important election of our lifetime. Don’t you think you could at least get on a plane? 2) The last time you sent one of your executives to parliament, he told MPs Cambridge Analytica had no Facebook data. Thoughts? 3) Who saw what Facebook adverts during the referendum and why? We need full transparency. It is not acceptable that our democracy is seemingly being conducted in the darkness of Facebook’s black box. You need to publish these in a public forum. You need to reveal to users who targeted them, based on what data. Legislators and academics and journalists and the public need full and open access to everything you have. This needs to be retrospective as well as ongoing. 4) Did campaigns co-ordinate? Can we see your servers? In the early hours of yesterday morning, you suspended AIQ from your platform to investigate information that suggested it was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica and may have had access to Facebook data. This is the data firm that is at the heart of Brexit. It received 40% of Vote Leave’s budget and was used by a further three campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party. The bedrock of our electoral laws is controlling money in elections and a key principle of this is that campaigns don’t co-ordinate. Did they? Would there be evidence on your servers? Can you look at the data flows? Did AIQ create custom audiences? If so, can we see them? 5) When did you personally learn that Cambridge Analytica had millions of Facebook profiles? You claimed last week you had no idea the company was involved in US politics. But when the Guardian published its exposé in December 2015, Cambridge Analytica made clear it was working for Ted Cruz. You say: “They weren’t an advertiser.” But Facebook ads were a key tool for the Cruz campaign. Are there discrepancies here? You say:“They were not a player that we had been paying attention to.” Can you confirm no Facebook employees were in touch with the Cruz campaign? 6) You referred a lot to Aleksandr Kogan last week, who harvested the data on Cambridge Analytica’s behalf. But you failed to mention Dr Kogan’s business partner, Joseph Chancellor, who now works for Facebook. Why? He went to work for Facebook right before the scandal broke in 2015. He still works for you. What does he know? Have you asked him? 7) You said last week: “Life is about learning from the mistakes and figuring out what you need to do to move forward.” This is not about you. Can you not see that? This is bigger than you, bigger than any of us. It’s about the 87 million Facebook users whose profiles were harvested on Cambridge Analytica’s behalf. It’s about the two billion users whose data has probably been scraped. It’s about if democracy can survive the age of big tech. It’s not a blip in your personal journey. You created a world-changing platform. Now the world has changed. It’s time for others to reckon with that. • Carole Cadwalladr is an Observer journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/07/sporting-lisbon-president-suspends-19-players-after-social-media-spat","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T15:08:35Z","webTitle":"Sporting Lisbon president suspends 19 players after social media spat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/07/sporting-lisbon-president-suspends-19-players-after-social-media-spat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/07/sporting-lisbon-president-suspends-19-players-after-social-media-spat","fields":{"headline":"Sporting Lisbon president suspends 19 players after social media spat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sporting Lisbon are left with six players for Sunday’s match with Pacos de Ferreira after president Bruno de Carvalho suspended 19 of the club’s players following a Facebook spat with the majority of the first team. De Carvalho instigated the spat by criticising some of his players for their “stupid” performance in their 2-0 Europa League defeat to Atlético Madrid. Defenders Sebastián Coates and Jérémy Mathieu were singled out for extra criticism. In response to the comments, 19 of the club’s players released a joint statement across their social media accounts expressing “our disgust with the president’s public statements … he is supposed to be our leader”. “We always fight for our club, for our supporters and ourselves,” said the statement. “For this reason, we express in this message our displeasure at the public comments of our president after a game in which we did not get the result we wanted. No matter what the situation, all such matters should be resolved within the group” The Sporting president was unhappy with this rebellion, retaliating by suspending those involved. “All the players who wrote the message below are suspended with immediate effect and will face the club’s disciplinary procedures. I’m fed up with spoilt children who don’t represent anything or anyone,” he said. “This time, my patience has run out for those who think they are above the club and any sort of criticism.” However, this Facebook post was later deleted. Jorge Jesus, the team’s coach, was due to hold a press conference on Saturday but this was postponed by three hours as reports emerged that he would be forced to field the reserve team in their league match against Pacos de Ferreira on Sunday. On Friday the club had been forced to deny the players refused to train in protest of the situation.

Foreign fans will be protected better than some might deserve","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"About six months ago a big Russian publishing house asked me to write a book before the World Cup. I suggested the story of the Russian national team. The faces of editors clouded over. “Nobody will read it. Russians don’t believe in the national team. They wouldn’t like to read about losers.” According to the latest survey, only 4% of those interested in football in Russia believe the host team could win the World Cup. Instead of dreaming of victory, most Russians hope just to celebrate an event of global significance, show foreigners their cities and entertain them with pure icy vodka and mighty zastolie. Don’t believe the scare stories about violence, racism, hooliganism and so on. There’s no way foreign fans will face any of it (assuming, of course, they don’t provoke locals). They will be protected better than some might deserve. It’s true that the diplomatic rows are getting a lot of attention on Russian TV and ordinary Russians don’t think an awful lot of Boris Johnson, Theresa May or other major British politicians. But the same happened in Soviet times, in even stronger terms. That didn’t affect the attitude of Russians to English football or ordinary English citizens. The English Premier League is broadcast on national Match TV for free, and some English games have much bigger TV ratings than most Russian ones. Former superstars such as Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard or Wayne Rooney are better known to many than English and even Russian politicians. Harry Kane with his goals could easily neutralise the negative political and diplomatic mood. If the British government does boycott the World Cup, it won’t influence the Russian response to the England team, because politicians don’t play football and their absence won’t be noticed. The only thing that matters is the presence of the Three Lions themselves. The Confederations Cup in 2017, which took place without one serious incident on or off the pitch, showed Russia can organise everything perfectly. Ask the 7,000 Chilean fans at that tournament who were accepted with absolute hospitality. On the night train from Moscow to Kazan, I saw Russians from Siberia pour them free vodka and cognac for half the night. Potentially violent fans will have no access to the stadiums because of the fans’ passport system, successfully adopted at Confederations Cup. The political message from the top and from the police couldn’t have been clearer. Ultra leaders know better than to show any aggression during World Cup month. Events like Marseille in June 2016 won’t be repeated inside the country and civilised English fans shouldn’t be worried about safety. Don’t behave like pigs and nothing will happen. At least I can’t imagine any prepared attacks. One piece of advice for foreign fans: there was a story before the start of Confederations Cup when a Chilean fan, who didn’t know the rouble rate, was cheated by an airport taxi driver. A supporter had to pay 50,000 roubles (about £600) for the 45-minute drive from Domodedovo airport to Moscow city centre. The driver was caught by the police, repaid the victim and barely escaped prison. But just in case: don’t use airport taxis. Uber is much safer for your pocket.

But will anybody dare open the door?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It is easy to set up a political party. You just have to register with the Electoral Commission and raise some cash to fund the deposits of your candidates. Then you are at the races. In the first three months of this year, 34 novel political outfits were formed, among them the Aspire party, the Legacy party, Save Us Now, the For Britain Movement and the Psychedelic Future party. I am not sticking my neck out very far when I forecast that none of them will form the next government of Britain. What is extremely hard is creating a new party with the potential to get to power. Since 1900, only one new party, that would be Labour, has become a governing party of the UK. It took 45 years, the Great Depression and two world wars for Labour to grow from startup to majority government. If your ambition is to reshape the political landscape of Britain, there has been a less demanding route than trying to break through an electoral system that is highly hostile to new contenders. That simpler method has been to take over one of the old parties and change it from within. In my lifetime, the one-nation Tory party of Harold Macmillan was transformed into a Thatcherised party. The pro-European Conservative party that took Britain into the Common Market has mutated into the Brexiteering party that is wrenching us out of the EU. It is 37 years since a group of leading Labour moderates, appalled by the party’s lurch to the left in the 1980s, broke away to form the SDP, which had the ambition to replace Labour as the alternative government to the Conservatives. Tony Blair did not join that breakaway. He stayed with the Labour party until he eventually got into the position to change it into New Labour. Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have done a Blair in reverse since 2015. Well over half of Labour’s current membership have joined – or rejoined, in the case of some of the older comrades – the party since he ran for leader. Its ideology has been radically recast. Control of party headquarters completes a takeover of its power structures. Demoralised Labour MPs have become internal exiles within their own party. Mr Corbyn is now king of the castle. Despair at this state of affairs among non-Corbynite parliamentarians and members fuels a constant background conversation about the creation of a new party, and that talk has become louder in recent weeks. The phoney unity that prevailed since the election has broken down over the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury and the shameful proliferation of antisemitism in Labour’s ranks that has been accompanied by threats of deselection against MPs who protest about it. Some anguished liberal Tories express a yearning for a new party. Senior Lib Dems, who might be expected to view this as a menace to their existence, have been giving encouragement to the idea, a recognition that they don’t have the heft to fill the gaping hole in the middle ground of British politics. To have any chance of success, the first must for a new party is a potential audience. That seems to exist. There is a substantial segment of voters who feel disenfranchised by the choice between a Corbynised Labour party and a Rees-Moggifying Conservative party. In the run-up to the last election, 45% of respondents told one pollster that “there is a need for a new centre-ground party”, a larger proportion of the electorate than either of the big parties managed to attract at the ballot box. Another survey suggests that 56% of voters do not feel that any of the existing political parties represent them. An appetite seems to be there. Another thing you require for a new party is money. This would not be a problem. There is an affluent constituency, who are both appalled by the May government and horrified by the thought of a Corbyn premiership, who are waiting to get out their cheque books. Some of them are former donors to Labour. Some used to give to the Tories. Other potential backers of a new party are of no previous affiliation. As my colleague Michael Savage reveals in today’s Observer, one network of entrepreneurs and philanthropists has as much as £50m ready to spend. More would be available from other sources. A new party could be in danger of having an embarrassment of riches given that it would be attacked – from both the Corbynista left and the Brexiter right – as a vehicle for the moneyed elite. It would be very important for a new party to show that it had the support of a wide spread of voters, not just business people with deep pockets. The project would need a name. Some Labour people have talked about breaking away as “Real Labour” or “True Labour”. That would present legal difficulties and cramp the scope to attract defectors from the Tory party and support from voters who do not naturally identify with Labour. The fundamental pitch of a new formation would be as the “Sensible party”, but it couldn’t call itself that because, when I checked with the Electoral Commission, I found that the name has already been taken. “Mainstream” is one potential label I’ve heard mooted, which sounds moderate and inclusive without being as anaemic as “Centre party”. A new party would have to have a policy platform broader than just opposing Brexit and it would need to be creatively open-minded about addressing the challenges facing Britain. Another must is convincing leadership with some star quality. Emmanuel Macron’s sensational breakthrough in France is the most often cited inspiration for a new party. He built En Marche! seemingly from scratch, but he had not actually come from nowhere. He had a track record as a senior minister and an established public profile that went with that. He also had the help of some seasoned operators. He was young, which energised his campaign with dynamism and freshness, but he also had experience, which gave him name recognition and plausibility as a leadership candidate. He was also smiled on by a context that was highly propitious. The traditional party of the left in France – the socialists – had become so unpopular that François Hollande did not even stand for re-election. The traditional party of the right had also been discredited and its candidate for president was enveloped in a dark cloud of scandal. The stars were well aligned for a new party. Some of the conditions for a similar earthquake in Britain are present today. Voter attachments to the traditional parties have been decaying for a long time. The rise of identity and values as political dividers is further loosening old allegiances. The historic voting coalitions that have sustained the Conservatives and Labour look brittle. Politics has become more fluid and faster moving. Many Britons don’t like the choice presented to them by the red-blue duopoly and the country refused to give either of them a majority at the last election. When asked to choose whether they want Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, a big number of voters prefer “neither” and “don’t know”. The opportunity exists for a new party, but it would be a massive gamble. What is so far lacking is a critical mass of MPs prepared to take the large risks involved in making it happen. It is said, and it is true, that recent events have pushed many Labour MPs to breaking point, but that does not mean they are quite ready to break with their party. One thing that stops them is a deep attachment to Labour as an idea and a tribe, along with a continuing reluctance among many to accept that their party has been lost to Corbynism for the foreseeable future. One of this view likes to say to distraught colleagues: “It will pass.” Another thing holding them back is Brexit. I have heard a significant number of Labour MPs say the time is not yet ripe for a new party because they have a duty to “hold it together” until the critical parliamentary votes on Brexit have played out. The moment of truth will come when we are closer to the EU departure date. It will be then that we will find out whether the many conversations about a new party amount to anything more than idle chatter. It will be then that we will discover whether wistful talk turns into the bold action that would be required to make it happen. History scoffs at the idea. Precedent suggests that a new party will fail. Then again, the past few years have repeatedly shown us, from the rise of Jeremy Corbyn to Brexit, that precedent has become a lousy predictor. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/14/country-diary-close-encounters-with-our-most-exciting-raptor","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T04:30:12Z","webTitle":"Country diary: close encounters with our most exciting raptor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/14/country-diary-close-encounters-with-our-most-exciting-raptor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/14/country-diary-close-encounters-with-our-most-exciting-raptor","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: close encounters with our most exciting raptor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The huge dolerite cliff at the head of the valley glows in afternoon light. A pale green algal cast accentuates white streaks and fresh spatterings. This is peregrine and raven territory, the latter maintaining a respectful distance from the former. They’ve been present here for at least 50 years. I first saw the falcons at their inaccessible eyrie under the great overhang in 1968. That was the time when peregrine and raven populations in Wales were recovering from dramatic postwar declines caused by organochlorine pesticides, used in dusting racing pigeons for fleas, treating crops, dipping sheep for parasites. The DDT, particularly, concentrated in the birds’ food chains, led to the thinning of eggshells and repeated brood failures. The scrupulous research for the Nature Conservancy Council of Derek Ratcliffe (1929-2005), and his determined harrying of the agrochemical lobby, surely saved the peregrine – our most exciting raptor – from extinction in Britain. I’m grateful to him, though less so to a Tory government that dismembered the NCC in 1989, in order to check its spirited and effective opposition to environmentally damaging schemes countrywide. I wish Derek could have seen the present rude health of this long-established nesting site. In the years I lived in Cwm Pennant I came here often, to watch these marvellous birds in a location where they’re relatively safe from nest-robbers. As a rock climber, pioneering routes up its steep faces, I frequently came close to them. I once spent an hour on a ledge with the tiercel, blue-grey and moustachioed, intently watching from six metres away, remarkably tolerant of my presence. I’d see him winging back, a pigeon in his talons, calling the falcon from her nest. Harsh chattering between the pair echoed from the rock walls. She’d fly beneath him upside down to catch the prey he dropped, before shearing back to feed the eyasses. Once, standing in my garden down-valley, the head of a pigeon, severed in his 200mph stoop, fell at my feet. I looked up into a cloud of down drifting across the sun, from which the tiercel appeared, haloed, pigeon corpse grasped tight as he sped back to his cliff on scimitar wings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/07/faceblock-campaign-urges-users-boycott-facebook-for-one-day-protest-cambridge-analytica-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T16:37:58Z","webTitle":"Faceblock campaign urges users to boycott Facebook for a day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/07/faceblock-campaign-urges-users-boycott-facebook-for-one-day-protest-cambridge-analytica-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/07/faceblock-campaign-urges-users-boycott-facebook-for-one-day-protest-cambridge-analytica-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Faceblock campaign urges users to boycott Facebook for a day","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook users are being urged to stop using the social media platform for one day in protest against the company’s involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The Faceblock campaign has been planned to coincide with Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance before US Congress on Wednesday, where the Facebook chief executive will be testifying about data privacy issues. The international group of campaigners is asking people to take part in a day of online protest by refusing to use Facebook’s platforms and apps, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, for 24 hours. Laura Ullman, spokeswoman for the campaign, said the group was concerned about data privacy and how the company had been regulated. “We wanted to organise some direct action where lots of people could say that they love Facebook but want to see it improved. By not using the platform for a day, it’s a virtual demonstration that is easy to do but will send a powerful message that we demand better,” she said. “We chose the day as we want to show Zuckerberg and also the US government that we want change. It’s Facebook’s responsibility to manage their platform, but it’s also the responsibility of governments to ensure companies protect data and to regulate monopolies.” Some users have said they are considering deleting their Facebook account completely, but Ullman said this was not feasible for everyone and that many still liked using Facebook and its other platforms. “Not everyone has the privilege to do so. Facebook has created a monopoly and in some countries the only point of entry to the internet is through Facebook. It is often the only source of news in some places,” she said. “Facebook has also become a platform for community organising, so why should those people have to suffer because of bad policies of a company? Why should they have to give up their involvement in the community in order to take a stand against a company that has not been regulated properly, that’s had improper policies and that has abused the trust of its users? “Individuals shouldn’t be forced to look out for themselves when the problem comes from the way the system is set up.” People can participate in #faceblock by joining the Facebook event and sending their own messages to Zuckerberg and their governments, Ullman said. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004, will be testifying before the House energy and commerce committee, which is examining Facebook’s “use and protection of user data”. He has also agreed to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate judiciary and commerce committees on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/07/farewell-butch-wilkins-and-the-crafty-cockney","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T18:00:07Z","webTitle":"Farewell Butch Wilkins and the Crafty Cockney – great players from a simpler sporting era | Alex Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/farewell-butch-wilkins-and-the-crafty-cockney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/farewell-butch-wilkins-and-the-crafty-cockney","fields":{"headline":"Farewell Butch Wilkins and the Crafty Cockney – great players from a simpler sporting era","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A memory from young adulthood: my dad shaking his head sorrowfully, bewildered, then sloping off for a stroll round the garden and a smoke. “Why did he do it? What was he thinking?” he asked, with a hint of anguish. “I’m so disappointed in him.” “He” was Ray Wilkins; “it” was throwing the ball away in a flash of temper, only to see it catch the ref a glancing blow and the result was a red card. The sole dismissal of his career and the end of his involvement in the 1986 World Cup; suspended for the next two games, he didn’t make the team for England’s quarter-final match against Argentina. You might say he was well out of the affair of Maradona and the Hand of God, though I don’t think Wilkins agreed. “When the Argentine kit man came in with shirts to give us, I thought Ray Wilkins was going to hit him,” team-mate Kenny Sansom remembered 30 years later. “I’d never heard Ray swear before but he got this chap out the dressing room, shouting, ‘We don’t want your shirts, you’re fucking cheats’.” (For younger generations: put thoughts of sour grapes out of your minds – they were cheats and the country entered a period of outraged depression as a result. But what’s probably harder to imagine is that only four years had elapsed since Britain and Argentina had gone to war over the Falklands, so the match was not, shall we say, free of context.) I like to think that “Butch” Wilkins, the Chelsea, England and AC Milan player whose unexpected death at the age of 61 has floored so many football fans, was channelling Alf Ramsey, who intervened during another testy England-Argentina World Cup clash to stop George Cohen swapping shirts with an opposition player. In that tournament, in 1966, England famously prevailed over all challengers, and also kickstarted the national side’s lengthy decline into the painful, three-lions-on-the-shirt cycle of hope and despair, the highlights of which are best known as Gazza’s Tears, Beckham’s Metatarsal and Lampard’s Disallowed Goal. Back to that evening in 1986. My dad wasn’t even a Chelsea fan – his hero was Bobby Moore, England captain and feted Hammer. But he loved Butch nonetheless and, more to the point, grasped the awful essence of the moment: a momentary lapse of control, a disproportionately serious consequence, a sense of letting oneself and others down. If it seems perverse to mention a sportsperson’s uncharacteristically bad day just after their death, I intend the opposite. Tributes to Wilkins have returned again and again to his decency, his warmth, his loyalty to friends, family and colleagues. (He used to call my partner, with whom he worked from time to time in sports radio, “young man”. Wilkins was three months his senior.) Obituaries have not shied away from the issues he experienced in recent years: depression and alcohol addiction that led to a lengthy driving ban, perhaps in part the result of the ups and downs of his post-playing career. The Guardian’s notice concluded with Wilkins’s words: “Footballers who think they are something special are making a terrible mistake,” he said. “I always told my kids I’m nobody but their dad. But I just don’t cope well with rejection.” Wilkins, I think, was not much like the darts player Eric Bristow, who also died last week. The Crafty Cockney was all about the razzmatazz he could build around his talent – he all but engendered the darts explosion that endures today. Except that both belong to a certain era of sports-watching experienced by my generation and upwards that now seems starkly at odds with contemporary mores. Mindful of a predilection for nostalgia and acutely aware of rose-tinted specs that filter out, for example, football hooliganism and the emerging evidence of widespread sexual abuse of young players, dinosaurs such as me still hanker for a simplicity that appears to have been lost – the hero worship, the us and them, the onrush of delight and the pain of disappointment. But more than anything, I think, is the idea that one might know and love one’s sporting idols without actually having to find out too much about them. This thought occurred to me as I watched the Winter Olympics and returns now as the Commonwealth Games get going. In part because the BBC has lost so many of its sporting rights, the corporation must max out its coverage and the way it has chosen to do so is through the personal stories of competitors. How many times have you got the late-night beer and popcorn organised, only to turn on and find yourself embroiled in some form of heartfelt documentary? How far do you stick with interviews with sportsperson X’s siblings, grandmother and best friend before you crack, desperate for some actual sport, and hurl the popcorn ceilingward? How do you begin to describe the bathos when, following an hour of painstaking analysis of past mistakes/injuries/comeback strategies, said sportsperson takes to the field/track/rink/cycle and falls flat on their back in the first 30 seconds? How to put it? I have enough trouble in dealing with the failures and disappointments of my own life without taking on those of barely known athletes. I do not want to see a journey – I want to see a football match. And, even more specifically, I do not want to see cheating cricketers parading their children, spouses and parents on television while breaking down in tears and apologising to the nation (before, one notes, the opponents they defrauded). Especially since the incident itself was the result of such monumental thickness – sandpaper in pants! More CCTV than Curry’s on sale day! – you worry for the future of the species. Here’s a lesson from the old days: take your lumps and don’t do it again. • Alex Clark is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/07/luxury-space-hotel-orion-span-aurora-station","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T18:13:00Z","webTitle":"'First luxury space hotel' plans to offer zero gravity living – for $792,000 a night","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/07/luxury-space-hotel-orion-span-aurora-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/07/luxury-space-hotel-orion-span-aurora-station","fields":{"headline":"'First luxury space hotel' plans to offer zero gravity living – for $792,000 a night","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Houston-based company said this week it plans to open the “first luxury hotel in space” by late 2021. Orion Span’s compact Aurora Station – at 35ft-by-14ft its interior will be comparable to that of a Gulfstream jet, the company said – is projected to accommodate four travellers and two crew members for 12-day stays 200 miles above the earth. Guests will be charged $9.5m each, or about $791,666 a night. Refundable deposits of $80,000 can now be made online. The founder Frank Bunger – described by his own company as “a serial entrepreneur and technology start-up executive” – told Bloomberg: “We want to get people into space because it’s the final frontier for our civilization.” In a press release, Orion Span said it would take “what was historically a 24-month training regimen to prepare travellers to visit a space station and streamline it to three months, at a fraction of the cost”. Customers would subsequently understand basic spaceflight, orbital mechanics and life in pressurized environments in space, the company said. The company said travellers would then “enjoy the exhilaration of zero gravity … gaze at the northern and southern aurora through the many windows, soar over their hometowns, take part in research experiments such as growing food while in orbit (which they can take home with them as the ultimate souvenir), revel in a virtual reality experience on the holodeck, and stay in touch or live stream with their loved ones back home via high-speed wireless internet access.” They would also, it said, “be treated to a hero’s welcome home”. Bunger said the project had been made possible in part because “almost every week, there’s another rocket-launch company that’s starting up with a new way to get to orbit cheaper, faster, better”. A spokeswoman told Bloomberg the company was assessing potential funding sources but would not disclose how much it wanted to raise. Orion Span would not be the first operation to offer rides into space. A number of wealthy travelers have flown to the International Space Station (ISS) with the Russian space programme – which said recently it too plans to open a “space hotel” in 2022. Dennis Tito, an American businessman, took the first “space tourism” flight in 2001, visiting the ISS for a reported $20m. He was followed by, among others, the software entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth and the first female space tourist, Prodea Systems co-founder Anousheh Ansari. Charles Simonyi, a former Microsoft executive, has visited the space station twice. “It is amazing how [the space station] appears from the blackness of the sky,” Simonyi said in 2007. “It was very, very dramatic. It was like a big stage set, a fantastic production of some incredible opera or modern play.” Last year, the SpaceX founder Elon Musk said his company planned to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon. The pair had paid a “significant deposit”, he said. Jeff Bezos of Amazon and the Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson aim to give tourists short rides to the edge of space, about 60 miles up. Branson has reportedly signed up celebrities including Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Katy Perry to take the $250,000 ride. Bunger, who announced his project at the Space 2.0 summit in San Jose, California, said Orion Span’s clients would be passionate about space and astronomical study. “We’re not selling a ‘Hey let’s go to the beach’ equivalent in space,” he said. “We’re selling the experience of being an astronaut. You reckon that there are people who are willing to pay to have that experience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/07/oulton-leeds-prefab-airey-houses-demolition-eviction","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T14:16:58Z","webTitle":"‘The spirit will be lost’: residents fight eviction from their prefab homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/07/oulton-leeds-prefab-airey-houses-demolition-eviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/07/oulton-leeds-prefab-airey-houses-demolition-eviction","fields":{"headline":"‘The spirit will be lost’: residents fight eviction from their prefab homes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The first that the residents of Wordsworth Drive and Sugar Hill Close knew of the possibility they could be turfed out of their homes was when flyers dropped through letter boxes last autumn. The leaflets, lost among the doormat detritus of takeaway menus, invited them to a consultation “to give us your ideas on how the [redevelopment] scheme can help meet the needs of the local community”. At first, some of those living on this estate on the outskirts of Oulton, a village that has morphed into a suburb of Leeds, were excited about what they thought would be a much-needed project to renovate their homes, which are among the last examples of Airey houses left in Britain. Named after Sir Edwin Airey, a construction magnate, around 200 of the houses were built on the estate in the late 50s as homes for miners, and few thought they would see in the millennium. Made from prefabricated concrete and scrap metal salvaged from military vehicles, they were designed to meet the housing needs of the growing numbers of workers living outside cities. Today, some 70 still survive on the estate, their pebble-dashed exteriors and brown wooden window frames offering a stark contrast to the smarter, modern brick houses with double glazing and uPVC doors that later appeared. Barry and Mavis Abbey, both in their early 70s, have lived on the estate since 1970, when the homes were owned by the National Coal Board. They admit it has had its share of problems as the miners moved out and new tenants moved in. But they talk fondly of a community where people still look out for each other. “I wouldn’t want to move somewhere else,” Mavis said. “We have a support system here.” At one stage the Abbeys had been led to believe they would be able to buy their home under the Thatcher government’s right-to-buy scheme. But this option was denied them for reasons that remain opaque. Ex-miners like Barry believe it was in revenge for them going on strike in the mid-1980s. The estate was sold off by the NCB in 1986, after which the homes passed through a series of owners until they ended up in the hands of the Pemberstone Group, a private investment firm that boasts a diverse portfolio of interests including an Italian tour operator, an indoor ski slope and the Ilford camera-film brand. Pemberstone’s “scheme” involves replacing the existing 70 Airey houses with 71 new properties, only 11 of which will be reserved for “affordable accommodation”, a number that it says is in line with Leeds city council’s Strategic Homes plan. Locals have heard that the new homes will be priced at around £300,000 – 10 times what a three-bedroom Airey house on another estate fetched recently. Surrounded by attractive green spaces, close to motorways and 20 minutes from the city centre, they should sell easily. The ex-miners, like Barry, and their widows have legal rights to be rehoused. But the prospect of moving at their age remains daunting. “When we got to know what was happening we couldn’t sleep,” Barry said. The Abbeys are the lucky ones. The occupants of more than 50 of the homes – who do not have assured tenancies – have no such protection and can, if Pemberstone gains planning permission, be ordered to leave with just two months’ notice. Pemberstone said it was talking to social housing organisations to see if they might take on the site, but it is unlikely that any could afford the expected price-tag. If no takers are found, Pemberstone intends to carry out the development in phases, building around six homes at a time over the next three to 15 years. “Given the natural turnover of properties and the long-term nature of the redevelopment, it is highly unlikely that any tenants would be asked to move from their home without being offered an equivalent alternative on the same estate,” the company said. But whether the tenants could afford the new rents is questionable. Cindy Readman, a teaching assistant who has lived on the estate for 13 years with her husband and three children, pays £500 a month for a three-bedroom house. “We couldn’t get anything like this size for the same amount of money,” she said. “There’s such a shortage of affordable housing around here. We’ve been told that once we were given notice, we would get the highest priority on the council waiting list. But even if you’re at the top, the waiting list is 70 weeks.” Pemberstone argues that it has little choice but to demolish the homes because they fail to meet the required standards, in particular for energy efficiency. “As new standards come into force, there will come a point when these houses are considered uninhabitable,” the company said. “The fact is also that concrete houses like these are becoming less attractive to tenants and therefore harder to let. Currently 12 houses – around 20% of stock – are vacant.” But the company appears to have misjudged the mood of those on the estate, some of whom have firsthand experience of confronting authority. During the strike, when money to heat their homes was scarce, Barry recalled how he and his fellow miners went into their back gardens and dug the coal seam a metre below, a quirk that Pemberstone might need to consider if it starts building work. When the Observer visited last Thursday, almost all the homes were sporting posters protesting against the scheme, and opposition is gathering momentum. A social media campaign has attracted the attention of both regional and national media. When the residents presented their reasons for opposing the scheme to the city council, they received a standing ovation. “This is the biggest injustice I’ve seen in all my time in politics,” said Karen Bruce, a Labour councillor. The fight has been joined by the Twentieth Century Society, which is backing a petition to save the homes due to their historical importance. And now, decades on from when their collieries closed, Yorkshire’s ex-miners are preparing to march again – a show of solidarity for the last vestiges of another era. “It’s not just about houses, it’s about the community spirit that will be lost,” said Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. “These people still talk to each other and help each other out. A lot of communities now, you don’t get that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/08/the-masters-final-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T22:51:50Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed wins the Masters after holding off Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/08/the-masters-final-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/08/the-masters-final-round-live","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed wins the Masters after holding off Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Andy Bull on the new champion: And here’s Ewan Murray’s report from Augusta National: The putt drops! He clenches a fist, pumps it, and yells in delight! He takes his cap off, bows, and is congratulated warmly by McIlroy! A round of 71 seals the deal! He wasn’t quite at his best today, but all the hard work had been done with the first three rounds of 69, 66 and 67, and whenever anyone came close to him today, he responded with birdie or stunning par save. He’s the deserving champion ... and a deserving major winner ... but spare a thought for poor Rickie Fowler, who embraced Reed sportingly but has now finished second at the US Open, the Open and now the Masters. That first major remains elusive for Fowler. Oh Rickie! -15: Reed -14: Fowler -13: Spieth -11: Rahm -9: Smith, Watson, Stenson, McIlroy -8: Leishman -7: Finau, D Johnson -6: Hoffman, Rose, Oosthuizen -5: Casey, Henley The stage is left to Patrick Reed. The 27-year-old Texan has two putts to win the Masters! He hits a dribbler down the green ... and it misses on the right and sails three feet past. It’s not over quite yet. A short uphill one for the Masters, we’ve all dreamed of it ... Rory McIlroy finishes up first. A par to end a dismal round of 74. If only that eagle putt on 2 had dropped, this entire story could have been different. But his flat stick went cold, and he’s still got a Masters-shaped hole on his CV, and a green-jacket shaped gap in his wardrobe. He ends the week at -9. Reed lands his second onto the green from 166 yards. He pulled it slightly, and it’s stayed up on the higher back portion of the green. So he’s got a slippery downhill 30-footer left. But he’s got two putts for the Masters! The gallery rises to acclaim him. Their new champion? Reed should finish this off. He’s been so solid all day ... all week. But the pressure’s really on now. Rickie prowls around his putt, checking every angle. Finally he strikes it ... and knocks it straight into the cup! The birdie takes him past Jordan Spieth into second spot. A round of 67. He’s one behind Reed. Jon Rahm puts his name to a 69. And back on the tee, Reed clatters a final huge drive straight down the centre of the fairway. It briefly threatens to run into Lyle’s Bunker, but stops short. He’s one good iron shot and two putts away from becoming the 2018 Masters champion! -15: Reed (17) -14: Fowler (F) -13: Spieth (F) -11: Rahm (F) Reed’s putt across 17 is the best part of 100 feet. He rattles it straight at the hole, and it hits the cup! It’s going too fast to drop, but the cup takes the pace off the ball and stops it six feet past. That’s a stroke of luck, but it’s reward for his positivity. And he rolls in the par saver, and he’s very close now. That’s a miracle two-putt from where he was! His name is surely on this Tournament ... unless Fowler can convert his birdie chance on 18 to put a little pressure on. Henrik Stenson finishes on a high, knocking his second to five feet and rolling in for birdie. That’s his third 70 on the bounce, to go with an opening-day 69, and he ends the week -9. Tommy Fleetwood finished with a very disappointing 74; he’s -4. They clear out of the way, to let Rickie Fowler send his final iron into the green. And it’s a peach, biting eight feet from the hole! Up on 18, the two-time champion Bubba Watson completes a very satisfactory week by signing for a 69. He’s -9 for the Tournament. Back on the tee, Fowler lashes an almost perfect drive down the centre of the fairway. And on 17, Reed’s second is not very good at all, only just creeping onto the front left of the green. The flag is all the way over on the other side, across a couple of ridges. That’ll test his putting touch. Fowler sends a nice putt up towards the hole from the fringe, but it’s never turning right as it needs to. He’ll have to make to with tidying up from three feet for par. Par for Rahm too. Back down the hole, Reed pushes his drive into the second cut down the right. He should be OK for his second shot, he’s not quite as wide as the row of trees. Fowler needs a birdie down the last, because Reed is closing in now. -15: Reed (16) -13: Spieth (F), Fowler (17) Reed thinks he’s made his birdie putt on 16, but it dies to the left at the very last turn. He stays two clear of Spieth and Fowler at -15, with two to play. Fowler needs a strong finish. But his second into 17 topples back off the front of the green. At the very least, he needs to get up and down, and see what happens down 18. “Nobody cavorts like Jack did,” declares Simon McMahon. “As distinctive in its own way as the raised arm of Denis Law or Joe Jordan, the raised finger of Dennis Taylor or Alex Higgins, the raised knee of Bruce Forsyth, the raised lip of Shakin’ Stevens, and the raised eyebrow of everyone’s favourite Bond, Roger Moore.” Reed looks determined to close this out. He fires his tee shot at 16 straight at the flag. It stops 15 feet short of the cup. A chance for birdie; more importantly, there’s now no chance for watery disaster. He’s been magnificent today, holding the field at arm’s length for most of the afternoon, and pressing on the gas when Spieth momentarily caught him. He’s just got to keep calm and he should close this out. Though at the Masters, nothing’s ever certain until the cards are checked and signed. Reed tickles a slightly nervy putt to four feet. He’s left with a tricky downhill tiddler, but knocks it straight into the middle of the cup. Nerveless? Not quite: he’s breathing quite heavily as he walks off the green, trying to calm himself down. But he’s in pole position to claim his first major. Fowler threatens to run him close, though: he splashes smartly out of the bunker at 16, sending his ball over the flag and letting the slope do the work to bring it back to the hole. He taps in for par. -15: Reed (14) -13: Spieth (F), Fowler (16) -11: Rahm (16) -9: Smith (F), Watson (17), McIlroy (15) Jordan Spieth screeches a wedge to ten feet. Sadly, his putt to equal the course-record of 63 stays high on the left. Bogey is such a disappointing end to his round, but that’s a spectacular final-day 64 which sets a clubhouse mark of -13. A huge ovation from the Augusta gallery as he wanders off to the marker’s hut. That was a Homeric effort. Will it be enough? Because back on 15, Reed lays up but sends a nervous wedge just over the back of the green. He’s only marginally off, mind, so will be putting from there. And on 16, Fowler finds the bunker front left. On 18, Cameron Smith is inches away for a birdie that would have brought him back in 29. He taps in for a par, and a 66. He ends the week at -9. Back down the hole, Spieth pearls a fairway wood up towards the green, but he’ll be left with a chip from 50 yards, and he needs to get up and down to equal the course record and set a clubhouse mark at -14. Meanwhile Fowler is on the 15th in two. He’s got a long eagle putt, and gives the 60-footer a trundle. It races six feet past. But he knocks in the return for birdie, and he’s two back at -13. Rahm can’t scramble his par, though, and drops to -11. His grim look suggests he knows his bid has fallen short. Spieth’s tee shot at 18 clips an overhanging branch down the left, and drops straight down. He’ll have a long, long second into the green. He’ll probably not reach the putting surface. He can still make four, but three looks a pipe dream. Meanwhile back on 15, Reed’s tee shot skirts down the left. It’s on the fairway, but he might not want to risk a hook round the trees to go for the green in two. Rahm might be spent, too, because his second into 15 hits the bank on the far side of the water, and topples back into the drink. This hole caused his compatriot Sergio so much pain earlier in the week ... now a second Spaniard looks to have succumbed to its watery grave. He could still scramble par, of course, but holes are running out. -15: Reed (14) -14: Spieth (17) -12: Fowler (14), Rahm (14) Spieth’s birdie effort on 17 slips by on the high, right side. He’ll remain at -14, and will need something up 18 you’d have thought. Because back on 14, Reed rolls in his birdie putt, and he’s once again the leader of this Tournament! McIlroy rolls his long one to three feet, but then misses the tiddler, which just about sums up his performance today. His putting has been appalling, and his race is run. Aside from the small matter of this year’s green jacket, Jordan Spieth just needs one more birdie to break the course record. He sets himself up by knocking his second at 17 to 20 feet. Meanwhile back on 14, Reed caresses his approach to eight feet. That is wonderful, given he’s under serious attack from Spieth. McIlroy finds the green in regulation, but it’s a fair way from the flag. He’s the only player in the top 25 over par for his round. Patrick Reed: the Tom Weiskopf de nos jours? Nicklaus’s birdie at 16 in 1975 shook Weiskopf; now Reed chips ten feet short from the bank on 13 and can’t knock in the birdie putt. Par, which means he’s still only tied for the lead. McIlroy makes birdie but at -10 it’s surely too late for him. Rahm birdies 14, and now he’s just two behind at -12. Meanwhile birdie for Smith at 17, his sixth in the last eight holes since the turn! He’s -9. -14: Spieth (16), Reed (13) -12: Fowler (14), Rahm (14) -10: McIlroy (13) Spieth’s 8-iron into 16 is well short of the flag. He’s left with a 33-foot putt for his birdie. And in it goes! A right-to-left slider and perfectly paced! It’s not totally dissimilar to the putt that effectively won the 1975 Masters for Jack Nicklaus! That is absurd! He doesn’t cavort like Jack did, but does look at his caddy as if to say: did that really happen?! You’ll be seeing that one again! He’s now the joint leader of the 2018 Tournament! -14: Spieth (16), Reed (12) -12: Fowler (13) Rory sends his drive at 13 into the second cut down the right. He does very well to lash a long iron into the heart of the green. He desperately needs eagle now. He’s got a 35-foot chance. Then a huge stroke of fortune for Reed! He hits a heavy second towards Rae’s Creek! But the ball sticks on the bank on the far side, and he stays dry! For a second that looked like a real game-changer ... actually, speaking of which ... Birdie for Rahm at the par-five 13th. That was fairly easy and basic, having found the green in two ... though Fowler matches his effort in more roundabout style, shooting his second into the swale to the back left of the green, then bundling a wonder chip across a treacherous slope to eight feet, and knocking in the putt. Meanwhile Cameron Smith makes it four birdies in a row at 15 ... then nearly cards a fifth in sensational style. His tee shot is poor, and flirts with the water, but sticks in the bank. Then he hits a gorgeous and intelligent wedge, over the flag, using the bank to bring the ball back towards the hole. It looks like trickling in, but stays an inch out on the right, and it’s just par. But he’s -8 now. -14: Reed (12) -13: Spieth (15) -12: Fowler (13) -11: Rahm (13) -9: McIlroy (12) “COME ON!!!!” McIlroy’s putt at 12 sails harmlessly past the cup. Another par when he really needs birdies. And then Reed rolls his unerringly into the cup! No messing! This brilliant 27-year-old Texan keeps bouncing back, every time he slips up! Hence the big COME ON. A birdie which ensures he stays in the lead ... because up on 15, Spieth makes his birdie putt. Spieth stays on Reed’s tail, though. -14: Reed (12) -13: Spieth (15) -11: Fowler (12) -10: Rahm (12) Reed finds the back of the green at 12. So does Rory. Neither tee shot is all that, but at least they’ll both be putting. The quality of golf in this final pairing is pretty poor: of all the challengers, they’re the only ones not under par. They’re the only ones over par. Meanwhile Spieth finds the 15th green in two. He’s left with a 60-footer across the green ... and leaves it a good eight feet short. Will he pass up the chance to make birdie? Reed bumps a wonderful wedge to seven feet. McIlroy clanks a clumsy one a similar distance past. Reed’s par putt lips out; he drops back towards the chasing pack. Rory really needs to make his ... but he pulls it to the left. His putter is stone cold. His bid is as good as over, surely, because he just isn’t making a single thing on the greens. Meanwhile Rahm’s 20-foot slider along 12 dies to the left; par. Fowler makes no mistake from 10 feet, though, and having been quiet in the early stages today, his bid is alive and very real! And on 15, Dustin lets an eagle putt from 12 feet slip by on the right. What a chance to really close in on the leaders. But that’s birdie, and he’s still in this! And look at this leaderboard! -13: Reed (11) -12: Spieth (14) -11: Fowler (12) -10: Rahm (10) -9: D Johnson (15), McIlroy (11) Reed isn’t quite in the trees, but he can’t go for the green. He punches down the hill, and will hope to get up and down from 50 yards. McIlroy can’t take advantage, though, pushing his second down the swale to the right of the green. That is very poor. Over on 12, Fowler and Rahm find the green and will be looking at birdie putts again. And Cameron Smith has put a good run together: the 24-year-old Aussie prospect has birdied 10, 12, 13 and now 14, and he’s -7, looking at a high finish and another visit next year. Rahm’s effort from 40 feet stops just shy of the cup. Par. Fowler is having a look from half that distance. It slides by on the high side to the right. Par. On 13, Bubba lashes his second into the green and strokes in the eagle putt: he’s -8. Up on 14, Spieth finds the centre of the green in two, but can’t steer in his birdie effort from 20 feet. And Tony Finau’s run of birdies comes to an end, by the width of a ball on 18. Par, and he’s back in 31, signing for a 66. What a brilliant performance after nearly suffering serious injury on Wednesday as he celebrated that hole-in-one during the par-three contest. He ends the week at -7, and has a good chance of a very high finish and a place in next year’s Tournament. Reed hoicks a wild drive into the trees down the right of 11. A chance for McIlroy to start fighting back? He blooters a drive down the middle of the fairway, anyway. Much will depend on what’s happened to Reed’s ball. Down on the green, Rahm and Fowler both find the dancefloor in regulation, and will have looks at birdie. Tony Finau, who very nearly didn’t make it this week after dislocating his ankle during the par-three contest, has just carded six birdies in a row between 12 and 17. Now there’s a run he could sell to anyone in the leading pack for a cash sum. He’s -7, just off the pace. Back on 10, Reed and McIlroy make pars. McIlroy will be happier, since he’d left himself a long two-putt, the result of finding the second cut with his drive, while Reed didn’t quite make a 20-foot uphill birdie chance, one turn shy of pace. But the bigger picture will please Reed: he’s now just eight holes from home, with a four-shot advantage over his partner. He’ll be worried more about Spieth right now. Can McIlroy respond with some magic? He’ll need to do something soon if he’s to give Reed something to think about. Jordan Spieth drives into the pine needles down the right of 13 ... then creams a fairway wood onto the green, straight at the flag, that compares with Phil Mickelson’s famous clatter from a similar position in 2010! That’s a real seize-the-day moment! What a stunning shot! He’s arrowed that to 12 feet from 230 yards! What an eagle chance he’s set himself up. Will he get the reward for such bravery and brilliance? No. He sets it off to the left, and it’s never turning back. He rises to -12, mind. For the record, Mickelson never made eagle after that shot, either. Another birdie for Dustin Johnson, by the way, now at 14. So he’s keeping himself on the fringe of the action. -14: Reed (9) -12: Spieth (13) -10: Fowler (10), Rahm (10), McIlroy (9) -8: D Johnson (14) They’ve just shown a montage of Rory’s travails with the putter on the front nine. To recap: he’s missed very makeable putts at 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9. And he trails Reed by four. It doesn’t take a genius. Meanwhile another birdie for Dustin Johnson, this time at 13: he rises to -7, which is three behind the leading pack. Reed lands his third 15 feet past the flag, a clever shot as it allows the slope of the green to take his ball back to tap-in distance. What a par save! And he’s further boosted when McIlroy leaves his short birdie putt high on the right. The flat stick is costing McIlroy. You can’t keep putting like this and expect to win the Masters. A shame, because he was rolling them in from everywhere yesterday. But he’s lost his mojo, and perhaps more importantly, his confidence. His race isn’t yet run, but he needs to buck himself up quickly, because he’s letting too many chances slip by, and Reed doesn’t look in the mood to do anything stupid. The astonishing Jordan Spieth is now Patrick Reed’s closest rival! He trundles in a gentle-left-to-right slider from the apron at the back of 12, and the hole that’s caused him so much pain pays him something back! He’s -11, three off Reed’s lead ... and Reed’s just left his second short at 9 ... and watched in horror as his ball rolls off the front of the green and back down the fairway! Meanwhile McIlroy lands his second well behind the flag, then spins it back pin high, leaving a 12-footer across the green for birdie! What’s that they say about the Masters only starting around the turn on Sunday, again?! -14: Reed (8) -11: Spieth (12) -10: Fowler (9), Rahm (9), McIlroy (8) Hole-in-one at 16 for Charley Hoffman! He skelps his tee shot straight at the flag. Well, a little to the left. It takes one bounce off the tilt of the green caused by the back of the bunker, and rolls unerringly into the cup! Hoffman cavorts with a huge grin on his face, as the crowd go loco! That’s the 12th hole-in-one at 16 on Sunday in the last 16 years! And one of the simplest. The ball lands with a bang, takes one jump to the right, and rolls in! He’s -6 after a great run today: birdies at 2, 3, 7 and 15, bogey at 11, and now this! Spieth sends his tee shot at 12 into the light stuff at the back of 12. But he’s over the drink this year without his ball disappearing into the blue vagueness, and he holds his arms aloft in victory, earning a cheer from the gallery for his good humour. That’s a lovely moment. Meanwhile back on 9, Fowler wedges his second over the flag. The ball spins back to four feet, and that’s back-to-back birdies for the popular Californian. He’s -10. Reed sends his third into 8 to ten feet. A great uphill chance for birdie. But he pushes it. Just the par, but never mind: McIlroy can only send his third, a long iron, to the swale to the right of the green. He trundles a hot chip six feet past, and can’t stroke in the one coming back. All of a sudden, Reed’s lead is four, and McIlroy is back in the pack! He doesn’t look happy right now at all. He’s never been quite on it today, from the get-go. That eagle yip on 2 won’t have helped, mind. -14: Reed (8) -10: Spieth (11), Rahm (8), McIlroy (8) -9: Fowler (8) Spieth doesn’t hit his fairly straightforward putt (by the standards of Augusta) for once. His ball stops a couple of feet short of the cup, and that’s just a par. Meanwhile Stenson drops a shot at 9, which means he’s out in level-par 36. At -7, his race is run. Birdie for his partner Fleetwood, his first of the day, but after bogeys at 2 and 7, he’s -5 and well out of contention. Spieth knows this Masters could be his, if he continues like this and posts a score. The best comebacks in Masters history were made by Jack Burke Jr., in 1956 and Gary Player in 1978; both were eight back going into the final round. Spieth trailed by nine at the start of the day. So he launches an arrow straight at the flag on 11 from the top of the hill. Not a concern for the water to the left. It’s a beauty, and he’ll have an uphill putt from 25 feet for another birdie! A sad end to Paul Casey’s round: a three-putt par on 18. That’s a bogey-bogey finish, and he’ll have to make do with a 65. Make do with a 65 at Augusta! Anyway, he’s risen up the leaderboard to -5, having carded 69-65 at the weekend. Shame about the 74-75 start. Back on 8, Fowler makes birdie after wedging to a couple of feet; Rahm saves his par. They’re -9 and -10 respectively. And further down the hole, McIlroy is forced to chip out from the pines, while Reed lashes up the fairway from the bunker. Reed finds a fairway bunker down the right of 8 with his drive. McIlroy wangs a wild one into the trees down the same side. Up the hole, Rahm is in bother, having hooked his second into trees on the left. His punch out isn’t all that, but he chips close with his fourth and scrambles a par. Spieth pars 10, though he’s only inches away from curling in a huge right-to-left breaker up the green for a birdie on the hardest hole on the course. At -10 he’s four behind Reed, though, as the big man taps in to convert his birdie. What can Rory do by way of response? Well, his chip takes a huge bounce to the left, off the shoulder of a bunker, but he rolls in the four footer that remains. That’s a good par from where his drive ended up, but he won’t be feeling that great as a result of Reed’s brilliant second. -14: Reed (7) -11: McIlroy (7) -10: Spieth (10), Rahm (7) Bubba’s been quiet, after bogey at 4 and birdie at 5. But he knocks his second at 9 to four feet and makes the birdie putt. He turns under par for his round, and -7 for the Tournament. Back on 7, Reed finds the second cut down the left; Rory finds the long stuff down the right. Rory has the additional problem of overhanging branches. Reed’s up first, and he sends a beauty into Webb Simpson Country. His ball lands in the centre of the green and is gathered back towards the hole. For a second it looks like going in for eagle, but stops just on the right. Reed will kick in to move back to -14. Rory by comparison will be struggling to reach the green at all thanks to the branches over his head. He can only punch out ... and very nearly threads a stunning punch onto the green, between the two bunkers guarding the front. It doesn’t quite make it, but he’ll at least have a chance to get up and down to save his par. But for now, this is very much advantage Patrick Reed, who keeps responding to mistakes with moments of sheer brilliance. Paul Casey’s bid to alter the record books takes a huge blow. He sends his second at 17 into a bunker at the front of the green, and his splash out is way short of the hole. He can’t make the par saver ... in fact he leaves himself plenty of work to do for bogey, the putt trundling four feet past. But he knocks it in. A birdie up the last, and he’ll at least equal the course record of 63 held by Nick Price and Greg Norman. Rahm joins Spieth in a tie for third! He was worried his approach at 7 was going to land in the bunker. But it dropped just over, and then turned towards the hole on the right. In goes the 12-foot birdie effort, and he’s -10. This is really hotting up now! And we’ve not even got to Amen Corner yet. Meanwhile Dustin Johnson rakes a birdie putt home across 10: after birdie at 9, he’s -6. Jordan Spieth, ladies and gentlemen! He turns his right-to-left birdie putt into the cup at 9! He reaches the turn in 31! He’s -10, and very much a live prospect now. Especially as Reed trundles his long putt 12 feet past the flag, and doesn’t make the one coming back. Rory leaves his one short, which gives him an uphill putt. In it goes. That’s a staunch save. But look where Spieth is, all of a sudden! What a competitor the young Texan genius is! -13: Reed (6) -11: McIlroy (6) -10: Spieth (9) -9: Rahm (6) -8: Stenson (7), Fowler (6) Poor tee shots at the par-three 6th by both Reed and McIlroy. Reed is miles left, McIlroy short, with the pin at the back right. Both are on the green, though. Spieth knocks his second at 9 past the flag, allowing the slope to bring the ball back to 12 feet. He’s really making his presence felt. And a bounceback birdie for Justin Rose at 10: it followed a double at 9, the result of coming a cropper at the bottom of the bank at the front of the green, and taking three to chip up. He’s -5. Rahm creams his tee shot at 6 pin-high to ten feet. But he lets the birdie putt slide by on the right. Fowler is chipping his second across the green ... but gives it too much check. He’s left with a crucial par - and momentum - saver. And in it goes! Birdie meanwhile for Stenson at 7, to offset a shot dropped at 6. -14: Reed (5) -11: McIlroy (5) -9: Spieth (8), Rahm (6) -8: Stenson (7), Fowler (6) -7: Casey (16) Casey saves his par on 16! He splashes out delicately, 12 feet past the flag, and uses the gradient to bring his ball back to five feet. He hits his putt straight, hard and firm, and in it drops! One more birdie! Can he make it for the course record? McIlroy bumps a chip up the big green to four feet. That’s a wonderful shot from where he was, well short of the green. But he dribbles a weak effort off to the right of the cup, and he keeps handing his birdies back. Reed rolls his long putt up to a similar distance, and makes no mistake. It’s as they were on the 1st tee again. But Reed is five holes closer to the holy grail. Casey pulls his tee shot at 16 into the bunker between the water and the green on the left. He’ll have quite a splash out of sand, with little dancefloor to work with. All of a sudden, that 63 doesn’t look so simple. Back on 5, Rory’s ball is nestling against the first cut. He doesn’t connect well, and leaves his second short of the green. That’ll be a test to save par. Reed comes up short too, from the middle of the fairway, but at least he’s on the green. And Spieth will surely make birdie on 8 after wedging his third to a couple of feet. He’ll move to -9. He’ll be four under for his round today ... and suddenly only five off the lead. With Reed and McIlroy looking nervous ... well, you never know. The 2015 champion is in the mix now! McIlroy sends another drive out to the right, this time at 5. He just about holds the fairway. Reed splits it. Up the hole, Fowler balloons his second through the green, then nearly chips back through it. He’s left with a long two putts for bogey, and does very well to make it. He drops back to -8, though it could have been worse. His partner Rahm also makes a two-putt from distance, but his is for par. He stays at -9. Casey has a 40-footer across 15 for eagle. He strokes it to 18 inches, and knocks the birdie putt in. He’s now -7 for the Tournament ... and if he pars home, he’ll equal the course record of 63! One more, and he’s making all sorts of history. He’s just gone birdie-birdie-eagle-birdie-eagle! And it all started with a chip-in on 11. All inspired by Jeff Knox making birdie there in front of him yesterday. Sort of. Reed rolls in his tricky par putt with supreme confidence. That shows grit after a poor first effort. McIlroy meanwhile had waited a long time to knock in his short birdie putt. After costly misses on 2 and 3, you can forgive his nerves a-jangling. But he knocks it straight into the cup. That’s a fine bounceback after a couple of disappointments. -14: Reed (4) -12: McIlroy (4) -9: Fowler (9), Rahm (4) -8: Spieth (7), Stenson (5) On 4, Rahm can’t get up and down from sand at the front and slips back to -9. Coming behind, Reed can only send his tee shot onto the front fringe, and his long putt up breaks off to the left and leaves a tricky, dribbly six-footer for par. McIlroy by contrast has whipped his tee shot to three feet! Meanwhile on 7 Spieth sends his second into the green Webb Simpson style, but misses a short birdie putt and remains at -8. Another birdie for Paul Casey, at 14, and he’s -6. More pertinently, he’s already eight under par for his round today. Pick up two more shots, and he’ll be signing for a course-record 62, beating the mark of 63 set by Nick Price in 1986 and matched by Greg Norman ten years later. Can he match the new major-championship record set by Branden Grace at Birkdale last year? Or even beat it? He’s just landed his second at the par-five 15th onto the green, so there’s a chance all right! Rory has a treacherous chip up the big, steep bank and onto the small portion of the green where the flagstick is planted. He does exceptionally well to lob his ball to ten feet. He’ll need to hole that, because Reed sends a hot putt straight at the cup ... and pumps his fist as it drops! Lucky the hole got in the way, eh, but hats off to Reed for accuracy! And it’s spooked Rory, who misses his par putt. Suddenly the gap is two, and that missed eagle chance looks even more expensive: they’re back to where they started! -14: Reed (3) -11: McIlroy (3) That eagle miss has taken the wind out of McIlroy’s sails. He hits a good tee shot down the middle of 3, but his wedge onto the green is short and spins back down the green at the front. He’ll have a tricky up and down from there. Reed sends his second over the flag, but just off the back. He’ll have a look at birdie from the fringe, maybe 18 feet away. Up on 4, Rahm dunks his tee shot in the bunker front right, while Fowler knocks his to 12 feet. Paul Casey is motoring! Birdies at 2, 5, 8, 11 and 12, and now an eagle at 13. He’s seven under for his round, and -5 overall. Birdie for Justin Thomas at 6: he’s -6. And on 3, Rahm wedges his second to five feet, and tidies up for his second birdie today: he’s -10, and just three off the lead! -13: Reed (2) -12: McIlroy (2) -10: Rahm (3) -9: Fowler (3) Tiger is coming up 18. He finds the heart of the green, but his ball doesn’t spin back down the ridge Sandy Lyle style. An anti-climactic three-putt later for bogey, and he’s signing for a final-round 69. He finishes his first Masters since 2015 at +1, and smiles warmly; it’s been a good effort, if you set aside the outrageous pre-Tournament expectations. Reed’s long bunker shot across 2 is fine, trundling to a halt ten feet from the cup. He can’t make his birdie effort, though, and remains at -13. But he remains in the lead, because McIlroy pushes a nervy one to the right of the cup and he has to settle for birdie. What a miss by Rory. It looked as though he rushed that one. Still, he’s closed the gap to Reed further - though he should be tied for the lead. -13: Reed (2) -12: McIlroy (2) -9: Fowler (2), Rahm (2) -8: Spieth (5), Stenson (3) -6: Rose (7) Birdie for Justin Rose at 7, having nearly holed out from the fairway, Webb Simpson style: he’s -6. And speaking of Simpson, another couple of birdies for the hottest act out there today, at 13 and now 15: he’s -4 for the Tournament but seven under par for his round! Reed slam-dunks a poor long iron into the bunker to the left of the 2nd green. He’s not started well; an up and down from distance for birdie would serve him well. By contrast McIlroy plays one of the shots of the week, taking the pin on over the sand to the right of the green and landing his second from 200 yards four feet from the cup! That is ridiculous! A glorious shot, and an eagle chance to match! Up on the 2nd green, Jon Rahm has found the front of the green in two. Instead of putting into the bunker like Bubba, he cradles a 70-footer up to tap-in distance, and that’s an easy birdie. He’s -9. His partner Rickie Fowler has a right-to-left-to-right swerver for his birdie from 25 feet, but par will have to do. He stays at -9. “Nice steady Seve-Par there for Rory at the first,” observes Adam Hirst. McIlroy larrups his drive at 2 down the left-hand side of the fairway. That’ll settle a few nerves after his opening effort. Reed’s is a nerve-settler too, though he does flirt with the bunker down the right. A sensational second to 5 by Spieth, who brings his ball to a halt a couple of feet from the cup from 200 yards. He’ll knock that in to move to-8. He’s not out of this! And up on 17, Tiger’s dream of finishing in red figures lives on, because he birdies 17 to move to level par for his week’s work. Whatever happens going down 18, this final round will give him more succour going forward as the great man continues his comeback! McIlroy makes his par! That’s another preposterous scramble: he made six from six yesterday. Reed meanwhile lags up very well from 50 feet to three, limiting the damage to a bogey. The gap at the top is now just two, and that’s news that’ll reverberate around the course, as it brings quite a few players closer to their dream. Up on 2, Stenson spurns a chance for birdie from six feet. That’s a depressing par. And it’s an even more depressing bogey for Fleetwood, who couldn’t hold his ball on the green from the bunker at the front and suffers as a result. -13: Reed (1) -11: McIlroy (1) -9: Fowler (1) -8: Stenson (2), Rahm (1) -7: Spieth (4) Reed catches his sand shot far too clean, and his ball very nearly falls off the back of the green! He’s lucky that didn’t trundle down the bank; he’s still got a job to get down in two putts, though. Rory’s ball is plugged, having found the trap from on high. He smashes out to ten feet and gives himself a chance of scrambling par. What a meal these chaps are making of this opening hole. The unique pressure of the Masters, on display right here! Reed can take a swing at his ball, by a tree down the left of Tea Olive ... but there’s danger on the follow through. He has to stab at his shot to avoid hitting the trunk and hurting himself. He manages to punch his ball up into the bunker front-left of the green, and avoid injury to boot. That’s a result from where he was. See also McIlroy, who is absurdly fortunate to get a route towards the green. Sort of. He lifts a full wedge over the trees, and lands his ball in the same bunker as Reed. Wow. This is not a solid start by the leading pair! Meanwhile Paul Casey tramlines a monster on 11 to move to -2. A rare birdie on that hole, having watched Jeff Knox show him how it was done yesterday! The final group take to the 1st tee ... and instantly betray their nerves. First up, the leader Patrick Reed, who sends his drive towards the base of a tree down the left. If that’s not bad enough, Rory McIlroy sends a wild one almost straight right! There’s out of bounds over there, so his heart is in his mouth. But he’s got a break, in so much as his ball has stayed within the boundaries of the course. Blimey. Will he have a route out from the pine straw?! The drama didn’t take long, did it. Meanwhile up the hole, Fowler and Rahm find the green in regulation and make a pair of pars. Disaster for Bubba on 2! The pin’s tucked behind the big bunker at the front right of the green. His ball is at the front. There’s no straight line to the cup along the kidney-shaped green. So he tries to use the camber of the bunker on the right to throw a putt towards the flag - but skirting with the edge of the trap is taking liberties, and his ball topples in! That’s absurd. Putting into a bunker! Of course he splashes out to two feet - delicately, without much green to play with - and salvages par. But still. He stays at -6. It might not have been Tiger’s week, but the man sure knows how to entertain the galleries. Having birdied 13, he now guides in a huge left-to-right breaker on 15 for eagle! The patrons erupt in delight, and Tiger cracks a huge smile as well, feeling the love rolling towards him from all angles. He’s +1. Meanwhile Branden Grace has just carded four birdies in a row, at 13, 14, 15, and 16: he’s -1 all of a sudden. The penultimate pairing is on the tee. Rickie Fowler bashes his drive down the right of the fairway and is very lucky to stop short of the sand. Jon Rahm - who had been standing around with his eyes shut tight, waiting, perhaps praying - blooters his down the left. Up on the green, Tommy Fleetwood leaves himself a monster birdie putt from the front of the green. He leaves it well short. But in goes the six-foot saver. He stays at -6. But his partner Henrik Stenson had sent his second pin high to eight feet, and makes no mistake with the birdie putt. He’s -8. Meanwhile on 4, another birdie for Justin Rose. He’s -5. Spieth’s eagle effort slides past the left lip, but that’s a birdie-birdie start for the 2015 champion. He’s -7. His partner Justin Thomas can only make a par, but what an eventful one it was: a huge hook into the hazard down the left, a chip out, a third onto the green, a 75-foot putt with a huge left-to-right break lagged close, and in. Then breathe. Hey, Spieth’s given us a reason to update our leaderboard at last... -14: Reed -11: McIlroy -9: Fowler -8: Rahm -7: Spieth (2), Stenson Bubba is one turn of the Titleist away from a birdie start. He’d crashed his drive miles down the middle, only to leave himself a 30-footer for birdie. His aim was dead on, but he didn’t quite give it enough. He stays at -6. Up on 3, Rose has a curly birdie putt from the back of 2, but he can’t quite guide in the big rightwards swinger. He stays at -4. Meanwhile on 2, Jordan Spieth crashes his second into the heart of the green to set up a 25-foot birdie putt. After a couple of hesitant days, he’s clearly in the mood to give this a tilt. Easy to forget he was four clear of the field at -7 after 17 holes of the opening round. Hideki Matsuyama is going along nicely: birdies at 2, 3, 5 and now 8, with just the one dropped shot at 4. He’s -3 for his round and the Tournament. Charley Hoffman has birdied 2 and 3: he’s up to -3 already. Paul Casey has reached the turn in 33, after birdies at 2, 5 and 8: he’s -3. Birdie for Dustin Johnson at 2: he’s -5. And though Webb Simpson drops his first stroke of the day at 12 to slip back to -2, all of this serves as evidence of Ian Poulter talking sense. With the weather warming up, but the greens staying receptive after yesterday’s rain, the pack chasing Patrick Reed should indeed be “licking their chops”. There’s a score out there for someone. Doug Ghim signs off in style! The guaranteed winner of the Silver Cup as low amateur - the only amateur to survive the cut - holes out from the bunker at the front left of 18, and earns a hug and a kiss from his dad as player and caddy leap around in celebration! Does that closing birdie beat his eagle from the centre of the fairway on day one? Hard to say, isn’t it. What a choice to have! Delightful scenes, and the young Texan deserves the huge ovation he receives: he’s carded 72-76-74-74 this week, and ends the week very respectably at +8! Thanks to Tom. And tell you what, there’s plenty of players who would pay Webb Simpson cash money for his start today. Those eagles at 7 and 8 were something else: his second at 7 landed in the centre of the green from 170 yards, the slope of the green gathering the ball back towards and into the cup, then a chip-in from the side of 8. He’s only the fourth player to card back-to-back eagles in Masters history. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Rose at 2, and he moves to -4. The Justin Thomas/Jordan Spieth pairing arrives at the first. Thomas his a three-wood towards but not into the trees on the left but finds some rough on the edge of the fairway before Spieth finds the top of the hill in a fairly central position with is tee shot. Thomas’s second shot iswell judged though, to the edge of the green, but is outdone by Spieth whose second with the driver is even better. Thomas’s birdie putt is just skewed slightly to the right of the pin and he must settle for par. Spieth makes no mistake with his though, from an easier distance, and the 2015 champion is underway with a birdie. Ian Poulter speaks: “I played lovely today, I felt free, and it was one last hurrah to see how many birdies I could make, but a bit frustrated at lack of eagles. A few sloppy mistakes but the good stuff was good which is why I made seven birdies. The course is receptive, typical Sunday pin positions. I think the chasing pack today should be licking their chops.” Talking of licked-chops, Scott’s back and, I trust, well fed, to talk you through to the keenly-anticipated end. Mickelson gets himself into the greenside bunker on 18 but chips adeptly out of it onto the green and then drains his par putt to finish on two over. Warm applause follows him off. Back up the leaderboard, Hoffman adds another birdie on the 3rd to move to three-under and Webb Simpson’s charge continues, a birdie on the par-four 10th taking him to -3, having made two eagles on his front nine Another couple of finishers – Ian Poulter has signed for a 69, his best round of the week. He was never in contention after his heroics to get here, but he’ll be pleased with his finish. He heads to the clubhouse four-over. Also going round in 69 to finish +4 is Brian Harman. Tiger finds a good position on the fairway on 11 and six-irons to the green with a satisfying plonk, but he can’t nail a sinkable putt for birdie and has to settle for par. Woods’s playing partner, Cabrera Bello, drops his first shot of the day here though, drifting back to two over. And another birdie for Mickelson at the 17th – he’s left it all too late, but he’s put on a decent show today: five-under for the round but two over for the tournament. In the meantime, here’s Neil McLean, going route one on sandwich tips: “Thick cut white bread, butter, extra stong cheddar and a layer of salt and vinegar Pringles on top.” An eagle for Webb Simpson on the 7th followed by a birdie on Yellow Jasmine has put him in the red at two under, where he is joined by Matsuyama and Charlie Hoffman, who has birdied the 2nd. Singh meanwhile has signed for a 71, to finish on +7. It’s been a fine final round from Phil Mickelson, Lefty has eagled the long par-five 15th to leave himself four-under for the round, +3 overall, while another old-stager having a good day is Bernhard Langer, who’s two-under for the round after successive birdies on 8 and 9 have put him one-over for the tournament. Tiger’s rollercoaster round continues – a bogey at the 9th while the veteran Vijay Singh has stumbled towards the end, dropping two shots on the 16th. He’s -1 for the round but plus seven overall. Evening/afternoon everyone, and thanks Scott. Hope you enjoy your ‘burger’. In the meantime, Tiger’s responded to his mis-steps on 7 with a birdie at Yellow Jasmine to move back to three-over overall. None of which will matter much at the business end of things. Further up the leaderboard, Rafael Cabrera Bello has hit his groove, birdie-ing 6 and 8 to move to advance to +1. Webb Simpson too is on something of a charge. A stunning eagle on the seventh has put him level par overall, while Hideki Matsuyama, who began the day on even par, has birdied the 2nd and 3rd to move to two under. Anyhows, while I’m here feel free to email me here with your observations and cheese sarnie recipes. Hideki Matsuyama has been frustrating this week. Steady, but never threatening to break into a charge. An early birdie at 2 today, though, and last year’s PGA nearly man moves into red numbers at -1. And with that, I’m off to stick my face into a plate of Hamburger Helper, the only MSG-and-sodium flavored food product to be marketed by a singing, grinning, gurning golf glove. You couldn’t get away with the tagline of this advert in these more enlightened days, though gender stereotyping never tasted so good. See you in an hour; in the meantime, Tom Davies will be your host! Haotong Li came of age at last year’s Open, of course, with that final-day 63 at Birkdale. But the 22-year-old from China will have done his profile no harm with his joyous perambulations around Augusta this week. He led the Masters for a brief moment on Thursday afternoon, knocking his tee shot at 16 to a few feet and making the birdie putt to move to -4, encouraging the patrons to break out into a chorus of Liiiiiiiiiiiii in the Matt Kuchar style. He ended up carding a debut round of 69. It couldn’t last, and he shot 76 on the second day, but he’s entertained the gallery with his good humour and innate showmanship: he’s a very expressive player, wearing his heart on his sleeve. Anyway, an early birdie at 2, the result of a fine up and down from the wrong side of the sand guarding the front right of the green. But then a bogey at 3, after fluffing a chip from the bottom the big bank at the front left of the green. He’s +1, and there’s nobody at Augusta who would begrudge the young man a strong finish. Tiger’s flat stick has let him down today. He’d sent his second at 7 pin high to six feet, a wonderful approach from a tight spot restricted by a tree to the right of the fairway. But all the good work was undone as he pulled his putt. And then he misses the short one coming back! A three-putt bogey from close range, and he’s back to level par for the day, and +4 overall. “I took the precaution of making two batches of pimento cheese yesterday,” boasts the very wise Richard Sillett. “Roasted red bell peppers, diced, seem to work equally well. Replacing some of the mayonnaise with cream cheese results increases smoothness and decreases life expectancy. I can’t imagine Gary Player has eaten many of them.” Vijay’s hot streak continues. He makes his third birdie of the day, this time at 13, to move to +5. He’s putting together the best round out there right now: three under for the day. Singh won two PGAs as well as the 2000 Masters: the greats never lose it. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele, more than half Singh’s age, adds birdie at 8 to the one he made at Tea Olive. These two are the only players currently out there at two under or better, because of the aforementioned multiple-birdie-making fast starters, Zach Johnson has bogeyed 4, while Ian Poulter and Phil Mickelson have dropped shots at 11. A great up and down for Tiger on 6. He’d sent his tee shot well wide right of the green, but bumped a careful chip down a slippery bank and knocked in his four-footer for par. He stays at +3; then his partner Cabrera Bello deals with his birdie business. The 2012 US Open champ Webb Simpson has enjoyed playing the par-five 2nd this week. Birdie every day. He opens fast for the fourth day in a row, to rise to +2. He’s out with 2007 Masters and 2015 Open winner Zach Johnson: the steady-as-you-like Iowan also birdies 2, and then 3 as well, to move back to level par for the tournament. Meanwhile now it’s time for Rafa Cabrera Bello to bother the pin at a par-three: he lands his tee shot at 6 a couple of feet to the right of the cup, and will surely tidy up for a birdie that’ll take the Spaniard - who briefly led this Tournament earlier in the week - to +2. There’s nobody tearing it up out there. Phil Mickelson had started off fast, but he’s dropped one at 8, having skirted with trouble all the way down the left of the hole, and taking three putts. He’s reached the turn in 34 strokes, two under for the day and +5 overall. Vijay Singh is also two under for his round, having just added birdie at 10 to the one he made a while back at 2. He’s +6. And Ian Poulter is the only other player on the course a couple of shots to the good today. He’s had a very eventful morning: a birdie at 1 followed by bogey at 3 and double at 5 ... then a run of four birdies in five holes: 6, 7, 9 and 10! He never really had time to prepare for this Masters, having only qualified last Sunday by winning the Houston Open ... but he’s not done badly at all in the circumstances. And being here at all seemed a pipe dream a fortnight ago, so he’ll not be complaining too much. He’s +5, and hopefully his trademark Sunday surge will continue in the name of early-doors entertainment. Tiger’s iron play is certainly a lot better today: he nearly makes hole in one at the par-three 4th! An iron arrowed straight at the flag. His ball lands a couple of feet in front of the pin, takes a skip forward, and clips the left-hand edge of the cup. It could drop ... but doesn’t, and zips ten feet past. He’ll get a good read at his birdie putt, because his partner Rafa Cabrera Bello is outside him, coming in from a similar line. The Spaniard strokes a fine left-to-right curler into the cup from 18 feet. That’s a birdie that offsets a bogey at the previous hole, and he’s +3. As is Tiger, who having gone to school makes no mistake! An eventful start to Tiger’s round. Tiger crashes a drive down 3, a hole he usually enjoys at the Masters. His ball rests front left of the green, but he’s got that huge bank to get over, and there’s not a lot of room to play with at the top, because the flag is front left. He wafts at his lob, and the ball stays at the bottom of the slope. His second effort only just makes it, apologetically creeping onto the green. He can’t make the 12-foot saver, and drops back to +4. That birdie handed straight back. This hole location, teetering on the edge by the big bank, might result in quite a few incidents today. Birdie for Tiger at 2, despite an errant drive down the left of the hole. He got greenside in two, then pitched to a couple of feet. He’s up to +3, and his bid to reach level par - maybe even get into red figures for the week - is on. It really should have been his second birdie of the day, but the flat stick let him down on the 1st. The good news, however, is that his irons seem to be behaving themselves today; he’s struggled with them all week. Better late than never. It’s been a fine week for the veteran Vijay Singh. Few expected the 55-year-old Fijian to make the cut, but the 2000 champion made it with ease after rounds of 71 and 74. At one point early on Thursday he was leading the Tournament after starting out with birdies at 1, 3 and 4. A birdie-free 79 yesterday was an unwelcome reintroduction to 2018 life, but he’s going well today: one under for his round through 8 after birdie at 2. He’s out first, so he’s out there with a marker. Incidentally, Jeff Knox, the Augusta National member and Masters cult hero, birdied 11 yesterday as marker, a feat beyond all of the players in the field. In fact, only ten players have birdied that hole all week. “It was a brilliant birdie, he’s very good,” his partner of yesterday Paul Casey reported. Any old excuse to post this marvellous profile. Hatton is out there today with Doug Ghim, the young Texan who, as the only surviving amateur, is guaranteed to win the Silver Cup providing he completes his round. Ghim’s dropped a shot at 3, so he slips to +7. There’s a fair chance he could end the Tournament in last place, but as an amateur there’d be no shame in that, and in any case he’ll be taking away one of the moments of this year’s event, a hole-out for eagle from the middle of the 18th fairway. His dad on his bag, too. Millions of golfers would give anything to experience a moment like that with the old man. Also, Ghim will be in good company as a winner of the Silver Cup. In recent years, it’s been lifted by the likes of Hideki Matsuyama, Ryan Moore, Patrick Cantlay and Bryson DeChambeau. It’s also been won in the past by future champions Cary ‘Doc’ Middlecoff, Jack ‘Golden Bear’ Nicklaus, Gentle Ben Crenshaw, Phil the Thrill, Tiger and Sergio. I hope he’s got a snappy nickname up his sleeve. Tiger’s second into Tea Olive is a peach. An easy wedge clipped to five feet. But he can’t convert for birdie, the uphill putt lipping out. He makes do with par. He hardly missed a single putt from that sort of length between 1997 and 2008. A long time ago now, I guess. Elsewhere, there’s a fast start for Tyrrell Hatton, who has birdied 1 and 2 to move to -2. Much was expected of Phil Mickelson, too, despite his advancing years. Lefty’s bid to become the oldest Masters champion in history looked on when he shot an opening round of 70, but he only just survived the cut after a second-round 79. He did well to post 74 yesterday after opening with a whiff in the trees and a triple-bogey down 1, but he set out today at +7, one of the pre-Tournament tips down with the stragglers. He’s the hottest thing out on the course so far today, though: birdies at 2, 3 and 4 catapulting him up to +4. You can’t keep a three-time Masters champion down. It didn’t quite happen for Tiger Woods this week. One of the pre-Tournament favourites never got going, posting rounds of 73, 75 and 72. The expectation a little too much for a rusty genius. He’s out early today as a result, but that’s not stopped the galleries swarming around him for a close look at a living legend. And it’s not stopped the CBS featured groups cameras trailing him either, so we’ll see plenty of him in these early hours before the real action gets going. He starts at +4 today, and has made it his goal to reach level par for the week. He begins well by splitting the fairway at Tea Olive. But he did that on Friday and Saturday and made bogey both times. Let’s see how this one goes. Great news: there’s no threat of bad weather today! It’s going to be cloudy in the morning, with the sun hopefully breaking through later on. There’s not going to be much in the way of wind, and what little there is will drop come the afternoon. It’ll be cool all day, though expect noggin temperatures to rise by many degrees around Amen Corner. No rain. In other news, click here to have a gander at today’s pin positions. All very traditional for a Sunday at Augusta National, designed as ever for optimum excitement. Can you wait? Us neither! Here we go then! Are you all set for one of the greatest days in the sporting calendar? Pimento cheese sandwich made? Sweet tea fixed? Just a quick bit of prep, and we’ll be good to go! For the sandwich, mix white and yellow sharp cheddar, sliced pimentos and mayonnaise. Spread industrial quantities onto white bread. For the Southern-style sweet tea, place tea bags in a heatproof jar; add boiling water; remove tea bags and add industrial quantities of sugar. Pour over ice. Turn on golf. Keep eye on this report. Put up feet (preferably on porch swing). Relax! Only six men have ever completed the career grand slam in major-championship golf. Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have all collected the set of Masters, US Open, Open and PGA, while Bobby Jones won the US Amateur, US Open, Open and British Amateur titles in the pre-Masters era. It’s an elite club. And it’s one Rory McIlroy can join this evening if he manages to banish the ghosts of 2011 and add a green jacket to his already-stellar résumé. He’s playing well enough to complete his application. He carded a joint best-of-week 65 yesterday, a round he doggedly kept on track despite at one point finding himself waist-deep in azaleas. He knows he can deliver on Sunday when the pressure is on: forget that meltdown here in 2011, and consider instead his four subsequent major titles, his street-fighting FedEx Cup smash-and-grab in 2016, or the final-round 64 he shot to claim the Arnold Palmer last month. Immortality is within his grasp. Only problem is, Patrick Reed is playing like a dream. Reed doesn’t have a major championship to his name yet, but everyone’s got to start somewhere, and this could be the moment the 27-year-old Texan finally joins the big league. He came very close at last year’s PGA, shooting 67 at Quail Hollow to push Justin Thomas hard; he was one misjudged putt from making a play-off at the Valspar last month. And he’s been nothing short of sensational here this week: an opening-day 69, a 66 on a testing second day, then those two eagles yesterday on his way to a scintillating 67. It’s earned him a deserved three-shot lead over McIlroy going into the final round. Keep doing the same things, maintain a cool head, and the title’s his. He’d be a most deserved winner. But nothing’s ever certain at Augusta on Sunday. Just ask Greg Norman, who shipped a six-shot 54-hole lead in 1996. Or Ed Sneed, who couldn’t convert a five-shot advantage in 1979. Or Rory himself, who crashed and burned so sadly around Amen Corner in 2011. Plus the fact everyone knows the tournament doesn’t really start until everyone reaches the turn on Sunday. In that respect, the story’s yet to begin. So it could be a Patrick Reed procession ... or a drama of such epic proportions we’ll remember every twist, turn, eagle, birdie, hook and yip until our dying breath. And the erstwhile Ryder Cup combatants Reed and McIlroy might not be the only characters in our story, either. Working on the premise that nobody has won the Masters from further than eight shots back going into the final round - when Jack Burke Jr. overhauled Ken Venturi in 1956 - there are a further six players within range who could still have a realistic shot. Step forward Rickie Fowler, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson, Tommy Fleetwood, Bubba Watson and Marc Leishman. That’s quite a cast of talent, and they’ve all been on song this week. Hell, let’s go a couple of shots further back, just so we can namecheck the brilliant US trio of Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in our roll-call. Hey, it’s unlikely, but records are there to be broken. We went into this Tournament hoping for a classic. The first three days have more than delivered. So here’s hoping day four can put the icing on the cake. Good luck, Patrick. God speed, Rory. All the best, Rickie. Give it your best shot, Jon. It’s the denouement of the 2018 Masters. It’s Augusta National on Sunday. It’s on!

Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah focused on the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, whose conduct while in office has led to rumors of his imminent dismissal at the hands of the White House. “Every week, another Trump cabinet official is getting caught in a scandal,” Noah began. “Ben Carson spent a fortune on furniture. Tom Price used private jets like they were Ubers.” “Recently,” he continued, “everyone has been talking about Scott Pruitt. He’s the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and the lovechild of George W Bush and a baked potato. You see, he’s taken cabinet scandals to a whole new level.” Noah then showed a CNN segment that detailed just some of Pruitt’s many scandals, including living in a DC condo rented from a prominent energy lobbyist, increasing two aides’ salaries in defiance of the White House, using sirens to cut through DC traffic, reassigning staffers concerned about EPA spending, requesting a 24/7 security detail, as well as traveling only in first class or military jets. “That’s so much scandal even Shonda Rhymes would be like, ‘OK, this is unrealistic,’” Noah joked. “The head of the EPA is spending taxpayer money like he just woke up in Chris Brown’s body. He also said he was afraid people are listening to his phone conversations, so he spent $43,000 building a soundproof booth. Noah replied: “Motherfucker never heard of whispering?” “Listen to this one,” Noah went on. “Scott Pruitt wanted to spend $75,000 on a bulletproof desk. What’s the point of a bulletproof desk? It only works if your assassin doesn’t know how to walk around stuff.” The host then noted that Pruitt’s reasoning for only flying first class was because he’d had “unpleasant interactions” with travelers, including one who said to him: “You’re fucking up the environment.” “Pruitt may be an over-entitled, self-dealing cabinet member, but he’s really good at being bad for the environment,” Noah added, alluding to the two dozen Obama-era environmental regulations Pruitt has rolled back, including vehicle emmission standards and the Clean Power Plan, as well as his support for backing out of the Paris climate accord. “It’s amazing how the only thing you need for Trump to consider you effective is to just hit delete on anything Obama did,” Noah concluded. Stephen Colbert “Since I was off last week, I barely checked the news,” began Stephen Colbert. “I know it’s my job to stay informed, but I did not once think about Donald Trump’s penis. “Well, that’s all about to change in tonight’s Stormy Watch,” Colbert added. “As long time Stormy Watchers know, porn star Stormy Daniels states that right before the election, she was paid $130,000 by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay silent about her alleged doing-it-with-Donald. “Future generations will learn all about it in the Trump presidential library’s adult section,” the host joked. He then went on to show Trump answering questions aboard Air Force One. In a clip from last Thursday, Trump claimed he didn’t know about Cohen’s payment to Daniels. “Today, on a tip from Mueller, the FBI raided Cohen’s office, seizing records related to several topics, including payments to a pornographic film actress,” Colbert continued, alluding to the extraordinary search conducted on Cohen’s legal offices. Colbert went on, referencing news clips, to explain that the prosecutors for the southern district of New York had to prove both probable cause that a crime had been committed and that evidence of such a crime could be obtained via a raid. Colbert went on: “If Trump really knew nothing about this, Cohen is already in deep trouble because getting into an agreement on behalf of a client who doesn’t know that you’re doing that agreement is grounds for disbarment in New York.” Colbert then showed Stromy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti in an appearance on CNN, in which he states that Trump’s claiming ignorance of the payment is good for Daniels, since “you can’t have an agreement if one party claims they knew nothing about one of the principal terms of the agreement”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/12/samuel-taylor-coleridge-poet-remains-rediscovered-wine-cellar","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge's remains rediscovered in wine cellar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/12/samuel-taylor-coleridge-poet-remains-rediscovered-wine-cellar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/12/samuel-taylor-coleridge-poet-remains-rediscovered-wine-cellar","fields":{"headline":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge's remains rediscovered in wine cellar","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It probably wouldn’t have surprised his long-suffering friends, but the remains of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge have been rediscovered in a wine cellar. Literary pilgrims have long paid their respects at the memorial plaques to Coleridge in the church above, unaware his lead coffin was lying behind a brick wall closing one end of the 17th-century cellar. The space was incorporated into the crypt of St Michael’s when the church was built in 1831 near the top of Highgate Hill in north London. “It has been said that you could see it as appropriate, but it is not in a very fitting state for him, and the family would support the plans to improve it,” said Richard Coleridge, the poet’s great-great-great-grandson, a police officer based in Newham. Coleridge’s well preserved lead coffin is just visible through a ventilation brick, together with those of his wife, Sara, his daughter, also Sara, his son-in-law and his grandson. The church plans to clear and restore the crypt – which is still half full of rubble from the demolished mansion, Ashhurst House, that preceded the church – and allow access to the last resting place of one of the most renowned English poets. At present the only way of visiting it is to go down a flight of stairs, through a door and then to clamber over and around piles of bricks and dust. “From a safety point of view it would be quite impossible to bring members of the public down here,” said the vicar, Kunle Ayodeji. “But we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge’s cellar. I don’t think we would open up a view of the coffins, but we could place a suitable inscription on the wall.” Coleridge, author of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, was a genius who suffered from poor health and depression. A heavy drinker, he also became addicted to opium in the form of laudanum originally prescribed for his health, and died aged 61 in July 1834. Coleridge could see the distinctive red door of the handsome new church from his last home across the green, where he lodged with a doctor he hoped could cure him – a house now owned by the model Kate Moss. He was buried in the nearby chapel of Highgate school. In 1961 it was noted that Coleridge’s vault had become derelict, and after an international fundraising appeal the coffins were moved to St Michael’s, with the poet laureate John Masefield giving an address at the unveiling of the stone. But in the words of Drew Clode, a member of the St Michael’s stewardship committee, “poor Coleridge was moved from a tip to a tip – they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them, and never did anything about the rest of the space”. As people died or moved away from the parish, the exact location of the coffins was forgotten, until a recent excavation revealed the entrance to the wine vault. The gap was just large enough to shine a torch through the ventilation block in the 1960s brick wall, and the excavators discovered the five lead coffins. They lay not where most thought, in the far corner of the crypt, but almost directly below the inscription “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge” on the prominent memorial slab in the nave. “So that was a bit of a clue really,” said Clode. The church is planning a special Coleridge day in June with recitals and lectures, with several members of his family expected to be present, to raise funds towards the restoration project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/15/wandsworth-council-labour-targets-thatcher-favourite-tory-control-four-decades","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T14:00:23Z","webTitle":"Wandsworth in play as Labour targets Thatcher's favourite council","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/15/wandsworth-council-labour-targets-thatcher-favourite-tory-control-four-decades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/15/wandsworth-council-labour-targets-thatcher-favourite-tory-control-four-decades","fields":{"headline":"Wandsworth in play as Labour targets Thatcher's favourite council","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Half a mile from where Sadiq Khan grew up on the Henry Prince estate in Wandsworth, a small gaggle of Labour activists are gathering in Earlsfield, with the real prospect of taking back a council that has been Conservative since the London mayor was at primary school. Wandsworth, famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite borough, has been a flagship Tory council for 40 years, pioneering the outsourcing of local services and famous for its ultra-low council tax. Labour campaigners have been buoyed by June 2016’s general election result, in which Labour ousted the Tory minister Jane Ellison in Battersea and slashed the majority of the then-cabinet minister Justine Greening in Putney. Housing is on the mind of many voters, said the MP for Tooting, Rosena Allin-Khan, out with the canvassers in Earlsfield where the ward is held by two Tory councillors and one Labour. “Housing is something that affects everyone, regardless of age or socioeconomic status, in council homes, renting or worrying about whether your children can ever afford to buy in the same area,” she said. One emblem is the controversial development of the former Battersea power station. Labour has said it would review the planning applications from developers in order to force them to reinstate plans for more affordable flats, controversially slashed last year with Wandsworth council’s approval. Simon Hogg, the Labour leader on the council, said the sight of the development was causing feelings of resentment. “People can see a big tower block going up and yet know none of their friends, or their children, are going to get to live there,” he said. The housing crisis had created some of the conditions for a possible Labour victory, Hogg said. “Wandsworth Tories aggressively sold off thousands of council homes to create this very large private rented sector, believing that would be a huge electoral advantage to them,” he said. “These are the renters who elected Marsha de Cordova in Battersea and gave Rosena such a big majority in Tooting.” However, Wandsworth council’s housing strategy is a key pledge that Tories in the borough are also fighting on, it having committed to delivering an extra 1,000 homes in the next five years, 60% of them affordable, built directly with council money. There is a significant housebuilding pipeline, though Labour argues not enough are affordable homes. However, it is the Tories’ low council tax pledge that is the key appeal to most voters. It still remains the second cheapest in the country at £716.51 a year for a band D property and estate agents use it to advertise their listings. Jo Rigby, who is standing in Earlsfield, admitted the low council tax message “does work, especially when people move into the area ... but what we are increasingly hearing is that, we would rather pay more and get better services”. Labour has said it would freeze council tax for the next two years. But John Locker, a newly elected Tory councillor who won his Thamesfield seat in a November byelection, said voters were sceptical. “I don’t think we understand how Labour can square that circle of extra spending now but not taxing more,” he said. “I want to improve Wandsworth, but in order to do that we have to manage our residents’ council tax money.” Locker’s victory was a boost for the Conservatives. He won his Putney seat at a low point for the Tories, after a difficult party conference for Theresa May, resignations of cabinet ministers and a tough Brexit negotiation, and amid a blitz of Labour activism. “Angela Rayner, Chris Williamson and lots of other Labour MPs came, there were hundreds of Momentum activists, but it didn’t work for them and we held the seat quite comfortably,” he said. “My campaign focused on local issues, what we can do to help shops on the high street, promoting cycling and pushing for a new entrance to [Putney] station to ease congestion. I think we have quite a sophisticated electorate; some tell us as well they vote differently locally to how they vote nationally.” Labour holds 19 seats and looks like it will make comfortable headway into the mid-20s, but the maths looks more difficult to get a majority. It would mean taking some of the most affluent wards in the country, where Labour councillors have not been elected since the 1960s. The former Tory MP Richard Tracey, latterly Wandsworth’s London assembly member, said incumbency was a key strength. “Statistically, Labour is strong in five wards, they have a lot of votes in a small number of wards. They will have to fight very hard in wards they don’t hold – it’s a high hill to climb.” Locker said Labour may have talked itself into a corner. “I do think the pressure is on Labour given how they have talked up Wandsworth as a crown jewel, winning this iconic council. I personally would never take voters of Wandsworth for granted. We have a strong manifesto on keeping council tax low, affordable housing, keeping weekly bin collections, things that really matter to local people.” Allin-Khan said in those seats where Labour needed steep numbers to win, the most crucial final hurdle would be getting Labour voters to the polls. “We’ll be piggy-backing people to the polling stations at 9.59pm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/15/dua-lipa-pop-has-to-be-fun-you-cant-get-upset-about-every-little-thing-new-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T08:30:08Z","webTitle":"Dua Lipa: ‘Pop has to be fun.

You can’t get upset about every little thing’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are plenty of reasons to be startled by the young musician Dua Lipa. Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands. Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’” Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms; and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.” We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass. It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent box. “You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.” As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY; and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”). “Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.” “Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.” Over tea with me she chuckles awkwardly about this. “People have kind of gotten the idea that the song isn’t about someone who’s [romantically] toxic to you, it’s about any male whatsoever in your life. I’ve seen memes that say: ‘Well, I haven’t picked up the phone to my dad or my brothers in months!’ And I think to myself: ‘I’m so sorry. I’ve created monsters.’” Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us already. And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story. Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.” In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.” Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to school.” Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.” We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello. Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.” From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look like. Lipa says: “Tell me about it. You have such high expectations. My mum married the first man she fell in love with – first boyfriend, first everything. It does kind of paint this ideal love story in your head.” At some point, she says, she decided to opt out of the family-approved “timeline of life, which goes birth, school, university, find a job, fall in love, get married, have kids. I feel like [for my parents] you turned 28, and people would look at you: ‘Why aren’t you in a relationship yet? Why haven’t you got kids? What’s wrong with you?’ Whereas now – it’s seen as being OK to be selfish. It’s OK to want to better yourself first, before you decide to bring other people into the world.” Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’” How did you feel? “I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.” And when you got there? “It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.” There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference. Lipa told them: “I wanna go back. I wanna go to Sylvia Young [theatre school] on Saturdays. I wanna be in the place where things are happening.” It has become a part of her approved sleeve-notes history, that the reason Lipa begged to return to London was because she was pining for music stardom. Hearing this, I always worried it was a bit neat – publicist-penned, maybe. Because what teenager persuades their parents to let them move 1,500 miles on the wild, one-in-a-million chance of them making it as a pop star? Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.” You weren’t telling yourself that at 14… “I was. Absolutely.” OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14… Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud. For the most part, Lipa says, she was well behaved in this minimally chaperoned period; only one near arrest, when she and some mates were told off by a policeman for throwing bubble-bath out of a window. “Honestly? I was a really good kid. I knew how terrified my parents were to let me do my thing. And I didn’t want to let them down – partly because I didn’t want them to move to London to look after me. My little sister and brother [Rina and Gjin, now 17 and 12] were just settling in school in Pristina. I didn’t want to separate the family. And I felt confident. Self-assured. I had a good relationship with my parents. They trusted me.” As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos. Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight. She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage and two very different speeches. The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that stage.” Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreams/magic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff? Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.” She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms. “For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.” Dua Lipa is on tour now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/12/vulnerable-eu-citizens-risk-failing-to-secure-right-to-remain-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T07:13:19Z","webTitle":"Vulnerable EU citizens risk failing to secure right to remain in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/12/vulnerable-eu-citizens-risk-failing-to-secure-right-to-remain-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/12/vulnerable-eu-citizens-risk-failing-to-secure-right-to-remain-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Vulnerable EU citizens risk failing to secure right to remain in UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vulnerable EU citizens including the elderly, children in care and victims of domestic abuse are particularly at risk of failing to secure the right to remain in the UK after Brexit, academics have warned. As the UK draws closer to departure from the bloc, the government is developing a system to give EU citizens already living in the UK “settled status”. But a “potentially significant” number of people may not be aware that they need to apply, including tens of thousands of children, the Oxford University-based Migration Observatory said, warning that the government will need to ensure that those eligible are well-informed. The Home Office said it was planning a range of support for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and families, victims of domestic violence, and those with English as a second language. Children in care are singled out by the academics as being particularly vulnerable as they may not have support completing an application and may have difficulty producing evidence of residence if they have moved frequently between foster homes and schools. Others at risk have specific vulnerabilities, such as 50,000 female domestic abuse victims, who may also miss out on the procedure, the Migration Observatory said. In a report, titled “Unsettled Status? Which EU Citizens are at Risk of Failing to Secure their Rights after Brexit?”, the migration experts said others may struggle to navigate the application process, including nearly 60,000 aged 75 and over and those without access to the internet. Others who may struggle include the disabled, those with dementia, and about 250,000 who struggle with the English language. EU citizens living in the UK are on average highly educated and should not be expected to have problems, the academics add, but if they have more than one of the vulnerabilities described, it will put them at risk of falling out of the process. There are about 3.4 million non-Irish EU citizens living in the UK, the vast majority of whom should be eligible for settled status, they said. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said: “The Home Office is clearly keen to create a system that is easy and straightforward to use, and most EU citizens should be able to sail through a simplified application process with little difficulty. “But for a minority of people, the process will be more difficult. Many of these are already society’s most vulnerable – whether it is because they are socially isolated, have been victims of exploitation, or face personal barriers such as mental health or poverty.” The Migration Observatory research is based on what has been negotiated so far about the EU-UK agreement on rights for EU citizens and their families. The report comes just weeks after migration experts warned that children of two EU citizens may not be eligible to get British passports even if they were born in Britain. People who, by 31 December 2020, have been continuously and “lawfully living” in the UK for five years will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by acquiring settled status. Those who will not have been living here for five years when the UK leaves the EU will be able to apply to stay until they have reached that five-year threshold. Then they too can also apply for settled status. Ministers have previously said the application process will include an online form of six to eight questions, cost no more than that charged for a British passport – currently £75.50 – and should deliver a decision within two weeks of the application being submitted. It is understood that the Home Office could make a mobile app available for the process. The government has pledged that the process will be “streamlined, low-cost and user-friendly”. But the Migration Observatory has warned the government faces a challenge in raising awareness about the need to apply. If the deadline is strictly enforced, and a significant number of eligible people do not apply, the number of illegally resident EU-nationals in the UK could rise. Sumption said: “Perhaps the biggest challenge if the government aims to include all EU citizens in the settled status process is awareness. It’s possible that many people simply won’t realise that they need to apply. “We know from other government programmes like child benefit that people often don’t apply for something even when it’s really in their interests to do so. When the deadline arrives, people who haven’t applied lose their legal status. This means that one of the biggest policy questions is what will happen to people who were eligible but didn’t apply in time.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are well aware of the challenges of ensuring that 3 million EU citizens and their family members living here understand the need to apply and have the ability to. That is why we have already launched a national awareness campaign, are holding monthly meetings with EU citizens’ representatives to understand their needs and are planning a range of support for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and families, victims of domestic violence and those with English as a second language. “We will be setting out further details before the summer and EU citizens will have plenty of time to make an application. But we have also been clear that we will exercise discretion if there are good reasons why someone has not been able to make an application before the June 2021 deadline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/10/the-fall-of-gondolin-new-jrr-tolkien-book-to-be-published-in-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:11:02Z","webTitle":"The Fall of Gondolin, 'new' JRR Tolkien book, to be published in 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/10/the-fall-of-gondolin-new-jrr-tolkien-book-to-be-published-in-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/10/the-fall-of-gondolin-new-jrr-tolkien-book-to-be-published-in-2018","fields":{"headline":"The Fall of Gondolin, 'new' JRR Tolkien book, to be published in 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"JRR Tolkien’s The Fall of Gondolin, his tale of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces which The Lord of the Rings author called “the first real story” of Middle-earth, will be published in August. The Fall of Gondolin will be the second “new” Tolkien work to be released in two years, following the release of Beren and Lúthien in May 2017. Edited by Tolkien’s son Christopher Tolkien, and illustrated by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings artist Alan Lee, its announcement came as a surprise even to Tolkien scholars: Christopher Tolkien, who is now 93, had described Beren and Lúthien in a preface as “(presumptively) my last book in the long series of editions of my father’s writings”. “That preface had a certain valedictory quality to it – he was reminiscing about his first encounter with his father’s work,” said John Garth, author of Tolkien and the Great War. “But here it is.” Garth said the story was written by Tolkien while he was in hospital and convalescing directly after the Battle of the Somme. “It’s a quest story with a reluctant hero who turns into a genuine hero – it’s a template for everything Tolkien wrote afterwards,” he said. “It has a dark lord, our first encounter with orcs and balrogs – it’s really Tolkien limbering up for what he would be doing later.” The book, said publisher HarperCollins, sets the “uttermost evil” of Morgoth against the sea-god Ulmo. Morgoth is trying to discover and destroy the hidden city of Gondolin, while Ulmo is supporting the Noldor, the kindred of the elves who live in the city. The story follows one of the Noldor, Tuor, who sets out to find Gondolin; during his journey, he experiences what the publisher described as “one of the most arresting moments in the history of Middle-earth”: when Ulmo, the sea-god, rises out of the ocean during a storm. When Tuor arrives in Gondolin, he becomes a great man and the father of Eärendel, an important character in Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. But Morgoth attacks, with Balrogs, dragons and orcs, and as the city falls, Tuor, his wife Idril and the child Eärendel escape, “looking back from a cleft in the mountains as they flee southward, at the blazing wreckage of their city”. “They were journeying into a new story, the Tale of Eärendel, which Tolkien never wrote, but which is sketched out in this book from other sources,” said HarperCollins. Garth said The Fall of Gondolin contains Tolkien’s “biggest battle narrative outside of The Lord of the Rings”, but he predicted the “capstone” of the book would be the “exquisite” piece of writing in which Tolkien attempted to tell the whole story again, in the novelistic style of The Lord of the Rings. “In the first [finished version] of the story, you feel like you’re reading The Iliad,” he said. “This one [which is unfinished], is more naturalistic.” According to HarperCollins, Tolkien saw The Fall of Gondolin as one of his three “great tales” of the Elder Days, along with Beren and Lúthien and The Children of Húrin. The latter title was also a bestseller, after Christopher Tolkien completed the text left behind by his father and published it in 2007."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/cocktail-of-the-week-martello-halls-little-red-door","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: Martello Hall's Little red door","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/cocktail-of-the-week-martello-halls-little-red-door","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/20/cocktail-of-the-week-martello-halls-little-red-door","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: Martello Hall's Little red door","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lambrusco is having a bit of a moment, though by “lambrusco” we don’t mean that super-sweet, super-fizzy, super-cheap stuff you get in the supermarket, but the real McCoy: look for anything labelled lambrusco classico.

Sustainable management of fish stocks would require limits on fishing for several years, as the current EU policies allow catches greater than populations of some key species can readily recover from, but within about seven to 10 years of setting its own policies the UK could be reaping the benefits, according to Oceana, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on fishing. However, this outcome would depend not just on the government agreeing to impose smaller catches on fishing fleets for several years, but also on reaching a suitable agreement with other European nations, because many of the UK’s fishing grounds are shared. Allowing stocks to recover would enable fishing fleets to increase their catch by more than 150,000 tonnes a year, with net profits more than doubling to more than £80m a year, according to the Oceana analysis. Under the common fisheries policy (CFP) of the EU, the UK’s fleet has diminished, and currently accounts for about 11,000 jobs. This is partly because of the way in which successive British governments have interpreted the EU rules, which has allowed bigger vessels – many of them owned overseas, rather than in the UK – to dominate. About two-thirds of the UK’s quota is awarded to three multinational companies. If the government awarded more of the CFP quota to smaller vessels, more jobs could be created in the UK. Fishing has become a loaded issue in the Brexit talks, far beyond its economic weight, with pro-Brexit figures such as Nigel Farage leading publicity stunts in the Thames outside parliament intended to illustrate the difficulties faced by the UK’s fishing fleet. The government, including pro-Brexit environment secretary Michael Gove, was recently criticised for agreeing as part of the Brexit talks to stay within the CFP until 2021. Paul Keenlyside, political adviser at Greenpeace, said the government could take action regardless of Brexit. “Many inshore fishermen have been left high and dry, but the blame lies much closer to Westminster than Brussels. It is the UK government that decides how to share out Britain’s slice of fishing quota to our fleet, not the EU, and for decades they got it completely wrong. Thanks to this mismanagement, local fishermen now have access to just 6% of the UK’s fishing rights, despite making up the vast majority of the fleet.” On Tuesday, civil society groups including Our Fish, Seas at Risk and WeMove.EU called on the EU to follow through on its promises made over many years to end overfishing by 2020. They said at least 30% of the EU’s seas should be designated as “marine protected areas” to protect fish stocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/russian-officials-warn-of-possible-military-clash-with-us-over-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T13:20:33Z","webTitle":"Russian officials warn of possible military clash with US over Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/russian-officials-warn-of-possible-military-clash-with-us-over-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/russian-officials-warn-of-possible-military-clash-with-us-over-syria","fields":{"headline":"Russian officials warn of possible military clash with US over Syria","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian officials and analysts have warned of the dangers of a military clash with the United States if Donald Trump orders a military strike in Syria in response to the chemical attack in rebel-held Douma at the weekend. One Russian politician involved in defence policy called it the most dangerous moment in US-Russian relations since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. The chief of staff of Russia’s armed forces said last month that Russia would shoot down incoming missiles and attack their launching platforms if a US strike on Syria threatened Russian military personnel. “The US and Russia are now closer to a direct collision between their military forces than at any time since the cold war,” Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Centre and a former Soviet military officer, wrote on Monday. “The only question on my mind: will Russia hit back at the US when it launches strikes against Damascus?” Similar concerns of a direct clash were raised after the Khan Sheikhun chemical attack that killed dozens of people a year ago, when Trump ordered a Tomahawk missile strike against the Syrian regime’s al-Shayrat airbase. Russian forces did not engage the US Tomahawk missiles using its air defence systems stationed in the region, either because they would have been ineffective in repelling the attack or because they had been told to stand down. The US gave Russia advance warning of that attack through a deconfliction notice. Russian military brass have signalled that the response may be different this time. In March, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, said that if the US sought to strike Syria in response to a chemical attack, Russia would use its air defence systems and other weapons to respond in case of a threat to Russian servicemen in the region. Gerasimov said Russian military advisers and members of several Russian missions to Syria, including military police and conflict resolution specialists, were based in Damascus at the headquarters of the Syrian defence ministry and at other Syrian military sites. “In the case of a threat to the lives of our servicemen, the Russian military armed forces will take response measures against both the rockets, and the platforms from which they’re fired,” he said. Moscow has made similar threats in the past, including last September as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces troops met Russian-backed Syrian government forces on territory held by Islamic State in eastern Syria. On Tuesday the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would propose a UN security council resolution on investigating the chemical attack in Douma, which Syrian forces have denied carrying out. Russia has previously vetoed a joint investigative mechanism between the OPCW and the UN into chemical attacks in Syria, citing bias. Lavrov’s deputy, Mikhail Bogdanov, called the threat of a strike “extremely dangerous” but said he did not think a direct military clash with the US was likely. “I think it does not exist,” he told journalists. “I believe that common sense should prevail over insanity.” On Monday Trump promised “major decisions” by Wednesday on a response to the Douma attack. Russian officials at the UN have said both that there is no evidence any chemical attack took place and that it was a “false flag” provocation to give a pretext for the US to launch strikes. The USS Donald Cook, a guided missile destroyer, was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean this week after a port call in Cyprus. The Black Sea fleet announced on Tuesday that crews manning its advanced S-400 air defence systems were holding training drills. A former Russian admiral told Interfax that the ship’s presence was “an escalation” but he believed the US was mainly trying to scare Russia. “I think that the United States will not openly decide to launch a strike against Syria with our ships and submarines in the Mediterranean Sea, along with the recent warning issued by our chief of staff [Gerasimov],” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/12/great-city-parks-around-the-world-readers-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:18:23Z","webTitle":"Green and gold: great city parks around the world – readers’ tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/12/great-city-parks-around-the-world-readers-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/12/great-city-parks-around-the-world-readers-tips","fields":{"headline":"Green and gold: great city parks around the world – readers’ tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Winning tip: Frogner Park, Oslo In a notoriously expensive city, this free park a 40 minute walk from the centre of Oslo is both a luscious green expanse and an open-air art exhibition. Designed by 20th-century sculptor Gustav Vigeland, it is home to over 200 statues of people running, dancing, arguing, hugging, and more besides, laid out in a moving Wheel of Life.

There are cycling trails, gardens and ponds, and the opportunity for outdoor activities such as skating and jogging. The park’s trees burst into flower during cherry blossom season, and thousands of people head there to enjoy hanami picnics. What sets the park apart is the opportunity to witness numerous cosplayers, fashionistas, street artists and rockabilly dancers who gather on Sundays in full 1950s attire to perform to Elvis tracks near the Harajuku entrance. cr7364 Jingshan Park, Beijing Just across the road from the northern gate of the Forbidden City is Jingshan Park. It costs about 30p to enter, but the view from the pavilion atop the artificial hill is magnificent. It offers the best views of the Forbidden City and the nearby Beihai pagoda and park, and if you visit in winter you should also see ice skaters on the Shichahai lakes. As with most Chinese parks, you are also likely to find locals singing, dancing or practising Tai Chi.

What few people seem to know about is the elevated walkway from Lumpini, through quiet communities, along a canal and over the expressway to Benjakitti park, which has a large lake in landscaped gardens, with a running and cycling path. The elevated walkway is accessible to bicycles too, and offers the chance to see into some typical Thai urban backstreets, while doubling your park experience. It’s particularly useful for those who want a quiet way to walk from Lumpini to the Asoke area, or runners looking for more than just endless loops of Lumpini. The walkway is in the far north-east corner of Lumpini park.

Al-Bidda, Arumailah and Wadi-Al-Sail parks are replete with flowering shrubs, wild grasses and leafy trees interspersed with canopied walkways, shaded play areas and fountains. Al-Bidda was reopened in February. Walking, running and cycling tracks wind round free-to-use tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, and open-air gyms. After doing its almost 200 hectares, you’ll fancy a rest, and there are loads of benches dotted around. You’ll also work up an appetite. Cafes have yet to open, but there are barbecuing stations throughout. Clean and free toilet facilities are an added boon. There are no fences and it appears to be open 24 hours. We left at 10.30pm and families were still arriving. sandandc Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines A vast green oasis filled with history in the middle of Manila, Rizal Park contains a full-size diorama of the execution by firing squad of a national martyr. Erected on the exact spot where the Spanish shot independence activist and ophthalmologist José Rizal in 1896, it can be reached following the brass footsteps that begin at Fort Santiago’s old prison and which trace Rizal’s last walk. The park contains other markers for the executed, alongside an avenue of busts honouring many national heroes, a giant statue of Lapu-Lapu, a 16th-century warrior who fought the Spanish, a planetarium, two national museums, a Japanese garden, a Chinese garden, musical fountains and a lake containing a large 3D relief map of the Philippines and its many islands. The park provides a haven for locals and tourists, attracting a rich diversity of people and Asian cultures. Ian Conrich Turia Gardens, Valencia Running right through the heart of Valencia, the Turia Gardens once contained the Turia river. In 1969, to prevent flooding, the river was diverted and the old river bed was converted into a park sunken into the city. It runs for 9km and contains orange trees, sports facilities and playgrounds (including a large-scale Gulliver for children to clamber over). Hire a bike (BR Bikes, €9 a day, brbikes.es) and cycle from Bioparc Valencia – a zoo park – at the north-western end of the park to the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences near the coast. Lisa Hatfield Parc des Buttes Chaumont, Paris This 25-hectare park in the untouristy north-eastern 19th arrondissement is full of surprises. Opened in 1867, its origins lie in the stone quarries that supplied the material for all those Haussmann avenues. It offers great views over Paris and includes a 30-metre waterfall, a suspension bridge, a lake, a grotto and a temple. The sloped lawns are great for a picnic watching the sun go down with a bottle of wine. For kids there are Les Guignols (the French version of Punch &amp; Judy), pony rides and fair rides – all from another era. For adults there’s the trendy bar Rosa Bonheur in a 1900 guinguette to the north of the park. On the southern fringe there’s a restaurant, Le Pavilion du Lac , in another restored 19th-century building, which has a huge terrace. • equipement.paris.fr Masmingou Park de la Grange, Geneva A glorious park with large grassy hills overlooking the lake as well as the most wonderful rose garden, Park de la Grange also has a brilliant and massive playground for kids of all ages.

Rebecca Matthews Botanical gardens, Chișinău, Moldova If you enjoy visiting places off the beaten track, the Botanic Gardens of the Academy of Sciences in Moldova’s capital city are very rewarding. The park is a massive 76 hectares of green space sandwiched between the grey, concrete apartment blocks of the city. Established by the Russian Academy of Science, it is a ghost of Moldova’s Soviet past. The Moldovan government has let out sections of the park to private companies in an attempt to revitalise it, and there are now playgrounds, cafes and rental bikes within it. Entrance is 10 leu (45p) or 35 leu for a tour (£1.50). • gradinabotanica.asm.md BelfastSchoolgirl Hamilton Gardens, New Zealand This sprawling park on the banks of the Waikato river in the east of Hamilton is the jewel in the crown of this small city. Highlights include the 20 or so themed gardens including Japanese, mid-century modern, Tudor and a traditional Māori garden. Kids love it as much as adults (the mid-century modern garden’s shallow pool is full of paddling toddlers on a hot summer’s day) and there are also a couple of playgrounds. You can also download activity sheets to keep the little ones entertained at hamiltongardens.co.nz.

Visitors can lose themselves in the scent of eucalyptus leaves and wander through a log maze, before soaking their feet in one of the pools. RKrachael Trinity-Bellwoods, Toronto, Canada You’re spoilt for choice when it comes to city parks in Toronto, and while High Park on the outskirts is probably the most popular, it’s the downtown Trinity-Bellwoods that is my favourite. All basic requirements are met – picnic benches, tennis courts, a splash pad for when it’s hot and an ice rink for when it isn’t. Its downtown location means there are plenty of places nearby to grab some food and drink (Dundas St West’s Tampered Press is great). However, it’s the visitors and events that make this park so special, from the farmers’ market and the drum-circle where drummers of all skills and disciplines meet on a Sunday to bang out a beat, to the park’s annual “bed-in” inspired by John and Yoko. Also, keep your eyes peeled for the park’s most famous resident – an albino squirrel. Honestly43 Lincoln Park, Chicago Lincoln Park, behind South Lagoon on the Lake Michigan shoreline, brims with facilities. The most notable is the zoo (free entry all year) which has various sections, including a farm, and a nature trail boardwalk with spectacular views across the city. There’s a huge conservatory showcasing plants from all types of world climates, a butterfly house and a spectacular lily pool. Not only are all attractions free, but there are regular guided tours from Friday to Sunday. In addition, there are seven safe, sandy beaches, including the iconic Oak Street beach, which is framed by skyscrapers and lapped by the lake. bowbank Zilker Metropolitan Park, Austin, Texas This wonderful space is enough reason on its own to visit Austin.

Along the way he also asserted that the company used the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, to lobby for Amazon’s interests. The price of Amazon shares fell on the news. In threatening a single business because of some personal quarrel with its CEO – apparently in order to squeeze friendlier coverage out of a newspaper that the CEO happens to own – Donald Trump has clearly violated the basic rules of democratic government. But it is also important to remember that the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend. Amazon has been the subject of critical reporting for a number of years; anyone who reads the Guardian or the New York Times knows about the company’s alarming labour practices and its imperial economic ambitions. Yet some critics of the president took his tweets as a signal to rally round Amazon and its chief executive. They joked about how jealous Trump must be of Bezos’s billions. They fantasised about how Bezos might contrive to humiliate the president by buying still more media properties. They clucked over Trump’s stupidity on the matter of the postal service. They snickered at his inability to understand modern internet enterprises. Given the chance to remind the public of American liberalism’s instinctive tendency to defend cyber-oligarchs like Bezos against the claims of those it sees as uncomprehending luddites, Team Liberal jumped at it. Along the way, they gave us a vivid reminder of why modern liberalism keeps generating – and losing to – unbelievably awful antagonists such as Trump. Put it this way: yes, Trump hates Amazon, and its chief executive, and his newspaper the Washington Post. But Trump’s blustering animosity doesn’t make Amazon an admirable company. Nor does it make the Washington Post a temple of objectivity, untainted by the capital’s culture of influence-peddling. Take the matter of the postal service’s contract with Amazon – the cause of so much self-assured guffawing among the know-better set. Guess what? The president’s complaint here is kind of legit. While it might be technically correct that the US postal service makes a “profit” on its current arrangement with Amazon, it would also be correct to say that it could easily be making a lot more. If you care about the postal service workforce, maybe you too might want to show some concern about the question rather than brush it off as yet more idiocy from the comb-over caudillo. Or take the larger question of Amazon’s overwhelming and unaccountable market power, which journalists and scholars have documented painstakingly and at great length – and yet which many commentators seem to have forgotten the instant Trump started bad-mouthing Bezos. “Amazon is the shining representative of a new golden age of monopoly,” is how the Atlantic journalist Franklin Foer put it in 2014, and what he said then is even truer today. Confronting concentrated, autocratic economic power is what Democrats used to do. It was the definition of the species. They fought against monopolies in oil and food and transport that ripped off producers with one hand and consumers with the other. But now it’s Trump who, in his clumsy and authoritarian way, is trying to swipe that legacy. I am making a tricky point here, so let me be clear: I don’t like Amazon, and I don’t like Donald Trump either. I would approve enthusiastically if a president started enforcing antitrust laws, but that’s not what Trump is proposing to do. What we are being offered instead is a choice between the worst president of our lifetimes and one of the most rapacious corporate enterprises in the country. And, eagerly, we are lining up with one or the other. This in turn seems to me an almost perfect representation of the wretched choices available to Americans these days, as well as the megadoses of self-deception we are swallowing in order to make them. It is everything that is wrong with our politics, and it extends from the most sweeping matters of state right down to the individual reader. It set off my alarm bells when the would-be monopolist Bezos tangled with the book publisher Hachette in 2014, just after buying the most important news outlet in Washington – but after reading Trump’s bullying tweets on Amazon, I want to like the plucky plutocrat from Seattle. Similarly, I despise what this president is doing to the US – but after watching CNN or reading the Washington Post’s op-ed page I sometimes want to like Trump too.

Age: About six weeks. Appearance: Wild and fervent, and slightly terrifying. Is this about the ancient king of the Franks? No, you’re thinking of Charlemagne. Oh, so it’s about the Mexican monster who drinks the blood of goats? No, that’s Chupacabra. Well, I’m stumped. It’s about Timothée Chalamet, you dummy. He’s a young actor who inspires mania wherever he goes. That sounds like an exaggeration. Well, it isn’t. He is inspiring so much mania that people have literally added “mania” to his name. That only happens with genuine mania. Like Beatlemania, if you will. Or nymphomania. Or megalomania. Well, I was thinking more of Leomania. Remember Leomania? It was when everyone went wild over Leonardo DiCaprio 20 years ago, because of how sexy and cute he was. That’s the sort of mania that Chalamania is. Are you saying that Chalamet is the new DiCaprio? I’m not saying that, but Interview magazine is, in an article headlined: “Is Timothée Chalamet the new Leonardo DiCaprio?” And is he? Sure, he is. He’s a floppy-haired, androgynous young actor with enormous talent, a laidback sense of cool and a name that’s deceptively hard to pronounce. And, like DiCaprio at the very pinnacle of Leomania, he just starred in a juggernaut of a blockbuster. He did? Haven’t you seen Call Me By Your Name? No. Well, it was a gigantic hit. Massive. Everyone was talking about it. No they weren’t. You can’t compare Titanic to Call Me By Your Name. Yes, I can. No, you can’t. Titanic is the second highest-grossing movie ever. Call Me By Your Name is – let me see – the 3,540th. Well, OK, maybe they don’t line up exactly, but Chalamet is still a star on the rise. He has already had an Oscar nomination – he also played the teen hunk in the beloved Lady Bird. His next films will push him into international superstardom. And they are? An Amazon movie about methamphetamine addiction and – yeesh – Woody Allen’s next film. OK, so neither are going to be Chalamet’s Titanic, but give it two years and he’ll be the most famous actor on the planet, his fame so suffocating that it will lead to public tantrums and drug addiction. Only then will I rest in my ridiculous worship of him.

According to him, there was a time between the 1920s and 1940s when football-loving Mancunians would watch whichever Manchester team happened to be at home on a given Saturday, so would take in United’s match one week and City’s game the next. If half-and-half scarves had been around back then, many chaps would have worn them along with their fedoras and knitted double-breasted sweaters without fear of being abused by Proper Fan fundamentalists on numerous social media abominations. Those were the days, says Weird Uncle Fiver, pouring wistfully from his hip-flask into his Tin. Divisions hardened thereafter, of course, and by the time the 1970s came round, there was bitterness between even the players of United and City. One clash from 1970 is remembered for a vivisectionist tackle on Glyn Pardoe by the famous hatchetman George Best. And in 1974 a derby had to be temporarily halted by the referee until Lou Macari and Mike Doyle simmered down enough to be able to storm off the pitch after being red carded. And now here we are in the present, preparing for the 176th Manchester derby and wondering whether United can possibly make things more unpleasant for City than Liverpool did on Wednesday. José Mourinho is capable of trying to spoil the spectacle and maybe of scrounging the draw that would delay City’s title party, but can he go so far as to add to City’s painful week by actually winning at the Etihad? That’s what The Fiver is asking, pouring wistfully from our hip-flask into our Tin. Did Liverpool teach Mourinho how to beat Guardiola’s team? “No,” answered Mourinho when asked that question by a proper journalist at his press conference on Friday. “No,” answered Mourinho again when asked the same question again in a slightly different way. Canny proper journalists! And canny Guardiola, for when he was asked how City intend to celebrate if they clinch the title against their closest rivals, he resisted giving Mourinho ammunition and replied: “I don’t want to talk about celebrations.” It could be argued – and therefore will be by The Fiver – that if Guardiola were really canny, he would omit all his first-choice players for Saturday’s match, simultaneously belittling United and resting his key men for Tuesday’s second leg against Liverpool. Maybe he hasn’t thought of that. But Jürgen Klopp’s line-up against Everton in Saturday’s early derby kick-off might just give him the idea. QUOTE OF THE DAY “EFL regulations do not prohibit the provision of subsistence and as long as the club adopts a consistent approach for all matches, and arrangements are not linked to success on the pitch, the club can continue to make appropriate provision” – an EFL suit serves up an early contender for most needlessly officious statement of the year, which allows (with conditions) Accrington Stanley’s owner to continue buying his team burgers.

The promotional game is supposed to be for adults, but “sweeps up children because children are part of the family. This is essentially a price promotion for high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar foods.” McDonald’s Monopoly has been running, on and off, since the 1980s in the United States and sometimes the UK. Selected food items have peel-off labels attached. Some are for “instant wins”, which can include a games console, entry to a paintball game or a fashion voucher, but more often will be food. Other labels bear the name and colours of the properties on a Monopoly board. The biggest prize is for four people who manage to collect both Mayfair and Park Lane, which will win them £100,000. The promotion applies to certain meals, some of which are high in calories. The Big Tasty contains 799 calories and the Big Tasty With Bacon 850 calories. A regular Cadbury Caramel McFlurry (ice cream with caramel sauce and chocolate) has 379 calories and 51g of sugar, which is 57% of an adult’s daily recommended intake, while the Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry has 375 calories and 54g sugar, which is 60%. Larger meals and portions of fries have a triple-prize label, while the medium portions have double labels, incentivising customers to “go large” and increase their chances of a win. The same difference is seen between large and medium Coca-Colas. There are about 25m instant food prizes to be given away. These include 1.5m each of Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets, but the biggest category is desserts. There are 11.7m apple pies or sundaes to be given away, as well as 4m sugar doughnuts or chocolate muffins. The healthiest prize on the menu is a fruit bag, but the 5.6m winners will have the alternative option of an ice cream cone. Public health and anti-obesity campaigners have been pressing for more control over the advertising and marketing of unhealthy foods, such as with “buy one get one free” promotions in supermarkets, and warning of stealth advertising through children’s internet games on smartphones. Viner also pointed out that McDonald’s foods cannot be advertised on children’s television due to their fat, salt and sugar content. “They do a lot of advertising of the brand to get around that, showing smiley, happy kids,” he said. “They don’t show them eating so they don’t fall foul of the restrictions.” The Royal College and other public health bodies have been calling for fast-food adverts to be banned before 9pm because of the numbers of children who watch during family programmes such as The Voice and The X Factor. McDonald’s Monopoly is for over-18s, according to the website, which asks for the year of birth of anyone who accesses the game online. But parents buy McDonald’s meals for children, who may then win sugary drinks and desserts. “McDonald’s wants a monopoly on people’s wallets and purses,” said Kath Dalmeny, CEO of Sustain, an alliance for better food and farming that includes the Children’s Food Campaign. “Attracting new customers is hard, so food companies like McDonald’s cajole existing customers to spend more each visit. Unfortunately, in the process of collecting sets of toys and games, people are also being drip-fed the idea that a McDonald’s meal isn’t complete without bigger portions and a pudding. “We have heard this week that obesity-related hospital admissions have risen by 18% over just one year. It’s time for an end to promotions that can add hundreds of unplanned sugary calories to each visit.” Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar, said: “This is a clear example of how McDonald’s is putting profit before the health of its customers by seducing them to eat more food and drink loaded with fat, sugar and salt in order to be in with a chance of winning a prize. There should be stricter controls in place preventing such irresponsible promotions and more focus on healthier options.” A McDonald’s spokesman said the promotion, this year called Monopoly Wiiiin!, was one of its most popular and now in its 13th year. “As the competition evolves so do the menu items involved, and this year Monopoly Wiiiin! stickers can be claimed on a number of menu items included in our under 400 and 600 calorie meal bundles such as Premium Salads, Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legend,” he said. “We provide clear nutritional information, at point of sale and on tray liners, to help our customers make informed choices, and our menu has evolved over the years so it provides more choice than ever, from salads, to wraps, to coffee, to fruit bags. Our support for Public Health England’s One You campaign, to provide meal options of 400 and 600 calories, is an extension of this, and part of our ongoing commitment to continue to work in partnership to help people confidently make informed choices about what they eat at McDonald’s.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/06/pee-and-pesticides-henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-in-trouble-warn-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:17:51Z","webTitle":"Pee and pesticides: Thoreau's Walden Pond in trouble, warn scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/06/pee-and-pesticides-henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-in-trouble-warn-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/06/pee-and-pesticides-henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-in-trouble-warn-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Pee and pesticides: Thoreau's Walden Pond in trouble, warn scientists","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The water of Walden Pond, which Henry David Thoreau described in 1854 as “so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of 25 or 30 feet”, is no longer quite so clear according to a new study. The Massachusetts pond was made famous in Walden, the transcendentalist writer’s account of the years he spent next to it in order to “live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life”. The pond has been greatly affected by human activity. Everything from forest fires in the 19th century, to wood-cutting operations, the use of pesticides in the 1960s and increasing tourism have affected the water quality, according to the paper. Over half of the phosphorus in the lake in the summer “may now be attributable to urine released by swimmers”, while a footpath to Thoreau’s cabin “caused large amounts of soil to wash into the lake”. “In the century and a half since Thoreau and his transcendentalist colleagues wrote of humanity as somehow separate from nature, we’ve become a force of nature in our own right, powerful enough to change the chemistry and temperature of the atmosphere and the ecology of lakes and ponds worldwide,” Curt Stager, a natural sciences professor at Paul Smith’s college, New York, and one of the authors of the paper told CNET. Stager and his fellow researchers analysed sediment from the pond to determine how the growth of algae has changed. Their research revealed that the major changes in the lake’s algae happened in the 20th century. The closure of a nearby landfill site, the stabilisation of the shoreline and the upgrading of septic facilities have mitigated the effects of humans on the lake since 2000, but the researchers warn that the pond has not returned to the state described by Thoreau. Writing in the mid-19th century, Thoreau referred to the “crystalline purity” of the pond, to its “remarkable transparency” and its “pure and well-like character”. “Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as ever,” he wrote. “Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them … It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.” The researchers warn that the lake would likely be further affected by climate change. “The sediment darkening and high percentages of [algae] in the recent sediments of Walden Pond … indicate not only that the lake ecosystem is now quite different from that described by Thoreau but also that it may be primed for more severe reductions in water clarity in a warming future.” Increasing temperatures in coming decades, for instance, could also increase recreational use of the lake in summer, add researchers, who suggest that a nearby swimming pool would “relieve pressure on the lake”. “If we’re not careful, this beautiful, iconic lake … could easily become more like a murky, green stew of algae,” Stager told CNET."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/06/roseanne-barr-donald-trump-conners-sitcom","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T11:08:18Z","webTitle":"Roseanne backs Trump.

But don’t let that put you off her show","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Watching the new season of the TV sitcom Roseanne, which rebooted in the US last month after a 20-year hiatus, has been like finding an old school friend on Facebook: full of affection and nostalgia and thrilling suspense as one waits to discover if she turned out to be awful. In the case of Roseanne Barr, that question had already been answered in pre-publicity for the show in a way that, for many people, left no room for doubt or discussion: Trump supporter, case closed. There is something inherently amusing about raising the Wagner/TS Eliot question – can one admire a piece of art while despising the artist? – about a sitcom. Not to denigrate the form, exactly, but the Conners’ iconic crochet-covered couch has never seemed so bathetic. The first two episodes were funny, charming and clever. Roseanne was sly and arch, as one remembered her to be, showing us that with a better haircut, a 65-year-old can look younger than she did at 40. Sara Gilbert’s Darlene was adorably sour; Jackie was, as ever, sublimely played by Laurie Metcalf; and Dan was Dan. And then there was Trump. “What’s up, deplorable?” says Jackie, dressed in a pink pussy hat, the words “Nasty Woman” emblazoned across her T-shirt as she greets her sister for the first time since the election. Barr herself has presented the show’s political positioning as a potential act of reconciliation along the lines of, why can’t we get together and laugh at our differences? And the political jokes, although the most strained of the script, did feel somewhat cathartic. Roseanne gets in inevitable references to snowflakes; Jackie brings Russian salad dressing for dinner. Watching the show felt like that rare thing, a place where both sides could hang out. The problem, obviously, is Roseanne herself. Choosing to make Roseanne Conner a Trump supporter was a smart dramatic choice, and a plausible one too, but it does leave one wondering about the politics. Onscreen, she is charming and reasonable (“He talked about jobs, Jackie,” Roseanne Conner says desperately to her sister of why she voted for Trump); the palatable face of an ugly political movement. In real life, or at least on social media, Roseanne Barr has a significantly less amenable presence. Many of Barr’s old tweets have been deleted, but for a while now she has been a reliable disseminator of nutty pro-Trump conspiracy theories and a general amplifier of the lunatic fringe. In a bad-tempered interview with the New York Times last month, Barr said it was her idea for Roseanne to back Trump, “because it’s an accurate portrayal of these people and people like them”. But by the standards of her own Twitter output, this isn’t quite true. Trump rang to congratulate Barr on the ratings – 18.2 million for the debut episode, so the series has already been renewed for a second season. She was purported to be thrilled by the call, and that soured the good feelings many had for her coming out of the show. And yet the show is still good. Writing a hit clearly matters more to Barr than politics and, to that end, Roseanne is not a propaganda piece. It works artistically because it is rooted in something Twitter personas can’t get at: the humanity of the other side. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/06/co-op-plans-to-take-over-failing-schools-in-north-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T13:24:42Z","webTitle":"Co-op plans to take over failing schools in north of England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/06/co-op-plans-to-take-over-failing-schools-in-north-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/06/co-op-plans-to-take-over-failing-schools-in-north-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Co-op plans to take over failing schools in north of England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Co-op is planning a major push into running schools after its exit from banking helped the group bounce back into the black. The mutual is to invest £3.5m in expanding academies from 12 to 40 over three years with a plan to take over failing schools in the north of England. The Co-op, which includes funeral parlours, grocery stores and financial services, made a profit of £72m in the year to 6 January, swinging back from a £132m loss in the previous year, which reflected the £185m writedown of its stake in the Co-operative bank to nil. The group sold its final stake in the bank in the autumn. Total sales remained stable at £9.5bn as sales at its established grocery stores rose 3.4%. Grocery sales were flat at £7.1bn after dozens of larger stores were sold. Funeral services and will writing revenues rose by 4% to £343m while insurance revenues slid from £439m to £331m as the result of a new reinsurance contract. Steve Murrells, group chief executive who took charge last year, said he wanted to drive growth by creating a more commercial Co-op that also had a “distinctive voice in society”. He said that a big expansion into schools was part of showing how the Co-op did things differently. “We need a vibrant, commercially successful business and the more successful they are the more we can do in society,” he said. “The academy investment is exactly that playing out. It is our chance to help in an areas that needs a lot of care.” The Co-op took on its first academy in Manchester in 2010 and now also runs schools in Leeds and Stoke. Murrells said the new schools would be in the north so they could share expertise and because there was more need in that part of the country. “I think education needs our help and we have got a good track record on turning those schools around,” he said. “This is not based on a business case; it is based on doing the right thing.” Murrells insisted that the move would not be a distraction for the business, after finally exiting the bank that had to be rescued from collapse and nearly brought down the Co-op Group in 2013, as they would be run by a “solid management team that are already there and eager to do more”. The schools expansion is likely to raise fears that the Co-op is stretching its management just as it battles to survive in a tough grocery market where discounters Aldi and Lidl are taking an increasing market share. Convenience store chains, which include the Co-op, are facing particular turmoil as the UK’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, takes over major wholesaler Booker, head of the Premier, Londis and Budgens symbol groups, which lend their name and products to independent stores. The Co-op is still awaiting clearance from competition authorities for its planned £143m takeover of the Nisa wholesale and symbol group and is also taking over supply of the Costcutter chain. The Co-op faces an inquiry into its treatment of suppliers by the grocery industry watchdog that could lead to a multimillion pound fine. Murrells said “we don’t feel great about where we find ourselves”, but said the Co-op was already improving its practices and was focused on “ensuring we get things right and come back stronger” in dealing with suppliers. “This is not a crisis, it is not an on-going problem and we will learn quickly and fix it,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/06/bestway-jobs-deal-bargain-booze-owner-conviviality","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T06:47:33Z","webTitle":"Bestway saves 2,000 jobs with Conviviality deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/06/bestway-jobs-deal-bargain-booze-owner-conviviality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/06/bestway-jobs-deal-bargain-booze-owner-conviviality","fields":{"headline":"Bestway saves 2,000 jobs with Conviviality deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"About 2,000 jobs are set to be saved with the buyout of retail chains Wine Rack and Bargain Booze in a £7m deal.

The deal was completed just before midnight on Friday. Matthew Callaghan, partner at PwC, said: “This deal safeguards the jobs of more than 2,000 employees, ensures franchisees have the ability to continue to trade and creates some much-needed stability for business customers and the sector in general. “Alongside the sale of Conviviality’s Direct business earlier this week, the total number of staff whose jobs have been protected stands at more than 4,000.” Bestway, which was founded and is chaired by the billionaire Sir Anwar Pervez, is one of Britain’s biggest food wholesalers serving thousands of retailers; it also owns the Well pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014. Conviviality announced its intention to appoint administrators last week after a string of profit warnings and the discovery of a £30m tax bill, putting more than 2,600 jobs at risk. On Wednesday, Magners owner C&amp;C bought Conviviality’s wholesale arm through a pre-pack administration. The Irish cider giant bought wholesalers Matthew Clark, Bibendum, Catalyst, Peppermint, Elastic and Walker &amp; Wodehouse for a nominal sum. Stella Artois and Budweiser maker AB InBev is also supporting the deal. PwC handled the sale and administration process. Conviviality’s retail arm operates more than 800 stores under brands including chains Select Convenience, Central Convenience and Wine Rack as well as Bargain Booze, many of which are run by independent franchisees. The breakup of Conviviality marks the end of the firm after rapid demise over just a few weeks. The chief executive, Diana Hunter, stepped down last month after shares in the company were suspended at 101p in the wake of two profit warnings in the space of a week that wiped more than 60% off its stock market value. The company blamed the first shock profit warning on a spreadsheet arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins and then admitted it had not budgeted for the £30m tax bill due at the end of March. Conviviality issued a third profit warning as it admitted it needed to ask investors for new funding of £125m to avoid going bust, but failed to convince them of its long-term future. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit after raising questions over the company’s strategy in making a string of rapid acquisitions, including the recent purchase of more than 100 Central Convenience stores from the collapsed Palmer &amp; Harvey business. Meanwhile, the chair of parliament’s work and pensions committee, Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/14/one-to-watch-sasha-sloan-sad-girl","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Sasha Sloan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/14/one-to-watch-sasha-sloan-sad-girl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/14/one-to-watch-sasha-sloan-sad-girl","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Sasha Sloan","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sasha Sloan’s route to purveyor of muted pop majesty is a decidedly modern one. In 2014, the 22-year-old Boston native’s parents decided to paint the front of their family home, lovingly daubing the word “dork” in big letters and underlining it with an arrow pointing to Sloan’s bedroom window. Sloan posted a picture of it to Reddit, where it went viral. Breaking the site’s protocol on self-promotion, she added a link to her Soundcloud page of song sketches in the comments underneath, a move that resulted in her signing a publishing deal, quitting Berklee College of Music (she studied music business) and moving to LA. After a few years struggling in writing sessions (“I was a bit of a jazz nerd, and I didn’t like pop music that much,” she’s said), she started to find her groove, co-writing Camila Cabello’s woozy ballad Never Be the Same. A string of collaborations with various dance producers (Kygo, Odesza, Kaskade) saw her edge nervously towards Sasha Sloan: the Artist, a move solidified by last year’s Ready Yet (7m Spotify plays and counting), an emotionally rich, left-of-centre ode to frayed relationships. Its subdued electronics and sharp, observational lyrics are matched throughout her delicious shrug of a debut EP, the knowingly titled Sad Girl. It’s heavy, songwriting as therapy, but filtered through a pop prism. “Sometimes I don’t even really know I’m feeling something until I’m writing about it,” she says, “and then I’ll write the song and be like: ‘Oh, shit.

Harbingers of gentrification. Often, a way for big brands to show how spontaneous and funky they are, bro, while testing out a new revenue stream, and capitalising on cultural trends. Even the word is annoying. Pop-up. Like a book for people who don’t like books, or a freaky toy in a horror film. You know what else pops up? A rash. Then I was invited to a supper club run by a refugee – Imad’s Choose Love Syrian Kitchen, which demonstrated the flexible, responsive advantages of pop-ups so convincingly, I changed my mind about everything I previously thought. It happens a lot. “I took a wrong turning on the way, because I was cold,” I say to Imad Alarnab, a man who escaped bombing, and made his way to this country through nine others, sometimes on foot. Luckily, he is a large, warm man who laughs a lot. Alarnab was a star chef in Damascus, owner of three restaurants, as well as juice bars and cafes. His “almost perfect” life was made less perfect by the arrival of civil war, but now that he is here, he wants to help those left behind. The proceeds from this weekly event, run with the charity Help Refugees, directly fund Hope Hospital, a paediatric facility and the only hospital in northern Aleppo. The hospital will close in one month without the support. Never has the phrase “Can we have the bill” seemed so fraught. The food is wonderful, and I’m not just saying that. Three courses of Syrian cuisine, involving many starters, baba ghanoush, salads and flatbreads, served as a communal feast. Alarnab’s personal touches lighten the dishes and keep them accessible. His chicken and freekeh lamb are meltingly tender. One dip, made from roasted peppers and aubergine, is as astonishingly good as it is unimaginatively labelled. “The smoked dip! If someone can come up with a name for it, that would be great,” he laughs. (I suggested Red Sauce at Night, Diner’s Delight but never heard back. Rude.) The scale of the humanitarian disaster in Syria often feels paralysing. Help Refugees saw a situation that needed help immediately. Within weeks, this kitchen was up and running, staffed by volunteers, with the money going straight to Hope. And of course, they lucked out with such a charismatic figure at the hob. Incidentally, the charity first became aware of Alarnab when he was living on the steps of a church near the Calais jungle, feeding a crowd of people every day. Draw your own parallels, yeah? Let’s keep this understated. The point is, I am also doing my bit, by turning up and stuffing my face with potato salad. Not all heroes wear capes, although a bib would come in handy. I urge anyone who can make the journey to 134 Columbia Road in London to do so. Eat a falafel, save a life – if that isn’t the deal of the century, show me what is. Imad’s Choose Love Syrian Kitchen will run until the end of the month, but if successful, can stay open longer. Sometimes a pop-up deserves to stay popped up. The Bollywood star and the killing of a couple of sacred deer Last week, bodybuilding Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was sentenced to five years in jail for poaching, having been convicted of shooting two endangered blackbucks while out on a drive with other actors. It would have been funnier if he’d been sent down for fishing without a permit. You know, because of his name. He may not be a household figure here, but that’s only because you’re racist. I’m kidding. But he is the ninth-highest paid actor in the world, according to Forbes’ 2017 figures. That’s only two places below Tom Cruise. Samuel L Jackson only made No 13. This is like Tom Hanks doing bird for ivory crime, or Vin Diesel smuggling endangered horn. It’s a huge scandal, particularly if you have Indian family. I text my mum, to get a grassroots response to the story. “Salman Khan prison five years for shooting a deer. What you think?” Within 30 seconds, the fastest she has ever replied, a response. “Fake news.” It’s not so much fake, as old news. The case has lumbered along since 1998 and, over the years, a beleaguered Khan has submitted various accounts of the incident, including that the antelope died from stray dog bites, or “overeating and jumping”. That’s a weird combination of activities. Like snacking and ducking. Or swimming and rapping. Of course, the ungulate and its family have my sympathy, more than any celebrity. Justice would best be served by the case never being fully resolved, so that the actor’s roles become dominated by this one bizarre courtroom drama, which costs millions, and in which every year he’s forced to put forward a more detailed, hilarious account of what happened that night. Maybe he’ll resort to singing his defences, to make them more plausible. Shirtless. It wouldn’t be Bollywood otherwise. The not so humble bumblebee Scientists are supergluing trackable QR codes to the backs of common bumblebees, hoping to gain a better understanding of their complex social behaviour. The news has many obvious points of interest for fans of the humble bumble, none of which has delighted me as much as discovering the latin name of one variety. Bombus impatiens. “This is the third time you’re late this week, and I am growing very BOMBUS IMPATIENS.” The words sound like a Harry Potter spell, and it is scientifically impossible to remain in a bad mood when saying them aloud.

A quarter of premature deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease (heart attacks and strokes) and an estimated 50-80% of them are preventable. So any checks that could help early detection are surely a good thing. Dr Matt Kearney, a GP and the national clinical director for cardiovascular disease prevention, welcomes the growing trend for people to take control of their own health, but he says that the challenge is judging which tests are likely to do more harm than good. “We should democratise health information so everyone has access to it; doctors need to welcome people knowing more and help them to navigate options. Screening is attractive to individuals who look for reassurance that they’re healthy.” The NHS offers a health check every five years to everyone aged between 40 and 74 to pick up early signs of stroke risk, diabetes, dementia, and heart and kidney disease. Kearney says there is a clear rationale for these checkups, despite criticisms that they pander to the worried well, are a waste of resources and lack clear evidence of effectiveness. “We don’t have evidence of long-term benefits yet,” he says, “although initial reports are encouraging. However, the tests and interventions in the NHS checkup are all evidence-based. The alternative would be to do nothing – but we have an epidemic of preventable ill health, such as diabetes, so we need to do something now.” The scale of undetected conditions such as high blood pressure is enormous. The British Heart Foundation estimates that seven million UK citizens have undiagnosed high blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease or a stroke. Kearney says that, of the 1.5 million adults in England who have taken up the NHS health check, one in 27 were found to have high blood pressure of which they were previously unaware. Of course, the next step is to make sure that, once detected, it is treated; 40% of people with diagnosed high blood pressure don’t achieve optimal targets. But better detection and treatment could prevent an estimated 14,500 strokes and 9,710 heart attacks in England over the next three years. The risk factors that commonly available checks are trying to identify are high blood pressure, poor diet, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, alcohol and drugs, poor kidney function, lack of exercise and air pollution. To help achieve this, and improve uptake, Kearney wants the standard NHS health check to be available in public places, such as leisure and shopping centres and for pharmacists and a range of healthcare professionals to be on hand if tests flag up problems. Then there are national screening programmes for early detection of cervical, breast and bowel cancer, as well as aortic aneurysms. But what if you are too young or too old for the NHS check – or have worries, but have been checked recently? And what about rarer conditions, such as thyroid cancer or brain tumours? Should people who worry about these go for a full MOT, complete with whole body scan, blood tests, lung function and heart tests? Then, too, there are the “gender-specific tests” – ovaries and breasts for women, testes and prostate for men? In fact, men are often offered a blood test to detect prostate problems as part of a health check and are told that it can be an indicator of cancer. But Prof Timothy Wilt of the University of Minnesota’s medical school says that he wouldn’t recommend it: “At best, the benefits are small and the risks are considerable.” Two big trials have shown no reduction in deaths from prostate cancer picked up at screening. The idea of a whole body scan is attractive; Oprah Winfrey kickstarted a rush 17 years ago when she had one. But Prof Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute in the US is wary. In a study of more than 1,000 healthy middle-aged adults, whole body scans uncovered an average of 2.8 abnormalities each. More than a third of them needed a follow-up. “Screening scans can trigger a cascade of events that ends in surgery,” says Welch. “People need to be very aware of what they’re getting into. The human body is full of abnormalities, modern imaging is very sensitive and we don’t know how to interpret everything we see.” A study by Welch has found that regions of the US with higher rates of routine – often unnecessary – scanning have higher rates of nephrectomy (surgical removal of a kidney.) He thinks the two are connected. “Whole body scanning can unearth a Pandora’s box of ‘incidentalomas’ – spots on your liver, lungs, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, ovary, pancreas and kidney. We doctors aren’t sure what they mean, so we tend to investigate them – an investigation that typically involves getting tissue, which requires needles and other surgical procedures. Whether anyone is helped by the process is hard to know, but it is easy to see how they can be harmed: unnecessary anxiety, unneeded surgical interventions and their attendant complications, including, rarely, death,” says Welch. But what about stories of perfectly well people who go for a brain scan, find they have an aneurysm (bulging, fragile blood vessel), have an operation to clip it and avert a possible stroke? Surely that’s something you would fork out for. But Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP who presented a BBC radio documentary on screening, points out that increasing diagnosis may not result in better outcomes. The prime example is a mass screening programme for thyroid cancer in South Korea that detected 15 times more cases than previous tests, with no net improvement in death rates from the disease to date. If everyone were scanned for aneurysms, around 2% of people would be found to have one – but, since most would never cause problems, intervention might well do more harm than good. McCartney says: “If a screening test is cost-effective, the NHS is doing it. We don’t have evidence for additional tests at the moment.” She thinks that people don’t get adequate information about the potential hazards of some commercially available tests; the stress and anxiety, false positives (when a test suggests an abnormality that turns out to be nothing) and false negatives (when a test is reported as OK, but isn’t, giving a false sense of security). The false positives get handed back to the NHS to deal with, which is “fundamentally unfair, immoral and unethical”. Kearney, though, says people should make their own choices about what they want to check out. And anyone with new, unexplained or worrying symptoms, a family history of a particular condition or a particular health concern should always see a healthcare professional, whether they have had a health check or not. The expert consensus seems to be: go ahead with commercial checks if you want to – but buyer beware, and very aware."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/06/hungary-democracy-britain-orban-brexit-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:45:35Z","webTitle":"Hungary’s war on democracy is a war on democracy everywhere | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/hungary-democracy-britain-orban-brexit-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/hungary-democracy-britain-orban-brexit-deal","fields":{"headline":"Hungary’s war on democracy is a war on democracy everywhere","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is Hungary still a democracy? It was a question I posed to Nóra Köves, an activist with the pro-democracy Eötvös Károly Institute, in the Castro Bistro café in central Budapest. “I wouldn’t say that, no. Not, I think, any more. We are heading to a kind of dictatorship, but we are not there yet. We are somewhere between.” That was in the winter of 2016, a few months after the institute had discovered that it had been professionally bugged. A year and a half later, on the eve of Hungary’s general election this Sunday, the situation has only deteriorated further. Hungary has been ruled by the authoritarian Fidesz and its leader Viktor Orbán for eight years. Fidesz is a party that combines contempt for democracy with xenophobia and crude antisemitic tropes. George Soros has long been a demonic figure for the far right, cast in the traditional caricatured role of sinister Jewish puppetmaster. In Hungary, Soros adorns pro-government billboards, accused by Orbán of conspiring to overwhelm the country with immigrants and refugees. His regime is cracking down on foreign-funded NGOs – particularly those linked to Soros. BuzzFeed has just exposed how an undercover operation is seeking to undermine and neutralise Soros-linked NGOs. It’s not surprising: Soros-funded NGOS “must be pushed back with all available tools,” says Fidesz deputy chairman Szilárd Németh, “and I think they must be swept out.” The use of state-sanctioned antisemitic tropes is profoundly disturbing in a country in which nearly a third hold “strong or moderate” antisemitic views, against a backdrop of 400,000 Hungarian Jews having been exterminated in the Holocaust. Orbán brags of creating an “illiberal democracy”. It is indeed evolving in the direction of other states, such as Russia and Turkey, which maintain the pretence, the trappings if you like, of democracy: there are elections, there are different political parties, there are different media outlets. But the actual substance of democracy is hollowed out. For example, after the largest independent newspaper, Népszabadság, uncovered scandals involving Fidesz, it was suspended and sold to a pro-Orbán firm. Pro-government businesses have bought up other media outlets, while public broadcasters echo the regime’s line. An electoral system that exploits the fragmentation of Hungary’s opposition hands a dramatic advantage to the ruling regime. Democracy is dying not just in Hungary, but in neighbouring Poland, where another authoritarian government is rigging the political system in its favour. It is scandalous that our own government is attempting to cosy up to Orbán’s autocratic regime in order to court support for a favourable Brexit deal. By these means, authoritarian populists are emboldened everywhere to assault democracy and civil liberties. For those of us who believe in solidarity, the war on democracy in Hungary is a war on democracy everywhere. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/06/researchers-develop-device-that-can-hear-your-internal-voice","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:15:05Z","webTitle":"Researchers develop device that can 'hear' your internal voice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/06/researchers-develop-device-that-can-hear-your-internal-voice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/06/researchers-develop-device-that-can-hear-your-internal-voice","fields":{"headline":"Researchers develop device that can 'hear' your internal voice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Researchers have created a wearable device that can read people’s minds when they use an internal voice, allowing them to control devices and ask queries without speaking. The device, called AlterEgo, can transcribe words that wearers verbalise internally but do not say out loud, using electrodes attached to the skin. “Our idea was: could we have a computing platform that’s more internal, that melds human and machine in some ways and that feels like an internal extension of our own cognition?” said Arnav Kapur, who led the development of the system at MIT’s Media Lab. Kapur describes the headset as an “intelligence-augmentation” or IA device, and was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Intelligent User Interface conference in Tokyo. It is worn around the jaw and chin, clipped over the top of the ear to hold it in place. Four electrodes under the white plastic device make contact with the skin and pick up the subtle neuromuscular signals that are triggered when a person verbalises internally. When someone says words inside their head, artificial intelligence within the device can match particular signals to particular words, feeding them into a computer. The computer can then respond through the device using a bone conduction speaker that plays sound into the ear without the need for an earphone to be inserted, leaving the wearer free to hear the rest of the world at the same time. The idea is to create a outwardly silent computer interface that only the wearer of the AlterEgo device can speak to and hear. “We basically can’t live without our cellphones, our digital devices. But at the moment, the use of those devices is very disruptive,” said Pattie Maes, a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT. “If I want to look something up that’s relevant to a conversation I’m having, I have to find my phone and type in the passcode and open an app and type in some search keyword, and the whole thing requires that I completely shift attention from my environment and the people that I’m with to the phone itself.” Maes and her students, including Kapur, have been experimenting with new form factors and interfaces to provide the knowledge and services of smartphones without the intrusive disruption they currently cause to daily life. The AlterEgo device managed an average of 92% transcription accuracy in a 10-person trial with about 15 minutes of customising to each person. That’s several percentage points below the 95%-plus accuracy rate that Google’s voice transcription service is capable of using a traditional microphone, but Kapur says the system will improve in accuracy over time. The human threshold for voice word accuracy is thought to be around 95%. Kapur and team are currently working on collecting data to improve recognition and widen the number of words AlterEgo can detect. It can already be used to control a basic user interface such as the Roku streaming system, moving and selecting content, and can recognise numbers, play chess and perform other basic tasks. The eventual goal is to make interfacing with AI assistants such as Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri less embarrassing and more intimate, allowing people to communicate with them in a manner that appears to be silent to the outside world – a system that sounds like science fiction but appears entirely possible. The only downside is that users will have to wear a device strapped to their face, a barrier smart glasses such as Google Glass failed to overcome. But experts think the technology has much potential, not only in the consumer space for activities such as dictation but also in industry. “Wouldn’t it be great to communicate with voice in an environment where you normally wouldn’t be able to?” said Thad Starner, a computing professor at Georgia Tech. “You can imagine all these situations where you have a high-noise environment, like the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, or even places with a lot of machinery, like a power plant or a printing press.” Starner also sees application in the military and for those with conditions that inhibit normal speech.

The Home Office has referred the case of Nancy Motsamai, 35, who died on 12 March, to the independent prisons and probation ombudsman for investigation. Her husband, Fusi Motsamai, also 35, has condemned the Home Office’s treatment of his wife. He also said: “We repeatedly asked the Home Office to release Nancy’s passport to allow her body to be transported to her home country for burial but they did not.” His distress was compounded when the Home Office sent a text to his wife’s phone on 30 March, more than two weeks after her death, warning her of penalties if she did not attend an appointment at a Home Office reporting centre on 5 April. The Home Office has confirmed that the text was sent after they were notified about Motsamai’s death and said it was “working urgently” to pass her passport on to the South African authorities. A spokesman said the texting error was caused by an automated system that had not been updated. The couple’s barrister, Linda Appiah, had advised the government’s legal department of her client’s death in a letter dated 16 March. The Home Office said it was not notified until 23 March, a week before the text was sent. The couple had been living and working in the UK for more than a decade, but ran into difficulties when they applied to renew their visas. Both were ordered to report regularly to Eaton House, a Home Office centre in Hounslow. When they attended on 7 March, they were told they were to be forcibly removed from the UK that day and put on a plane to South Africa. Appiah said she had filed a judicial review claim on 5 March over the Home Office’s handling of the couple’s visa application. The Home Office, however, insists there were no legal barriers to removing the couple two days later. “Nancy said she felt unwell while we were at Eaton House,” said Fusi Motsamai. When the couple were taken to Heathrow airport several hours later she collapsed in a corridor. “An immigration official at the airport accused Nancy of faking her collapse to avoid being put on a plane,” her husband said. “He told Nancy that he would handcuff her hands and feet and make her walk to the plane like a penguin, and that he would put her onto the plane even if he had to carry her.” Officials then decided to put the couple into detention instead. “We were detained separately, but after we were released Nancy told me that a nurse at the detention centre told her she was too ill to be detained, but the nurse was overruled by a superior and she was held overnight,” said Fusi Motsamai. The next morning both of them were released, but she collapsed and died of a pulmonary embolism five days later. Nancy’s body was eventually flown to South Africa on 5 April after the country’s high commission agreed to provide an emergency travel document. Fusi contrasted his wife’s treatment with her attitude to others. “Nancy was the kind of person who would light up the room with her smile,” he said. “She loved helping others and volunteered to help at the church with different youth programmes. She believed in justice and used to get cross when injustice happened to others and no one was held accountable for it.” Rev Lucy Brierley of Woking United Reformed Church, which supported the couple and continues to support Fusi, condemned the UK’s immigration removal system as a travesty and an embarrassment. “This case is an indictment of the administrative chaos in the UK visa and immigration system, “ she said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts and condolences are with Mrs Motsamai’s family at this difficult time. We take our responsibilities towards detainees’ health and welfare seriously. When there are claims that the highest standards have not been met these will be investigated thoroughly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/15/truth-or-dare-horror-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Truth or Dare review – horror games fall flat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/15/truth-or-dare-horror-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/15/truth-or-dare-horror-review","fields":{"headline":"Truth or Dare review – horror games fall flat","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This tepid teen horror from Blumhouse Productions is a disappointing backwards stumble for the indie company, given its recent track record of cheap but effective genre thrills such as Split and Happy Death Day (as well as the considerably higher profile Get Out). Opening, as cliche dictates, with a trip to Mexico during spring break, a group of college friends end up playing truth or dare in an abandoned castle: “Tell the truth or you die. Do the dare or you die. Refuse to play? You die.” Both the truths and the dares are tailored to the players, designed to ruin their relationships or to kill them trying, and delivered by familiar faces that contort into evil smiles, looking, as one character puts it, “like a messed up Snapchat filter” (much less scary than it sounds).

These joyless, increasingly petty “twists” try and fail to raise the film’s subterranean stakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/11/unexpected-high-jump-and-javelin-successes-boost-golden-day-for-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T12:30:14Z","webTitle":"Unexpected high jump and javelin successes boost golden day for Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/11/unexpected-high-jump-and-javelin-successes-boost-golden-day-for-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/11/unexpected-high-jump-and-javelin-successes-boost-golden-day-for-australia","fields":{"headline":"Unexpected high jump and javelin successes boost golden day for Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian field athletes have rarely been the nation’s sporting standard bearers but unexpected Commonwealth Games gold medals in the high jump and javelin at Carrara Stadium helped Australia’s athletics team pick up where the record-breaking swimmers left off. Brandon Starc, the younger brother of cricketer Mitchell, cleared 2.32m to snatch victory in the men’s high jump. In recording a personal best, Starc became the first Australian to win a major high jump competition in 24 years. “This is just unreal. The whole stadium, I could not thank them enough. I have no words,” Starc said. “I knew I was in good form, I just had to back myself and believe in myself.” Kathryn Mitchell broke her personal best, the Commonwealth Games record and the Australian record with her opening throw in the women’s javelin. Mitchell’s effort of 68.92m was a mark no other competitor came close to beating, and would have comfortably won gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where she finished sixth. Fellow Australian Kelsey-Lee Roberts saved her best effort until last, moving into the silver medal position at the death. Remarkably, it was a first ever podium finish for Mitchell, a 35-year-old veteran of four Commonwealth Games and two Olympics. “I’ve opened before with my biggest throw, I’ve also thrown my biggest throw in the last round,” Mitchell said. “I just tried to concentrate on what I was doing in that moment, and I did that on the first throw. “The less I focus on results, the more the results come. I tried to put all thought of results out of my mind. I knew I could throw the Australian record eventually, so I just said to myself, ‘allow it to come’.” Henry Frame fell just short of making it a triple treat for Australia in Wednesday night’s field events, finishing with silver in the men’s long jump. Frame led for most of the competition, but was out-jumped at the death by South African world champion Luvo Manyonga. Cameron Crombie, a volunteer firefighter from Canberra, won the gold medal in the men’s F38 shot put final with a throw of 15.74 metres, a whisker short of the world record. In the women’s T35 100 metres, 16-year-old Isis Holt also fell just shy of a world-best time, providing her nation’s highlight on the track at Carrara Stadium. The Australian medal tally kept climbing, even after the conclusion of the swimming program, the country’s best ever result in the pool. Australia’s first gold medal of the day - and 51st for these Games – came from on-target shooter Daniel Repacholi, who took out the men’s 50-metre pistol event. Repacholi, 35, now a three-time gold medallist from four Commonwealth Games, had before the event announced it would be his last international shoot. His score of 227.2 was a Games record. “It’s amazing,” he said straight after the victory. “To win gold in front of my beautiful wife, my two beautiful kids and all our family it’s fantastic. It was great, [the crowd] were behind me the whole way. I don’t know if the same result would have happened if they weren’t here or if it was in another country.” Australian pair Georgia Sheehan and Esther Qin won the first diving gold medal on offer, jumping from fourth to first with their final dive in the women’s 3m springboard synchronised diving competition. Strong winds and technical problems with the scoring system overshadowed the remarkable come-from-behind victory. Fellow Australians Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith, bronze medallists at the 2016 Rio Olympics, had led the competition until the last round but appeared to be affected by the long delays and recorded a no-dive. They finished seventh. The outdoor conditions will likely prove challenging for the remainder of the diving program. “At the end of the day everyone’s in the same boat, everyone’s up,” Sheehan said. “They’e the same conditions [for all] so it’s really just who can deal with it the best today and that just happened to be us, which is really exciting.” On the Gold Coast’s iconic beachfront, Australian pairs won through to the women’s and men’s finals of the beach volleyball. Chris McHugh and Damien Schumann comfortably beat English opponents Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf. McHugh and Schumann are strong favourites to win Thursday’s gold medal match and showed their strong credentials with a cultured display against the 210cm Gregory, who posed a unique challenge at Coolangatta Beach. “Gregory is a big, strong blocker so it was important to move him around,” Schumann said. “There’s been a lot of nervous, sleepless nights, and tonight will be no different. We’ll give it our best crack tomorrow. Whoever we play is going to be world class. Their win was matched by women’s pair Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho Del Solar, who will also play for gold tomorrow. Both pairs will face Canadian opponents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/14/gigs-cost-live-music","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"‘I typically go to 40 or 50 gigs a year all over the UK.

I started going to gigs at 16. Now I’m 47, and maybe I’m someone who hasn’t grown up because I typically go to between 40 and 50 gigs a year, all over the UK. It usually costs me about £500 a month, including travel. I’m a big fan of singer-songwriters, and old-school indie bands. My favourite artists are Morrissey, Adam Ant and Robert Forster, former member of the Go-Betweens. I’ve seen Forster 50 times in the last 30 years. He once did three UK gigs on consecutive nights in Glasgow, Manchester and London. I went to all three. I will also spend up to £20 on merchandise at each gig. But often I’ve already got all the stuff they’re selling – I spend £80 to £100 on CDs, books, DVDs and vinyl each month. It varies, depending on what has been released and whether I can resist the temptation. I don’t just listen to music – I play it, too. I own 25 guitars but they weren’t very expensive. The most I’ve ever spent on a guitar is £500. I don’t buy MP3s or subscribe to Spotify and I’ll always pay £1 extra for a ticket to be posted. I like owning a product. I’ve probably got over 1,000 vinyl records and maybe 2,000 CDs. Many are autographed or limited editions. I’ve got singles I paid £1.99 for that are worth £150, but I’d never sell them. They are for my kids. Songs come to life when you hear them performed live. There are subtle differences, you can hear the artist at work. I also love discovering the support acts. I once saw The Killers supporting British Sea Power at Colchester Arts Centre. Each music venue affects the character of the gig in different ways and changes how I experience the music. Life is about experiences, after all. You can’t take your money with you. All you have on your deathbed is what you’ve done with your life and the places you’ve been. I recently bought a folding bike for £100 so I could explore all the music venues in the cities I visit for gigs. I’m curious about venues whose names I know well from tour itineraries, and towns I wouldn’t normally go to. I find I often have great conversations with like-minded people I don’t know in the crowd. I’ve written a book, London Gig Venues, which covers 600 music venues in the city. Quite often, I’ll work out a route round the UK that enables me to combine our family holidays with a gig I want to go to. My very understanding wife will stay in, looking after our three children. We used to go together, before babysitters. Her favourite band is the Pet Shop Boys. Once we got tickets to see them, but my wife went into labour late. A day or two after the child was born, I went off with her sister to the gig. It’s unfortunate they were her favourite band but it didn’t make sense to waste the tickets. My daughter Ciara, who is 11, has been to about 20 gigs with me over the past two years. Often, when the band sees a little girl in the audience, they point her out. So she thinks every gig you go to, the artist makes a reference to it or you get to meet him or her afterwards. My wife has her own lifestyle PR agency and I work for her. We split the household bills. I pay £200 for council tax, £230 for gas and electricity, and £400 on food each month. My wife pays the mortgage and the broadband and mobile phone bills. She knew I was obsessed with music when we married but I have promised her I’ll cut down on gigs this year. Sometimes the children roll their eyes and say: “Daddy’s off to a gig again.” But I’m not someone who goes off to the pub or watches football. Music is my passion.

Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous was incapable of sensible thought thanks to her insatiable appetite for champagne; Bernard Black in Black Books stoked his misanthropy with wine. The characters in M*A*S*H were often drunk to blunt the trauma of war. And in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia – just because they felt like it. Bit-part comedy drinkers range from exaggerated monsters such as Father Jack in Father Ted and Barney Gumble in The Simpsons to the flippantly presented misery of Fun Bobby in Friends – Monica’s boyfriend who became “Ridiculously Dull Bobby” as soon as he wasn’t sloshed. Recently, however, comedy has sobered up. On Netflix, Flaked sees Will Arnett play an alcoholic rebuilding his life. One half of the couple in Channel 4’s Catastrophe is a reformed drinker. In Love, the slacker sitcom whose third season has recently launched on Netflix, protagonist Mickey realises she’s an addict – of love and sex, but also alcohol and drugs – and starts to visit AA meetings. Meanwhile, Loudermilk, which appeared on Amazon Prime Video in January, stars Ron Livingston as Sam Loudermilk, an embittered Seattle divorcee who leads an addiction group and is himself an alcoholic in recovery. “I’ve never met an alcoholic I didn’t like,” says Loudermilk co-creator Peter Farrelly, for whom the show is a move into more adult TV comedy after a career spent making wilfully crass movies such as Dumb and Dumber. “Such a big flaw humanises people, it makes them way more interesting. Right away the likability is up. Loudermilk is the ultimate asshole but because we know his flaws, we put up with it.” Comedy’s thirst for teetotalism extends as far as mainstream sitcom Mom, which features Allison Janney and Anna Faris as a mother and daughter who are both in recovery. But sobriety is particularly suited to the new wave of nuanced, funny/serious “dramedy”, where the “sit” doesn’t reset neatly to zero and the characters’ mental health is in the foreground. A drinker whose recovery could derail at any point perfectly fits that bill. “There’s been a shift towards complicating protagonists in comedies,” observes AV Club critic Kyle Fowle. “Streaming services, and tastes in general, have changed the nature of sitcom: there’s room for punchlines and traditional episodic storytelling, but more often than not viewers want something more complex. Dramedy is interested in serialised storytelling, where conflicts aren’t resolved in a single episode. Shows that have characters struggling with addiction can explore storylines, consequences and triumphs over multiple episodes, while still having that comedy bent.” The danger with comedies about something so serious is the laughs getting lost: either the show’s in poor taste or it’s simply a massive downer. Farrelly knew this was a trap to be avoided. “The thing I’m most proud of is Loudermilk’s not as depressing as most shows I’ve seen with AA-style programmes. Usually they paint a dreary picture of a bunch of sad sacks sitting around talking about their problems. It doesn’t have to be that way. People go to these meetings to be uplifted. There are a lot of laughs. Anyone in the programme will tell you.” “Shows like Loudermilk go back to the idea that there’s a kernel of comedy within every tragedy,” says Steve Greene, a writer at IndieWire. “Part of getting past horrendous things is finding the weird ironies in what comes after.” A sober protagonist also brings in-built tension to a comedy, because their determination to resist booze is a Chekhov’s gun: at some point they’ll succumb. Flaked pulls the trigger at the end of episode one, when we see that the bottle marked “Kombucha” that Will Arnett’s character keeps in the fridge is actually full of wine. Loudermilk retains that uncertainty for as long as possible. In Catastrophe’s very first scene, Rob Delaney’s character uses his drinking problem as an unconventional chat-up line: “I quit a few years ago, after I shit my pants at my sister’s wedding.” This announces the show as being about flawed adults, not sitcom caricatures. Then last year’s more downbeat third season depicted an unhappy “Rob” relapsing. “We knew it was a potential disaster in our back pocket,” says Delaney’s co-star and co-writer Sharon Horgan. “We didn’t even know initially if we’d do anything with it. We just liked the idea that Sharon was someone for whom drink, and getting pissed, was a part of life, and seeing her involved with a sober alcoholic interested us. It took a long time for us to figure out how to deal with Rob falling off the wagon. We didn’t want the show to get so dark that it stopped being funny.” Delaney himself is a sober alcoholic in real life, as is comedian Marc Maron, whose autobiographical sitcom Maron similarly saw the creator’s screen alter ego relapse. This trope of a performer acting out a scenario they hope never happens to them was bleakly flipped by Will Arnett when he made Flaked: after 15 years sober, during filming for season one he started drinking again and had to resume attending AA meetings. Comedians who are willing to put their own trauma on screen are part of a change in culture, with stars increasingly open to discuss mental health. Meanwhile, a steady drip of deaths – Amy Winehouse and Philip Seymour Hoffman being two illustrations of how the battle for sobriety can suddenly be lost – has buried the idea of substance abuse being cool. In the real world, too, millennials drink less than preceding generations, and Dry January gets bigger every year. In this context, an old-school lush might not get laughs. Farrelly acknowledges that shows such as Loudermilk signal a shift in what we consider funny. “When I was a kid, Dean Martin went on The Tonight Show drunk: slurring his words, messing everything up. We had the town drunk in [1960s sitcom] The Andy Griffith Show. It’s not as funny any more. I remember laughing at all the cocaine jokes on Saturday Night Live. We thought it was hysterical. Then [John] Belushi died.” “The fact that recovery is the subject of popular TV, and especially comedies, reflects a change in culture,” says Dr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development at Alcohol Research UK. “We’re more ready to discuss recovery. This is to do with less stigma around mental health issues but also a wider recognition that ‘recovery’ is a positive journey that many people take, and achieve successfully.” Addiction counsellor Simon Leigh agrees, though he points out that the US, the home of these series where recovery is the central theme, is ahead of us: “In America, alcoholism and addiction are treated as an illness. There’s not enough education about addiction in this country. If you have a drinking problem in America you go to rehab. If you have a drinking problem in England you go to the pub!” For the grown-up TV comedies of the 21st century, however, the pub is no longer the place. Heavy drinking used to mean easy laughs; now, that well has run dry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/15/novelist-guy-grime-mc-observer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:59:07Z","webTitle":"Novelist: Novelist Guy review – commanding production from grime’s sage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/novelist-guy-grime-mc-observer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/15/novelist-guy-grime-mc-observer-review","fields":{"headline":"Novelist: Novelist Guy review – commanding production from grime’s sage","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It starts with the name. Novelist, a 21-year-old MC from the south London borough of Lewisham, didn’t go with a particularly gritty byline when he started rhyming in his early teens. He chose Novelist, perhaps because novelists use words to a purpose; they are the masters of their own narratives. It follows, then, that Novelist (Kojo Kankam on his passport) is one of grime’s brightest young hopes, one of a clutch of artists in his early 20s releasing key grime projects this year, and yet – simultaneously – a real maverick. There is something of a class of 2018 shaping up, where fellow travellers such as AJ Tracey, Dave and Abra Cadabra (not to mention Stefflon Don) are expected to release official full-length debut projects into a wider listenership ready to receive them, but already Novelist is an artist apart. He is not “the next Stormzy” but very much his own man, lyrically and sonically: Novelist Guy is entirely self-written, self-produced and released on his own label with no guests. The path has been long and increasingly idiosyncratic. Last year Novelist (known foremost as an MC) released Be Blessed, an EP of instrumentals with religious-themed titles; a couple of years previously, he collaborated with electronic artist Mumdance on a few tracks for XL (a good home to grime over the years) but declined to sign with anyone, and set up his own label, MMM Yeh. The young Novelist came up aggressive, with a high-speed, take-no-prisoners flow that recalls much older iterations of the genre such as Dizzee Rascal, allied to a bounce that makes the vast majority of Novelist freestyles into instant dance music. Here, tracks such as Man Better Jump are a command rather than a request – taut, relentless, old-school rhythms matched by Novelist’s flow. He is the product of a certain postcode – SE4 – and his music vividly reflects lived reality. That grimness has hit something of a new crisis pitch in the last few weeks with an upsurge in violence on London’s streets. “Mind your own, watch your tone,” runs Gangster, one nagging track on Novelist Guy, which rehearses street rules to icy, gaming-style production. But Novelist takes the inputs he shares with many other MCs and refuses to turn them into the usual output; this is a stern, confident, uncompromising record about higher moral codes, one that sounds perfectly “street” without getting any guns out, one that you can jump up and down to very easily. The track Gangster is actually about how Novelist didn’t turn into a thug. In the old days, he had a crew around him. Having left them, he is more likely to do a video featuring one long-shot take of a solo night-time freestyle. While most MCs are in the business of bigging themselves up, Novelist sounds consistently aloof, apart – a ninja sage among blusterers. “Money, drugs, cars, girls, that’s for the films,” he spits on Afro Pick, one of the standout tracks, named for the comb he used to wear in his hair. “What does it mean when your own thinking can’t be still?” With killer production, both rubbery and stark, Afro Pick is actually about fighting for equanimity – about peace of mind, not “ps” (money). He’s always “thinking, thinking, dot dot dot,” (Dot Dot Dot). As a younger teen, Novelist was elected deputy young mayor of Lewisham, and despite putting out a body of pre-album work that often rehearsed street values (Endz, from 2015; PissTake freestyle, from 2016), he spent the last general election campaign endorsing Jeremy Corbyn. There’s a mention or two of that here, but Novelist has other priorities on this statement of intent. His own ambition looms large on these 15 tracks; he wants “the whole nine yards” (Whole 9 Yards). But it’s not just money and status; Novelist is motivated by self-reliance, independence (“I trust myself and not the gang”) and showing his peers that there are other ways to carry themselves, ways that don’t end badly. Another standout track here spells out a pugnacious south London take on #blacklivesmatter: Stop Killing the Mandem. Hydraulic digitals and punching beats underline the message, which isn’t limited to law enforcement but includes black-on-black violence; it ends on a coughing beat. This is, for lack of a better word, a conscious album: there aren’t any shanks or mentions of weed, nor is there any disrespect to women. God gets a lot of shoutouts. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when God entered Novelist’s narrative, but a great deal of the rectitude on here has its backup in the musician’s faith. You can’t help but wonder how Novelist’s audience will take to it, and to his reappearance after such a long absence; Novelist was incandescently hot three years ago. Grime moves fast and Novelist isn’t quite who he used to be. However, Stormzy demonstrated that faith doesn’t exactly play badly on a grime album – the video for Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2 (ft MNEK) has 5.5m YouTube views. And neither does conscience: witness again Stormzy’s refusal to let the Grenfell Tower disaster be forgotten. Grime is now a maturing genre, with room for a multiplicity of voices and subject matters. And in Novelist, grime now has an upstanding and versatile outlier.

Marks &amp; Spencer was first off the block with British asparagus on sale in selected branches last week – nearly three weeks before the traditional start of the eight-week season on 23 April – while Waitrose put the first spears on sale on Wednesday. Sainsbury’s is likely to stock small quantities from the weekend. But the much larger mainstream crop – grown in the open in fields rather than in polytunnels or glasshouses – is likely to be delayed by two weeks as a result of adverse weather conditions and the impact of up to three separate snowfalls which sent temperatures plummeting, according to the trade body British Asparagus. It says the perfect growing conditions are a cool, crisp spring which is not too wet and not too dry. Airmile-laden products from Peru – still the world’s largest exporter of asparagus – have traditionally bolstered supermarket shelves because of the unpredictability of UK weather.The British asparagus season ends on the summer solstice – 21 June – when the last spears are harvested by hand. M&amp;S now offers white asparagus, purple asparagus and, for the first time, jumbo-size “king” asparagus, which will be on sale from mid-April. Last year British asparagus went on sale at M&amp;S even earlier, at the end of March. “There is always an air of excitement when the first British asparagus comes into season as it signals the beginning of spring,” said Chris Ling, M&amp;S vegetable buyer. Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor, whose early crop is supplying Waitrose, said that with warmer temperatures expected, “consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May.

The “disgrace” – deserved. The “humiliation” – deserved. The “ridicule” – that too. All of it. Barcelona had deserved it all. Roma’s Edin Dzeko, Daniele De Rossi, and Kostas Manolas had as well. All three had scored in the first leg, De Rossi and Manolas in their own goal, and now all three had scored in the second leg, the road leading to redemption and a historic result. The Greek stood, tears welling in his eyes while they went wild at the Stadio Olimpico. As for Barcelona, they have not been back to the semi-final since they won the 2015 Champions League: for a third year in a row, they’ve been knocked out in the quarters. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, not this time. When the draw was made, Sport described it as a “sweetie”; before the second leg, 4-1 up, they announced that Barcelona could “touch the semi-final”. It slipped from their hands. Before the game, Ernesto Valverde said his team had to ensure “nothing extraordinary happens”, but it did. What happened, said Sport, was “a failure with no excuses”. Their cover is black, reserved for days of mourning. It was, the front page said, enough “to make you cry”. “Total failure,” Marca’s front called it. Well, “it”? They. Marca gleefully put Pep Guardiola alongside his former team. They were both out. Everyone expected City to be, at least after Anfield; Barcelona were another matter. El Mundo Deportivo called it “the fall of Rome”, Marca called it the “fall of the Barcelona empire” and for AS in the eternal city they had suffered an “imperial failure”, sent falling to earth, in ruins now. Juan Cruz was calling it a “suicide”, in which by the end they couldn’t cry because there were “no tears left”. If anyone had been lucky, it was Barcelona in the first leg. “Losing is not always a failure, but losing like this is,” wrote Jose María Battle in El Mundo Deportivo. “A team like Barcelona can’t throw a lead like that in the rubbish bin.” It will always be there, most agreed. “This is the biggest humiliation of their contemporary history, after a surreal display,” said El Mundo. “A humiliation that will be remembered for years,” wrote Lluis Mascaró in Sport. “A historic humiliation. Enormous. The kind that hurts. A lot. A hell of a lot.” In Marca, David Sánchez called it a “ridículo mundial”, a humiliation seen around the globe. Ridículo was a word they were all using, but there were others: terrible, dreadful, inexplicable. Or perhaps – and this was the worst thing – not so inexplicable. “This knockout revealed a drama that was there, [but] no one wanted to see it,” El Mundo said. “When you walk a tightrope, you can either fall into a safety net or crash onto the tiles. The latter happened.” Valverde said he was “entirely responsible” and fingers pointed his way. Sport highlighted “Valverde’s fear”, Sánchez talked of his “conservatism”, El Mundo noted that the coach had chosen “resistance over control”, and “they couldn’t resist: they didn’t deserve to, either”. They didn’t even compete. One cartoon shows a man in front is his television long after the game. His wife tells him to turn it off, but he replies: “I can’t, I’m waiting for Barcelona to come out on to the pitch.” There was more than just this night, however poor it was. When it has come down to it, away from the Camp Nou, they have had little response of late. Last season they were beaten 4-0 in Paris and 3-0 in Turin. The year before that they were beaten 2-0 in Madrid, against Atlético. Now they have been beaten 3-0 in Rome. They were fortunate to draw 1-1 with Chelsea in London, too, remember. This season, they have kept winning, but they have not always convinced. “Apart from Messi no one is untouchable after this,” said Fernando Polo, but this time some of the focus must fall on him too. It was noted that Barcelona don’t play to Messi’s strengths. It’s more than that: they play to their weaknesses, always giving him the ball in part because there is little else. If Messi’s not there, nor are Barcelona – and last night Messi was not there. “He was isolated, it’s true, but he was missed; he didn’t turn up,” wrote AS, giving him their “Vaya día” (what a bad day) award. “This was a tragic night, a copy of previous debacles, as if nothing has been learned. It is too easy to just expect an extra-terrestrial to systematically solve the errors of human beings,” said Ernest Folch in Sport. “This should not be treated as a bad day, a one off: they have been playing very little football for a while now, making the most of defensive security and the trump card that is Messi,” said Marca. “The miracle worker was not their saviour this time,” wrote Mascaró. In seven years, supposedly the Messi-era, Barcelona will have won just one European Cup. And this time at least, there could be no complaints, and it was not just chance. “They’re out on merit,” wrote Sport, “their own merit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/syrian-airstrikes-could-disrupt-commercial-flights","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T15:41:26Z","webTitle":"Commercial airlines rerouting flights due to possible Syrian airstrikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/syrian-airstrikes-could-disrupt-commercial-flights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/syrian-airstrikes-could-disrupt-commercial-flights","fields":{"headline":"Commercial airlines rerouting flights due to possible Syrian airstrikes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Airlines are rerouting flights after Europe’s air traffic control agency said plane operators in the eastern Mediterranean should exercise caution over the next 72 hours due to possible airstrikes in Syria. As debate mounted over possible military action, Eurocontrol said the use of missiles could result in intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment. The warning came after increased discussion among the US and its western allies of airstrikes to punish the Syrian regime’s suspected ordering of a deadly chemical weapons attack in a rebel-held area of the country on Saturday. At least 45 people are thought to have died in Douma, a town on the outskirts of Damascus. A spokeswoman for Air France said the carrier had decided to alter flight paths on Beirut and Tel Aviv flights. EasyJet also announced that it would reroute flights from Tel Aviv. Most commercial carriers have stopped using Syrian airspace during the country’s eight-year civil war after warnings from aviation regulators. Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines, one of the few to continue flying directly over Syria, is also rerouting its flights temporarily. Only Syrian Air was still offering commercial flights above Syria on Wednesday, according to the flight tracking website FlightRadar24. In a statement on its website, Eurocontrol said due consideration should be taken in airspace across the region, including Cyprus, the nearest EU member state to Syria. “Due to the possible launch of airstrikes into Syria with air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles within the next 72 hours, and the possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment, due consideration needs to be taken when planning flight operations in the eastern Mediterranean/Nicosia FIR [flight information region] area,” it said. Greece’s largest carrier, Aegean Airlines, which flies six times a day to Cyprus from Athens and Thessaloniki, said no changes had been made. “We are, like all airlines, on alert over the next 72 hours, but no changes have been made on any scheduled flight for the time being,” a company representative said. The entire island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters were included in the designated airspace singled out by Eurocontrol. The downing of a Malaysia Airlines commercial jet by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine in 2014 – in which all 298 people on board died – raised awareness among regulators and airlines of the risks posed to flights in conflict zones. Recent warnings have tended to emerge after military action has started, so Eurocontrol’s pre-emptive notice suggests a heightening of regulatory scrutiny."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/14/tinashe-people-are-past-point-they-think-im-a-mindless-puppet","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Tinashe: ‘People are past the point where they think I’m a mindless puppet’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/14/tinashe-people-are-past-point-they-think-im-a-mindless-puppet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/14/tinashe-people-are-past-point-they-think-im-a-mindless-puppet","fields":{"headline":"Tinashe: ‘People are past the point where they think I’m a mindless puppet’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Halfway through school at California’s Crescenta Valley High, budding actor Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe made a new best friend. She was delighted to have found this new acquaintance, and sad when she had to leave school for two months to shoot a TV movie, Cora Unashamed. On her return to Crescenta, she discovered her BFF didn’t like her any more. No one did. Her friend turned into a bully and created a We Hate Tinashe group of which she was leader. She would ring Kachingwe at home to describe exactly how she was going to “fuck her up” at school the next day. She, like everyone else, didn’t like the fact Kachingwe was on TV. “There were groups of girls who would throw food at me in the hallways,” she remembers. “Like, cereal. And milk. Gross stuff like that. People were pretty mean.” Despite such torrential tormenting, the 25-year-old – now the singer who goes simply by Tinashe – is remarkably sanguine about these experiences. “It led me to be hyper-focused on what I wanted from life and that was how I was able to stay happy and not get depressive as a kid,” she says in the cafe of New York’s New Museum, where we meet to discuss her long-overdue second album proper, Joyride. “It’s easy to feel like the whole world is against you as a kid, but the world is bigger than school.” It’s a lesson Tinashe has retained, applying the same sage standards to “what people are saying online” about her life and music. “Everything will get better. You just have to keep focusing on what makes you happy and what fulfils you. For me that’s making music and performing.” Does she still see those girls? “Fuckin’ bitches,” she grins. “Where are they now?” Although people no longer chuck food at Tinashe’s head, they do throw a lot of shade her way. They question why her records don’t sell. With her catalogue a combination of subtle, silky trap and rap-infused tracks and glossy hits (Player; the DJ Mustard co-produced 2 On; her collaboration with Snakehips on All My Friends) critics say she’s either too pop or too R&amp;B – or not enough of either. “I think genres should just die,” she says. “As a human being, you don’t limit yourself to being one thing or other; I don’t think people think of themselves in that way. It’s the same for how I present my music, how I listen to music, how I dress, how I live my life. It’s not black and white. Who you are is actually much more complex.” The last time she spoke to the Guardian the internet disseminated Tinashe’s thoughts on colourism and sexism (“Sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community; they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman,” being one quote). Television host Wendy Williams delivered a snippy three-minute bit about the interview. “She’s blaming Rihanna and Beyoncé for her lack of success?” Williams asked. “You have no one to blame but yourself, Tinashe. You gotta make your own path. Mariah, Drake and Alicia Keys are all biracial, so what’s your next excuse?” Tinashe avoids mentioning the acerbic host directly, but suggests her points were taken out of context. “The biggest thing [about the article] was that it seemed like I was placing blame, which really wasn’t what I intended. If anything I was trying to point out, as testament to my own experiences, that being able to speak without coming across as whiny or entitled is important. I think it’s necessary for women to be able to speak their truth.” She doesn’t regret saying she feels colourism exists. “The more people talk about it, the more people can relate to those kind of feelings. It’s important to have an open dialogue because these things are very real.” We continue to roam the gallery’s five floors, stopping at artist Tomm El-Saieh’s chaotic abstract paintings. “This is so detailed. It must take days and days just to do one tiny part of it.” Perhaps, I venture clumsily, it’s a metaphor for the long – very long – awaited Joyride. “It has taken a while, yes,” she laughs. “I listened to songs obsessively for months and there’s been so much overthinking throughout the process. I was so stressed out, trying to force things and feeling like everything was out of my control.” She drove herself a bit mad, sending the record to the label prematurely, who sent her off to make more music. At one point she lost her title track after Rihanna reportedly took it for her own album. “Someone sold it to her that I was unaware was shopping it around. He was also dating her at the time, so … ” She fakes a cough and splutters: “Travis Scott. It’s really all his fault. Then when it didn’t make [Anti] I was like, ‘Yeah, so my album is still called Joyride, it would be great to have that back if you’re done with it.’” Meanwhile, fans and trolls lined up to wonder where the album was and whether it might sell more than her “critically acclaimed” (translation: didn’t sell well) debut, 2014’s Aquarius. This is another aspect of “the business” that Tinashe has little time for. “You’re either at this super-high level of fame and dominating the whole world or you’re a failure, which is just not accurate,” she insists. “My definition of success has changed over the course of this album. I’ve learned that making the music and art and videos I want to make, that’s enough for me. I don’t feel like I need all the accolades.” It has taken Tinashe time to reach such a place of self-satisfaction, however. With more than 200 tracks recorded and “numerous” iterations of Joyride in the vault, the album seemed destined never to see the light of day. Finally, last summer, Tinashe let go a little. She moved into a new home in the Hollywood Hills with sweeping views of LA and turned the guesthouse into a studio. She invited friends, producers, writers, graphic designers and artists over and together they zeroed in on the music, artwork and videos. “It was a really big turning point for me because I was able to focus creatively and get all my thoughts in one place. It really gave me perspective on what I’d already created and what I still needed to work on. It was more focused, more purposeful.” Joyride is a delightfully sleazy bop, full of red-light R&amp;B, woozy hip-hop and lyrics that linger on hook-ups and getting high. “It’s a snapshot of when I wasn’t in a relationship and I was trying to find myself,” she says. “That sense of confidence and almost braggadociousness was something that I wanted to express on the album – ‘I don’t need anybody, I’m good.’” She is now in a relationship with the basketball player Ben Simmons, another reason she’s living life a little lighter. “Ben has been an important part of being able to let go of the album creatively. Because you can get crazy,” she says. Funnily enough, it looks as if Joyride could just be a hit; the Offset-featuring single No Drama clocked up a million views in one day, while the delightfully tactile Me So Bad and title track Joyride are streaming at rapid rates. The album is self-assured, a bit frivolous but occasionally weighty – such as on Easy on Me, which voices her frustrations with politics in the United States. The track, an interlude, is one of two Tinashe has produced on Joyride, having taught herself Pro Tools when she was 17. “When I first got on the scene I was honestly shocked that I could work for a whole year with hundreds of engineers and producers and not one would be another woman. We need to see more representation.” Having been in the entertainment industry for so much of her life – as both an actor (including her role as Celeste Burnett on Charlie Sheen’s Two and a Half Men) and a singer (who could forget her stint in the Stunners, a shortlived girlband signed to Columbia in 2007) – Tinashe has a deep understanding of the seismic shifts occurring at the moment. She believes, however, that the music business has a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to the #MeToo movement. “Mostly it’s people’s perceptions of what it means to be a female artist and how you deal with your sexuality and people respecting your creative opinion. I haven’t had any straight-up, very outwardly sexist experiences in the music industry; I’ve been very lucky. Maybe one session where I had to walk out where I was uncomfortable. But for the most part I’ve worked with really great people. The issue is really a systemic, cultural one that impacts across the board.” It’s time to leave the New Museum – Tinashe has a stack of CDs to sign before getting up at 4am to do Good Morning America. Before she goes, however, I wonder if she is really as happy, as calm, as sorted as she appears? “Honestly, yes. I think people respect me as an artist now. I’ve been making art for a good number of years. People have got past the point where they think I’m just a cute girl or a mindless puppet of a record label.” She may not yet be a superstar, but actually Tinashe is really very successful. And that’s more than enough. “However this album does, I’ve come to realise that I’m not going to stop making music if it isn’t a hit. I can say the same for the next album and the next album. So be it. I’m going to continue to make art and everything’s gonna be OK. I’m happy and confident and excited and proud of what I’ve done. Life is all right!” You believe her, you really do.

It follows Facebook’s admission that the company “may” have handed over the direct messages of some users to the Cambridge Analytica contractor without their express permission. The revelation is the most severe breach of privacy yet in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network admitted to the transfer of data in its warning to users whose friends had installed the This Is Your Digital Life app, which harvested data from not only the installer, but also all their friends on the site. “A small number of people who logged into This Is Your Digital Life also shared their own news feed, timeline, posts and messages, which may have included posts and messages from you,” the company told affected users. Following publication of this article, Kogan and Facebook contacted the Guardian. Kogan said he had never collected private message data for any commercial purpose of his business Global Science Research (GSR). He said private messages were only ever used for university work within his lab, for which Cambridge University ethics approval had been obtained. A Facebook spokesperson said: “In 2014, Facebook’s platform policy allowed developers to request mailbox permissions but only if the person explicitly gave consent for this to happen. At the time when people provided access to their mailboxes - when Facebook messages were more of an inbox and less of a real-time messaging service - this enabled things like desktop apps that combined Facebook messages with messages from other services like SMS so that a person could access their messages all in one place. According to our records only a very small number of people explicitly opted into sharing this information. The feature was turned off in 2015.” The Facebook admission that the company may have handed over direct messages of some users appears to echo previously unreported claims made by Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower. Wylie told the Observer that he had seen a table, produced by Kogan, that included private messages. It remains unclear whether GSR, Kogan’s company, or Cambridge Analytica ever used the messages to build any targeting models. Prior to, and after, publication of this article Kogan referred the Guardian to an interview with the New York Times in which he said his app collected information from a “couple thousand” people, and that the data “was obviously sensitive so we tried to be careful about who could access it”. Kogan told the New York Times that he took messages only from people who had installed his app, not their friends, and that none of the information was shared with Cambridge Analytica. For users who did not install the app, only their messages with the friend who had actively installed the app could have been shared, owing to the specific functionality offered by Facebook at the time. But those users would not have been offered any opportunity to opt out of the data sharing, since Facebook required the mailbox owner only to consent to uploading the entire contents, both sent and received. For the users who did install the app, potentially their entire mailbox history was uploaded. Those users, however, would have been explicitly notified – through a simple clickthrough panel listing all the permissions they were handing over – that they were granting mailbox access. The potential that Facebook may have handed over direct messages was first publicly highlighted in late March by Jonathan Albright, a professor at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. On 21 March he noted that apps such as Kogan’s “could also request users’ private messages [ie their Facebook DM inbox] via the ‘read_mailbox’ API request”. Albright said at the time that Facebook should “immediately” share the API access that it had granted Kogan, as well as whether or not private messages were collected. Speaking yesterday, Albright said: “Have to admit, I didn’t expect private DMs/messages to show up in people’s CA notifications today … Might explain why FB late getting these [notifications] out?” • This article was amended on 16 April 2018 to add statements by Aleksandr Kogan and Facebook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/11/why-are-deaths-of-uk-homeless-people-rising-share-your-thoughts","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T10:37:53Z","webTitle":"Why are deaths of UK homeless people rising?

The figures compiled by the Guardian include an average of more than one death a week in 2017.

Greater London is the only part of the UK which records detailed information on street homelessness, through the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (Chain), run by St Mungo’s. The investigation has prompted leading homeless charities to call for more robust statistics on mortality rates, and an extension of the review system used by local government and emergency services to investigate the deaths of vulnerable adults.

In the last decade, formerly two-dimensional avatars from Lara Croft to Wolfenstein’s BJ Blazkowicz have been retrofitted with backstories and motivations – with varying success. On the face of it, Kratos, the vengeful god who powered the excellent (and gratuitously violent) God of War games of the 00s, is an absurd candidate for such humanisation. Until now, his sole character trait has been angry. He has retired to Scandinavia, is recently widowed and father to a tweenaged son who knows nothing of his god-slaying, blood-soaked past in Greece. He and the boy set out to scatter his wife’s ashes from the top of a distant mountain, getting unwillingly caught up in the affairs of Norse gods along the way. This God of War wants us to see Kratos as a person, rather than an instrument of extraordinary violence. The game not only pulls this off, but turns Kratos and his son’s journey into one of the best games of recent years: a deft intertwining of relatable familial drama and awe-inspiring mythological epic. The combat is not as comically overblown as it once was, but this is still a very violent game, with deliberate, intense fights against creatures ranging from the frozen undead to building-sized monsters. It is exhilaratingly brutal: every hit has heft, and most enemies are a threat. You can unfurl an arsenal of attacks with bare fists, a shield and an ice-imbued axe that, once thrown, flies back into Kratos’s hand with a satisfying thunk. His son, Atreus, who blinks back tears while hunting a deer in one of the game’s first scenes, gradually becomes more accomplished with a bow and helpful in confrontations. When not fighting, you are exploring the reaches of Midgard on foot or by boat, finding temples and ruins that take inspiration from Norse mythology. Treasure chests and mythological texts are hidden in places that need brainwork rather than brawn to unlock, encouraging the player to look around and feel present in the world. The axe is frequently put to alternative use in these puzzles, freezing mechanisms in place or thrown to flip switches or destroy sigils. Comprehending God of War’s memorable places is as satisfying as sinking the axe into a demon’s skull – alternating between thinking and fighting gives God of War a rhythm that can be absorbing for hours at a time. The game is one continuous shot, with no interruptions; irritating necessities such as loading screens are hidden so effectively that you barely realise they are there. This cinematic commitment to Kratos’ point of view enhances the story’s efforts to humanise him. You walk in his boots, flowing between combat, story scenes and exploration without interruption. There are abundant moments of outstanding beauty: canoeing beneath the rusting legs of an ancient statue of Thor and on to a lake; traversing the bodies of fallen giants; entering a temple to find cavernous, treasure-packed chambers, resplendent works of virtual architecture. It is among the most visually impressive games made – so much so that rendering it makes the PlayStation 4 sound as if it’s about to expire. God of War’s world is enormous – set aside at least 30 hours to explore it – but it is devoid of the busy work that plagues similarly ambitious games. Every diversion from the main story is an adventure rather than a task, making exploration worth your while for more than the treasure; some of the best stories here are hidden. The mythological setting imbues this world with mystery. Players feel like archeologists, learning more about the fiction with every foray into an unexplored corner of the map. God of War is a story about what it means to be a god – traversing realms, killing mythical monsters, exerting power, exploring the boundaries of possibility – but also about what it means to be a man. Power and masculinity are intertwined, and Kratos’s desire to protect his son from the realities of both is unexpectedly touching. Atreus is far from the irritating sidekick he might have been, complementing Kratos’s gruff and humourless dialogue with quips and endearing observations, turning his father’s intense seriousness and inability to find humour in anything into a running joke. Their dynamic changes shape more than once over the course of the story, and their relationship involves a lot more demon blood and magical artefacts than the typical parent-child relationship, but Kratos is still a distant, emotionally remote father trying clumsily to reach out to a son who feels unwanted. It is rare to play a game so accomplished in everything it sets out to do. God of War is a standard-setter both technologically and narratively. It is a game that, until recently, would have been impossible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/08/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-8-lies-amplifiers-fking-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T21:00:40Z","webTitle":"Homeland recap: season 7, episode 8 – Lies, Amplifiers, F**king Twitter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/08/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-8-lies-amplifiers-fking-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/08/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-8-lies-amplifiers-fking-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Homeland recap: season 7, episode 8 – Lies, Amplifiers, F**king Twitter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Step by step, somehow, you end up very far from where you ever wanted to be.” If you have a heart, spare a thought for Franny “Franny Banany” Mathison. You are barely born before your father is hanged from a crane, you survive a siege, are taken into foster care then raised by your aunt while your useless mother serves overseas. Last week’s SWAT team interruptus finally pushes her over the edge and Maggie gives Carrie an ultimatum: either she checks herself in to hospital or she starts proceedings to take custody of Franny. Carrie is naturally horrified, but not so horrified that she doesn’t once again prioritise work over her daughter, despite being unemployed. Her unsalaried minister-without-portfolio roaming brief brings her to a familiar scenario – face-to-face with Saul, pleading to be put into service. “I can break him. You know I can.” With time running out, Coach throws his mercurial protege into play – and a blistering showdown with Dante. “Do they know what a lunatic I’m sitting across from?” he asks. Yes, they do, Dante – that’s why she’s currently between jobs, strung out on fake Ritalin and about to lose custody of her daughter. None of which is to say that she is a soft touch. She rides him mercilessly during the interrogation, taking him on an emotional rollercoaster he won’t forget in a hurry. After charm, empathy, threats and verbal abuse fail, she resorts to that old stalwart – attempted murder. The contact poisoning delivered by his fake lawyer’s pen in effect loosens Dante’s tongue, but also flatlines his cardiovascular system. He gives up Simone and implicates himself right before his heart stops. It’s what Professor Piehead would call “another partial success” for Carrie. A second dead traitor showing up so soon after McClendon – that really would be bad optics. “The things we thought could never happen in this country apparently can.” The good news for Elizabeth is that Senator Paley is willing to halt proceedings against her for the good of the office. The bad news is that the price tag is her resignation. She finds his terms not to her liking at all and sets her attack dog David Wellington on the case. The Russians need to learn that actions have consequences. “They’ve had a free run at us. Tell them in terms they understand.” He conveys a message to the Russian ambassador that the US will consider Simone Martin testifying a hostile act. It is strongly worded enough for the ambassador to tell Yevgeny that Simone must not testify. The subtext is clear – Simone must be taken out. Yevgeny opts to take this literally by taking her out of the safe house, planting a big smacker on her lips like Daffy Duck and driving her off into the sunset. What Bonnie and Clyde antics might these two get up to next week? “I don’t trust you, not like I used to – running around like some deranged vigilante.” Saul has always known his mentee was special. Touched equally by genius and madness, she has saved the day as often as she has ruined it. It has long been his job to tell which version of Carrie has shown up on any given day. On this given day, he decides to run with her berserk high-risk poisoning plan that may very well still blow up in their faces but it is enough to get the warrant for Simone Martin’s arrest he so desperately needs. He races towards her hideout, only to find Yevgeny’s men have already got to Simone. He won’t know if he made the right call until Dante is confirmed dead or survives. Notes and observations “The problem isn’t that you don’t love your country, it’s that your country doesn’t love you back.” Carrie makes a good stab at unravelling Dante’s motivation, even if it ultimately doesn’t work. Yevgeny is not just about drowning double agents, rescuing operatives or disseminating fake news. His slick under-pressure elevator pitch blackmailing Simone’s lawyer proves him a true all-rounder – a Swiss army knife of spycraft. Carrie grilling Dante is reminiscent of her epic interrogation of Brody in season two. “Your entire mental health plan is having me tell you when to medicate because you have no idea.” Dante throws Carrie’s self-medicating in her face to drop her in it with Saul. He is definitely concerned, but it’s nothing he hasn’t heard before. What next for Franny? Will Dante pull through? And are Yevgeny and Simone Homeland’s new power couple?

Boris Kuznetsov, who fled Russia in 2007, said he had handed British diplomats the police case files from the 1995 murder of a Russian banker and his secretary with a toxic substance, which scientists have identified as a product of the Soviet-designed Foliant programme. A related nerve agent was used in the Salisbury poisoning last month. The documents, some of which had previously been leaked by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, were given to British diplomats in Latvia in March, Kuznetsov said. He told the Guardian he had also handed the case files to US authorities. Among the documents, which have been seen by the Guardian, are the results of a mass spectrometry and an infrared spectroscopy of the poisonous substance, which was scraped off a telephone receiver used by the businessman Ivan Kivelidi and his secretary. Both died in agony. The files may provide rare physical evidence about chemical weapons production at Shikhany. The British case has so far relied more heavily in public on circumstantial evidence and secret intelligence. Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at the University of Leeds who investigated the use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988, said “the data would be very helpful” after being given a description of the files. He said an analysis of the lab data would be necessary to make a further assessment, but the hydrolitic process used in several of the analyses of the suspected novichok, and the quality of the mass spectrometry data, would be of particular importance. On Thursday, the Times reported that British intelligence had identified Shikhany as the source of the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack, during a briefing for the country’s allies. Kuznetsov said: “If the substance synthesised by Rink and the substance which poisoned Skripal are identical, then that means that the attempted murder of Skirpal was made with the Russian government’s knowledge.” But with a number of labs producing at least five variants of novichok across Russia, and a lapse of two decades between the cases, the ultimate use of the data from the 1995 murder may be limited in relation to Skripal. British scientists at Porton Down said this week that they had not determined the country of origin of the nerve agent, explaining it was “not our job to say where it was manufactured”. The Foreign Office subsequently deleted a tweet that said the nerve agent was “produced in Russia”, saying the remarks had been truncated. A representative for the Russian foreign ministry said that the UK had its own “test tube of shame”, a reference to the evidence shown by the then US secretary of state Colin Powell to the UN security council in support of the Iraq war. The Kivelidi case files also included blood work analyses, largely testing for the presence of heavy metals. Investigators initially believed he had been poisoned with cadmium. During a police interrogation, Vladimir Uglev, a scientist who worked on the programme, had identified the poisonous substance in the killing as one of the nerve agents produced at his lab in Shikhany, he told the Guardian. Leonid Rink, a former employee of the chemical weapons facility, admits in case files seen by the Guardian and first reported by Reuters to enlisting a scientist to develop a batch of the nerve agent in his garage and sell it to an organised crime group. He was caught before the murder of Kivelidi, but the nerve agent was later used in the killing. Russia did not publicly declare its Foliant programme before signing the 1993 chemical weapons convention, limiting known data about the nerve agent’s properties. Some chemical formulas were published in a 2008 book by the whistleblower Vil Mirzayanov. The US may have collected physical evidence of the nerve agent during its cleanup of the Nukus chemical weapons testing facility in Uzbekistan in 1999. Otherwise, little is publicly known about the programme. Russia’s ambassador to the UK has denied Moscow ever developed a nerve agent called novichok. The argument appeared to be semantic. At the same time, Russia has said that because the chemical formula for the nerve agent was well known, any country could have synthesised the poison used in Salisbury. But data from a nerve agent produced in Shikhany may show some differences between it and comparison samples possibly produced in labs outside Russia. Uglev had previously told the Guardian it would be difficult for investigators to pinpoint the source of a nerve agent without any previous data on it. “They have the footprint of the substance in Salisbury … but no data about the substance [its fingerprint] in the database, so how can they say where it is from?” he wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/09/youtube-illegally-collects-data-on-children-say-child-protection-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T04:01:48Z","webTitle":"YouTube illegally collects data on children, say child protection groups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/09/youtube-illegally-collects-data-on-children-say-child-protection-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/09/youtube-illegally-collects-data-on-children-say-child-protection-groups","fields":{"headline":"YouTube illegally collects data on children, say child protection groups","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A coalition of 23 child advocacy, consumer and privacy groups have filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission alleging that Google is violating child protection laws by collecting personal data of and advertising to those aged under 13. The group, which includes the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC), the Center for Digital Democracy and 21 other organisations, alleges that despite Google claiming that YouTube is only for those aged 13 and above, it knows that children under that age use the site. The group states that Google collects personal information on children under 13 such as location, device identifiers and phone numbers and tracks them across different websites and services without first gaining parental consent as required by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa). The coalition urges the FTC to investigate and sanction Google for its alleged violations. “For years, Google has abdicated its responsibility to kids and families by disingenuously claiming YouTube — a site rife with popular cartoons, nursery rhymes, and toy ads — is not for children under 13,” said Josh Golin, executive director of the CCFC. “Google profits immensely by delivering ads to kids and must comply with Coppa. It’s time for the FTC to hold Google accountable for its illegal data collection and advertising practices.” The group claims that YouTube is the most popular online platform for children in the US, used by about 80% of children aged six to 12 years old. Google has a dedicated app for children called YouTube Kids that was released in 2015 and is designed to show appropriate content and ads to children. It also recently took action to hire thousands of moderators to review content on the wider YouTube after widespread criticism that it allows violent and offensive content to flourish, including disturbing children’s content and child abuse videos. But the coalition say this is not enough. Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy said: “Google has acted duplicitously by falsely claiming in its terms of service that YouTube is only for those who are age 13 or older, while it deliberately lured young people into an ad-filled digital playground. “Just like Facebook, Google has focused its huge resources on generating profits instead of protecting privacy.” The complainants state that among the most popular channels on YouTube are those directed at children, including ChuChuTV Nursery Rhymes &amp; Kids Songs with 15.9m subscribers and more than 10bn video views and LittleBabyBum with 14.6m subscribers and 14bn views. The coalition also states that Google’s Preferred advertising platform includes a “parenting and family” lineup in which major advertisers pay a premium to place ads. The 59-page FTC complaint says “YouTube also has actual knowledge that many children are on YouTube, as evidenced by disclosures from content providers, public statements by YouTube executives, and the creation of the YouTube Kids app”. Katie McInnis, policy counsel for the Consumers Union, said: “YouTube knows children are watching content on their site, and has created content channels specifically aimed at them, but does not appear to obtain the required parental consent before collecting information about them. “Google has the responsibility to be Coppa-compliant and ensure that children can safely watch the programs designed and promoted for kids. These practices present serious concerns that warrant the FTC’s attention.” James P Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense, said: “It is time for Google to be completely transparent with all the facts and institute fundamentally responsible new policies moving forward to protect the privacy of kids. We fully expect Google to work closely with advocates and reach out to parents with information about parental controls, content and collection practices on YouTube so parents can make informed choices about what content they allow their kids to access and how to protect their privacy.” A YouTube spokesperson said: “While we haven’t received the complaint, protecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us. We will read the complaint thoroughly and evaluate if there are things we can do to improve. Because YouTube is not for children, we’ve invested significantly in the creation of the YouTube Kids app to offer an alternative specifically designed for children.” How children’s TV went from Blue Peter to YouTube’s wild west"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/06/bournemouth-crystal-palace-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:32:52Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth v Crystal Palace: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/bournemouth-crystal-palace-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/06/bournemouth-crystal-palace-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth v Crystal Palace: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Crystal Palace need to move on from their unlucky defeat against Liverpool last time out despite the mental struggle of winning only once in their past nine matches.

But there are a few, including Flight of the Conchords and Daily Show correspondent Ronnie Chieng. Will the names Angus Gordon and Aaron Chen one day trip as easily from the tongue? On the basis of this double-billed UK debut, you’d probably hedge your bets. Yet you can see what swayed the judges: Gordon and Chen are distinctive personalities, with ambitious new angles on the art of standup. But they’re also both, to some degree, anti-comics: performers who scorn the conventions of standup and prompt the kind of nervous laugh generated by material more painful or inept than outright funny. Anti-comedy has a distinguished lineage, from Andy Kaufman via Gregg Turkington’s dyspeptic alter ego Neil Hamburger to the monotonous Brit Edward Aczel. That’s the ballpark we’re in this evening: discomfort in place of mirth. As Gordon says at the top of his set (looping in Chen’s sidekick Jon Lo): “We’re just three variations on Australian awkwardness.” Which, after an hour and 40 minutes, doesn’t seem like much variation at all. You can, it turns out, get too much of a bad thing – and well before the end of these twinned sets, I craved a quickening of pace or some relief from all the tense, if artful, silences. Lo is up first in the double-and-a-bit bill, with a short prologue to Chen’s 40-minute set. There’s a drawn-out joke about Tinder; he shows us his tattoo. The joke in both his and Chen’s case is the lackadaisical delivery – slightly perkier with Chen but still slacker-slow, with every scripted line separated by uncomfortable pauses and “unbearable” (his word) audience interplay. Chen will solicit the audience’s opinion interminably on the same hot snack, a tedious process rendered all the odder by the fact that none of us know what snack he’s talking about. He carries it off unflappably and with no little charm – his company is always enjoyable, even if the paucity of material and harping on the gig’s supposed failure get frustrating (it has, he admits, been “mostly just tepid”). Faltering anecdotes about eating chips off the floor of his car and inventing a Japanese girlfriend to annoy his dad suggest a young man with minimal life experience to draw on. But he knows that. His unearned self-satisfaction is part of the gag. Through it all, Lo sits at a desk upstage, infrequently operating sound cues and serving as Chen’s nerdy co-conspirator in whatever trick they’re playing on the audience. By the close of their set, the evening needs an injection of energy. But we get the opposite in Gordon: a downbeat depressive from Brisbane – whey-faced, red-eyed, morbid. It starts with a video of Gordon’s expressionless face – all very Kim Noble – and the Smiths on playback. The show is called Sad Boy Comedy Hour, and finds our host bleakly observing the murderous habits of cats or pontificating on euthanasia. It’s played as – and may indeed be – real. This isn’t some broad caricature. Gordon seems to feel a vague disgust for glib comedy, although he doesn’t disguise the occasional (and welcome) flicker of a smile at his more obvious laugh-lines. Elements of the set are enervating. Gordon bashes his forehead with the mic to imitate a cane toad’s death throes, and decants a jug of water to explain Brisbane’s recent floods. Others – twisted dialogues culled from his loveless relationship, jaundiced critiques of celebrity philanthropy – strike the sweet spot where poetic nihilism meets gallows humour. I liked the picture he painted of his gran’s head grafted on to his shoulder, which summoned the spirit of another anti-comic, the Edinburgh comedy award nominee Jordan Brookes, and his spoof dead-gran show Body of Work. He’s not there yet, though. Neither of these two prize-winners is the finished article – but both are promising in intriguing ways. What they aren’t is ideal bedfellows. To watch them together is to have frustration heaped on frustration, as each one withholds the release of tension that tends to characterise comedy. Individually, their acts are eye-catching. In a double-bill – one malfunctioning, the other wilfully joyless – they’re fatally low on dynamism. At Soho theatre, London, until 13 January.

For the past three centuries (since the Acts of Union in 1707) their national identity has been so folded into their role as the senior power in the British federation that they are unaccustomed to self-examination. At times condescending, at times complacent, they have rarely needed to question their place in the world. Thanks to Brexit this is changing, and quickly. National identities are not usually fluid. As the accumulated residue of long histories, they evolve at a stately pace, like coral: they can hardly be cast aside on a mere whim of fashion. But the past 18 months have cast sharp doubt on such assumptions. England’s national identity is undergoing a fast and furious overhaul. A country that was once a byword for steady, imperturbable (sometimes maddening) stodginess has suddenly revealed itself to be fractious, impulsive and jittery. A land of fair play and cautious pragmatism (don’t rock the boat, no need to frighten the horses, steady as she goes) has become moody and quarrelsome. Thanks to Theresa May, the idea that we are in any way “strong and stable” has lost all credibility. There has long been an ambiguous quality to Englishness. The Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana described the English as “the most disliked of men … except where people need someone they could trust”, and many have echoed his words. But today’s England feels like a country that has fallen out of love with itself – mistrusting its elites, scornful of its media, and famously impatient with experts. It is willing even to denounce its own judges as bootlegging “enemies of the people”. “Think” less, runs the slouching new sign of the times. “Feel” more. Self-deprecation is one thing: this is something stronger. Deprived of its reputation for reliability, England can only be a shadow of its former self. As it is, the fever of self-loathing reminds one of nothing so much as the jolly old Noël Coward ditty: From Colwyn Bay to Kettering They’re sobbing themselves to sleep. Their shrieks and wails In the Yorkshire dales Have even depressed the sheep. In rather vulgar lettering, A very disgruntled group Have posted bills on the Cotswold hills To prove that we’re in the soup. Coward’s lyric is a timely reminder that English whingeing is nothing new. But the vexed spirit of the day is awkward because the problem lies not in our circumstances but in our selves. A national identity cannot be picked out like a new suit of clothes. If anything, it is the image we see reflected in the eyes of others, and what we see now does not look too good. Brexit is leading foreign pundits to regard us with disdain. “What in the world has happened to this country?” asked one Swiss paper, while a German radio station called Brexit the “biggest political nonsense since the Roman emperor Caligula decided to appoint his horse Incitatus as consul”. Britain has appeared in a Polish journal as “an offended, spoiled child”, in a Japanese paper as “an outcast”, and in India as guilty of “utter folly”. Pakistan described the British lion as possessing “more of a moan than a roar”, while an Austrian cartoon showed a deluded Brit leaping from a plane clutching not a parachute but a union flag. The Süddeutsche Zeitung, a serious paper, has driven the point home by calling Britain “the laughing stock of the world”. When Dean Acheson characterised Britain in 1962 as a country that had lost an empire and not yet found a role, he cannot have imagined that this new role was to be … a joke. Nor can the English pretend that such barbs are aimed at Britain as a whole. To the foreign onlooker the distinction is blurred – as it often is to the English themselves. We have the BBC but speak English; we fly British Airways but expect a full English breakfast; we cherish English literature … in the British Library. We know, however, that Brexit was primarily an English emotion, fuelled by English votes. In all honesty we should not speak of Brexit. What happened in the referendum was “Exit”. It would be wrong to conclude from this that England is by nature more pull-up-the-drawbridge than the other British nations. It is by some distance Britain’s most cosmopolitan region. According to a 2017 survey by the Migration Observatory, London alone has almost five times the foreign-born population of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together. There are more foreign-born in Manchester than in Scotland. It is often asserted that Englishness, like Britishness, must be a matter of ideas and values – liberty, democracy, equality, tolerance and so on. But it is hard to see these as distinctively native: they are standard-issue social ideals shared or claimed by almost everyone from Australia to Zimbabwe. The only unique things about England, the qualities that are irrevocably its own, concern its landscape and history. These are the fields we should explore in order to find what we have been fighting for. In 1941 George Orwell argued, in The Lion and the Unicorn, that even if England were to be conquered and overrun it would somehow remain England, an expression of its green hills and valleys, fields and hedgerows, squalls and rainbows. “The Stock Exchange will be pulled down, the horse plough will give way to the tractor, the country houses will be turned into children’s holiday camps, the Eton and Harrow match will be forgotten, but England will still be England, an everlasting animal.” No one knows whether this is true – not everything lasts. It is possible that England will remain the driving force of a new golden age for a new global Britain, but it is equally possible (to put the bleaker case) that England will awake from the Brexit fever, gape in amazement, and wonder how such folly came to pass. In the meantime we should note that England is by no means one thing. Ullswater is not at all like Brixton; Widnes would look out of place in Dorset; there are easy-to-spot differences between Constable country and Wolverhampton. The chasm that divides a Canary Wharf money trader from a zero-hours road haulier in Sunderland is deep indeed. As has often been said, modern England is a land of cricket matches and cathedral choirs; but it is also a land of pub darts, Indian saris and Islamic minarets. Whether a national identity can cohere around the theme of variousness is another question. We had better hope so, because one thing is certain: the imperious workshop of the world, the nation that seized those far pavilions, the England of Nelson and Florence Nightingale … that place is no more. Variety may soon be all we have. • Robert Winder is the author of The Last Wolf: The Hidden Springs of Englishness"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/07/ipcc-concerned-about-rise-in-ethnic-minority-deaths-following-police-restraint","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"IPCC concerned about rise in minority ethnic deaths following police restraint","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/ipcc-concerned-about-rise-in-ethnic-minority-deaths-following-police-restraint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/ipcc-concerned-about-rise-in-ethnic-minority-deaths-following-police-restraint","fields":{"headline":"IPCC concerned about rise in minority ethnic deaths following police restraint","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The official police watchdog says it is concerned about a rise in the proportion of ethnic minority people who have died after police use of force or restraint in the last eight months, the Guardian has learned. Of the 11 people who have died after a clash with police in England and Wales since April 2017, six are from an ethnic minority background, says the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). One case, involving a woman in Cheshire, involved the use of leg shackles. The full circumstances of all 11 cases are still under investigation either by the IPCC or at inquests. Dame Anne Owers, chair of the IPCC, told the Guardian that the watchdog had asked for the data on the cases. She said: “Of those, five men were black or mixed race, one was a black woman and the remainder were white.” In 2015-16, of 11 deaths after police restraint or use of force, three were from ethnic minorities, while in 2016-17, five ethnic minority people died out of 15 deaths after the use of force or restraint, the IPCC said. Owers said: “We need to look closely between the relationship between ethnicity and the use of force.” The IPCC says more work is needed to understand why the deaths have taken place, and that reasons could include use of alcohol, drugs or the increasing number of people with mental health problems whom police have to deal with. Campaigners claim prejudice may play a role, and discussion around the issue in the UK is influenced by the debate in the US, which has been driven by the Black Lives Matter movement. The latest figures, covering the last eight months of 2017, suggest a growth in racial disproportionality, so that the proportion of ethnic minority people who have died exceeds their proportion in the overall population. The incidents include high-profile cases such as Rashan Charles and Edson Da Costa in London, whose deaths led to tension in the streets between police and communities. In these two cases, the IPCC has decided officers should be issued with notices warning that their conduct is under investigation. The IPCC has been much criticised and its release of the emerging data may prove controversial at a time when some police officers feel that their ideals of public service are under unwarranted attack. Concerns about police and race are longstanding in some communities, and have been a constant theme of Theresa May’s time as home secretary and prime minister. In October, a report into deaths in custody ordered by May showed a possible racial factor. The report, by Dame Elish Angiolini, said: “Deaths of people from BAME communities, in particular young black men, resonate with the black community’s experience of systemic racism, and reflect wider concerns about discriminatory over-policing, stop and search, and criminalisation.” A report by David Lammy for the government in September found racial disparities across the criminal justice system. Owers said: “We will need to see if there are the same patterns that Lammy found, whether they apply here.” Owers also revealed that the government had promised to introduce a requirement that police officers cooperate with inquiries into their conduct. In the past, some have refused to answer oral questions in interview and instead provided written answers at a later date. Owers said: “There should be a duty to cooperate with an independent investigation.” She said the duty of cooperation, similar to the duty of candour introduced in the health service, had been promised in forthcoming legislation and was needed because “sometimes we have found a defensive approach”. “We are assured that is going to happen, in the new regulations in the new Policing and Crime Act.” As an example, Owers said that when the IPCC got the power to require officers to attend an interview, the Police Federation advised its members, who are rank and file officers, to answer questions in writing. That slowed down investigations by the IPCC, which police then complained about, Owers said. The IPCC ceases to exist this weekend, and from Monday will become the Independent Office for Police Conduct, with a new leader and stronger powers. Owers is standing down after five years in charge. In a number of cases, both the police officers under investigation and the families who had lost loved ones were united only in criticising the IPCC. The IPCC was set up as part of the reforms following the public inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case. It was supposed to be independent and gain public confidence. Owers accepted it had faced criticism from all sides. Deborah Coles, the executive director of Inquest, a charity that gives specialist advice in cases of deaths in state custody, said: “These latest shocking figures show this is a systemic problem, exposing the structural racism embedded within policing and criminal justice. Deaths continue because of failing systems of investigation, oversight and accountability. “No longer can the government ignore the serious human rights issues raised by this deadly, disproportionate policing.” The National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for restraint and self-defence, Commander Matt Twist, said: “The police service has made great progress in making use-of-force recording more accessible and transparent, with police forces now regularly publishing data on their officers’ use of force. This data will help us to ensure that our training, tactics and equipment are fit for purpose and that when force is used, it is used legitimately.” Those people of an ethnic minority background who died after police use of force or restraint in the last eight months were Rashan Charles, Edson da Costa, Darren Cumberbatch, Shane Bryant and Nuno Cardoso. A black woman in her 50s, who has not been named and on whom leg restraints had been used, died several days after contact with Cheshire police. The other people who died were Gary Williams in Merseyside, Douglas Oak in Dorset, Mark Cole in Devon and Cornwall, David Molloy in Greater Manchester and a man, yet to be named, who died after an incident involving the Met."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/07/nottingham-forest-v-arsenal-fa-cup-third-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T18:05:57Z","webTitle":"Nottingham Forest 4-2 Arsenal: FA Cup third round – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/nottingham-forest-v-arsenal-fa-cup-third-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/nottingham-forest-v-arsenal-fa-cup-third-round-live","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham Forest 4-2 Arsenal: FA Cup third round – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As soon as the teams were announced, one felt Arsenal could come undone here, and so it proved – Arsene Wenger’s first ever third-round defeat.

Forest were immense. Ben Brereton, man of the match, ran Mertesacker and Holding ragged. Smith had an excellent day in goal, the Welbeck clanger aside, saving twice from Nketiah. Cash and Osborn never gave Elneny and Willock a second of time to settle in midfield. Dowell showed glimpses of some frightening talent, the boy has one magical left foot. Forest saw out the game with great maturity, despite being down to 10 men. Lichaj, another man-of-the-match contendor, was brilliant, scoring twice – including a goal for the ages, looping one into the top corner just before half time. But he was also solid at the back, organising his younger counter-parts well. “My wife said she would let me have a dog if I scored a hat-trick this year”, says Lichaj in his post-match interview. “But Kieran [Dowell] wouldn’t let me have the last penalty. He told me to go away.” Thanks for reading. See you next time. Bye! The holders of the FA Cup are out! 90+3 min: This has been some game, but the 10 men of Forest look as though they’ve done enough here. The young team are seeing the game out well here. Matt Mills replaces Kieran Dowell and Barrie McKay comes on for Matty Cash. 90+2 min: Nketiah is put clean through on goal … saved by Smith! He’s redeemed himself there after the clanger for Welbeck’s goal. Nketiah tries the dink, but Smith races out to meet him, gets a finger on the chip, the ball rolling agonisingly wide before Walcott has a chance to tap into an empty net! 90 min: Four minutes added on for Arsenal to find two goals! 89 min: The young defender is given a second yellow card for a sliding tackle on Welbeck. It’s probably the right decision. He had only picked up the first yellow card 45 seconds earlier. 87 min: It’s almost impossible to tell if Dowell touched it twice – if he did, the penalty wouldn’t stand and Arsenal would have a free kick. Personally I do think he did touch it twice! Forest have definitely had the rub of the green there. Dowell slips as he takes it, the ball spoons up into the air and it goes into the roof of the net! Arsenal are appealing that Dowell touched the ball twice – shooting into his standing leg that slipped from under him – but Moss awards the goal after checking with the linesman! 84 min: Traore skips past both Debuchy and Mertesacker, he’s clean through … chopped down by Debuchy in the box! But wait, replays show Debuchy won the ball! It was a good challenge! Yellow card for Debuchy, he should be shown red if Jon Moss thinks it is a foul! Ospina also shown a yellow card for dissent! 81 min: Cash is back on his feet, he’s OK. 80 min: Ten minutes left! A break in play as Cash goes down with a head injury. He took a shoulder in the face from an Iwobi challenge. The camera cuts to Wenger, who is furious that somebody is hurt. 3-2 Iwobi plays a slide-rule pass through to Welbeck, Smith is favourite to win it as he comes out of goal, but he fails to gather it, and Welbeck sidefoots the loose ball into an empty net. Smith is furious with himself! Out of nothing, Arsenal are back in this! Clanger from the goalkeeper Smith. 77 min: Walcott finds some room down the right and fires a low cross but it’s too weak and Mancienne is able to slide back and tackle it clear. Another poor cross! 75 min: If anything, Nottingham Forest look the more likely to score. Before the third goal, they had 30% possession, but the City Ground are now cheering every pass as Vaughan, Osborn and Cash stroke it about the pitch. 73 min: Brilliant from Dowell! He nutmegs Mertesacker on the edge of Arsenal’s area, drives to the byline and his cut back nearly reaches Walker, only for Debuchy to stick out a boot. 72 min: Brereton is bullying Holding and Mertesacker again. Eighteen! 70 min: Chance for Nkaetiah! He turns sharply in the box and fires a low shot at goal, but Smith closes the angle extremely well, advancing out of goal like an octopus, and gets a knee on the ball to turn it away. Big chance, big save. 68 min: Holding has had a nightmare day. Brereton has given him the runaround, getting in behind and winning free-kicks to alleviate the pressure in this second half. To top it off, Holding passes the ball out of play, when trying to find Maitland-Niles. He’s lost his head. 66 min: Arsenal make an immediate change: Nketiah, the hero of the Caraboa Cup for Arsenal earlier this season, is on for Willock. Brereton – 18 years old! – wrestles the ball out of Dowell’s hands, confidently puts the ball on the spot and sends Ospina the wrong way! Forest lead by two! 63 min: Holding is caught on his heels, Cash nips in to steal the ball and he is ceremoniously brought down by the former Bolton defender! 61 min: Chance for Brereton! Walker gets some room on the left – Debuchy is jogging! – he crosses to the near post and Brereton meets it. Deflected behind, the ball just going wide of Ospina’s right post! 59 min: Free-kick to Arsenal, Walcott again over the ball, but it’s straight into the arms of Smith. Walcott’s hair is strangely tall today. Giroud-esque. 57 min: Nelson goes down in the area, but it’s a fantastic tackle from Lichaj. He got all of the ball. 55 min: Tyler Walker, son of Des, comes on for Forest, their first change. He’s another that’s come through the academy in Nottingham. He’ll replace Clough, no relation of Brian/Nigel, who has had a poor game in truth. 53 min: Maitland-Niles sends Lichaj for a hot dog, dumping the Forest goalscorer on his arse, but with plenty of time to cross from the byline, overhits the cross. Another poor delivery after some good play. 50 min: Arsenal putting the squeeze on here. They’ve come out with a real sense of purpose. 47 min: A poor cross from Debuchy is caught by Smith. Apart from the free-kick from Walcott, Arsenal’s deliveries from wide areas has been shocking. Half-time reading: That Lichaj goal is a poor-man’s Joe Cole. Not as far out as the England man, but had similar shape on the shot. The City Ground erupts as Jon Moss blows for half time. You can’t say that Forest don’t deserve that lead. Arsenal’s back four look like they are skating on ice. 2-1 Cash gets a cross in from the right, it’s headed clear but only as far as Lichaj on the edge of the area. The ball doesn’t touch the floor, as the right back takes one touch on his chest and volleys the ball into the top corner, a looping effort that left Ospina motionless! Postage-stamp stuff. Wow! Forest lead! Lichaj again! WHAT. A. GOAL. 42 min: Ospina looks like he’s got a problem here. The glove is off and he’s grimacing. Looks like a finger that causing him discomfort, but he’ll carry on. 40 min: Once more, Brereton goes clean through on goal, the third time this half! Brereton tries to get the ball back onto his stronger right foot, Holding is able to get back, and Brereton aims a weak shot straight at Ospina. It’s another golden chance wasted. Arsenal’s line is so high! Why would you defend like that with Mertesacker in the team?! 38 min: Walcott has looked lively. He dribbles past two Forest players inside the box and cuts the ball back to Iwobi, but Lichaj does well to read the pass and makes the interception. The Forest right back has had a fine half. 35 min: Mertesacker may have scored Arsenal’s goal, but he looks like he is running in syrup. He’s always been slow, but this is ridiculous. Forest are obviously targeting him. 33 min: Chance for Brereton … great save Ospina! Holding gives a loose pass and Arsenal are caught on the counter-attack, suddenly Brereton has just one to beat. He cuts brilliantly inside on his left, leaving Mertesacker for dead but his powerful shot is well palmed away. Ospina got a good hand to that. 31 min: The ball breaks kindly to Iwobi on the edge of the area, and the Arsenal forward spoons it 20 yards over the bar. Lovely player Iwobi, sometimes he dribbles as though he has the ball on a string, but he can’t shoot for toffee. 28 min: David Vaughan, the veteran Welsh midfielder, looks off the pace. Iwobi, Nelson and Willock running rings round him. 26 min: Arsenal are reborn, and they now look in the mood. Nelson is looking sharp – that dive for the free-kick aside – especially with Maitland-Niles down Arsenal’s left. 1-1 Forest’s lead lasts three minutes! Arsenal win a very debatable free-kick on the left of Forest’s box – Nelson appeared to dive after a neat nut-meg on Vaughan – and Walcott delivers a brilliant cross to the back post. Holding nods it against the far post, the ball bounces out into a crowd of players and Mertesacker stabs home from six-yards out. Arsenal hit straight back! 1-0 This is a very clever piece of play from Lichaj, to give Forest the lead! From a free-kick on Arsenal’s byline, Dowell curls a pacy cross to Ospina’s near post and Lichaj is completely unmarked to head past the Arsenal keeper. Arsenal were claiming offside but Lichaj lined himself up perfectly with Arsenal wall from the free-kick, which was very deep. From the free-kick, Lichaj heads in! 18 min: Debuchy is caught woefully out of position and Clough has a free run at Mertesacker on Forest’s left. He cuts inside nicely, Mersesacker gets a good block on the shot, but the ball falls to Cash, who laces one towards the bottom corner. Brilliant save from Ospina! The Colombian does fantastically well to tip Cash’s shot wide: just enough to turn it round the post, but not too much that Brereton couldn’t tap the rebound in. 15 min: Both sets of supporters are in good voice. “Champions of Europe, you’ll never sing that”, cry the Forest fans. “Champions of Europe, you weren’t even born” reply the Arsenal lot. 13 min: Arsenal get it wide to Walcott on the right, he crosses for Welbeck but the England international only gets his shoulder to the ball, and the ball trickles wide. 11 min: Forest have their first bit of sustained pressure inside Arsenal’s half, and win their first corner. It will be Kieran Dowell, the youngster on loan from Everton and Forest top scorer this season, who will take it. Poor, doesn’t beat the first man on the near post. 9 min: Nice to see Pat Rice at the back there, alongside David O’Leary. 7 min: A lovely flick from Welbeck carves a gaping hole in the middle of Forest’s defence. A nice ball from Iwobi gives Walcott a clear shot on goal, but the 28-year-old scuffs his shot completely and Smith gathers easily. Good chance wasted. 5 min: Arsenal very lucky to get an offside call, with England U-19 international Brereton put clean through for a one-on-one with Ospina. It was tight, but replays show he was on. 4 min: Forest are pressing Arsenal’s back four extremely high. Mertesacker and Nelson, calm as you like, break the press with some neat passing. 2 min: Looks like Arsenal have lined up in a 3-4-2-1, with Welbeck leading the line in front of Iwobi and Walcott. The insufferable Robbie Savage – former Derby player – in on commentary for BT Sport. Why? Peeeeeeeeeep! And we’re off. The teams are out. Forest in their home red, Arsenal in their changed kit of blue. Can’t say I’ve seen much of 18-year-old Joe Willock, who starts in central midfield for Arsenal today. Where is Coquelin? I wasn’t sure about this personally, but Wenger has confirmed he is allowed to talk to the team in the dressing room beforehand and at half-time, despite his touchline ban. It’s not just because I’m giving this the hard sell, but I genuinely think this is going to be a great game. Young, exciting, largely-homegrown Forest team backed by a sellout crowd v young, partly-exciting, partly-homegrown Arsenal team. These two did meet in the EFL Cup last season at the City Ground. Arsenal cruised to a 4-0 win. Big day for Theo Walcott, who starts up front today alongside Danny Welbeck. He hasn’t made a single league start this season, and has been linked with a January move to former club Southampton, which would be an excellent fit in my opinion. Shop window, etc. Meanwhile, time must be running out for Chuba Akpom, who played for Forest on loan in 2015. He’s 22 now, has played 20 minutes of football all season. Surely he’s got to leave the Emirates. It’s a wonderful sunny day in Nottingham. It’s a sell-out at the City ground. The teams are out for the warm-up. Gary has been the academy manager at Forest since 2012, and has been instrumental in bringing through a lot of excellent players, including goalkeeper Jordan Smith and Joe Worrall, who both start today. There are a lot of young players in the Forest side, seven of the 11 today are 23 years and under. Forest’s caretaker manager Gary Brazil, no relation to Alan, is father to Ellie, a striker at Fiorentina. Read Rich Laverty’s piece from last month. There are two other FA Cup ties going on at the moment. AFC Wimbledon have had about three touches (goal kicks) but are still holding Spurs to 0-0, despite Harry Kane being on the field. West Ham, meanwhile, are doing their best to botch it against League One flyers Shrewsbury. It’s 0-0, you can follow it here with Nick Ames, who is wearing a fetching knitted jumper to my left. Never forget … when Forest hosted Arsenal in 1999. Armand Traoré plays against his former club, it’s good to see Ben Osborn playing in his normal position in midfield, and watch out for Zac Clough - he had a very underwhelming 2017 since his move from Bolton and has been out of favour recently, but the boy has magic in his feet and gets his chance here. It’s just a case of whether Forest can actually keep the ball and get it to him. Matty Cash is also an excellent prospect, another one that hasn’t played much of late but was the subject of a £6m bid from RB Leipzig this time last year. Sweeping changes then for Arsenal. Rob Holding and Ainsley Maitland-Niles are the only two players here that started against Chelsea on Wednesday. Most players from that game haven’t even travelled. Nottingham Forest: Smith, Lichaj, Worrall, Mancienne, Traore, Osborn, Vaughan, Brereton, Dowell, Cash, Clough. Subs: Mills, McKay, Henderson, Bouchalakis, Walker, Cummings, Vellios. Arsenal: Ospina, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Holding, Nelson, Willock, Elneny, Maitland-Niles, Walcott, Iwobi, Welbeck. Subs: Chambers, Reine-Adelaide, Akpom, Da Silva, Macey, Nketiah, Osei-Tutu. Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire) Neither Forest or Arsenal will have a permanent manager in their dugouts today. Caretaker Gary Brazil has taken charge of the home side, following the sacking of Mark Warburton on New Year’s Eve, and promptly earned an impressive 0-0 draw away at Leeds United a day later. Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, has been given a three-match touchline ban and fined £40,000 for his verbal abuse of Mike Dean. He will watch on from the stands today, as well as the Caraboa Cup semi-final with Chelsea on Wednesday and next weekend’s meeting with Bournemouth. Wenger has said that he will rotate his squad for this fixture, but success in recent years in this competition has shown how seriously he takes the FA Cup. With the league title already out of reach, the importance of Arsenal’s cup performances are amplified. Since his appointment in 1996, Wenger has never lost an FA Cup tie at this stage. We’ve already seen one upset today and for some reason, despite Forest’s recent troubles, this stinks to high heaven like the day Wenger comes undone in the third-round Kick-off: 4pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/nelson-flag-battle-of-trafalgar-up-for-sale-sothebys","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T14:24:31Z","webTitle":"Fragment of Nelson's flag from Battle of Trafalgar up for sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/nelson-flag-battle-of-trafalgar-up-for-sale-sothebys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/nelson-flag-battle-of-trafalgar-up-for-sale-sothebys","fields":{"headline":"Fragment of Nelson's flag from Battle of Trafalgar up for sale","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A tattered panel of red, white and blue woollen fabric, an unusually large surviving piece of the union flag flown at Trafalgar from Lord Nelson’s ship Victory – one of hundreds of battle-stained souvenir fragments to which the flag was reduced by sailors grieving for their lost admiral – is to be auctioned by Sotheby’s at an estimated price of up to £100,000. On Nelson’s orders, his fleet flew the union flag as well as the white ensign at the battle against the French on 21 October 1805, which became his greatest victory but which cost him his life. The flags from HMS Victory came back to the UK with his body and were displayed as he lay in state in the Painted Hall at Greenwich, before being carried in his funeral procession to St Paul’s Cathedral in January 1806. The ceremony was supposed to end with the sailors who carried the union flag folding it reverently and laying it on Nelson’s coffin before it was lowered into the grave. The Naval Chronicle recorded what actually happened: “These brave fellows, however, desirous of retaining some memorials of their great and favourite commander, had torn off a considerable part of the largest flag, of which most of them obtained a portion.” Many of the surviving fragments are in museums, including the Maritime Museum at Greenwich, and sales from private collections are rare. This piece was apparently once even larger: it was owned by Capt William Hugh Dobbie – who was not at Trafalgar but serving with the East India Company – and was left by him to the museum of the Royal United Services Institute, which was broken up in the 1960s. Collectors are avid for any Trafalgar memorabilia: the last complete flag from the fleet to be auctioned, from HMS Spartiate, went for almost £400,000 in 2009, 40 times the estimate. The Victory fragment will be sold with other Nelson items, including a cache of his letters, on 17 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/07/new-look-faces-fresh-blow-as-insurer-cuts-cover-for-suppliers-euler-hermes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T07:28:42Z","webTitle":"New Look faces fresh blow as insurer cuts cover for suppliers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/07/new-look-faces-fresh-blow-as-insurer-cuts-cover-for-suppliers-euler-hermes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/07/new-look-faces-fresh-blow-as-insurer-cuts-cover-for-suppliers-euler-hermes","fields":{"headline":"New Look faces fresh blow as insurer cuts cover for suppliers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"New Look is coming under fresh pressure after an insurer stopped selling cover against insolvency to its suppliers, in the latest sign of difficulties for retailers amid a squeeze on consumers’ spending power. The troubles for the high-street fashion chain come after a difficult Christmas for many leading retailers. Credit insurer Euler Hermes is understood to have halted the sale of protection against insolvency to suppliers of New Look, although is still expected to cover any shipments with protection signed before it made the decision to stop fresh sales. The Sunday Times, which first reported the story, said another insurer had reduced coverage levels to suppliers of New Look, but had not withdrawn sales altogether. Credit insurance protects suppliers against the risk of a customer going bust during the period between an order being accepted and payment being made. The loss of such protections can have disastrous consequences for a retailer, having played a part in the demise of high-street names such as Woolworths, Focus DIY and Zavvi. Without cover, retailers can struggle to buy sufficient levels of supplies or can be forced to accept more onerous payment terms. New Look, which has a debt pile of more than £1bn, has seen a drop-off in sales in recent months, with revenue falling by 4.5% to £686m in the six months to 23 September. The company said at the time it had access to £242.5m in cash, which it said was “adequate” for its needs despite tough trading conditions. Controlled by the South African tycoon Christo Wiese through his Brait private equity vehicle, the company received another blow in December when the credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded its debt to junk status. Wiese resigned from the board of South African retailer Steinhoff last month, where he was the largest shareholder, after accounting irregularities came to light. Steinhoff is also the parent company of Poundland, which had seen an insurer cut the level of coverage to its suppliers last month. The discount chain said at the time it was “profitable, cash-generating and trading very strongly”. New Look is attempting to stage a turnaround, after rehiring former executive chairman Alistair McGeorge to help stem falling sales. He is expected to give an update on the firm’s strategy early next month alongside its latest sales update, which will include the key Christmas shopping period. New Look and Euler Hermes declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/07/nigel-farage-to-claim-to-be-voice-of-174m-brexit-voters-when-meeting-barnier","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T12:36:06Z","webTitle":"Farage to claim to be voice of 17.4m Brexit voters when meeting Barnier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/07/nigel-farage-to-claim-to-be-voice-of-174m-brexit-voters-when-meeting-barnier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/07/nigel-farage-to-claim-to-be-voice-of-174m-brexit-voters-when-meeting-barnier","fields":{"headline":"Farage to claim to be voice of 17.4m Brexit voters when meeting Barnier","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nigel Farage will seek to cast himself as the voice of 17.4 million leave voters when he meets the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels. The lifelong Eurosceptic campaigner is due to meet Barnier at the European commission headquarters on Monday at 11am (1000 GMT). Speaking on his LBC radio show on Sunday morning, Farage claimed the EU had not heard the views of 17.4 million leave voters and argued immigration was the main factor that had driven people into the polling booths. “I genuinely don’t think Mr Barnier has heard the views of the 17.4 million people who stood up against the establishment,” Farage told listeners. He went on to outline his opposition to the government’s Brexit strategy of a two-year standstill transition period in which the UK would be subject to EU rules, without any decision-making power. “We didn’t vote for a transition period, we didn’t vote to effectively pay the membership fee for another couple of years, but there are some pretty big issues we did vote on.” His intervention underscores the pressure the government will face in fashioning a Brexit deal, despite the collapse of the Ukip vote in last year’s general election. However, the Ukip MEP’s claim to be the voice of the leave campaign has been given short shrift by Barnier’s officials. Stefaan De Rynck, Barnier’s righthand man, told Farage to “tone it down” , noting that he was hardly the first to represent leave voters, as Barnier meets the British government “all the time”. On Wednesday, Barnier is due to meet other leave campaigners, including Steven Woolfe, the former Ukip MEP who quit the party after being injured in a brawl with a fellow member in the European parliament. Digby Jones, the former trade minister, John Mills, chairman of Labour Leave, and John Longworth, the co-chairman of Leave means Leave, make up the rest of the delegation. The leave campaigners, including Farage, requested a meeting with Barnier after the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke and the Labour peer Andrew Adonis held talks with Barnier last year. Farage has promised to ask Barnier three questions sent in by British voters after launching an appeal for topics on Twitter. The #AskBarnier hashtag attracted a number of pro-remain questions that are unlikely to make the cut. Speaking on LBC, Farage made clear immigration was his priority. “I will talk about trade, but [also] the big picture stuff, why we voted to leave and what the key issues were that motivated voters to stand up as they did on 23 June 2016. “There was one reason that motivated people who had never voted in their lives to go the polling booths on that day and, yes, it was the question of open-door immigration.” Barnier will be in “listening mode” and does not have a fixed agenda for the meeting, according to officials. Since the British government cleared the hurdle to move on to the second phase of Brexit talks in December, no dates have been set for the next rounds of formal negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/07/may-condemns-toby-youngs-comments-but-backs-him-keeping-ofs-post","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T10:45:10Z","webTitle":"May condemns Toby Young's comments but backs him keeping OfS post","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/07/may-condemns-toby-youngs-comments-but-backs-him-keeping-ofs-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/07/may-condemns-toby-youngs-comments-but-backs-him-keeping-ofs-post","fields":{"headline":"May condemns Toby Young's comments but backs him keeping OfS post","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has said Toby Young should be allowed to continue serving on the board of the new higher education watchdog even though she condemned offensive comments he has made in the past. In her first public statement about Young’s appointment, the prime minister said she was not aware of Young’s history of making sexist and homophobic remarks when he got the job and that, if he were to use language like that again, he would be sacked. But she signalled that she was happy for him to remain on the board of the new Office for Students, even though the opposition and the main teaching union, the National Education Union, have said his previous outbursts make him unsuitable for the post. Young, a journalist, was appointed to the OfS principally because of his record as a champion and founder of free schools. The announcement led immediately to intense scrutiny of the many provocative and offensive comments he has made in public in the past, particularly on Twitter. In an interview on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, May said Young had done “exceedingly good work in relation to free schools” and that was why he was appointed. When it was put to her that his appointment jarred with her declaration in her new year’s message that public debate should be conducted “with decency”, May said she was not aware of Young’s comments when he was appointed. She added: “Frankly, I’m not at all impressed by those comments. He’s now in public office and as far as I’m concerned if he was to continue to use that sort of language and talk in that sort of way he would no longer be in public office.” Asked if Young would be allowed to carry on, May said he had apologised and that if he made remarks of this kind again, he would not be allowed to remain in public office. May seemed to be referring to a lengthy statement Young issued last week in which he said that some of his previous remarks had been “sophomoric and silly” and that he regretted those. He continued: “But some have been deliberately misinterpreted to try and paint me as a caricature of a heartless Tory toff. For the record, I’m a supporter of women’s rights and LGBT rights.” Also speaking on the Andrew Marr show, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health spokesman, condemned May for not showing more leadership on this issue. “These tweets from Toby Young are disgusting, offensive, sexist. She should show some leadership; she should get rid of him,” Ashworth said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/07/barcelona-v-levante-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T17:11:09Z","webTitle":"Barcelona v Levante: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/barcelona-v-levante-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/barcelona-v-levante-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona v Levante: La Liga – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So there you have it. A fifth successive clean sheet for Barça. A third consecutive game without a goal for Levante, who were never overwhelmed here and had their moments early in each half, but once they were behind defeat seemed pretty inevitable. Barcelona are now nine points clear of Atletico in second, and 17 ahead of Real Madrid, who play at Celta Vigo later tonight. And they can probably only get better, given recent reinforcements. Levante remain three points above the drop zone. Thanks for following. Bye. And that’s yer lot. Messi, who I’d just said had been quiet, slaloms into the area down the left and pulls it back with precision for Paulinho, who I also said had been quiet, for a simple tap-in. It’s his seventh goal of the season, the best for a midfielder in La Liga this term. 90+2 mins: One last chance for Levante, as a low cross from the left eludes the Barca back line and is knocked back by Samuel for Doucoure who flashes a shot far too high. 90 mins: Four minutes will be added on. 89 mins: Alba is back on the field, though limping, as a Paulinho-Messi give-and-go on the edge of the area doesn’t quite come off. 88 mins: Ouch. Jordi Alba has gone down clutching his left leg, wincing in what looks like considerable pain. It looks like he twisted it after stumbling following a challenge on Samuel. He leaves the field for treatment, and Barca, having used their subs, are momentarily down to 10. 87 mins: Stats fans, Barcelona have completed almost four times as many passes as Levante, which is normal. 85 mins: Barcelona sub: Albaiz comes on for Roberto, creator of the second goal. 84 mins: It’s been a low-key display by Barca in general, this, and though Suarez and Messi have, inevitably, scored they’ve both been quiet by their standards. It’s the engine-room keeping-it-ticking-over players who’ve excelled today – Rakitic, Mascherano, Vermaelen – complemented by some fizz from Dembele earlier and the full-backs Roberto and Alba. Another who’s been quiet, Paulinho, creates a chance with a run into the box but his low cross in can’t quite find Suarez. 83 mins: Barcelona delay Levante’s final substitution for ages and ages by just passing the ball endlessly between each other, the move breaking down when Messi drives into the area and is crowded out. A subsequent foul on Roberto allows the change to be made, Jason making way for Samuel Garcia. 78 mins: Messi wins a free-kick in a dangerous position after being bundled over following some neat interplay between Rakitic, Alba and Gomes. And the free-kick is slammed into the wall but Barca keep possession and Gomes forages into the left of the area with some twisting and turning before his ball in is hacked clear. 76 mins: Barcelona substitution: Iniesta off, as per, after a quietly effective display of his wonderful arts, to be replaced by Andre Gomes/ 73 mins: Levante’s attempt to be more expansive this half has been admirable, given this side was selected with half an eye on their Copa del Rey second leg against Espanyol (where they lead 2-1). They make another sub anyway, Boateng off for Nano. 72 mins: Suarez is denied twice by Oier after beating the offside trap to take down a long ball and hammering it at the keeper, whose second save goes behind for a corner, which Levante clear. 70 mins: Moore’s cross from the right finds Doucoure, who turns neatly but is dispossessed by Mascherano. 69 mins: Semedo is involved straight away, foraging down the right and winning a corner when his ball in from the by-line is volleyed behind. 67 mins: Barcelona substitution – one summer signing for another, Semedo for Dembele, who’s looked sparky and impressive. Sergi Roberto will push forward on the right with Semedo tucking in behind him at right-back. 65 mins: Levante chance! A lovely flowing move ends with Moore being found by the increasingly influential Jason in space on the right of the area, and his low shot is well blocked with is legs by Ter Stergen who concedes a corner. This is the visitors’ best spell of the game, even if the corner is wasted via a sliced cross-shot 63 mins: Substitution: Levante bring on the defender Pier for Lerma, who gets through the afternoon without seeing red. 62 mins: Another Levante attack from the left, as Jason cuts into the area from the left but his ensuing cross-shot is scooped weakly over 60 mins: Levante have found some space behind the midfield line on a few occasions this afternoon, and a sweeping breakaway on the left finds some more but the move breaks down when two attackers collide when meeting the low ball in from the left. 58 mins: Messi smartly plays in Roberto down the right but his low ball across the area fails to find a finisher and Suarez is in any case penalised for clattering into Cabaco. 57 mins: A Barcelona shot. Dembele, Rakitic and Alba combine smartly on the left before the ball is laid back to Dembele who cracks it high, wide and not particularly handsomely over the bar. 56 mins: Some neat quickfire passing in their own half gets Levante out of bother but the attack fizzles out on the right and we’re back to the Barcelona keep-ball experience. 54 mins: Dembele’s trickery certainly brings something (even more) to this team, and he dances past two players to win a throw in the corner, from which it’s worked out left to Messi then Alba, who’s well closed down by the American defender Moore as he bears down on goal. Barca haven’t had a shot in this half yet. Rubbish. 51 mins: Levante win a free-kick, curved menacingly to the back post by Ivi, and beyond Ter Stergen but Barca clear and press again. 50 mins: The crowd here is a meagre 56,000, though this isn’t the most high-profile of weekends or of fixtures. Barca are now composing themselves after a bright start from Levante and knocking it around in a cool and carefree fashion. 48 mins: Another neat flowing move from Levante from left to right before Alba closes down Doucoure on the edge of the box and the danger passes. 47 mins: Levante attack first in this half, as they did in the first, and win a corner down the right but the ensuing delivery doesn’t beat the first man, who is Suarez, but Levante win it back and Ivi draws an excellent save from Ter Stegen, deftly beating two men before unleashing from 25 yards. The keeper does well to tip it over. We’re back underway Half-time thoughts on the Twitters, from John McEnerny: “PC the long term replacement for the giant that is Iniesta,they’re having a laugh He’ll free up Iniesta for the CL cos La Liga is more or less wrapped up. He’s a good player but he’ll never come close 2 Iniesta’s level one of the all time greats of the game!” Maybe not, but it’s a nice problem/argument to have. Paulinho almost rounds off another spell of possession by bursting through in the box but is forced wide and denied. And that ends the first-half. Barcelona took a few minutes to hit their stride, but only a few, and have been in control since taking the lead. Levante have never won a league point at the Camp Nou and don’t look like getting one here. Their goal drought continues. See you in 15 minutes. 45 mins: Nearly another for Messi – a ball over the top on the left puts him clear but his angled shot is blocked by Oier. 44 mins: Barcelona have had more than 71% possession – is this more of the radical non-possession much discussed recently, or have they just not given Levante much of a sniff. Dembele has another dart into the box past two men but Levante clear. 43 mins: Suárez and Messi interchange intricately on the edge of the box but though Messi is crowded out he works it back to Rakitic who sends a rasping volley just wide of the right-hand post. 41 mins: Barca build again from the corner and Iniesta gets to the left by-line and sends a hanging cross into the box for Vermaelen who can only head weakly at Oier. 40 mins: Barça are rampant now and Messi wins another free-kick after a Lukic handball. But we are told, remarkably, that they haven’t scored from a free-kick this season. And they don’t from this one, Messi’s delivery being deflected wide off the wall for a corner. A long meandering spell of Barcelona possession explodes into life with a raking long ball forward down the right by Mascherano for Roberto who volleys in a brilliant cross first-time for Suarez, who takes it down and belts it high into the corner. An excellent goal. 35 mins: A painful clash of heads between Vermaelen and Boateng as they contest a high ball forward sends both players to the turf, and in need of treatment off the pitch. But both are given the Ok to return to the field. 34 mins: More defensive dawdling by Barcelona goes unpunished as an attempt by Doucoure to rob Paulinho is a rashly executed clumsy foul. 32 mins: Messi’s free-kick clears the six-man wall but goes over and wide by about six inches. 31 mins: Lerma’s in damger of losing the plot here, conceding another free-kick after ramming into Iniesta. He gets another talking to but no further sanction. Postigo does, though, seeing yellow for tripping … you guessed it, Messi. 29 mins: Lerma, already booked, is living dangerously, clattering Messi’s left leg to concede another free-kick. The Argentinian wins another within a few seconds, and then gets on the end of Iniesta’s lofted ball forward towards the right byline but is crowded out and Levante clear. 26 mins: Close! The exciting Dembele forages forward, driving down the inside right channel before sending a powerful drive to Oier’s right that the keeper palms out to Suarez who blooters the rebound over the bar. 24 mins: Some lax defending from Barca almost lets Levante through as Vermaelen is robbed by Boateng who drives forward at speed but his ball for the onrushing Ivi finds the latter offside. 21 mins: Alba skips down the left and pulls it back for Paulinho whose heavy touch on the edge of the area upsets the swift flow of the move and Levante can regroup and clear. Boateng goes down with what looks like a calf twinge but can carry on. 19 mins: From the corner Levante manage to retain possession and spray it around on the edge of the area for a while before being harried out for a Barca throw. 18 mins: Levante have something about them on the counterattack with Lerma, Boateng and Doucoure but you can see why goals have been hard to come by. Rakitic and Messi are pulling plenty of strings elegantly when Barca get it though. Levante get another corner when Ivi picks the ball up 20 yards out, brings it down and sees a fierce low shot deflected behind. 16 mins: Levante get some respite and Doucoure bombs down the right behind the home side’s lines but Boateng makes a hash of the sharp low ball in, mis-hitting it rashly wide. 14 mins: Alba, Messi and Iniesta combine beautifully down the left and the latter’s pull-back is cleared. Barcelona come again and Suarez’s firm swivel and close-range shot is beaten away. The expected pattern is now emerging. That man again. Some trickery on the right from Demebele who plays in Roberto down the right, and after the ball is played in high for Alba who heads it precisely down for Messi who volleys it down against the right-hand post and it rebounds in. Barca lead without having impressed particularly thus far. 11 mins: Up the other end, Iniesto dinks a ball in from the left for Suarez who can only scoop it tamely into the keeper’s hands. 10 mins: A Messi-Suarez one-two is well-blocked and cleared, enabling Ivi to smartly set up a counter, beating a couple of challenges and playing in Doucoure for a cross that Ter Stegen claws away and Barca clear the danger. 9 mins: Messi’s free-kick is curled tantalisingly towards the far post with the left foot, but it just about eludes everyone – including the keeper and onrushing Mascherano – and goes behind for a goalkick. 8 mins: Messi sees the ball for the first time and skips past a couple of challenges before being banjo-ed by a very late challenge from Lerma, who receives the game’s first booking. 6 mins: Barcelona get a chance to finally have a settled spell in possession, and Iniesta wins a free-kick just after halfway after drawing a rash challenge from Doucoure. The free-kick is lumped forward for Alba on the left channel but he’s flagged offside. 4 mins: Lerma seizes on a loose pass from Dembele in midfielder and drives forward to set up a cross from the right for Boateng that’s headed behind for another corner. This has been a sprightly start from Levante, a lazy one from Barça, but the corner is cleared easily enough. 2 mins: Levante win an early corner as a long ball for Boateng to chase is turned behind by Mascherano, who’s expected to be off to China this month. The corner is cleared but played back into Lerma on the left-hand side of the box but he blasts it high over the bar from an angle. The visitors get us underway, Levante’s experimental line-up in a nominal 4-3-3, Barça 4-4-2. It’s grey and wet in Catalonia, as the teams make their way out. Ground not full. Dembele finally making his first La Liga start at the Camp Nou. While we’re waiting, you can dip into some proper English FA Cup action, where Shrewsbury have looked the likelier side against West Ham in a first half that has just ended goalless. Nick Ames is talking us through that here. Barcelona: Ter Stegen; S Roberto, Alba, Mascherano, Vermaelen; Paulinho, Iniesta, Rakitic, Dembélé; Messi, L Suárez. Subs: Cillesen, Semedo, Piqué, Digne, D Suarez, Gomes, Arnaiz. Levante: Oier; Moore, Luna, Cabaco, Postigo; Lerma, Jason, Doukoure, Lukic; Ivi, Boateng, Jason. Subs: Raul, Tono Garcia, Rober Pier, Samuel, Coke, Nano, El Hacen. Anyway, it was a lively old day of action in La Liga yesterday. Diego Costa did the most Diego Costa-ish thing imaginable on his league return for Atletico Madrid, scoring and getting himself sent off in one fell swoop, while the Andulacian derby between Sevilla and Real Betis was a bit of a humdinger, the latter winning 5-3 with second-half goals from Riza Durmisi, Sergio Leon and Clement Lenglet taking the game away from the home side, who look as if they’ll struggle to gain another place in the Champions League. Afternoon everyone. “We’ve caught [PSG] peeing in the swimming pool and Neymar is peeing off the diving board.” Not my words, the words of La Liga president Javier Tebas, expressing his outrage in August over the whopping £198m deal that took the Brazilian from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain. Anyway, turns out the water in that pool isn’t so rancid after all, with Barça jumping in themselves – their splurging of up to £142m on Philippe Coutinho is the big transfer talking point of the hour. Well that Neymar cash was never going to just sit there, and the former Liverpool playmaker joins Ousmane Dembélé, Nelson Semedo and Paulinho as chief Barça beneficiaries of that massive summer windfall. But anyway, though for some the key appeal of January football is self-important men waving large sums of money about, there is some actual football to be played. And Barcelona’s first La Liga assignment since their imperious demolition of Real Madrid just before Christmas brings Levante up the coast to the Camp Nou. Juan Ramón López Muñiz’s side haven’t conceded in their past two league games – they’ve not scored either – as they dig in to avoid yo-yoing back to the second tier again, so the leaders may not have it all their own way. Nonetheless, you’d expect Barça to stretch their lead at the top to nine points. Coutinho will be sitting in the stands, and doubtless the subject of many TV camera close-ups, as he gets to run the rule over his new muckers. The general sense is that the league title is almost in the bag for Ernesto Valverde’s team but Barcelona’s current place in the pan-European scheme of things is less easy to gauge after an autumn where the pace and attention was set by the lavishly bankrolled swagger of Manchester City and PSG. We’ll find out soon enough. Kick-off 3.15pm GMT. Tom will be here soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-v-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T15:56:34Z","webTitle":"Shrewsbury Town v West Ham United: FA Cup third round – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-v-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-v-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-live","fields":{"headline":"Shrewsbury Town v West Ham United: FA Cup third round – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With that, I pass you to Michael Butler for Nottingham Forest v Arsenal, which will surely be better than what we’ve just seen. Enjoy that, and thanks for your company here! A late Shrewsbury break causes a scramble on then edge of West Ham’s box but that’s it now, we are done. That was, if you strip the context away, a godforsaken affair. A patched-up West Ham got better as it went on but Shrewsbury should have won it if anyone should, Sadler drawing a first-half save from Hart and Nolan blasting a good chance over near the end. The Hammers created nothing, zero, nada, niente, no chances whatsoever. They get an extra game for their troubles but, on the bright side, seem to have averted the biggest threat of an upset. Shrewsbury can be proud of a bright effort and might as well have another good go in the replay. 90+2 min: I don’t get the impression there will be a goal. 90 min: Four minutes of added time will be played. This game doesn’t deserve a goal, unless perhaps Shrewsbury can sneak one. 88 min: Whalley goes off now and on comes Arthur Gnahoua. 87 min: Big chance for Nolan! The free-kick is delivered, Nsiala heads across goal and Payne slides in heroically at the far post to stop it going out of play. It’s cut back to Nolan, 10 yards out, who blasts over with the headlines in sight! 85 min: Reid seemed to twist his knee while making a clearance. He’s going to come off and the midfielder Domingos Quina will replace him, presumably with Kouyate dropping back as a result. Moyes will be worried by this. 84 min: Obiang cynically fouls the breaking Nolan midway inside the West Ham half. Should be booked; I’m not sure he was. We’ll have another delay now in this fractured and, I’ll say it now, turgid game because Reid is down. 82 min: Another Shrews change. Morris goes off, top scorer Payne enters the fray. Can he conjure something up off the bench ...? This game has been dying a death. 82 min: Cullen is back with us. His tooth has, apparently, been placed in a cup of milk. 80 min: Obiang has half a sight on the left edge of the area after some nice footwork, but drags harmlessly wide. 78 min: While Cullen is off, Obiang delivers the free-kick. It’s enough to say West Ham will wish he hadn’t. 77 min: And ... oooof ... it looks as if Cullen has lost a tooth there. Replays show it shooting out of his mouth as he was challenged, to be collected from the turf by West Ham’s physio later. Not nice. 76 min: Cullen wins a free-kick about 35 yards out, but receives a cut in the process and will need treatment for the game’s latest blood injury. Meantime, Derby loanee Max Lowe comes on to replace Rodman for the hosts –making his debut for them. 73 min: Ogogo and Rodman combine in the box but the latter can’t quite make space for the shot. The former then tries to return the ball with interest but crosses straight into Hart’s arms. A bit more life from the Shrews there after a quiet 15 minutes or so. 72 min: A West Ham change. Hernandez, who has had absolutely no impact, is replaced by young striker Antonio Martinez. 71 min: I’m not going to say I’ve been unlucky with my football games this weekend but I was at Norwich v Chelsea yesterday. 68 min: Now West Ham get some decent “ball” in the Shrews’ half, led by Masuaku and Cullen. That’s what they need to do. Start moving the ball around, make the opponent work. 66 min: Cullen has moved into the middle, I think. That makes sense, he’s a nice little footballer and might get them playing a bit more. 64 min: If West Ham have improved in this half, and I think they have, it’s been very minimal. Still no sign of a goal from either side, if we’re honest. 61 min: Masuaku shows some much needed drive and wins a corner from Godfrey down on the byline. It’s very well headed out. Cullen’s ball in was again menacing. 60 min: Beckles somehow works an angle and clips a beautiful ball on the left; Rice, at full stretch, has to glance behind before an attacker can convert. The hosts have a corner on the right but there’s a push somewhere and a free-kick is given to the Hammers. 57 min: Sadler is back on, wrapped up in bandages and all sorts. He’ll be an unmistakable figure now. West Ham failed to make use of their power play. 55 min: It’s Shrewsbury who make a chance though – Nolan is ready to lash one at goal from an angle only for Rodman, his own team-mate, to take it away from him! 54 min: Yep, he’s gone down the tunnel so you’d expect Shrewsbury to be down to 10 for the next five minutes at least. Can West Ham capitalise? 53 min: Sadler has another problem: that blood is now streaming all down his face, it’s Terry Butcher all over again, he’s had to go off and you’d expect stitches looking at that ... 52 min: It’s hard to escape the conclusion that this will finish 0-0. West Ham are at least getting on the ball a tiny bit more at the moment though, and Ayew harmlessly flicks an Obiang free-kick towards goal after one move. 49 min: Masuaku, who is improving quite a lot from the bits I’ve seen of West Ham lately, does well to keep Whalley from getting to the ball at the byline and wins himself a goal kick. 47 min: Rodman makes big inroads and has space to shoot at goal on the 18 yard line. But he doesn’t, preferring to lay the ball to the right and eventually seeing the move break down. He should have shot – it was a decent position! 46 min: Hart catches an early, swirling cross from Whalley well. Will the Shrews be able to keep their tempo up? No changes. Will West Ham step things up a gear? Anyway, come back now if you can – we’re a couple of minutes from the second half! Truth, there. The half ends with some good Shrewsbury pressure – including a shot wide by Nolan, a teasing low cross from Morris and a corner that momentarily causes chaos. They’ve been much the better here, and came close to taking the lead when Hart saved very well from Sadler. West Ham look tired and disjointed and have offered the square root of nothing. Join me for what will, hopefully, be rather more than that in 15 minutes’ time! 45 min: Godfrey looks a very good player and surely has a future at Norwich, as a bare minimum. He wins another set piece with some lovely skill and strength. It doesn’t come to a lot though and the half is drifting to a close. 43 min: Then Kouyate gives Ayew a sight on the right side of the area but his attempt isn’t really a cross or a shot. Henderson gathers. That was the best move they’ve put together, which is saying nothing. 42 min: Hernandez holds the ball up well inside the home half and wins a free-kick. That was better, I suppose. Cullen, whose deliveries are decent, puts another nice one in but Nsiala is up high to head away. 39 min: Henderson punches away a deep Cullen free-kick. It was something for the Shrewsbury goalkeeper to do. 37 min: The flag kick is dealt with. But West Ham are on the rack. The pressure, just now, is unrelenting and Rodman forces Hart into another parry from 18 yards after cutting inside. 36 min: And Sadler almost breaks the deadlock! A kind ricochet sets him through on Hart, at an angle on the left inside the box, and the hometown boy dives to his left and tips away superbly! The hosts would have deserved that! Now they win a corner ... 35 min: Yes, they’re both back on and this scruffy, messy game gets back underway. 34 min: Sadler is bleeding heavily after all that and is being treated, too, on the sidelines by his own physio. He’s being patched up; Ayew is, meanwhile, being helped up and while care will need to be taken it seems as if he’ll be OK. 32 min: Now Ayew is down after a clash of heads with Sadler, which looked very painful. The physio is on. 31 min: Nsiala creates space in his own half with a lovely dummy and releases Morris with a raking pass down the right channel, but Reid is in the right place to cut the move out. Shortly afterwards Nsiala produces something very similar and the pressure is this time sustained, finishing with a Beckles blast from 25 yards that sails not too far over. 28 min: West Ham haven’t offered a thing since that early Kouyate glanced header, which wasn’t really a close call at all. 26 min: Obiang is told to calm down after tripping the impressive Nolan. Shrewsbury look the more nimble and mobile. Whalley’s free-kick sails all the way to Godfrey at the far post; he just can’t quite get enough on it and Hart is down to gather. 24 min: Another Shrewsbury free-kick is plopped towards the box by Sadler, but doesn’t quite get there and West Ham launch a break that ends with a poor ball from Masuaku towards Ayew, which runs out of play. 21 min: Nolan makes ground down the right but Ogbonna cuts out his ball aimed for Whalley. Shrewsbury are really forcing the issue at the moment. Hernandez is up and about, by the way, after clutching his knee. 18 min: And at the moment this is panning out as predicted in the first couple of minutes: next to no space out there, a fair tempo but no real cohesion, real industry and energy from the home team, who are certainly having a good go. Hernandez, meanwhile, is down and in some pain ... 16 min: A much deeper Shrewsbury free-kick, aimed in by Whalley, causes much more trouble and forces Reid to concede a corner. It gives rise to some head tennis inside the area but, at length, West Ham get it away. 13 min: Joe Hart is wearing a cap to deal with the bright sun. He appeared to borrow it from a fan in the away support a few minutes in! 12 min: ... but Nolan’s shot is poor, aimed straight into the wall when it called for some whip and dip. 11 min: Godfrey breaks through midfield brilliantly for the Shrews and frees Rodman, who is fouled in a great position 25 yards out ... 10 min: Something happens now, Masuaku winning West Ham a corner on the left. The first delivery from Cullen is headed out well by Morris; his second is whipped in deliciously and glanced a couple of yards wide by Kouyate. 7 min: I might be wrong but get the feeling this is going to be very scrappy unless something happens early. Understandably so. The ball is mainly pinging around between the boxes with little real control. 5 min: Moyes stressed pre-match that these are the only players he has available. They’ve played Tuesday-Thursday-Sunday after all. It’s a bit much. 3 min: I should have mentioned – Newport have beaten Leeds 2-1, right at the death, in this lunchtime’s other tie. A shock already! 2 min: The home side press well early on, but Hart deals well with an awkward clearance. Doesn’t look as if there’ll be loads of space out there for West Ham on this evidence. Shrewsbury kick right to left, West Ham the other way. Anyway – the teams are out on the pitch! We’re almost ready. It’s a beautiful sunny day. Dangermen for the Shrews? There are a few but they have a couple of good players on loan from Norwich, Carlton Morris and Ben Godfrey. Morris, a talented forward, has six goals but has not scored since November. Eight-goal Stefan Payne is on the bench, Hurst: “Lots of things have fallen into place but first of all it’s the players. The performances and commitment this season have been excellent and we hope to show that again today.” It’s been done, hasn’t it, Wigan&gt; Hammers fans, are you happy with that team? Shrews well-wishers, who should they be worried by? It will be interesting to see how Josh Cullen, recently on loan at Bolton and a decent young prospect, does in Moyes’s midfield. Reece Burke, the right wing-back, is back from Bolton too and similarly well thought-of. Shrewsbury: Henderson, Godfrey, Sadler, Beckles, Whalley, Ogogo, Morris, Bolton, Nolan, Nsiala, Rodman. Subs: Macgillivrary, Lowe, Dodds, Gnahoua, John-Lewis, B Morris, Payne. West Ham: Hart, Burke, Rice, Reid, Ogbonna, Masuaku, Kouyate, Obiang, Cullen, Ayew, Hernandez. Subs: Adrian, Neufville, Quina, Makasi, Samuelsen, Haksabanovic, Martinez. Joe Hart is, of course, back in Shrewsbury where it all began. Not only does he get a these days rare game – he gets the West Ham captaincy too! Otherwise it’s a quite decent looking mix of promise and experience for West Ham. Javier Hernandez could probably do with a goal or two here. Hello. Think of Shrewsbury and you think of lower-league strugglers, coracles, peat bog pitches at Gay Meadow, dim floodlights and dramatic late Nigel Jemson winners against Everton – managed by none other than David Moyes! Things have moved on a tad now. They play at a shinier new ground for one thing; for another thing they are currently second in League One, five points ahead of third place and going great guns under a very promising manager in Paul Hurst. Even if they aren’t that gritty and grotty anymore, this has “cupset” scrawled large. West Ham may have shut out the bigger sides effectively under Moyes but their relegation battle is taking a toll and, for one thing, they may make a few changes this afternoon. For another, this is another form of homecoming for Moyes himself – he played for Shrewsbury between 1987 and 1990, sticking his head in where it hurt at centre-back, and wouldn’t it be something to bloody the nose of an old boy who has moved on to various more exotic adventures? Yes, it would. Can Shrewsbury emulate Coventry and claim a top-flight scalp?

Shawn McCoulsky, on loan from Bristol City, was the hero for the League Two club as his 89th-minute header took Newport into the FA Cup fourth round for the first time since 1979. It was a dramatic finish to an absorbing game and there were wild scenes at the end as Newport, 53 places below Leeds on the league ladder, pulled off a famous victory that will be talked about in these parts for years to come. Michael Flynn, Newport’s 37-year-old manager, was not even born the last time the club won a third-round tie. Although Newport scored twice in the final 15 minutes, this was no smash-and-grab victory. Flynn’s side played with spirit and belief throughout, looked much more dangerous going forward and possessed the best player on the pitch in Robbie Willmott, who was working as a maintenance man for a supermarket before joining Newport in the summer. As for Leeds, any sympathy for the Championship club will be in short supply, given the team that Thomas Christiansen picked. The Leeds manager made nine changes to the side who drew against Nottingham Forest on New Year’s Day and paid a heavy price for doing so. Flynn was honest enough to admit that he felt “a little bit more confident” from the moment the visitors’ team sheet arrived in the Newport dressing room. Although Christiansen defended his selection afterwards, pointing out he had adopted a similar approach in the Carabao Cup this season and enjoyed a degree of success, it was a risky path to go down against Newport, especially bearing in mind what happened to Leeds in the FA Cup fourth round last year, when Garry Monk fielded a reserve team at Sutton United and the non-league club inflicted a humiliating defeat. Leeds started brightly enough against Newport, taking the lead through the first goal of Gaetano Berardi’s career, yet they never imposed themselves thereafter and it felt as if it would be only a matter of time before the home team levelled. That moment arrived when Conor Shaughnessy turned Frank Nouble’s low cross into his own net, setting the stage for McCoulsky to nod home the winner emphatically. To compound a miserable day for Leeds, Samuel Sáiz was sent off seconds later for allegedly spitting at a Newport player. Christiansen, who said he did not witness the incident involving Sáiz, took responsibility for the result but was clearly hugely disappointed by the performance. “When you look at the players we had in the first XI today, it’s players who have had possibilities in the first XI. For this we expect more and it should be enough to pass to the next round but unfortunately it was not. I take the blame,” he said. In truth all the ingredients were there for an upset before a ball had been kicked. It was a bitterly cold afternoon in south Wales as a biting wind swept across a surface that was always likely to cause a few problems as the ball bobbled around and players struggled to keep their footing. Throw understrength opponents into the mix as well and Newport could have been forgiven for sensing blood. Despite all of that it was Leeds who seized the initiative early on. Berardi, one of the two survivors from the team who started against Forest, pounced on a loose ball about 25 yards from goal and thumped a low, swerving shot that flashed past Joe Day. Newport, however, refused to be discouraged and kept probing, with Willmott producing an endless supply of crosses from the right. Pádraig Amond volleyed over, saw another effort cleared off the line and later hit the side netting. Joss Labadie also had a couple of excellent chances. Newport’s persistence eventually paid off when Nouble escaped on the right and produced the sort of cross that defenders dread. Shaughnessy, under pressure, knew he had to make contact with the ball and ended up diverting it into his own net with what seemed to be more shin than boot. Flynn’s side were not finished, however, and McCoulsky, on as a second-half substitute, completed the turnaround with a towering header. Flynn, who is making quite a name for himself after keeping Newport in the Football League against the odds at the end of last season, described his players as “outstanding” and hopes to be rewarded with a plum tie. “This is huge for the club and the city,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of tough times but hopefully we’re going in the right direction and this shows it. We’re in the fourth round now and, being a Liverpool fan, I’d love to get them at Anfield – but I’ll take whatever makes the club the most money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/french-singer-and-eurovision-winner-france-gall-dies-age-70","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T19:08:59Z","webTitle":"France Gall: French singer who inspired My Way dies age 70","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/french-singer-and-eurovision-winner-france-gall-dies-age-70","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/french-singer-and-eurovision-winner-france-gall-dies-age-70","fields":{"headline":"France Gall: French singer who inspired My Way dies age 70","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French singer France Gall, who inspired the original version of the song that became a worldwide hit for Frank Sinatra as My Way, has died in a Paris hospital aged 70, her spokeswoman announced. On learning of her death from an infection two years after she was diagnosed with cancer, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, tweeted: “She leaves behind songs that everyone in France knows, and set an example of a life devoted to others.” The French culture minister, Françoise Nyssen, described her as “a timeless icon of French song”. The song that became My Way was originally released in 1968 as Comme d’Habitude by singer-songwriter Claude François as a bleak reflection on the breakup of his affair with Gall. In the original version, the final curtain was lowering on love, not on life as in the Sinatra version: the about-to-be-forsaken lover returns to an empty house, “as usual”, and retires “all alone ... in this big, empty bed”. Gall, born into a musical family in 1947, recorded her first hit, Don’t Be So Stupid, when she was 16. In 1965, she won the Eurovision song contest, representing Luxembourg, with the Serge Gainsbourg song Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son – beating the UK’s Kathy Kirby. A tribute to her was posted on the Eurovision website, and a tweet from the official Eurovision account expressed sorrow “on behalf of the entire Eurovision family”. Gainsbourg later plunged Gall into controversy when she had a massive hit with his sexually suggestive song, Les Sucettes (Lollipops), complete with promotional images of her dressed in a skimpy bikini and licking a lolly. She said later she had been too young to understand the double entendre of the lyrics, and refused either to perform it or to work with Gainsbourg again. Despite her success, Gall’s life was marked by tragedy. She had another major international hit in 1987 with the album Babacar – including the song Ella, elle l’a, her tribute to Ella Fitzgerald – with music and lyrics by her husband and musical partner Michel Berger, who died in 1992 aged 44. She retired from recording and performing in 1997, following the death from cystic fibrosis of their eldest child, Pauline. She devoted herself largely to humanitarian work until a comeback performance in a 2015 stage show based on her and her husband’s songs. The rights to Comme d’Habitude were bought by the singer-songwriter Paul Anka after he heard it by chance while staying in Paris. He completely rewrote the English lyrics into an end-of-life boastful valediction, especially for Frank Sinatra, who released his version in 1969."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/stone-age-hunter-gatherers-paradise-discovered-in-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T14:31:51Z","webTitle":"Stone age hunter-gatherers' 'paradise' discovered next to major Israeli road","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/stone-age-hunter-gatherers-paradise-discovered-in-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/stone-age-hunter-gatherers-paradise-discovered-in-israel","fields":{"headline":"Stone age hunter-gatherers' 'paradise' discovered next to major Israeli road","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Israeli archaeologists have uncovered next to one of the country’s busiest roads the site of an extraordinarily well preserved prehistoric “paradise” used by stone age hunter-gatherers over half a million years ago, who left behind evidence of hundreds of knapped flint hand-axes. The discovery at about a five-metre depth at Jaljulia, near the town of Kfar Saba, suggests that an extinct species of early human - homo erectus – may have returned to the site repeatedly, perhaps attracted by a water source and abundant game, leaving behind evidence of their primitive stone tools. Archaeologists believe the site, north-east of Tel Aviv, was regarded as a sort of “paradise” for prehistoric hunter-gatherers – with a stream, vegetation and an abundance of animals encouraging them to return. The site’s extended area was uncovered in recent months in a joint dig conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority in cooperation with the archaeological department in Tel Aviv University. The most striking find was evidence of a well-developed lithic industry – referring to elaborately worked stone tools – including hundreds of flint hand-axes typical of the ancient Acheulian culture that existed in the Lower Paleolithic era from about 1.5 million to 200,000 years ago. Acheulian axe-making culture – associated with homo erectus and early homo sapiens – is characterised by distinctive oval and pear-shaped flint hand tools used by early humans. The dating of finds of Acheulian hand-axes – which scientists now believe were used for a variety of purposes from butchering to digging – has been used to trace the early human migration out of Africa into Asia and Europe. Archaeologists have long believed that the presence of good quality stone including jasper and flint attracted early humans to certain sites. Researchers believe that the fact that the site appears to have been occupied repeatedly indicates that prehistoric humans possessed a geographic memory of the place, and could have returned there as part of a seasonal cycle. Maayan Shemer, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: “Coming to work in Jaljulia, nobody expected to find evidence of such an ancient site, let alone one so extensive and with such impressive finds. “There are only two sites [in Israel] whose estimated age is close to Jaljulia in the Sharon, or central Israel: one in Kibbutz Eyal, approximately 5km to the north, and the other, dated to a slightly later cultural phase, at Qesem Cave located approximately 5km to the south. “The findings are amazing, both in their preservation state and in their implications about our understanding of this ancient material culture.” Ran Barkai, of Tel Aviv University, added: “This extraordinary site will enable us to trace the behaviour of our direct prehistoric ancestors, and reconstruct their lifestyle and behaviour on the very long journey of human existence.“"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/08/bbc-iplayer-enjoys-record-week-christmas-eastenders-peaky-blinders","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"BBC iPlayer enjoys record week as viewers switch off traditional TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/08/bbc-iplayer-enjoys-record-week-christmas-eastenders-peaky-blinders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/08/bbc-iplayer-enjoys-record-week-christmas-eastenders-peaky-blinders","fields":{"headline":"BBC iPlayer enjoys record week as viewers switch off traditional TV","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"BBC iPlayer enjoyed a record week between Christmas and new year as viewers turned away from traditional television channels in favour of on-demand and streaming services. Viewers streamed more programmes and spent more time on iPlayer between Monday 25 December and Sunday 31 December than any other week. There were 69.2m requests to watch programmes on iPlayer during the week and viewers spent 25.6m hours on the service. This compares with 58.6m requests and 22.5m hours between 25 December and 31 December last year. Watching television at Christmas is a long-standing tradition but viewing figures on the main channels such as BBC and ITV have fallen to a record low in recent years, as increasing numbers of people have turned to on-demand services such as Netflix or DVD boxsets instead. The BBC adapted to the change in viewing habits for Christmas 2017 by making popular programmes from its archive available on iPlayer, including Peaky Blinders, Line of Duty, Planet Earth and Blue Planet. Charlotte Moore, the BBC director of content, said: “It’s hugely exciting to see such unprecedented numbers come to BBC iPlayer this Christmas. The public have responded in their millions to the amazing range of content we’ve offered – and for those who are loving our special Christmas box-set collection there are still a few days to go.” The extra programmes have been requested 29.4m times since they were made available – an average of more than 1.5m a day. The most popular box sets include Peaky Blinders, which has been requested more than 8m times. The most popular individual show on iPlayer during the festive period was the Christmas Day episode of EastEnders, which was requested 1.6m times. Six of the top 10 shows on iPlayer were episodes of EastEnders, with other popular programmes including the series four finale of Peaky Blinders and the Christmas specials of Doctor Who and Mrs Brown’s Boys. Mrs Brown’s Boys was also one of the most watched shows on BBC1 on Christmas Day. The top Christmas Day programme was Call the Midwife, which attracted 9.6 million viewers, while Mrs Brown’s Boys was watched by 9 million, and Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders were watched by more than 8 million viewers. Although the BBC said its Christmas performance was “strong”, the Christmas Day viewing figures compare unfavourably with the 16 million who watched Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death in 2008."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/07/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-five-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T03:36:21Z","webTitle":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England, fifth Test, day five – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/07/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-five-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/07/ashes-2017-18-australia-v-england-fifth-test-day-five-live","fields":{"headline":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England, fifth Test, day five – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Steve Smith receives the Ashes trophy, beckons his team onto podium and holds it up in triumph. “Come on!” he shouts. Come on indeed. Australia have stuffed England, and the 4-0 scoreline flatters them not one jot. They’re an excellent side, with a dream bowling attack and an all-time-great batsman. That’s it for our Ashes liveblog. On behalf of all the OBO writers, thanks heaps for your company throughout the series. Even for an England fan, it’s been great fun. Sort of. The Compton-Miller Medal for Player of the Series goes to Steve Smith “It’s been a great couple of months. The cricket we’ve played has been outstanding. All the bowlers have taken over 20 wickets, which is exceptional. England have played some exceptional cricket but we’ve been able to win those key moments and not let them back in the game. It’s nice to have the five Test matches without these injuries. So much work was done before the series to ensure the bowlers would be fit for the series. I’m really proud of everyone in that group.” Joe Root is asleep in the changing-room, so Jimmy Anderson is stepping up for a chat “We’ve been outplayed in the key moments of each game. Credit to Steve and his team, they were a far better side. They’ve got a fantastic bowling attack and all the batsmen have scored runs when the team needed them. We haven’t done that. We’ve very lucky to have such great support and we’re very grateful for them even though we’ve been beaten in this series.” The Man of the Match is Pat Cummins “I couldn’t have asked for much more than to get through the five Tests and win the series. It’s everything I could have asked for. To be in th thick of an Ashes series ... I’ve loved any minute of it.” It was a fairly competitive series until the second day at Perth, when Australia really started to crush England. Anyway, there is plenty of time for post-mortems. It’s time for the players to open their faces and let some words spill out. The players from both sides shake hands on the field. England don’t have the thousand-yard stares on, as they did at this stage in 2013-14. I don’t know whether that’s a good or bad thing. Australia have been far too powerful in these conditions, and it would have been more emphatic but for a few slow pitches. I’m going to hand to Rob for the post-match. Racing downstairs for the press conference. Thanks for your company. Bye! As expected, it is nine out and all out with Root not joining Curran when Anderson edges the first ball of Hazlewood’s fresh over. It’s over. Cheers Adam, hello everyone. It’s all over after one ball: Anderson fences Hazlewood behind, Joe Root will not return to the middle, and Australia celebrate a thumping 4-0 victory. 88th over: England 180-8 (Curran 23, Anderson 2) Nathan Lyon now thrown the ball after Cummins copped a bit of tap from Cummins. He’s taken 3/50. Curran keeps on keeping on, dancing to the spinner and stroking him beautifully through cover, almost inside-out. Five more - off the helmet! How about that. Penalty runs. Very rare. End of the over then. That is drinks. 87th over: England 171-8 (Curran 19, Anderson 2) Hazlewood gets a chance to finish it off, replacing Starc. He won’t this over though, Jimmy beaten early then under a couple. Deflects the last ball down to short leg. Drinks an over away. For those paying attention to that. 86th over: England 171-8 (Curran 19, Anderson 2) Tom Curran! What a couple of shots they are! Beautiful off-drive off Cummins to begin the new over. Slams into the rope. But then goes one better on the back foot, admittedly backing away a bit, but makes fantastic contact over midwicket. The bouncers follow - they always do. Curran ducks into one. Ouch. Worn on his shoulder not head, thankfully. Has a smile, too. Tough lad. Nearly taken at short leg last ball, Bancroft diving to his left. But just out of his reach. They survive. 182,349 the total attendance for the match. 85th over: England 163-8 (Curran 11, Anderson 2) Handy from Curran, off his hip fine for one to begin. Anderson does the best he can. You know the drill. So does he. Starc does give him something on the pads though, taken for a couple. Off the mark! 17,174 the final attendance today at the SCG. 84th over: England 160-8 (Curran 10, Anderson 0) Cummins to Jimmy. Warne saying on telly Root is asleep in the England rooms. Probably not seeing him at the fall of the next wicket, then. It’s awful for Anderson, short stuff at his body then yorkers at his toes. But does well to get behind the last one. Toughing this out. What other option is there? Barmy Army giving it the big ones, as they tend to do before certain defeat. 83rd over: England 160-8 (Curran 10, Anderson 0) Bit going on here with the last couple of men out there. Really nice shot from Curran, square driving Starc to the rope and he’s into double figures. Big shout for lbw next up, but turned down. Smith nearly went for the review, but it was pitching outside leg. Rapid bouncer to finish. He’s out of the way. On TMS, Michael Vaughan is advocating starting the county cricket season earlier in the year and in the UAE on flat pitches. That’s outside the square. “Is it just me or did Broad’s dismissal and subsequent departure have more than an air of “not my job mate”?” asks Elliot Carr-Barnsley. Bit harsh, I reckon. Not many players are keeping that out. Right? And Sarah Bacon is a big fan of Pádraig Collins’s Go-Betweens piece. “Just to say: me, me, ME! Showing my age here, but when I received my vinyl copy of ‘Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express’, it was a happy, happy day. I almost wore it (and The Triffids album I bought on the same day) out with the rotations it received. Great memories, and what a great article to boot.” Nice Venn Diagram of cricket/G-Bs, I reckon. 82nd over: England 156-8 (Curran 6, Anderson 0) A leg slip and a leg gully in position for Anderson, alongside the three conventional clips. Player of the series for England? Vaughan says Malan, Dan Norcross reckons Jimmy. “He’s worked his guts out.” Brutal bouncer at the no. 11’s helmet, somehow gets out of the way. Beaten outside the off-stump to end the set. Cummins very unlucky not to bank his bag of five there. And I don’t think Starc will give him another chance for it, either. He was very adamant about the review, but it has clipped his glove on the way through, the thumb. That’ll do it. Another brilliant bouncer from Cummins. What a bowler. HAS CRANE EDGED CUMMINS? Umpire says yes, Crane says no. Review. 81st over: England 156-7 (Curran 6, Crane 2) Nice clip from Crane to begin, behind square for one in response to the first delivery with the second new ball, sent down by Starc, who has replaced Lyon. Curran is into it too, slaying behind point for four then shovelling off his hip for a couple more. Starc’s yorker nearly gets underneath his bat, but he’s hanging in there. Barmy Army singing ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’ in response to being half way to having Australia bat again. 80th over: England 149-7 (Curran 0, Crane 1) Crane out of Dodge with a tuck around the corner from a ball on his body. Cummins right on the mark with his short balls at Cummins. Paine is taking them head-high. New ball due. Not far away now. Here is an update on Root, from the England camp. “Joe was feeling exhausted at the lunch break and is resting up in the dressing room. He is feeling unwell and some of the symptoms have returned. At this stage, it is unclear if he will return to bat.” 79th over: England 148-7 (Curran 0, Crane 0) Curran does what he needs to to deny Lyon a fourth wicket. A bit of debate as to whether he will keep his spot for New Zealand. Tough call. There are certainly more dynamic seamers in the England system. But at the same time, he has a bit about him. A nice read before this all ends from Pádraig Collins on the Sydney sports desk. I’m tipping there are going to be quite a few Go-Betweens fans here. Enjoy. Vaughan is right, this is ending quickly. Broad is gone second ball, off the glove or splice of the bat. A snorter from Cummins, deflected straight in the air. Seven down, but essentially eight with Root unlikely to bat again. 78th over: England 148-7 (Curran 0, Crane 0) Missed a straight and full one. No review required. “He’s just fallen across it,” says Vaughan. There are a few overs until the new ball. Uh oh. “This is going to end quickly.” 77th over: England 144-5 (Bairstow 38, Curran 0) Not the setting for the sort of innings Curran played way back on morning two where he was slapping it everywhere. Feels a long time ago. Into his defensive stride to each of these Lyon deliveries. Nice. “Here in ThongerWorld™️, this last day of The Ashes has become merely a prelude to phase one of Bristol City’s annihilation of Manchester City tomorrow night in the Carabao Cup semifinal,” begins Kim Thonger. “All outcomes are regarded as favourable omens. Root and YJB see out the day, it’s plucky underdog triumphs against adversity. They don’t, and England tail folds, it’s a sign of the favourite’s overconfidence and eventual undoing in the final battle. It’s not widely known but Dr Pangloss was actually Bristolian. “All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds” is the battle cry!” Where does Root not coming back out factor into this? Get creative. 76th over: England 144-5 (Bairstow 38, Curran 0) So there is some news from lunch, and that is that Joe Root has retired ill again on 58. He is six runs short of the most runs for England in the series, for those with an interest in these matters. More to the point, he must be a very unwell boy to have sat out again. “Health is everything to me,” says Michael Vaughan on TMS in a very David Brent tone. Tom Curran is the man at the non-strikers’ end. Maiden from Hazlewood to Bairstow. Cops a short one in the body, defending the rest. Hi. Back. Only news to report from lunch is that I exploded a tomato over my shirt. That’ll look good on video later tonight. “Sterling effort from YJB and Joe Root this morning,” Brian Withington writes. “Cricketing equivalent of Rorke’s Drift in terms of the hopelessness of the situation and stoicism of response. Start minting a couple more Victoria Crosses in anticipation I say.” With that, it is Cummins to Bairstow. Play. 75th over: England 144-5 (Root 58, Bairstow 38) Last over before lunch. Root defends Hazlewood with comfort early on. Pulls a couple from a relatively tame short ball to finish the session inching closer to a precious ton in Australia. Hazlewood finds an inside edge with the penultimate ball, but the England captain is through to the break. Gutsy stuff considering where he started this morning: in hospital. Lunch. Only Moeen fell during the session. He looked quite good against Lyon this morning too, but eventually the off-spinner was able to get through via a straight one. So straight that there was no consideration of going upstairs to review. Plum. Australia half way there. That aside, there hasn’t been an inch given from the home side but the visitors have look up for the fight. Bairstow has played very nicely. Since resuming his innings, Root has been the more productive of the pair, but also the more likely to make an error. The Yorkshire teammates to grab a big drink and return in 35 minutes. I will do the same. Looking for something during the break? Check out Geoff and my Final Word podcast with Vic Marks from after the Perth Test. On a lot more than the current series. Jason Gillespie as well, if you haven’t heard that episode yet. Brilliant guests, both of them. 74th over: England 142-5 (Root 56, Bairstow 38) Mitch Marsh on for a twist instead of Lyon. Not a bad shout. Shamelessly plug my piece from last night one more time, then? Okay. Decent set too. Keeps Bairstow honest. Paine shakes it up by coming to the stumps. “That won’t help Mitch’s desire to get back into the fast bowling cartel,” Simon Katich notes on the ABC commentary. Classy take from the stumper when YJB leaves, having to move high to his right. The batsman is hurried up by the last one too, prompting a few oohs and aahs. Nearly snuck through. Another maiden. “Interesting how, at time of writing, Cook and Root have ended up with identical figures (Root with power to add), but in completely different ways,” emails Tom Bowtell. “Cook: 376 runs at 47.00, Balls Faced: 748, 4s: 39 - One Daddy hundred and nothing else. Root: 376 runs at 47.00, Balls Faced: 761, 4s: 39 - 5 50s but no hundred.” 73rd over: England 142-5 (Root 56, Bairstow 38) Hazlewood to Root. Full for the most part, defending. Root decides not to attack when the shorter ball comes. Eyes very much on lunch for the England duo now. Probably two overs away from the break. Maybe three if Lyon rushes. “From a laughter-filled press conference to copping a grim blow even as he faces the possibility of an axe,” says Aditi, “Bancroft’s tour has been like a tragic Western (is there any other kind?).” Very good. But you know what, I reckon there is a decent chance he will be retained for South Africa. Don’t underestimate the old Australian desire not to change a winning team. 72nd over: England 142-5 (Root 56, Bairstow 38) Lyon to Root. Getting well forward to defend, then driving through cover when the width is there for it. Collects another three. Bairstow deals with the rest. Very impressive morning from the wicketkeeper. 71st over: England 139-5 (Root 53, Bairstow 38) Hazlewood for his second shift of the day from the Paddington End. Root turns him square to begin, Root does likewise for a couple later in the over. All fairly sedate at this stage. Let’s get to lunch and go again. “So, if Juan Mata won the award for Football in 2017, who deserves the Golden Graun for Cricket?” asks Adam Hirst. “Male and Female awards, of course.” That’s a great shout. I’ll take it on notice to think about during lunch. Any nominations? 70th over: England 136-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 36) Big shout for lbw from Lyon against Bairstow, turned down. They consider going upstairs for a brief moment but think better of it. To the penultimate delivery Bancroft cops another whack, this time hitting his lower leg by the looks. Another maiden. We’re inside ten overs to the second new ball and about 20 minutes until the lunch break. Should help Lyon, too. 69th over: England 136-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 36) Nasty! A full-blooded pull shot from Root off Starc goes straight into Bancroft’s helmet. He doesn’t move an inch, straight into the grill. The game stops while a new helmet is brought out for the Aussie opener. He seems alright, thankfully. A maiden. “On this, the last day before it’s officially AFL season again, I have some thoughts about bowling tactics in a situation like this.” Give them to me, Matt Harris. “I feel like the Australian bowlers ought to just send down six balls in a row aimed at the stumps. Stick half a dozen men out on the leg side to stop the runs getting out of hand. With 540-odd deliveries due in the day’s play, they need the English batsmen to make a mistake six times. I can’t see Bairstow nicking off when he can just leave the ball. Is this theory too simplistic?” Very good. Do you have an economics background, I wonder? And you’re right about footy season starting tomorrow. Well, maybe a few more weeks where the summer game dominates headlines. But not through until March as it once was. My own passive protest is not to click an AFL link until the preseason games. Join me. 68th over: England 136-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 36) Very patient, YJB. Lyon throws it up then darts it in, the response is the same. Kipling, yeah? When Lyon gets too straight, he collects two through midwicket. Doing everything right. “Gastro bug or not, suggesting that Root’s condition overnight/this morning had “nothing to do with heat exhaustion” is just silly,” emails Steve Anthony. “Honestly, does anyone seriously believe being out in the middle in up to 55C heat was going to make his tummy feel better? Discussion of a limit to player exposure when such extreme heat prevails is still a conversation that is long overdue. No amount of online Aussie macho posturing, ribbing the “soft” Poms, will change that. Ask Dean Jones (quoted this morning saying pretty much the same thing... the man who famously batted through a sea of vomit in India).” Spot on. 67th over: England 134-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 34) Similar theme to the previous Starc over, mixing it up. Bairstow the man at the business end this time, playing calmly. Tickles one behind square off the pads to keep the board moving. Root times one off the pads the only ball he has to negotiate, but it has smacked into Bancroft at short leg. 66th over: England 133-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 33) Lyon set and forget from the Randwick End. Bairstow into the defensive groove, much in the same mould as Mitch Marsh last week at Melbourne. Does grab one to cover later in the over. Root goes back to the last delivery and tries to cut but doesn’t make contact. Contrasting approaches. “Morning, Adam.” Hi Sarah Bacon. “I’m no lawyer, but I’m pretty sure the SCG has some sort of small-print disclaimer about entering the ground at one’s own risk blah blah blah,” she writes. “And besides: at least the crowd could avail themselves of plenty of horse p!ss, or rather, low-strength beer, to stay hydrated.” One of the great divisions in Australian cricket is that you can drink full-strength beer in the members but only the light stuff in the outer. Probably a piece in that. I’ll add it to my list. 65th over: England 132-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 32) Starc versus Root. That’s a heavyweight stoush. Defending, driving, leaving. Driving, defending, driving. Can’t complain about this. “Blessing in disguise that Root didn’t resume from overnight?,” asks Sachin Paul. “He has a terrible record resuming overnight. Happened in Adelaide, happened at MCG and many more crucial times in his career.” A cunning plan. Hospital tag and all. More on that: 64th over: England 132-5 (Root 52, Bairstow 32) Lyon once more, to Root. Nice shot through cover for two more. Best form of defence and all that from the England numero uno. But then he’s beaten! Nice from the off-spinner, again looking just as dangerous from the balls that don’t turn. He spoke a lot about that when we were in Bangladesh late last year, learning how to - as he put it - bowl ugly. He does turn one bigger later in the over, Root setting up deep enough in the crease to turn nicely behind square for a few. That gets him to 50. His fourth half-century of the series. Can he go big and save this for England? Wouldn’t that be something. 136 balls to reach the mark. “Ashamed to admit that when I read the words of Moeen joining YJB I immediately assumed that Joe had coughed it up early on a morning resumption “yet again”,” wrote Brian Withington before the first wicket fell. “Relief that he had not been dismissed was then tempered by concern for his condition - let’s hope his arrival at the crease is delayed as long as possible.” Sorry about that. Going nicely, though. 63rd over: England 127-5 (Root 47, Bairstow 32) Starc is on to replace Cummins. Root likes that match up, playing late and through backward point for four! Then a single to midwicket. He’s nice and busy early on. Daniel McDonald has outdone himself here. “Some Walt Whitman remixed for the final morning’s events,” he emails. And here it is: O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is toast, The ship has weather’d every dire pitch, the prize we sought is lost, The port is near, Whateley’s voice I no longer hear, the people all exulting, While OBO eyes miss Lemon, his body wracked and convulsing; But O heart! heart! heart! O the beading drops of sweat, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen dry and parched. 62nd over: England 121-5 (Root 42, Bairstow 31) Drinks were taken at the fall of the wicket. And Joe Root is the man walking out to the middle. Magnificent effort given how crook he must have been overnight, rocking up to the ground with a hospital tag on his wrist as play resumed an hour ago. Some lovely wors from Phil Walker about the England captain over at Wisden overnight that I’ll link below. Lyon throws it up to him and gets enough turn to find the inside edge from the last delivery of the over. On another day, could have ended up in the hands of the man at short leg. There it is! Lyon and Moeen have been battling hard with the batsman defending confidently. But not this time, the arm ball doing the damage for the second time in the innings for the off-spinner. That’s the seventh time in nine innings during the series where Lyon has picked up Moeen. No review required - this is plum. 61st over: England 120-4 (Bairstow 30, Moeen 13) Well, that’s England biggest over of the morning, six from it. Albeit with a leg bye to begin when Moeen ducks and it collects his shoulder on the way to fine leg. Then an edge through the cordon to the rope. It didn’t carry, which Cummins is quite disappointed about. Looked a clear snick from Moeen rather than any soft hands at work. An ongoing theme of the series, really. 60th over: England 114-4 (Bairstow 29, Moeen 9) Lyon pushing through his overs in a hurry here, giving Moeen no chance to chill. But he does have enough time to get on the back foot to pull a single to midwicket. Bairstow plays out the rest. 59th over: England 113-4 (Bairstow 29, Moeen 8) Bouncer then slower ball combo to begin from Cummins to YJB. More short of a length stuff aimed at his body. This is where Cummins has been clever throughout. Bowls plenty of bumpers, but so accurate with the deliveries that are below head height but make life difficult. Fuller to finish, Bairstow times a drive through cover for a couple. 58th over: England 111-4 (Bairstow 27, Moeen 8) Lyon to Moeen. Not much to see here, which is good news for the visitors. Oh, as I type that he beats the edge. Nice bowling. But still, nearly an hour into the day and yet to really make an error. Watches the last couple go by. Maiden. Good cricket from all involved. 57th over: England 111-4 (Bairstow 27, Moeen 8) Runs again from the first ball of the over from YJB, two of them off the pads from Cummins. Sure enough, the short balls follow. But he’s back in time to defend or duck throughout the set. 56th over: England 109-4 (Bairstow 25, Moeen 8) Bairstow turns Lyon square to begin. Moeen continues to defend Lyon solidly. About seven weeks too late, I’m afraid. Leaves the last one alone. I’m in a very boisterous press box at the moment. “A real end of term feel,” notes Will Macpherson to my right. “I’m very sorry to hear that G. Lemon is crook (though deeply thrilled at the chance to use the matchless ‘crook’ to a genuine Australian).” Morning Rob Wilson in Paris. Coming to visit in a few weeks, so goes the plan. “With Root all wibbly-wobbly as well, the OBO feels like a world of torment and debility. If Root comes on and gets any, he’s got planet-sized round ones.” If he gets motoring later on, I’m heading over to the Barmy Army for a sing. 55th over: England 108-4 (Bairstow 24, Moeen 8) Cummins into the action from the Paddington End, replacing Hazlewood. Decent pace to begin. Bairstow gets off strike to fine leg, and will be happy to do so. The right-armer has been Australia’s most dangerous quick by some margin in this fixture, for mine. Nearly gets Moeen first ball! A wafty drive, no real footwork, nearly ends up in the hands of the diving Mitch Marsh at point. If only he were six inches taller. If only he was Bruce Reid. “Hello from Rhode Island, where it’s early evening on Sunday and -11C.” Hello to you, Tat Wood. “Over on the Guardian news site the story about Rooteh’s hospital stay has been greeted with a lot of comments based around the ‘suck it up’ theme. But I’m wondering about the spectators. Putting them in medical jeopardy opens up the doors to lawsuits and that ought to concentrate the minds of the ICC is nothing else does.” I’m shouldering arms to that. Anyone here who went to law school for longer than the semester (let’s call it four weeks) that I did before giving it away in favour of full-time political hackery? 54th over: England 103-4 (Bairstow 22, Moeen 5) A couple through midwicket for Moeen off Lyon, nicely tucked. Moeen brought forward throughout. No real issues for him so far this morning against his nemesis. “Hi from frigid Yarmouth, Maine,” emails Andrew Schaefer. “Sorry if I’m the only one who doesn’t already know this but what are Joe Root’s options for batting today? Can he just return to the crease once Bairstow or Moeen go out?” Yep, he’s good to go at the fall of any wicket today. 53rd over: England 101-4 (Bairstow 22, Moeen 3) Moeen tucks around the corner, giving YJB the strike. Gets a bit of room to swing the bat and does, stroking a compact boundary through cover. England’s first of the morning. Clear plan from Hazlewood to go shorter after that. Handles it well. Hydration is the story of the day and Simon Katich makes an interesting point on the ABC broadcast. “Back when I was playing with the Australian team we had the hydration Test every morning,” he said. “If we weren’t at the right level we had to get enough fluid to be at that mark before we warmed up.” England 100 up with that Bairstow boundary too, for what little that is worth. 52nd over: England 96-4 (Bairstow 18, Moeen 2) Men around the bat for the Lyon vs Bairstow contest. He has three wickets against right handers (17 against lefties) this series, at an average close to 80. Now, that is quite misleading given how frugal he has been - Paul Farbrace last night said he was nearly as important as Smith in the series - but this is the preferable matchup for England. Plays very carefully here. Going nicely. 51st over: England 96-4 (Bairstow 18, Moeen 2) Hazlewood bounces Moeen in their first exchange of the day. He ducks in response. Does it again. So there are his two bumpers out of the way. Defends until another shorter one comes to finish, sways away nicely. Good scrap. “Best wishes to Geoff Lemon (from one invalid to another) and we hope for his fast recovery,” emails Johnny Starbuck. I’m sure he is reading on and will appreciate that. Cheers. “Certainly in time to do a few of the shorter-form matches. I doubt very much that cricket will set an upper-limit temperature for play as we’ve been working for that in British workplaces for over forty years with no luck at all. The only thing that might change is bringing in roofs, a la tennis, and managing the temperature through artificial means.” I’m not so sure about that. I do think this will prompt a discussion. At club level, games are called off when it gets above 40 (where I played, anyway). I’m not saying at the elite level it should be quite so black and white. Put some smart people in a room and sort it out. Is all I’m saying. 50th over: England 96-4 (Bairstow 18, Moeen 2) Change of ball between overs. The umpires took a look, it didn’t pass through the rings, so they grabbed another. Lyon beats Moeen with the first delivery using it! Once upon a time, the common wisdom was that Nath couldn’t win games for Australia on the final day. You don’t hear that kind of thing anymore, especially after his 2017. Plays with so much confidence now. Moeen gets the first run of the day, behind square. Bairstow does likewise later in the over, and Moeen again to midwicket. 49th over: England 93-4 (Bairstow 17, Moeen 0) Three maidens. Hazlewood sends a bouncer down early to Bairstow, the first of the day. Reckon there’ll be quite a few later on if the pattern of the series continues. Big day for Jonny, he’s leaving well. “Moeen double century to save the Test?” asks Mark Hopper. Well, he has batted all day to (nearly) save a Test before. 48th over: England 93-4 (Bairstow 17, Moeen 0) Lyon to take up the attack from the Randwick End. To Moeen, who has had so much success against in the series. Brought further forward as the over went on, an inside edge found last ball. Good start from both ends. 47th over: England 93-4 (Bairstow 17, Moeen 0) All the cameras on Joe Root as he runs up the stairs to the England sheds, having just arrived at the ground. Jerusalem belted out by the Barmy Army. Couple of slips, a gully and a catching cover in place. As usual, the Australian quick is right on the money. Bairstow defending and watching. Root has a hospital tag still on his wrist, I can see the on TV. Go you good thing. Moeen is the new man to the crease. Joining YJB, who resumes on 17. To repeat the news from this morning: Joe Root has been in hospital overnight with severe dehydration, but he’s at the SCG and expected to bat later on. Josh Hazlewood has the ball in his hand from the Paddington End. Play! It is likely that Joe will bat today. That’s the latest from the England camp. We’re back in five minutes. Before it gets overtaken by events, my bit from last night on the Marsh brothers. I knew that line of commentary from Gerard Whateley would come in handy again at some stage. Morning! Yes, Geoff is not a well boy. As those who have heard his voice know, when he talks it booms. Today, you can barely hear him. Back to the sick bay. Wish him well. Speaking of health, the good(ish) news for England is that Joe Root is on his way to the SCG. The England camp have clarified that he will not bat when play resumes in 20 minutes, but the fact that he is here and not hospital is a good development. This episode will, and should, prompt a conversation about playing in extreme heat. When the Australian Open tennis begins next week, they will be off the moment the tempterature hits 38 degrees. Has been that way for a generation or more. But on our game, we celebrate these moments. How ill Dean Jones was during his 210 during the 1986 Tied Test has served as the ultimate proof his bravery. When Pete Handscomb nearly collapsed in Chittagong in September it was much the same. There are many other examples, of course. I remember Ricky Ponting batting without a helmet in 2002 in Sharjah against Pakistan because the heat was so intense. Copped a whack in the face from a bouncer for his trouble. In short: let’s get this right. That’s it for me, I’m going back to my sickbed. I was hoping to push through, for one last hurrah on the Ashes OBO, because I’ve had such fun with you all throughout the series. Signing it off on the last day would have been grand. But medical necessity does not permit sentiment. Adam Collins is luckily on hand to take over from this invalid, and I shall continue back to my Swiss sanatorium. Please direct your correspondence to him. Thanks for reading along the last few weeks. Till next time. “I would have thought with all England’s support staff, that I assume includes a doctor, fitness trainer, dietician etc, that such an incident would be avoidable. Can’t be pleasant for the guy, hope he recovers quickly,” writes Dave Brown. I don’t know how avoidable it is when he’s spent almost the whole day on the field. Captain of the bowling side through the worst of the heat, then was out there batting after the quick fall of two wickets. There’s only so much they can do. Plenty of discussion around now about whether cricket should have a maximum permitted temperature. While the Sydney bureau stations were reading in the 40s, those are the measurements taken in the shade. Anecdotally, the readings in the middle of the SCG yesterday were above 50 degrees. It does seem absurd to ask athletes to perform in those conditions. It seems absurd to ask spectators to sit around in those conditions too. It’s true that cricket already has annoying delays for rain and light, but in the far more dangerous conditions of extreme heat, it’s hard to mount much of an argument against it. Yes, good morning or other times of day to you all. I’ve been following the middle three days of this Test from my sick bed inside a whorl of fever dreams. I had the distinct thought yesterday that while I’d had an utterly miserable three days, it still wasn’t as bad as the England cricket team’s. Then it turns out that we have actually shared the experience of vomiting and nausea and hospitalisation in Sydney. After being on the field for most of the day in extreme 40+ degree heat, Joe Root got extremely ill overnight with dehydration and went into hospital at 7 this morning. He’s getting IV drips and all that, and a statement will be made later as to whether he’ll take any part to play. Perhaps it will be a Graeme Smith situation, where he’ll only come back later if there’s some chance of saving the match. Or perhaps they’ll just sack it off as a bad lot. This tour has not been kind to England in any way. Geoff will be here shortly. In the meantime, read Paul Farbrace’s comments on the England players here: England’s planning for their next tour to Australia in four years time must begin as soon as possible following a failed Ashes defence that Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach, conceded has exposed mental frailties among the squad. An impossibly hot fourth day in Sydney that produced a record high of 47.3C (117.1F) in the city ended with Steve Smith’s hosts on course for a 4-0 series win. England had shipped 649-7 declared before closing on 93-4 in their second innings – still 210 runs behind – and Farbrace was in no mood to put a positive spin on events. “A series like this does expose issues in your team,” said Farbrace. “And we have a choice. You either churn out some positive stuff, or we be honest and say that there are certain areas that are not good enough. That’s every single one of us – players, staff, structures, setup. Everybody needs to look very closely and ask if we have got the right people in the right places.” Read the full story here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/08/indigenous-rangers-expansion-call-as-support-from-one-nation-voters-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Indigenous rangers: expansion call as support from One Nation voters revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/indigenous-rangers-expansion-call-as-support-from-one-nation-voters-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/indigenous-rangers-expansion-call-as-support-from-one-nation-voters-revealed","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous rangers: expansion call as support from One Nation voters revealed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Indigenous ranger groups have called for the Queensland and federal governments to expand support for their land management and employment programs, after polling revealed backing from more than 80% of Queenslanders. Galaxy polling commissioned by Country Needs People, a coalition of Indigenous traditional owners and ranger groups lobbying for better government commitment, found high levels of support across the political spectrum. The November poll of a representative sample of more than 1,000 people included several questions related to Indigenous land management and its public funding. It found more than 80% of people supported Indigenous land management, including more than 70% of One Nation voters, and 88% supported a proposal to create 200 new ranger jobs in Queensland over the next 10 years. About 90% of people supported the statement “people living on the land in the outback have an important role to play in protecting and restoring the natural environment” and a similar proportion agreed that providing incentives for the work would benefit the state. Indigenous rangers are funded through federal and state governments. Queensland’s $11m Indigenous Land and Sea Management program is administered by the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection and operates in 17 remote and regional locations. Grants of up to $75,000 support ranger projects, including eight in 2017-18. A 2017 budget boost increased the number of employed rangers to 100. Ned David, the chairman of the Gur A Baradharaw Kod Torres Strait Land and Sea Council, said the ranger program was a rare success and “ticked all the boxes” in the Torres Strait, where unemployment was extremely high. “People feel like they own the issues and more importantly they own the solutions,” David told Guardian Australia. “I’m passionate about it because I live and breathe my country, the Torres Strait. “I’ve been involved in education in the Torres Strait for the last 22 years now. I see kids going from the early years into prep, primary, secondary, and then off to Tafe or university or a career. I can map that out and see where the gaps are and how the gaps are not getting any smaller.” He said the program created jobs, encouraged people to work on their traditional country, supported Indigenous culture and conserved the environment. “Something like this, you back it, you see it work, you want to make sure you do everything you can to make sure there’s a long-term commitment towards it.” The Galaxy polling – conducted before the Queensland state election – found 45% of people said a commitment to increase funding to ranger groups would make them more likely to vote for a candidate. This increased to 55% among people who had visited a national park twice or more. One in 10 respondents were opposed to increased funding and the remaining 45% said it would not change their vote. Patrick O’Leary, spokesman for the Pew Charitable Trust, welcomed the wide support for rangers in Queensland. “It’s a huge state, seven times bigger than Great Britain, five times bigger than Japan, and to manage fire, feral animal impacts like wild pigs, weed invasions and other pressures across that area needs a skilled and ready workforce on the ground,” he said. “There’s huge grassroots demand around Queensland for Indigenous ranger jobs and there’s a great opportunity in the next state budget to expand to meet that need.” Queensland’s treasurer, Jackie Trad, told the Country Needs People campaign the Labor government would continue the state-funded program “and look for ways to build upon its successes to date”. The Queensland budget will be handed down in June but the midyear fiscal and economic review flagged “emerging fiscal pressures” from a federal shakeup of GST distribution, with Trad warning of potential impacts on the budget. The federally funded Working On Country program was established by the Coalition government in 2007 and employs more than 1,600 people to care for and manage land and sea, including about 60% of Australia’s Indigenous protected areas – which themselves cover about 43% of the national reserve system. Current federal funding for the program ends in June. While the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, has given a verbal commitment of a two-year extension, and committed an extra $30m for training and expansion, supporters are calling for its funding to be brought in line with that of Indigenous protected areas and guaranteed until at least 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/07/what-theresa-may-told-andrew-marr-nhs-rail-fares-brexit-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T13:58:31Z","webTitle":"What May told Marr: the PM's thoughts on NHS, rail fares, Brexit and Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/07/what-theresa-may-told-andrew-marr-nhs-rail-fares-brexit-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/07/what-theresa-may-told-andrew-marr-nhs-rail-fares-brexit-trump","fields":{"headline":"What May told Marr: the PM's thoughts on NHS, rail fares, Brexit and Trump","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In recent years it has become traditional for the prime minister to start the year with an interview on a Sunday politics programme. The BBC’s Andrew Marr got Theresa May this year, and the pair covered a wide range of topics in the exchange, which was pre-recorded in May’s Maidenhead constituency before being broadcast on Sunday morning. Marr asked about the forthcoming reshuffle and May arrived with prepared announcements about a review of what the Parole Board can reveal about how it takes decisions and about the creation of a new forest in the north. Here are some of the other topics that came up. NHS May brushed aside calls for a radical rethink of the way the NHS is funded, suggesting innovation and “best practice” were just as important as money in improving the service. She accepted that the NHS was facing problems this winter, saying at one point “nothing’s perfect” as part of a response to a question about a stroke victim waiting hours to see a doctor. But generally she defended the NHS, and her government’s record, saying more people were being treated than ever before and the government had given the NHS more money, not just for the winter but for the years ahead. When Marr put it to her that, despite the extra spending on health, the NHS was continuing to go from crisis to crisis, and that Tories such as Sir Oliver Letwin thought the only solution was some form of hypothecated NHS tax, May refused to accept this. “You keep talking about the money but actually what you also need to look at is how the NHS works, how it operates,” May said. Although money was a factor, “we also need to ensure that we’re seeing across the whole NHS the best possible practice”, said May, citing as an example what she had seen on a recent visit to a hospital that was cooperating with GPs to reduce the number of elderly people being admitted to hospital. Marr asked specifically about a stroke victim in Essex who recently had to wait five hours to see a hospital doctor. He said that if he had had to wait that long when he had his stroke, “I would not be here talking to you”. May said she did not know about the case, and she recognised people would be concerned about such experiences. She added: “If we look at what is happening across the NHS, what we see is that actually the NHS is delivering for more people, it is treating more people and more people are being seen within the four hours every day than has been a few years ago. But of course nothing’s perfect and there is more for us to do.” She brushed aside Marr’s argument that a £6bn cut in the social care budget was a factor. She said the government was working on a long-term plan for a sustainable solution to social care, but she would not give any details. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, accused May of complacency. He told the same programme: “She hasn’t got a plan to get those people off the trolleys and corridors. Her only plan apparently is to promote this health secretary. They should be demoting this health secretary. If she promotes this health secretary tomorrow it’s a betrayal of those 75,000 people in the back of ambulances.” Rail fares May defended this year’s average rail fare increase of 3.4%, the highest for five years, saying commuters had to contribute to investment. Asked about the increase, she said: “Since privatisation, usage of the railways has doubled and we have seen the biggest investments since Victorian times in our railways. A lot of people rely on our railways. We want to see good service on our railways but that does mean that investment is needed.” East Coast rail franchise bailout May refused to deny that taxpayers would lose out from the East Coast rail franchise bailout ordered by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary. Virgin Trains East Coast, a partnership between Virgin and Stagecoach, had agreed to pay the government £3.3bn to run the service until 2023. Grayling let them pull out three years early. When Marr asked May if the taxpayer would still get the £3.3bn, she said Virgin and Stagecoach were “still paying money to the government”. Marr responded: “So the answer is no.” Brexit May said she expected to reach an agreement with the EU on a transition – or “the implementation period”, as she put it – by the end of March. She indicated that she expected the “meaningful vote” parliament has been promised on the final Brexit deal to take place before the end of the year. Donald Trump May dismissed claims that Trump’s mental health was a matter of serious concern. When it was put to her that questions were being asked about his mental health in the US, and she was asked whether f she thought those concerns were serious, she replied: “No.” She continued: “When I deal with President Trump, what I see is somebody who is committed to ensuring that he is taking decisions in the best interests of the United States.” She confirmed Trump would be coming to the UK. A visit is expected in February. Foxhunting May confirmed she had abandoned plans to hold a vote on repealing the ban on fox hunting. “If I look back at the messages that we got from the election, one of the clear messages we got is that there are a number of areas in which people were concerned about what we were proposing,” she said. “On this issue of foxhunting, what I can say is that there won’t be a vote during this parliament.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/08/educational-support-for-deaf-children-in-england-in-complete-disarray","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Educational support for deaf children in England 'in complete disarray'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/08/educational-support-for-deaf-children-in-england-in-complete-disarray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/08/educational-support-for-deaf-children-in-england-in-complete-disarray","fields":{"headline":"Educational support for deaf children in England 'in complete disarray'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Educational support for England’s 45,000 deaf children is “in complete disarray” with a dwindling number of specialist teachers struggling to meet growing demand, according to research. A report by the Consortium for Research into Deaf Education says the number of teachers of the deaf has been cut by 14% in the past seven years, at the same time as a 31% increase in the number of children requiring support. In some areas the situation is so critical there is just one specialist teacher for every 100 students. Without intervention, researchers say the crisis is likely to worsen, with many existing staff close to retirement. Susan Daniels, the chief executive of the National Deaf Children’s Society, said despite deafness not being a learning disability, deaf children already fell a whole grade behind their hearing friends at school. Almost 80% of deaf children attend mainstream schools with no specialist provision. Daniels warned that underachievement among deaf children was likely to grow. “The evidence couldn’t be clearer. From every angle and at every turn, a whole generation of deaf children will have their futures decimated if the government doesn’t act before it’s too late. “We already have too few specialist teachers of the deaf across England, but with 60% due to retire in the next 10 to 15 years, the government’s current complacency is a complete dereliction of duty. “I’m profoundly deaf, and know all too well the challenges of growing up without support. It means struggling to communicate, falling behind at school, failing to achieve your potential.” The report, which surveyed almost every authority in England, found more than a quarter of services have one specialist teacher for every 80 students, and in 15% of services there was one teacher for more than 100 students. Figures also show that a third of councils seeking new specialist staff have found it difficult to recruit. Caroline Blenkhorn, whose four-year-old daughter is deaf, has seen at first-hand the impact of recent cuts. “Our early years teacher of the deaf was incredibly supportive but she was stretched to the limit with the time she could give. “Since moving up to primary school we have had very little support. Her teacher left, and the local authority has had no communication with us to say what is happening. “This is the prime time for my daughter’s learning, and I feel like we are being completely failed by the system.” The National Deaf Children’s Society is calling on ministers to provide additional funds for the education of deaf children. It also wants the government to launch a recruitment drive and a centralised bursary to fund trainee specialist teachers of the deaf. Responding to the report, Robert Goodwill, minister of state for children and families, said councils had been given £223m extra funding to pay for the biggest reforms to special needs education in a generation, with new education, health and care plans tailored to the needs of every child. “Most children who are deaf are able to attend their local schools while receiving expert advice, and for those with more complex needs there are specialist deaf schools. This has shown results, with the ‎proportion of children with hearing impairment achieving 5 A*-C GCSEs, including in English and maths, at a record high.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/08/graham-arnold-is-the-standout-candidate-and-should-already-be-socceroos-coach","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Graham Arnold is the standout candidate and should already be Socceroos coach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/08/graham-arnold-is-the-standout-candidate-and-should-already-be-socceroos-coach","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/08/graham-arnold-is-the-standout-candidate-and-should-already-be-socceroos-coach","fields":{"headline":"Graham Arnold is the standout candidate and should already be Socceroos coach","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Six weeks on from Ange Postecoglou’s resignation and a month since the announcement of a many-handed recruitment process to find his replacement, the Socceroos still don’t have a head coach.

The coach of Australia should be Australian and Arnold is by far the most qualified Australian available. The coach of every national team should be of the nationality of the players. It’s an inconsistency of international sport that it is comfortable with citizenship beginning and ending with the players on the field. Competition between nation states should incorporate the tactical nous of a population’s coaching staff and all other back office functions. Allowing a free market to operate outside the field of play is contrary to the idea of country v country. Football can be decided on the selection table, the training ground and the magnet board. The smooth course of a match can be diverted at a stroke by a substitution or massaged in a different direction by a rousing half-time team talk. It is counterintuitive that such an influence could be outsourced to an individual travelling on a different passport to the group they are instructing. Even if it’s not a Fifa requirement it should be seen as a matter of pride for a national association to want to champion its country’s top managerial know-how against the world as part of the sporting exercise. There’s a strong argument to be made for allowing some developing nations to import expertise to pump prime their growth, but the Socceroos are the reigning champions of Asia and en route to their fourth consecutive World Cup. Australia has no excuse to seek outside help, which makes FFA chief executive David Gallop’s comment that his organisation is “open minded about whether the coach is Australian or someone from overseas” all the more disappointing. Inevitably moments such as this contain the whiff of cultural cringe. It’s seductive to be associated with a household name such as Marcelo Bielsa or Jurgen Klinsmann, but by flirting with an overseas coach the governing body betrays a lack of faith in the system it oversees and should be advocating for. This is a golden opportunity to talk up the capabilities of local coaches and their international readiness, in so doing celebrating the strength of Australian football and nurturing optimism for the future. Instead we have a panel of former players and an “international search and consulting firm” advising the FFA on a decision that need not be as complicated as they’re making it out to be. The domestic pyramid (if it’s operating efficiently) should point in the direction of the national side – not just the funnelling of elite players but also coaches and support staff too. What message would it send to the local game if this appropriately qualified candidate was overlooked in favour of a Fifo mercenary? Arnold boasts the highest win percentage of any full-time A-League coach. He’s a premiership and championship winner with two clubs in the last seven years (the latter arguably the best to ever grace the A-League, indicating he is continuing to improve as a manager). He is a former Socceroo with experience in the international coaching set-up. It’s hard to imagine how much more he – or any other Australian coach – could be expected to accomplish before being offered the top job. Arnold’s candidacy is also supported by pertinent short and long term arguments. The World Cup is just five months away, giving a newcomer little time to appraise the situation and effect change. It is difficult to construct a case for an overseas coach to have anywhere close to a comparable grasp of the task in hand than Arnold, especially considering his relationships with a host of squad members, not least first-XI regulars Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury and Tom Rogic, players he helped bring through the ranks at Central Coast Mariners. Looking further ahead, the new coach has the opportunity (responsibility even) to build on the course of self-determination admirably set in motion by Postecoglou. Ange spent his tenure convincing Australia’s football community to believe in itself and expect success. This dovetailed with the ascent of the Matildas and feeds into the burgeoning conversation around the restructuring of the game in Australia to ensure it is forward-looking and optimistic. These are shoes Arnold slips into comfortably. He is confident, forthright and does not shy away from his win-first mentality. His tactical approach may not mirror his predecessor’s but the message will remain one of never taking a backward step. What would Sven-Goran Eriksson or Bert van Marwijk provide? A sugar hit to offer a veneer of sophistication through a World Cup campaign (one that Fifa rankings suggest will last only three matches)? Then what? They have no reason to invest in the long-term future of Australian football. Postecoglou has started a program that should be embraced, not ignored. For Arnold, this will be the pinnacle of his career, not just another job. He will be a custodian, not an employee. He should be trusted with the game’s most precious asset, not see that handed over to a babysitter because we lack the trust in our own to do the job properly. The last Australian to dominate the A-League and be elevated to the national setup did all right, why are we so scared it won’t happen again? Graham Arnold is the best available Australian coach. That’s a simple as this decision needs to be. Just give him the job already."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/07/pubs-may-stay-open-late-for-royal-wedding-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T12:46:24Z","webTitle":"Pubs may stay open late for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/pubs-may-stay-open-late-for-royal-wedding-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/pubs-may-stay-open-late-for-royal-wedding-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle","fields":{"headline":"Pubs may stay open late for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pubs could be allowed to stay open later in order to encourage national merriment on the occasion of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The government is looking to allow bars and other licensed premises to delay calling time until 1am on 18 and 19 May to allow the nation to better celebrate the nuptials of the 33-year-old prince and his American bride. The move may also cheer football fans, as the wedding is on the same day as the FA Cup final and the Scottish Cup final, Saturday 19 May. Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne and will drop to sixth upon the birth of his older brother Prince William’s third child in April, will marry Markle, 36, an actor best known for her role in the US legal drama Suits, at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Launching a four-week consultation on extending the licensing hours in England and Wales, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said: “The royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion. “I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.” Licensing hours were extended for the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton in 2011 and for the Queen’s official 90th birthday celebrations in June 2016. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the extended hours could be worth £10m to the pub trade. “Visitors see the Great British pub as a cultural icon, almost as much as the royal family,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/snow-spain-traps-thousands-people-cars-overnight","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T16:10:40Z","webTitle":"Snow in Spain traps thousands of people in cars overnight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/snow-spain-traps-thousands-people-cars-overnight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/snow-spain-traps-thousands-people-cars-overnight","fields":{"headline":"Snow in Spain traps thousands of people in cars overnight","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spanish police and soldiers have rescued thousands of people trapped on roads in the centre of the country after heavy snowfall forced them to spend Saturday night in their cars. Hundreds of vehicles were caught in the snow on the AP-6 motorway in Castile and León and north-western parts of the Madrid region as people returned from Epiphany celebrations. Around 70 km (44 miles) of motorway between Madrid and nearby Segovia were affected, with some motorists trapped for up to 18 hours. More than 150 members of the army’s military emergencies unit (UME) were deployed early on Sunday to help Guardia Civil officers reach stranded motorists. “There are a lot of vehicles trapped on the AP-6 but we’re working bit by bit and kilometre by kilometre to get to all of them as soon as possible,” the UME tweeted. By mid-morning, conditions had improved, making it easier for snowploughs and emergency workers to reach stranded drivers. Members of the Red Cross handed out hot drinks, blankets and high-energy food. The UME said that everyone had been rescued by lunchtime on Sunday and the road was due to be reopened by late afternoon. Some of those trapped complained about the lack of information. Carlos Treviño and his wife spent 13 hours stuck in their car after trying to drive back to Madrid from Lugo in north-west Spain. “There are thousands of us here with no information,” he told El País by phone. “There’s been nothing, absolutely nothing. They’re not telling us what they’re doing on the radio or on the internet – or what’s going to happen to us. We haven’t seen a snowplough for hours.” The Guardia Civil advised anyone taking to the roads to plan their journey carefully and keep up to date with the latest advice and forecasts, while Spain’s directorate general of traffic called for caution and prudence in the face of the bad weather. Opposition MPs have called on the infrastructure minister, Íñigo de la Serna, to appear in parliament to explain how the situation came about. De la Serna has promised an investigation and said questions will be asked of the company tasked with running the motorway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/07/may-urges-greater-parole-board-transparency-following-john-worboys-case","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T11:48:33Z","webTitle":"May urges greater Parole Board transparency following John Worboys case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/may-urges-greater-parole-board-transparency-following-john-worboys-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/07/may-urges-greater-parole-board-transparency-following-john-worboys-case","fields":{"headline":"May urges greater Parole Board transparency following John Worboys case","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has called for greater transparency in Parole Board decisions on releasing prisoners such as the serial sex offender John Worboys. In a television interview on Sunday morning, the prime minister supported demands for victims to be given more information about when and why their attackers are to be let out of jail. The justice secretary, David Lidington, is to conduct a review of Parole Board procedures following the furore over the freeing of the former black-cab driver who is believed to have drugged and assaulted more than 100 women. Appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, May declined to comment on her role when home secretary in intervening in a supreme court case on the side of the police against two of Worboys’ victims who are seeking compensation. “The Parole Board operates independently but I think it’s right that we as a government are saying that we should look at the question of openness and that we should look at this whole issue too of how victims are kept in touch with … what is happening,” May said. “My instinct is that people do want to know more about why decisions are taken in the way that they’re taken … Let’s look at this properly … but I fully recognise why people are concerned about this.” May revealed that she personally knew “somebody who was one of [Worboys’] victims and who was not contacted and first heard of what was happening through the media.” May was asked why, as home secretary, she backed the Metropolitan police through a succession of court challenges against two women whose complaints were not taken seriously by officers. She said she would not comment on individual cases and it was “for the courts to determine what is right”. The supreme court is due to rule on the women’s compensation claim in the coming weeks. May said her main concern was to “ensure that we give people the confidence to be able to report these crimes, make these allegations for them to be properly investigated and then the right and proper action to be taken.” Legislative changes could be needed in order to make Parole Board decisions more transparent, she conceded. In a separate statement, Lidington said it was vital that victims of rape and sexual assault have full confidence in the criminal justice system. “While sentence lengths for these horrific crimes have increased by over 30% since 2010 and more victims are coming forward, there is still more to do,” he said. “While it is right that the Parole Board should remain an independent body, I believe that there is a strong case to review how to allow greater openness about the decision-making process. “We also need to make sure arrangements across the criminal justice system ensure victims are both heard and, if they wish, kept informed about their case.” Lidington said he had talked to the victims commissioner, Helen Newlove, and the chair of the Parole Board, Nick Hardwick, about what changes could be made to help victims of crime and provide greater transparency about the board’s work. “I want to make sure we consult victims’ groups and others, and to start this work now so that decisions can be taken before Easter,” he said. Worboys, 60, has spent nine years and nine months in prison, including time on remand. He was given an indeterminate sentence, which had a minimum term of eight years, for drugging and sexually assaulting at least 12 women, including raping one of them. He is likely to be freed within weeks. A total of 105 complaints against Worboys reached the Crown Prosecution Service, but the Guardian understands the former taxi driver was formally protesting his innocence as recently as two years ago. After he was jailed in 2009, the CPS advised police that it would be in the public interest only to prosecute fresh allegations of rape. The human rights organisation Liberty said that May “has serious questions to answer” about her intervention on behalf of the police in the supreme court case. Hardwick has apologised unreservedly because two victims had not been informed of the Parole Board’s decision, but has pointed out that it was the role of the probation service’s victim contact team to pass on the information. Hardwick said that the law prevents publication of the three-person panel’s decision-making process in any individual case. However, he has acknowledged that the case highlights the need for greater transparency and said that he has “radical plans” to change the rules. Worboys, who also worked as a male stripper, was reported to have “found God” and regularly attended Church of England services during his time at Wakefield high-security prison. Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represents 11 of Worboys’ victims, said: “Are his many victims seriously expected to believe that he has become a changed character? It is crucial that we are told the reasons why he has been allowed out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/07/government-pledges-57m-to-develop-new-northern-forest-m62","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T11:13:03Z","webTitle":"Government pledges £5.7m to develop new northern forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/07/government-pledges-57m-to-develop-new-northern-forest-m62","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/07/government-pledges-57m-to-develop-new-northern-forest-m62","fields":{"headline":"Government pledges £5.7m to develop new northern forest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has pledged £5.7m to kickstart the creation of a northern forest that will stretch from Liverpool to Hull. The plans, which are being led by the Woodland Trust, include the planting of 50m trees along a 120-mile stretch of land running next to the M62. The project is expected to cost £500m over 25 years, with more than £10m committed by the Woodland Trust and the remainder still to be raised. The project aims to provide new habitat for wildlife, as well as bolstering the local economy by an estimated £2bn through tourism, jobs, increasing property value and reduced flood risk to 190,000 homes. The Woodland Trust claims the new woodland will help tackle climate change by locking up an estimated 8m tonnes of carbon. The UK is one of the least forested countries in Europe, with just 10% of England covered by woodland, compared with 31% of France and 37% of Spain. Just 7.6% of the area planned for the northern forest is currently covered by trees. The government has set a goal of 12% woodland coverage in order to help meet its targets to cut climate emissions, but the Woodland Trust claims that in 2016 there were just 700 hectares of planting in England, well below the national target of 5,000 hectares (12,500 acres) a year. Planting for the forest is to begin in March at the Woodland Trust’s 680-hectare flagship site in the suburb of Smithills, in Bolton. The charity will deliver the project in partnership with five community forests that sit within the proposed area for the new woodland – the Mersey forest, Manchester’s City of Trees, Leeds’ White Rose forest, South Yorkshire community forest and the Heywoods project. The plans resemble those that created the National Forest in the Midlands, 200 sq miles of new woodland planted in north Leicestershire, south Derbyshire and south-east Staffordshire. That project was launched in 1991, in part to regenerate the area after the decline of the mining industry. Announcing funding for the northern forest project, which forms part of the government’s 25-year environment plan, Theresa May said: “It is vital that we leave our planet in a better state than we found it, with cleaner air, stronger protections for animal welfare and greener spaces for everyone to enjoy. “Progress is being made. We’re investing over £3bn in improving air quality, tackling marine pollution by banning harmful microbeads and increasing sentences for animal cruelty to five years. “But to create an environment fit for the future we can’t stop there, and that is why we are supporting the creation of this new northern forest and will shortly be setting out our ambitious vision to further support the environment and protect its good health for generations to come.” Austin Brady, the director of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said planting more forests would “lock up carbon on a large scale, boosting wildlife habitat and greening our towns and cities”. Responding to the government’s £5.7m commitment, he told the BBC: “We’re delighted the prime minister’s supporting our project. It’s great to get the idea of the northern forest on the map. Admittedly the government’s cash contribution isn’t huge, but it will help us to unlock other funding.” Michael Gove, the environment secretary, described trees as “some of our most cherished natural assets and living evidence of our investment for future generations”. He said: “Not only are they a source of beauty and wonder but a way to manage flood risk, protect precious species and create healthier places for us to work and live.” Paul de Zylva, a senior nature campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said the government announcement was extremely welcome, but added: “It’s a supreme irony that the current routing of HS2 [rail line] threatens 35 ancient woodlands north of Birmingham. We need new forests and ancient woodlands - not one or the other. “Communities across England also face threats to their local parks and green spaces through developments and council cuts. Ministers must do far more to rescue the UK’s declining nature, and give every child a right to experience it every day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/08/labor-says-treasury-document-shows-negative-gearing-claims-outright-lies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T17:01:16Z","webTitle":"Labor says Treasury document shows negative gearing claims ‘outright lies’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/labor-says-treasury-document-shows-negative-gearing-claims-outright-lies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/08/labor-says-treasury-document-shows-negative-gearing-claims-outright-lies","fields":{"headline":"Labor says Treasury document shows negative gearing claims ‘outright lies’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has released a Treasury document that states its negative gearing policies could cut house prices in the short term but, over time, the impact will be “relatively modest”. The opposition has seized on the advice to government, released under freedom of information, as proof the Coalition exaggerated claims that changing the tax treatment of property would be a “sledgehammer” to the economy. Before the 2016 election Labor promised to restrict negative gearing to new homes and reduce the capital gains concessions from 50% to 25%. The Treasury analysis from 2016 contains a table showing the expected impact of Labor’s policy on various asset types. It concludes that, for residential investment properties and owner-occupied housing, the policy “could introduce some downward pressure on property prices in the short term”. “In the long term, increases in taxation on rental property could have a relatively modest downward impact on property prices,” it said. The document notes that “returns for Australian investors will fall under the policy” but owner-occupiers would be unaffected, limiting the impact on property prices. It said that changes to negative gearing from 1985 to 1987 and the introduction of the CGT discount in 1999 “had little discernible impact on the market”. “Overall, price changes are likely to be small, though the composition of ownership may shift away from domestic investors.” The document, first produced under FOI to the ABC, is heavily redacted. It states the table was created after a “request for information” and includes talking points to describe the impact of Labor’s policy on a police officer earning $90,000. The document also confirms distributional modelling of Labor’s policies stating that more than 50% of the benefits of negative gearing go to the top 20% of income earners, while the top 10% of income earners receive nearly 75% of the benefit of the capital gains tax discount. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, responded to Labor’s policies with claims the package would “crash” confidence in the economy, while Malcolm Turnbull said it amounted to taking a “sledgehammer” to the property market. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the document, which the Australian information commissioner ordered be released, “directly refutes” the Liberals’ “overblown attack on Labor’s housing affordability policies”. He said it was clear the criticisms were “little more than outright lies”. “Scott Morrison loves to selectively leak Treasury advice when it suits him and yet this critical advice was withheld for almost two years.” Bowen noted that cabinet had considered changes to rein in the “excesses” of negative gearing but Turnbull ruled them out after Labor released its policy, a commitment he renewed in 2017. “Labor is the only major party with a set of housing affordability policies which will help level the playing field between first home buyers and property investors,” Bowen said. The acting treasurer, Kelly O’Dwyer, told ABC’s AM the document “confirms what we have been saying all along: [Labor’s policy] would have a disastrous impact when combined with a weaker housing market”. She cited a passage in the document that uncertainty around the policy “could compound upon a cyclical downturn that may be under way”. O’Dwyer maintained Labor’s policy would have a “significant impact” on the housing market, citing “broader advice” to government on the issue but refused to give a specific source for the claim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/07/trumps-voter-commissionn-kris-kobach-homeland-security-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Trump's 'voter fraud' commission is dead – but activists fear new DHS push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/07/trumps-voter-commissionn-kris-kobach-homeland-security-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/07/trumps-voter-commissionn-kris-kobach-homeland-security-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Trump's 'voter fraud' commission is dead – but activists fear new DHS push","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s quixotic year-long quest to prove the 2016 election was marred by millions of fraudulent votes has become, in the words of White House insiders, a “shit show” that appears unlikely to fare much better now the effort is shifting from a widely loathed presidential commission to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Voting rights activists rejoiced this week when the White House announced it was abandoning the eight-month-old Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a body run by some of the country’s most notorious advocates of voter suppression. Such activists remained concerned the administration could still find ways to constrict ballot access for new citizens and other minority groups through the DHS immigration enforcement arm. It is not clear, however, that the DHS has either the resources or the will to conduct a wide-scale investigation into voter eligibility when it is fully stretched implementing the administration’s broader goal of rounding up and deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible. The DHS itself said it was committed to continuing to work with states on improving cybersecurity around election machinery and voter databases, but made a point of distancing itself from Trump’s point man on election matters, the Kansas secretary of state and outgoing vice-chair of the presidential commission, Kris Kobach. “Kris Kobach will not be advising us on this matter,” the DHS said in an apparent refutation of Kobach’s own public statements. Kobach told one interviewer he expected the DHS to match state voter rolls to its own records on migrant non-citizens in an effort to weed out fraudulent voters – something Kobach has advocated for many years, despite being told repeatedly that the DHS database of immigrant enrollees in federal benefits programs is wholly unsuited to assessing voter eligibility and does not track citizenship at all. Kobach also argued that the DHS could move more efficiently than the presidential commission and that Democrats and others who opposed the commission’s work and filed lawsuits to force greater transparency had scored an own goal. “Anyone on the left needs to realize that by throwing food in the air they just lost a seat at the table,” he told Politico. Kobach’s position, however, appeared to be a lonely one. Even the president’s own staff members have privately expressed exasperation with the way he ran the commission. Experts on federal bureaucracy pointed out that the DHS would, if anything, have a greater obligation to transparency than the commission did under the federal Privacy Act – not to mention congressional oversight and opportunities for public comment. “With the commission, Kobach effectively jumped on a live grenade that he himself pulled the pin on. Most people don’t want to be the second person to jump on the same grenade,” Justin Levitt, an Obama-era justice department official and voting rights expert, told the Guardian. “Having seen the disaster that is the Kris Kobach show, it’s not clear DHS is going to be eager to follow him.” Wounded pride Trump’s commission ran into trouble from the start, as a broad-ranging request for voter information – including details of military service that are usually considered confidential for security reasons, and even party affiliation – hit a wall of bipartisan resistance from state election officials and a warning from a former DHS chief that the data, if collected, could pose a cybersecurity risk. Critics pointed out that Trump’s assertion of widespread fraud appeared to be based on his own wounded pride at having lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by close to 3 million votes, not on actual evidence. And they feared that the true purpose of the commission was to wage partisan warfare against Democratic voters – especially minority voters – by making it more difficult for them to register and cast a ballot. A revealing email written by one of Kobach’s allies on the commission expressed opposition to the inclusion of any Democrats or even “mainstream Republicans” because they would guarantee the failure of its mission. The commission met just twice, giving away little or nothing of its agenda, the documentation it was relying on or even basic information like the time and venue of meetings. Civil rights and voting rights groups filed close to a dozen lawsuits to try to shed greater light on what Kobach and his colleagues were planning. Then, in November, one of the commission’s own members, Maine’s Democratic elections chief, Matt Dunlap, filed his own suit after trying and failing to obtain basic information. An initial court ruling handed down just before Christmas ruled in Dunlap’s favour, a development that appears to have precipitated the White House’s decision to close the commission down completely. Dunlap was one of just a handful of Democrats that were widely seen as token figures on a commission over which Kobach maintained tight control from the start. Voting rights activists pieced together what they guessed to be his agenda from a variety of sources – including court filings, a document photographed in Kobach’s hand following a meeting with the then president-elect Trump in December 2016, and Kobach’s occasional column for Breitbart News. Much of it was familiar from Kobach’s efforts in Kansas, which in many cases have been challenged in court and some struck down. Such efforts include introducing a “citizenship requirement” for voter registration despite a dearth of evidence that non-citizen voting is a problem; nationalizing a multi-state registration crosscheck that Kobach has championed, despite evidence that it flags legitimate voters hundreds of times more often than it does fraudulent double voters; watering down the 1993 National Voter Registration Act to make it easier to knock inactive voters off the rolls; and lobbying the DHS to use its immigrant benefits database to seek out non-citizen voters. Of that wishlist, only the last item appears to have survived the disbanding of the commission. Meanwhile, the fight is continuing over the commission’s documentation, since Dunlap is pursuing his lawsuit despite strong opposition from the Trump administration. “The value of obtaining the documents is that we will finally have clarity as to what the premise of this commission was,” Dunlap told the Guardian. “It will give the American people something to look out for.” On Friday, however, the justice department told Dunlap it saw no obligation to hand over anything now the commission has been dissolved. In response, Dunlap accused the justice department of “arrogance and contempt for the rule of law”. Since the commission’s documentation was now being forwarded to the DHS, public scrutiny was more important than ever, he argued. “The actions taken by the administration going forward will have an immense impact on every American voter,” he said. “The government cannot cloak major undertakings in changes to public policy in total secrecy without any public scrutiny or accountability.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-drops-manifesto-promise-to-allow-foxhunting-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T08:21:22Z","webTitle":"May drops manifesto promise to allow foxhunting vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-drops-manifesto-promise-to-allow-foxhunting-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-drops-manifesto-promise-to-allow-foxhunting-vote","fields":{"headline":"May drops manifesto promise to allow foxhunting vote","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May has confirmed that she has ditched plans that would have allowed the end of the ban on foxhunting, in the latest attempt to repair the Conservatives’ reputation on animal rights. In a U-turn that will anger some party members and supporters in its rural heartlands, she revealed that she was dropping plans in the Tory election manifesto to hold a parliamentary vote on reversing the ban. The prime minister voted against the ban when it was introduced under Tony Blair and New Labour. However, the decision to include a vote on the repeal of the ban has been blamed by some Tory MPs as contributing to the party’s disastrous result. In an interview recorded for the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show to be broadcast on Sunday morning, May said that she had “not changed” her personal view on hunting and had “never fox hunted”. However, she added that she wanted to listen to the verdict of voters at the election. “If I look back at the messages that we got from the election, one of the clear messages we got is that there are a number of areas in which people were concerned about what we were proposing,” she said. “So, just as we have looked at issues on school funding, on tuition fees, on housing, we are taking forward approaches in relation to that. On this issue of foxhunting, what I can say is that there won’t be a vote during this parliament. “As I said my own view hasn’t changed. As prime minister, my job isn’t just about what I think about something. It’s about what the view of the country is.” It follows a concerted effort by the party and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, to counter social media campaigns denouncing the party’s record on animal rights. A Survation poll taken ahead of the election revealed that 67% of voters believed foxhunting should remain illegal. During the election campaign, Labour officials said the foxhunting pledge had helped them enormously on the doorstep. While May’s move had become inevitable, it will unleash a backlash within the party. In previous elections, the Tories have been helped on the ground by Vote-OK, a pro-hunting organisation, mobilising its supporters to back the local Tory campaign.

Cambodia’s immigration department said on its official Facebook page that 1,814 grams of heroin were found embedded in the side of Ve Thi Tran’s suitcase in several different packages. An immigration official at Phnom Penh airport, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to comment, said the 37-year-old was preparing to return to Australia via Hong Kong when she was arrested while checking in at the airport on Saturday. The arrest followed a tipoff from the Australian federal police, which requested cooperation with Cambodia’s immigration department in making the arrest, the official said. The AFP was criticised over its role in the Indonesian arrest of the so-called Bali Nine – a group of Australians arrested and convicted for attempting to smuggle heroin into Bali. The AFP was aware of the smuggling plan before the individuals left Australia but chose to tip off Indonesian authorities instead of arresting them in the Australian jurisdiction. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed by firing squad in April 2015. The others remain in prison in Indonesia, six of them on life sentences. A spokesman confirmed the AFP was working with Cambodian authorities on Tran’s case but said while inquiries were continuing no further comment would be made. Tran is being questioned by Cambodia’s anti-transnational crimes squad. Drug-smuggling offences are dealt with harshly by the Cambodian justice system. In 2016 an appeals court upheld a 23-year jail sentence for an Australian woman, Yoshe Ann Taylor. Taylor, a 41-year-old former teacher from Queensland, and 19-year-old French woman Charlene Savarino were arrested in 2013 at Phnom Penh International Airport with 2.2kg of heroin in Taylor’s bag. The pair were preparing to fly to Australia. Savarino was sentenced to 25 years in jail and a Nigerian man, Precious Chneme Nwoko, sentenced to 27 years. Taylor claimed she was tricked into carrying the drugs. In May two foreign nationals were given life sentences for attempting to smuggling nearly 5kg into Cambodia, the Cambodia Daily reported. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is aware an Australian woman has been detained in Phnom Penh. “We stand ready to offer consular assistance in accordance with the consular services charter,” a spokeswoman said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-little-man-fake-claudio-ranieri-chelsea-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T22:06:39Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte brands José Mourinho ‘little man’ and ‘fake’ in new attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-little-man-fake-claudio-ranieri-chelsea-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-little-man-fake-claudio-ranieri-chelsea-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte brands José Mourinho ‘little man’ and ‘fake’ in new attack","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has branded José Mourinho a “little man” and a “fake” in an astonishing escalation of the verbal war that has broken out between the pair in recent days. The Chelsea manager, clearly furious at Mourinho’s latest salvo regarding Conte’s ban for failing to report match-fixing while working in Italy, used the majority of his press conference after the 0-0 draw at Norwich to leave no doubt of the contempt in which he holds his Manchester United counterpart. In a lengthy and clearly premeditated outburst he also brought up Mourinho’s show of support for the former Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri, appearing to suggest it had been an affectation. “I think before you make this type of comment, before to hurt another person, you must pay great attention,” Conte said of Mourinho, who had stated the previous day he had never been, and will never be, suspended for match-fixing. “You show you are a little man. A little man. You don’t know very well [what] is the situation. But I know him very well in the past. In the past he was a little man in many circumstances, is a little man in the present and for sure he will be a little man in the future. “Also if he wants to try to change his behaviours … but the person’s this, Mourinho’s this. You know him very well. The level is very low. I repeat: I think before to speak you have to know very well what happened.” Mourinho’s jibe had followed a suggestion from Conte earlier on Friday that the Portuguese was suffering from “demenza senile”. That was in response to an assertion from Mourinho that he did not have to “behave as a clown on the touchline” to demonstrate his passion, seen as a reference to Conte. At the time Chelsea stressed that Conte had meant “amnesia” rather than the direct English translation of “senile dementia” and he settled on the former when returning to the theme at Carrow Road. “This is not my problem, I consider him a little man,” Conte repeated. “I consider him a man with a very low profile. “There is a story to speak for him and for me. You can change the story, but you have to know the story very well before hurting another person. In the last period he’s suffering a bit of amnesia. We are there, amnesia. When you become to be older, there is this type of risk. Also for me, and for you – for all. The problem is if you show this. He must pay great attention. He’s doing this with regularity.” Conte explained the facts of his four-month suspension while manager of Juventus, which was handed down for allegedly neglecting to inform the authorities of match-fixing offences during an earlier spell in charge of Siena. He was found innocent in May 2016. His evisceration of Mourinho did not end there and, without prompting, he raised what he saw as the two-faced treatment of Ranieri. “I remember a stupid example with Ranieri,” he said. “When he offended Ranieri for his English. Then when Ranieri was sacked he put on a shirt for Ranieri. You are a fake. I think you have good consideration for a person or not. It doesn’t change your opinion to be more sympathetic. If you want to fight a person, you try to kill this person. And then after two years you try to help this person, because maybe it’s good for you, for your profile.” That referred to an incident in 2008, during which Mourinho said his Chelsea predecessor had “still struggled to say ‘good morning’ and ‘good afternoon’” during five years in England. After Ranieri was sacked by Leicester last February, Mourinho arrived at a press conference with the letters “CR” emblazoned on his training top. The rapid intensification of an enmity that has festered for some time could come to a head on 25 February, when Chelsea visit Old Trafford. “It will be the opportunity in the game against United when we go to Old Trafford,” Conte said. “Me and him face to face. I’m ready. I don’t know if he’s ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/mark-hughes-speaks-defiantly-after-fa-cup-humiliation-for-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T19:38:06Z","webTitle":"Mark Hughes sacked by Stoke City after FA Cup humiliation by Coventry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/mark-hughes-speaks-defiantly-after-fa-cup-humiliation-for-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/mark-hughes-speaks-defiantly-after-fa-cup-humiliation-for-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Mark Hughes sacked by Stoke City after FA Cup humiliation by Coventry","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Stoke sacked Mark Hughes in the aftermath of the Premier League strugglers being knocked out of the FA Cup by Coventry City of League Two. A 2-1 victory thanks to goals from Jordan Willis and Jack Grimmer was the shock of the third round, and Hughes, in his 200th game in charge, was dismissed three hours after the third-round tie. Humiliating defeat left Hughes in a desperate situation, with Stoke also in the Premier League relegation zone, and the club decided time was up for the Welshman. Shortly after 8pm, Stoke said Hughes’ contract had been “terminated with immediate effect”. A a statement on Stoke’s official Twitter feed added: “We would like to thank Mark for all he has achieved for the club over the last four and a half years, notably in guiding us to three successive ninth places finishes in the Premier League, and we wish him every success for the future. The club will look to appoint a new manager as soon as possible and will be making no further comment at this time.” Hughes was appointed at Stoke on 30 May 2013, taking over from Tony Pulis. He leaves the club 16th in the Premier League standings and with one win in their past eight games. It is the first time Stoke have been knocked out, as a top-flight side, by a team from the fourth tier or below since they lost to Bradford Park Avenue in 1938.

Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist MP, was quoted by the Iranian labour news agency as saying that around 90 students have been detained with at least 10 unaccounted for. The scale of the crackdown emerged as the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, defended Jeremy Corbyn over his silence on the unrest in Iran, saying the Labour party takes an approach of “extreme caution” when it comes to the politics of the Islamic republic. Thornberry told the BBC it was impossible to determine what political forces lay behind the protests, which began on 28 December and are said to have led to at least 21 deaths – mostly of protesters but also some security guards, according to officials. Corbyn has been under increasing pressure to speak out about the protests. Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was “extraordinary” that Labour had not spoken out against the Iranian regime. The international community is split over how to respond to the protests. A US attempt to raise the issue at a UN security council discussion on Friday was opposed by Russia. When the discussion took place, France rejected American efforts to make the protests an excuse for ditching the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran has tried to recast the protests against the clerical establishment as the result of foreign interference. Thousands of government supporters staged rallies on Saturday, with state television showing protesters in cities including Amol, Semnan and Shadegan waving Iranian flags and chanting “Death to America”, “Death to Israel” and “Death to Britain”. The provincial governor in north-eastern Mashhad, where the protests started, was quoted as saying that 85% of detainees there had been released after signing a pledge not to take to the streets again. Tehran University has set up a committee to track the fate of arrested students. Sadeghi, who represents a Tehran district, said: “It seems that the total number of detainees is around 90. Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and … it is still unknown which body has detained them.” According to Reuters, Iran has several parallel security bodies and arrests are often not immediately announced. Videos that have appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons in search of their loved ones. Thornberry spoke to the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast to explain her reluctance to make a statement, and followed that with a lengthy social media post detailing her position. “Our approach now is one of extreme caution when it comes to Iran and a recognition that the society in Iran is an immensely complex one, and seemingly contradictory,” she said. “For example, with these current riots, sometimes they are calling to reinstate the monarchy, sometimes they are calling out against [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei, sometimes they are calling for Khamenei, sometimes they are calling for the price of eggs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/06/northampton-gloucester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T18:42:00Z","webTitle":"Ken Pisi inspires Northampton to sink Gloucester and end losing streak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/06/northampton-gloucester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/06/northampton-gloucester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Ken Pisi inspires Northampton to sink Gloucester and end losing streak","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Alan Gaffney could have been forgiven for wishing he had remained in Dubai when Northampton fell 11 points behind 12 minutes into the second half against a team with title pretensions. The Saints had lost their previous 11 matches in the Premiership and Europe and had just conceded a try that owed as much to limp defence as attacking wit. Gaffney, whose coaching CV includes Australia, Saracens, Ireland and Munster, was visiting his son in the United Arab Emirates when Northampton, who were falling perilously close to the relegation zone, asked the 71-year-old to take charge until the end of the season while they trawled the world for a long-term successor to Jim Mallinder, who was sacked last month after a decade in charge. The difference a new coach makes was immediately obvious from the start as players who in previous weeks had slipped off tackles and been slow to get back on their feet after contesting a breakdown showed an urgent desire to impress. Old failings remained, the legacy of confidence drained away, but they ultimately won because they edged Gloucester in terms of determination, gaining strength at the moment the match was slipping away from them. When the Gloucester prop John Afoa scored a try to put his side 19-8 ahead, after Jake Polledri had charged through two defenders and Owen Williams had drawn the cover before putting the New Zealand international into a gaping hole, the visitors were on course for a bonus-point victory that would have taken them to second in the table. They had hardly looked potential champions, passive initially and then erratic, moments of brilliance scarred by basic errors, but they had reached the point where they had a team, inured to defeat, where they wanted them. As Northampton’s players huddled behind the posts, Dylan Hartley, in virtually his last contribution before making way for Mike Haywood, told them the cause was far from lost. Three minutes later, the scrum-half, Nic Groom, sneaked his way over the line after spotting Jake Polledri drifting from the base of a ruck and the great escape was on. Its ending was the stuff of Hollywood, a late penalty followed by a driving lineout with one minute to go and a penalty try awarded after Haywood reached the line but only after a double movement. The Gloucester centre Andy Symons was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing the maul. His head coach, Johan Ackermann, wondered whether the offence had been committed after the referee had blown his whistle, but of greater puzzlement to him was the way his team reverted to the flaky confection of previous seasons, uncertain in possession, not knowing whether to protect what they had or finish with a flourish, and getting caught inbetween. “At 19-8 down it would have been easy for players to have dropped the bundle and let it slide,” said Gaffney. “It may have happened previously: when you have been on a long losing streak it is easy to give up, but the players dug deep and clawed out the win. I did not have a lot of involvement with the players in the week, but I will be sitting down with them all, starting with Dylan, getting his thoughts on where we are.” Hartley failed to find his target at three lineouts, including one at the end of the first half with his side 14-8 behind. This should have resulted in a try for the Gloucester lock Mariano Galarza but he dropped the ball with the line beckoning. Gloucester had been awarded a penalty try after 14 minutes when Ben Morgan was at the back of a maul heading for the line; Api Ratuniyarawa brought it to the ground and was sent to the sin-bin. Gloucester failed to score in the 10 minutes the second row was off the field and Harry Mallinder restored Northampton’s lead with a penalty. It lasted five minutes before James Hanson finished a move started on the left wing by David Halaifonua who crashed through two tackles, aided by Williams impeding Tom Wood so slightly that the incident was not reviewed. Gloucester could rightly point to decisions at the end that conspired to bring them down, not least a knock-on given against Jason Woodward when the ball went backwards. But the visitors had only themselves to blame for one point that should have been at least four. They lost two lineouts in the final six minutes and were blown at a scrum. Ackermann refused to use as an excuse a stomach bug that had affected a number of players in the days before the match. Northampton, inspired by Jamie Gibson and Teimana Harrison in their back row, kept going, hitting hard and harder, and were rewarded at the death. On Twelfth Night there was no 12th defeat for the Saints."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/06/brexit-will-divert-70m-from-our-cancer-drug-making-capacity-glaxosmithkline","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T18:36:17Z","webTitle":"Brexit to swallow £70m meant for developing cancer drugs, says GSK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/06/brexit-will-divert-70m-from-our-cancer-drug-making-capacity-glaxosmithkline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/06/brexit-will-divert-70m-from-our-cancer-drug-making-capacity-glaxosmithkline","fields":{"headline":"Brexit to swallow £70m meant for developing cancer drugs, says GSK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Up to £70m will have to be diverted from developing new cancer drugs in order to prepare for the impact of Brexit, Britain’s biggest maker pharmaceuticals of has warned. In a stark intervention over the extra costs being incurred, Phil Thomson, president of global affairs at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), made clear that something approaching the figure would have to be spent whatever the outcome of trade talks. In evidence to the Commons health select committee, he said he would rather be spending the money on the company’s efforts to find new, life-saving cancer treatments. He said the company estimated that 1,700 of its products would be directly affected by a chaotic Brexit, with new regulation processes, labs and approval systems costing “somewhere between £60m and £70m”. “Even if we have a smooth and orderly Brexit process, and we work through with a new [free trade agreement] or a new arrangement, there are going to be costs of that magnitude anyway, but they will probably be more phased,” Thomson told the committee. “We will probably be able to reallocate some of those costs elsewhere. It may not be as significant as the contingency plan, but the reality is that we are already going to have to spend some of that. “All I would say to you is that we are going to do everything we can to minimise disruption. “Obviously, that money could though, be being put behind clinical trials, and I can tell you right now that we have a cancer portfolio we are trying to invest in, into which that money should be going, to develop the next generation of cancer medicines. “That is something – I will be honest with you – that we are wrestling with internally inside GSK.” He added that under some scenarios, products that have been approved in the UK would need to be re-authorised for Europe. “Of the products affected, the impact of the testing changes and the reregistration is about 13,000 packs that will have to be updated as a result of what we need to do,” he said. Some money was already being spent, he said. “The timeline to implement the laboratories, at a minimum, takes 18 months – so, we are already having to initiate cost as a result of this.” Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the health select committee, said it was her personal view that the UK should try to stay inside the European Medicines Agency, to ensure current regulation remained as simple as possible. The Liberal Democrats said they had uncovered figures suggesting the cost of importing medicines had already jumped by £5m since the Brexit vote. Freedom of information data from 32 NHS trusts found they had spent an extra £1.2m due to the fall in the pound since the referendum – the equivalent of an extra £5m across all 135 NHS trusts. GSK has already announced it is preparing to build new drug testing facilities in Europe as part of contingency plans. The pharmaceutical industry as a whole has been warning about the impact on patients as a result of a chaotic Brexit. Sheuli Porkess, from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: “The way each company is approaching Brexit depends on their own individual circumstances, but we’ve already seen a number of companies make decisions about their future business. “These decisions are being taken – at a cost – to replicate important safety and quality assurance processes for medicines in the UK and the EU, and take time to implement. “The sheer scale and complexity of safely ensuring 45m packs of medicine make their way from the UK to Europe each month – and over 37m packs coming the other way – requires processes to be in place well before March 2019.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: “Our absolute priority is the safety of patients and we are doing everything we can to make sure they continue to have access to the best and most innovative medicines, and that their safety is protected by the strongest regulatory framework.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/philippe-coutinho-join-barcelona-142m-deal-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T17:44:20Z","webTitle":"Philippe Coutinho joins Barcelona after £142m deal agreed with Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/philippe-coutinho-join-barcelona-142m-deal-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/philippe-coutinho-join-barcelona-142m-deal-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Philippe Coutinho joins Barcelona after £142m deal agreed with Liverpool","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Barcelona have announced the signing of Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for a fee that could reach £142m. The Brazil international flew out on Saturday night and is expected to be at Barcelona’s match with Levante on Sunday afternoon. The 25-year-old did not join his Liverpool team-mates as they flew to Dubai on Saturday for a break and has been adamant that he did not wish to play again for the Anfield club. In a statement on their website, Liverpool said: “Liverpool FC can confirm Philippe Coutinho will be leaving the club after a transfer agreement was reached with FC Barcelona, subject to a medical and agreement of personal terms. The player now has permission to complete the usual formalities to conclude the transfer immediately.” Barcelona confirmed Coutinho’s arrival on their website shortly afterwards, revealing the player will have a €400m (£355m) buyout clause. Barcelona have put together a package worth a basic fee of £106m, plus a further £36m in variables, of which £26m should be easily met. After the £105m basic, an additional £17m would be payable for the first 100 games Coutinho plays for Barcelona, £4.4m per 25 games. A further £4.4m would be paid for Champions League qualification in the first two seasons with a £4.4m bonus for winning the competition. Coutinho has agreed a five-and-a-half-year deal worth £12.1m a season. Liverpool had refused to countenance a sale in the summer, going so far as to release a statement insisting that Coutinho would not depart. Barça’s private confidence that Liverpool would back down proved to be unfounded, even though they did not give up until the last day of the summer transfer window. After the window closed, the club’s sporting director, Albert Soler, publicly claimed that at the last minute Liverpool had offered to sell for £177m but that they had that refused to meet such a figure as an act of financial responsibility. That statement was met with a denial from Anfield. Barcelona had not given up on Coutinho but there was an internal debate about the extent to which they could afford to meet a fee which they believed would be in the region of £124m. Some on the board feared that not only was the fee high, having spent more than £88m of the £196m they had received for Neymar on Ousmane Dembélé, it might also deny opportunities to squad members such as Denis Suárez. While there was little doubt that in the medium to long term he was a priority, Coutinho would also be unable to play in the Champions League this season. Coutinho remained determined to depart and Liverpool’s posture had changed. That shift became apparent in the public remarks from Anfield, as well as the private information Barcelona had, as they worked with the Brazilian’s camp. Liverpool team-mates had soon come to assume that he was going to leave. Jürgen Klopp explained the departure on the Liverpool website, writing: “It is with great reluctance that we – as a team and club – prepare to say farewell to a good friend, a wonderful person and a fantastic player in Philippe Coutinho. “It is no secret that Philippe has wanted this move to happen since July, when Barcelona first made their interest known. Philippe was insistent with me, the owners and even his team-mates this was a move he was desperate to make happen. Despite that, we managed to keep the player here beyond the summer window, hoping that we would be able to persuade him to stay and be part of what we are looking to do. “I can tell the Liverpool supporters that we, as a club, have done everything within our means to convince Philippe that remaining part of LFC was as attractive as moving to Spain, but he is 100% certain his future – and that of his family – belongs at Barcelona.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/06/swatting-death-police-hoax-call-tyler-barriss","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T18:25:16Z","webTitle":"'Swatting' death: accused man has made other false reports to police, officials say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/06/swatting-death-police-hoax-call-tyler-barriss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/06/swatting-death-police-hoax-call-tyler-barriss","fields":{"headline":"'Swatting' death: accused man has made other false reports to police, officials say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A man accused of making a hoax 911 call that led to another man’s death in Kansas has a history of making similarly false reports to the police, including bomb hoaxes centered around two schools and an ABC affiliate TV station, according to authorities. Tyler Barriss, 25, is set to be transferred to custody in Kansas from Los Angeles, where he allegedly made the call to police that ended with an officer fatally shooting Andrew Finch, an unarmed Wichita man with no known connection to Barriss. Police in Wichita said they received a call on the evening of 28 December claiming a man had been shot and two others had been taken hostage. When officers arrived at Finch’s home, the man reached towards his waistband when told to raise his hands and was shot, according to Troy Livingston, Wichita’s deputy police chief. Livingston said: “Due to the actions of a prankster we have an innocent victim.” Barriss is accused of making the call in order to exact revenge for a dispute arising from his activities as an online gamer. Police believe that Finch, who was studying to be a tattoo artist and had two children, had no connection to the dispute and was mistakenly targeted by the prank call, which is known as “swatting” after the involvement of police Swat teams. According to police and court records, Barriss has made about 20 hoax calls and was sentenced to more than two years in jail in 2016 for making false bomb threats against two Los Angeles schools and an ABC affiliate TV station that led to their evacuations. Court records show that Barriss told one of the schools: “There are 10 backpacks that have bombs in them. Do not take this lightly.” Barriss, who was released in January 2017, targeted numerous other venues as far away as Illinois and New Hampshire, according to police, before Finch’s death. Barriss’s grandmother, who had helped raise him and suspected him of making the bomb threats, alleged he issued “constant threats to beat my face bloody”. Dexerto, a gaming website, reported that Barriss became embroiled in an argument over a $2 wager while playing Call of Duty, resulting in threats between him and another player to “swat” each other. Finch was unrelated to the argument and his family said he did not play online games. While Finch is thought to be the first direct fatality from swatting, the FBI has warned it is a growing problem in the US, with about 400 incidents occurring each year. Callers often use software to disguise their number when making the hoax calls. The rise of swatting has led to calls for police to improve processes that identify hoax calls, and to better handle confrontations with innocent parties who are reported to be armed. Lawyers for Finch’s family said that while “swatters” carry blame, ultimately it is the police’s responsibility to ensure they do not shoot people who pose no risk. “Justice for the Finch family constitutes criminal charges against the shooting officer and any other liable officers as well as damages against the city of Wichita for the policies and practices of its police department,” the attorney Andrew Stroth, who is representing the family, told the Associated Press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/12/country-diary-farlington-marshes-hampshire-return-hunting-harrier","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T05:30:21Z","webTitle":"Country diary: a marsh harrier causes havoc among the wildfowl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/12/country-diary-farlington-marshes-hampshire-return-hunting-harrier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/12/country-diary-farlington-marshes-hampshire-return-hunting-harrier","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: a marsh harrier causes havoc among the wildfowl","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As I raised my binoculars to scan the reed bed for bearded tits, a stocky, chocolate-brown bird of prey lazily flapped across my field of vision. “Marsh harrier!” I exclaimed as it drifted a few metres above the fronded stems, its wings held in a characteristic shallow V. The harrier was silhouetted against the setting sun but, as it pirouetted around, its pale-coloured crown flared gold in the late afternoon light. Marsh harriers were once widespread in Britain but, by the early 1970s, persecution and habitat loss saw the population dwindle to a single breeding pair. Thanks to a reduction in pesticide use and efforts to improve and expand their preferred wetland habitat, this number has risen to about 400 pairs. Although traditionally summer migrants, wintering as far south as sub-Saharan Africa, a growing number – usually females – remain all year round. Though their stronghold is in East Anglia, they breed in low numbers in other regions where large reed beds are found. But these majestic raptors remain a rare sight in Hampshire. A pair raised two chicks at Titchfield Haven in 2017 – only the second time marsh harriers have bred in the county since 1957. As the harrier methodically quartered its hunting ground in search of prey, it flushed out a flock of lapwing, their wings flickering as they wheeled up over the lagoon. At the sound of their kazoo-like alarm calls, thousands of waders and wildfowl exploded into flight, blossoming across the sky like fireworks. Chevrons of brent geese, wigeon and shelduck headed out to sea; while pulsating nebulas of black-tailed godwits, curlew, dunlin and oystercatchers performed evasive aerial manoeuvres. Banking to avoid a mob of black-headed gulls, the harrier flew into the maelstrom and made a pass at a lagging teal, but missed. As it circled back, sending up a second wave of water birds, the soaring form of a falcon drew my attention. A kestrel was winnowing above the harrier, seemingly using the larger bird as cover. The harrier carved a path through a murmuration of starlings. As one bird jinked out of its grasp, the kestrel pulled smoothly out of its slipstream and sailed past, plunging down to strike the unsuspecting starling’s back with outstretched talons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/06/trump-jeff-sessions-russia-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T20:33:00Z","webTitle":"'Not way off, but off': Trump challenges reports he meddled in Russia inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/06/trump-jeff-sessions-russia-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/06/trump-jeff-sessions-russia-investigation","fields":{"headline":"'Not way off, but off': Trump challenges reports he meddled in Russia inquiry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump attempted on Saturday to fight off renewed reports that he intervened in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, insisting: “Everything I’ve done is 100% proper.” Trump said a New York Times story that outlined his unsuccessful attempt to stop the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, from recusing himself from the Russia investigation was “off, not way off, but off”. The special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly aware of Trump’s actions as he looks into whether the president has obstructed the inquiry into Russian attempts to sway the election in his favour. “Everything I’ve done is 100% proper, that’s how I do things – proper,” the president said during a 20-minute press conference at Camp David. “I guess the collusion is now dead, everyone’s found after a year of study that there’s been absolutely no collusion.” Following a week in which Trump bragged on Twitter about the size of his nuclear button and faced allegations in a new book that his close aides and family doubt his competency and grip on reality, the president also said the Mueller investigation was harming America’s reputation. “There was no collusion between us and the Russians,” he said. “Now, there has been collusion between Hillary Clinton, the [Democratic National Committee] and the Russians but unfortunately you people don’t cover it that much. “Everyone tells me I’m not under investigation. Maybe Hillary is, I don’t know. We’ve been very open. When you’ve done nothing wrong, let’s be open and get it over with. Honestly, it’s very bad for our country, it’s making our country look foolish and this is a country I don’t want looking foolish. It’s not going to look foolish as long as I’m here.” Sessions recused himself in March, over revelations that he held two undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador during the election campaign, in which he was a prominent supporter and adviser to Trump. Trump’s effort to keep Sessions in charge of an investigation into his campaign offers Mueller yet another avenue to explore as his prosecutors work to untangle potential evidence of obstruction. Actions under scrutiny include the firing of the former FBI director James Comey; an allegation by Comey that Trump encouraged him to end an investigation into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn; and the president’s role in drafting an incomplete and potentially misleading statement about a 2016 meeting with Russians. The New York Times reported this week that Trump directed his White House counsel, Don McGahn, to tell Sessions not to recuse himself. The report added to the portrait of a president left furious by an investigation that he again called a hoax on Saturday and suggests that he worked through an intermediary to keep the inquiry under the watch of an attorney general he expected would be loyal. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed to the Associated Press that McGahn spoke with Sessions just before he announced his recusal, to urge him not to do so. One of the people said McGahn contacted Sessions at the president’s behest. All three spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid publicly discussing an ongoing investigation. “What this adds that is new is that [Trump] took action to prevent, to attempt to prevent, Sessions from recusing himself,” the Notre Dame criminal law professor Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor, told the AP. “So now we go simply beyond his state of mind, his personal beliefs, to taking concrete action to attempt to prevent Sessions from recusing himself.” Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly maintained that he did nothing improper and that as president he had unequivocal authority to fire Comey and take other actions. They may also argue that the president was empowered to want the attorney general he appointed to oversee the justice department’s Russian meddling investigation or, as McGahn contended to Sessions, that there was no basis or reason at that time for the attorney general to recuse himself. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who supports Sessions’ decision to recuse himself, told the AP he saw Trump’s order to McGahn as another sign of the president’s novice and norm-breaking approach to governing, rather than evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. “This may have been part of the learning curve,” Turley said. “It does not necessarily mean that he was covering up a crime.” Sessions’ recusal left the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, in charge of the Russia investigation. Once Trump fired Comey two months later, Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to run the investigation. Four people, including Flynn and Manafort, have been charged so far. The Sessions recusal has been a sore spot for Trump, with the president publicly deriding the decision and lamenting his selection of the former Alabama senator as his attorney general. In a July interview with the New York Times, Trump said: “Well, Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/nottingham-forest-fa-cup-arsenal-mark-warburton-managers-sacked","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T19:00:01Z","webTitle":"Echoes of past but hope for future after latest Nottingham Forest firing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/nottingham-forest-fa-cup-arsenal-mark-warburton-managers-sacked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/nottingham-forest-fa-cup-arsenal-mark-warburton-managers-sacked","fields":{"headline":"Echoes of past but hope for future after latest Nottingham Forest firing","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The timing was not ideal. A week before Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Arsenal and in the sliver of time between two games in 48 hours, Mark Warburton was sacked as Nottingham Forest manager. Fans might have been forgiven for fearing the worst, that this was just a continuation of an old regime that made the club a laughing stock over the past five years. Last summer the frantic reign of Fawaz al-Hasawi came to an end as the Olympiakos owner, Evangelos Marinakis, took over at the City Ground. Given that Marinakis has match-fixing charges in Greece hanging over him (ones he denies), there was immediately a sense that Forest had jumped out of the frying pan, and straight into another slightly different but still sizzling frying pan. But more or less from the moment the Marinakis regime arrived Forest started looking like a proper football club again. Admittedly that was not a particularly high bar to leap over, given what came before. The previous regime was one littered with disorganisation both major and minor, high and low farce, from cancelling a signing owing to an eye test and failing to pay transfer fees on time, right down to not having enough toilet rolls on match days. In five years half a dozen winding-up orders were issued, three transfer embargoes were enforced and there were eight permanent managers (including three in three months in 2016) and four chief executives. For much of those five years you could barely describe the staff at the club as skeleton: skeletons, after all, have a structure. Hasawi was, according to a number of people who worked with him at Forest, a football fanatic who was in way over his head. Forest were a plaything and he was a man with almost no interest in running a football club who was running a football club. “If it wasn’t in a red shirt on a Saturday, he wasn’t interested,” one former employee told the Observer last year. That, at least, has changed now. Nicholas Randall QC, a sports lawyer, was installed as chairman. A chief executive, a financial officer, a commercial officer and a head of football operations were all brought in. A marketing manager was recruited from Adidas. That most of those positions had previously been vacant gives an indication of the state of things before. Small touches also give the impression that Forest are in safer hands. Randall has met with the newly formed supporters’ trust and the club is working with Forza Garibaldi, a separate fan group set up last season in order, among other things, to beef up the atmosphere at the City Ground. The club hero Johnny Metgod was appointed as a director. You could write this off as clever PR – and they have certainly done a good job of getting some influential figures onside – but at the very least it is an improvement. There are significant caveats to any optimism, not least the charges made against Marinakis in November. He was accused, along with 27 others, of match-fixing and ordered to step down as Olympiakos owner: he denied the charges with gusto, but it is still pretty troubling. The dismissal of Warburton also set queasily familiar alarm bells ringing. Forest are 14th in the Championship and the prospect of reaching the play-offs was drifting, but promotion this season was never particularly realistic. The decision felt hasty and had an echo of the former era of chaos: at this point stability in the dugout feels like a distant memory. But there were certainly problems with Warburton’s reign. On a basic level, results were not great: only second-bottom Birmingham have lost more games. Curious tactical decisions (such as playing Ben Osborn, Forest’s best midfielder, at left-back), a stubborn adherence to a slow, patient passing style regardless of the suitability of the players to do so and a summer transfer window charitably described as patchy were factors. Frank McParland, the director of football who worked with Warburton at Brentford and Rangers and who oversaw that transfer window, has left the club, too. It was telling that Jordan Smith, Forest’s young goalkeeper, said on Friday there was merely an element of surprise among the squad that Warburton was sacked. When asked if he had been unhappy with the former manager’s insistence on him passing from deep, instructions with which he was clearly uncomfortable, Smith diplomatically declined to answer. There is a weariness that Forest are here, looking for a manager once again, but it is certainly easier to trust the new owners to get this appointment right. Aitor Karanka is the bookies’ favourite but against Arsenal the academy manager, Gary Brazil, the man responsible for bringing through the five youth products that started Forest’s last league game against Leeds, will be in the dugout. “I was expecting to play Bolton Under-23s at Alfreton on Friday,” said Brazil with a wry weariness: this is the third time in just under four years he has been asked to step in after a sacking. Brazil can take inspiration from the last time Forest pulled off a big FA Cup shock: Colin Calderwood was sacked before they beat Mark Hughes’s Manchester City in 2009 with John Pemberton in caretaker charge. For the most part Forest is a very different place, but some things remain the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/jan/07/azed-crossword-2378","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:01:07Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,378","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/jan/07/azed-crossword-2378","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/jan/07/azed-crossword-2378","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,378","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Special instructions: The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.

I’m Martin Farrer and this is the Guardian’s morning briefing. Campaigners against fossil fuels have claimed a major victory after the government agreed to allow Britain’s £2 trillion workplace pension schemes to dump their shares in oil, gas and coal companies more easily. In an exclusive story, our money editor Patrick Collinson says new regulations set to be introduced by ministers mean fund managers will be able to mirror members’ ethical concerns and address environmental problems. They overturn fiduciary duties that required schemes to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change. Catherine Howarth of campaign group ShareAction said the move was a “welcome breakthrough” which followed years of campaigning. Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion, said savers would have “the clear opportunity to have their say on where their money is invested and can reflect what is personally important to them”. The rules are expected to come into force next year. * * * Brexit rebel call – The Tory rebels who voted against the government last week have been emboldened by their success and are urging Theresa May to enlist Labour MPs to fashion a cross-party alliance for a soft Brexit. As the prime minister and her senior ministers meet today to thrash out the shape of Britain’s post-Brexit relations with the EU, the dissident Tories believe she could persuade opposition members to back a push for a closer future relationship with Brussels. But she must do so quickly, they say, before Jeremy Corbyn firms up his policies and prevents his MPs from backing the government. One said that if she was clever, May could “go to those sensible Labour people and put the hard Brexiters back in their box”. The full cabinet, which is divided over Brexit, meets to discuss its strategy tomorrow. Writing in the Guardian, Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and leading rebel, says the fomenting of hatred in the wake of last week’s vote – which he blames in part on the pro-Brexit press – “undermines the ability of politicians to engage in rational debate”. The publisher who launched the Harry Potter franchise has warned of another unintended Brexit consequence. Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury, says that British publishers benefit financially from the English-language rights to books published in the EU but, post-Brexit, rivals in America could muscle in, meaning less risk-taking and therefore fewer openings for new writers. * * * Diplomat found dead – Police in Beirut will today continue their investigation into the death of British diplomat Rebecca Dykes, whose body was found at the side of a road in the Lebanese capital on Saturday morning. Details about her death are still unclear but local police officials have suggested she was strangled. Dykes, 30, a policy manager with the Libya team at the Foreign Office, had been out with colleagues in the city’s Gemmayze district on Friday night. She is thought to have left on her own at around midnight. * * * Spoty surprise – Sir Mo Farah’s victories aren’t usually a surprise, but Britain’s greatest track Olympian shocked everyone last night – including himself – by winning the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award. Farah, whose four Olympic golds have been overshadowed by an anti-doping investigation into his former coach, was not at the ceremony in Liverpool. Instead he was presented the prize – known as Spoty – via videolink which promptly collapsed and viewers initially missed his surprised reaction. The boxer Anthony Joshua had been favourite to win but he ended up fourth behind Farah and Paralympic sprinter Jonnie Peacock and Superbikes rider Jonathan Rea. Our sports writer Sean Ingle says it is a sign that the British public has finally taken Farah to their hearts. * * * Airport chaos – More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled after a power cut brought the world’s busiest airport to a standstill. Passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta were left stranded when a fire damaged the hub’s electrical system at about 1pm local time on Sunday. All outgoing flights were stopped and incoming planes were held at point of departure. International flights were diverted. Closer to home, a one-day strike planned by Ryanair pilots on Wednesday has been suspended after their union agreed to meet management for talks about their dispute over representation tomorrow. * * * Cheesed off – What is it about Britain and Christmas? There was the Lapland New Forest wonderland that turned out to be anything but. Now there’s a festive stink about the The Giant Cheese Board event in London which promised all-you-can-eat cheese, plus mulled wine and helpers dresed as giant mice to guide you round. Some festival-goers reported feeling short-changed with one describing “plates of chopped up British cheeses, mostly hard, some caterers packs of chutney, no Camembert (baked or not), queues for cold and very sweet ‘low alcohol’ mulled wine”. The organisers denied the accusations but did acknowledge that the halloumi burger and camembert chef had fallen ill the night before. Lunchtime read: Melancholy and the battle of the sexes It was a bestselling cult classic and its admirers have included John Keats, Samuel Beckett, Philip Pullman and Cy Twombly. But while Robert Burton’s eccentric masterpiece The Anatomy of Melancholy might not feature on many household bookshelves these days, back in the 17th century it was a sensation. The “often exasperating, but strangely addictive” 1,400-page tome is the latest entry in Robert McCrum’s magisterial assessment of the 100 best non-fiction books of all time. Although it is ostensibly a medical text on the condition of the human mind, McCrum says the book also acts as “an offbeat, encyclopedic, stream-of-consciousness meditation on the mysteries of existence”. Burton, who also opines freely on the battle of the sexes, finds melancholy ingrained in the human condition, calling it “an inbred malady in every one of us”. Discuss.

The MEAA released some of the findings of the survey on Monday, revealing that 40% of respondents had experienced sexual harassment. The survey found that 11% of those working in the live performance sector had been the victim of a physical assault and 10% had been stalked by someone at work. The national director of Actors Equity, Zoe Angus, released some of the preliminary results of the survey at an industry forum last week and said the data painted a “compelling” picture of bullying, sexual harassment and assault in the sector. She said 40% to 50% of respondents had firsthand experiences of various forms of sexual harassment including “unwanted familiarity, leering [and] unpleasant jokes”. About 9% had experienced indecent exposure, 10% had been stalked by someone at work, 11% had been a victim of physical assault and 14% reported sexual assault. Angus said the survey showed bullying within the industry was “rife”. It found 62% of actors and technicians working in live performance in Australia experiencing some form of bullying. “In pretty much all the indicators the same number of people said they have witnessed these experiences,” she said. “[That is] anything from crime to the whole gamut of sex harassment and bullying.” On Monday the Confederation of Australian State Theatre (Cast) companies released a statement acknowledging “any failure” to address problems in the industry. “The findings provide sobering evidence of the negative experience of many artists working in Australian live performance,” a spokeswoman said. “Coming at a time of scrutiny and reflection around the world with regard to bullying and harassment in the entertainment industry, Cast companies consider that the release of the survey results will help fuel a turning point in the Australian environment. “We accept that it is our responsibility – as the current generation of leaders of Cast companies – to acknowledge any failure of our organisations to act effectively at all times in the past, and to ensure that as of now we commit to creating lasting and positive change for the future.” Cast represents Bell Shakespeare, Belvoir, Black Swan, the Malthouse, Melbourne Theatre Company, Queensland Theatre, the State Theatre Company of South Australia and Sydney Theatre Company. In the statement, the confederation confirmed its companies had “enthusiastically accepted an offer from the MEAA to work collaboratively on a review of policies and procedures in theatre workplaces, and also to explore the circumstances that might lead to inappropriate behaviours, and those that militate against effective reporting and management of cases”. The groups are expected to begin work on a new policy early in the new year. “While 34% of respondents to the survey reported that levels of bullying and harassment in live performance workplaces have been constant over time, it is encouraging to note that 27% say there has been some improvement, providing hope that there is the potential for real change,” Cast said. The survey found that 53% of victims and 60% of witnesses had never reported incidences of bullying, harassment or assault, and Angus said the low rate of reporting pointed towards a “historically poor culture in the live theatre sector, which had sought to downplay the issue”. Fifty-eight per cent of respondents said they were rarely or never told how to deal with workplaces issues related to sexual harassment and 47% found that, when they did report it, the situation was not handled well. In half of those cases, things became worse. Angus said theatre companies were now acknowledging they had sometimes failed in their responsibility to provide a safe and secure workplace for performers. “When an individual complains that they have been victim of or witnessed harassment or bullying, they should be able to expect their complaint will be taken seriously and result in action,” she said. “The grim lesson from this data is that there are not effective practices in place in Australian theatres to prevent or deal with sexual harassment and bullying.” The survey opened in July, before allegations of sexual harassment and assault against prominent American entertainment industry figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey came to light and the #metoo movement forced greater recognition of the issue. Angus said the survey had received about 1,200 responses and found that, while 40% of victims reported incidents of harassment or assault, only about a quarter were satisfied with the outcomes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/18/trump-drop-climate-change-national-security-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T04:06:45Z","webTitle":"Trump drops climate change from US national security strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/18/trump-drop-climate-change-national-security-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/18/trump-drop-climate-change-national-security-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Trump drops climate change from US national security strategy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Trump administration has dropped climate change from a list of global threats in a new national security strategy the president unveiled on Monday. Instead, Trump’s NSS paper emphasised the need for the US to regain its economic competitiveness in the world. That stance represents a sharp change from the Obama administration’s NSS, which placed climate change as one of the main dangers facing the nation and made building international consensus on containing global warming a national security priority. White House officials said on Sunday that the Trump NSS was the culmination of 11 months of collaboration between all the leading security, foreign policy and economic agencies of government. The exclusion of climate change as a national security threat appears, however, to conflict with views previously expressed by the defense secretary, James Mattis. “Climate change is not identified as a national security threat but climate and the importance of the environment and environmental stewardship are discussed,” a senior administration official said. Another official said Trump’s remarks when he announced he was taking the US out of the Paris climate accord “would be the guidepost for the language in the NSS on climate”. In that speech in June, Trump declared “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris” and alleged the agreement “hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries”. The Federalist website, which first reported that Trump would drop climate change from the NSS, quoted the draft document as suggesting the Trump administration would actively oppose efforts to reduce the burning of oil, gas and coal for energy. “US leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests,” the website quoted the document as saying. “Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty.” A senior official said on Sunday the main difference between the Trump NSS and its predecessors was a new emphasis on border security and economic issues. “The economic piece … gets much more attention,” the official said. “The insistence that economic security is national security.” In unpublished testimony provided to Congress after his confirmation hearings in January, Mattis said the US military had to consider how the thawing Arctic and drought in global flashpoints would pose present and future challenges. “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today,” Mattis said in written answers to questions posed after the public hearing by Democratic members of the committee. Mattis and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, are reported to have argued against leaving the Paris climate agreement. Officials said the new NSS was based on Trump’s previous speeches on national security and foreign policy. The president was said to have decided to break with normal practice and launch it with a speech. “As far as we have been able to determine, no president has ever rolled this out with a speech before,” a senior administration official said. “The president was briefed on the document all the way along but when it was near completion and when it was shown to him what it looked like, he was very excited and he personally said he wanted to introduce it to the American people and to the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/20/alaskas-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-1bn-price-tag","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T18:38:47Z","webTitle":"Alaska’s Arctic national wildlife refuge now has a $1bn price tag on it | Kim Heacox","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/alaskas-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-1bn-price-tag","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/alaskas-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-1bn-price-tag","fields":{"headline":"Alaska’s Arctic national wildlife refuge now has a $1bn price tag on it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Years ago, camping in Alaska’s Arctic national wildlife refuge, I watched a herd of caribou – 100,000 bulls, cows and their three-week-old calves – braid over the tundra, moving to a rhythm as old as the wind. “Not many places like this left today,” said my friend Jeff, sitting next to me above an ice-fringed river. And so Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski believes this refuge – 80 miles east of Prudhoe Bay – could generate $1bn over 10 years once it’s opened to oil leasing. She and her Republican colleagues slipped this drilling provision into the Senate Republican tax bill. Murkowski repeatedly says this development would cover just 2,000 acres, “about one ten-thousandth of ANWR”. The acronym ANWR conveniently deletes the words “wildlife” and “refuge”, with no regard for the polar bears, Arctic fox, musk oxen and migratory ground-nesting birds that come there every summer, some species from as far away as Patagonia. Alaska’s lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, has said that drilling in ANWR is necessary to deal with climate change. His caddywhompus logic: we need to drill for more oil to raise money to address a problem that’s caused by humanity’s addiction to oil. Why not just say the truth? We want the money. Murkowski adds: “We have waited nearly 40 years for the right technology to come along for a footprint small enough for the environment to be respected.” They have not. Alaskans have been trying to drill here for decades, using one crazy rationale after another. At one hearing the state’s lone congressman, Don Young, put a blue pen mark on his nose to show how small the industry footprint would be. Clever man. The development would in fact be a spider web of roads, pipelines, well pads and landing strips smack in the middle of the biological heart of the refuge. It would look less like a refuge and more like Prudhoe Bay, where thousands of spills have been reported. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington says the whole idea is “ludicrous”, noting that the Republican tax plan would add roughly $1.5tn to the national deficit in five years [with the richest 1% of Americans reaping half of the tax cuts]. “I am disturbed,” she says. She should be. Christopher Lewis, a retired BP manager of exploration, has said: “I do not believe that there are any adequate, commercially viable reservoirs in the Arctic refuge.” The reality is “there are other less sensitive and less costly places to explore”. Meanwhile, the congressionally mandated Climate Science Special Report announced recently that nearly all global warming since 1951 has been caused by humans, with 2014-16 the hottest years on record. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2, a heat-trapping gas produced by burning oil and coal) now exceeds 403 parts per million (ppm), the highest by far in the past 800,000 years (that averaged 170-280ppm). And it’s rising. Christiana Figueres, a former United Nations climate chief, predicts that we have only three years left to “bend the [carbon] emissions curve downward” and mitigate a series of runaway global catastrophes. Shell and BP expect global temperatures to rise as much as 5C by 2050. Senator Murkowski acknowledges this, but remains committed to drilling, as do others. She never asks Alaskans to sacrifice; never compels them to get innovative and be truly independent. Why not lead the world into the clean energy revolution? Go solar and tidal. Alaska has massive tides. Don Young no doubt wiped that blue mark off his nose after the hearing. Do not mistake his cleverness for wisdom. He knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. The esteemed scientist Jane Goodall sent a letter to every member of the US Senate urging them to vote no on this, adding that the refuge’s “very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual connection to nature, a necessary element of human psyche”. On that special day – one of the best of my life – the caribou flowed past Jeff and me as if in a dream. I wondered then as I do now: when they return, what will they find?

Farah’s own coach was caught on camera uttering a disbelieving expletive after the four-time Olympic champion was announced as winner of the prize. Farah had been a 50 to one outsider with bookmakers to win the prestigious award, with the boxer Anthony Joshua considered the overwhelming favourite. When former Liverpool FC player and manager Kenny Dalglish announced he had triumphed in the public vote, Farah’s new coach Gary Lough turned to his wife Paula Radcliffe and exclaimed: “That’s a fucking joke.” Lineker and Logan had to cope with the failure of the video link to London at the crucial moment, meaning that viewers did not hear Farah’s reaction. The 34-year-old did not attend the event, but conducted a live interview from St Mary’s University in Twickenham during the show. His daughter sat alongside him, helping to take care of Farah’s two-year-old son who was suffering from a vomiting bug. At one point, she picked up her irritable brother and rushed from the room to howls of laughter from the studio audience. Joshua, a three-time heavyweight world title belt holder, attended the ceremony alongside 10,000 others and had been widely expected to triumph. But he was 18 votes short of the podium, finishing behind Paralympic sprinter Jonnie Peacock and Superbikes rider Jonathan Rea. When the video link was re-established, Farah did not disguise his surprise that he had won with 83,524 votes to Rea’s 80,567. “I am pretty amazed,” he said. “There are such great people on the shortlist from Anthony Joshua to Lewis Hamilton and Jonnie Peacock. “I do wish I was there I wish I was giving back to people. My son and twin daughters have been sick. In fact, while I was in the room my son was throwing up everywhere. I owe it to the public and people who supported me and voted [for] me. I can’t stop staring at it,” he said, gesturing at the trophy. Farah’s athletic achievements are undisputed, as an owner of 10 global titles. He won 10,000m gold and 5,000m silver at the world championships in London this summer to add to four Olympic golds and a further five world titles. But his medals have been overshadowed by controversies surrounding his support team. Alberto Salazar, his former coach, remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency with a leaked report stating he almost certainly flouted anti-doping rules with six of his athletes – none of whom were Farah. After the 2016 Rio Olympics, Farah gave an interview stating his belief that he would never reach the Spoty podium again. “I won’t be in the top three,” he said. “You have just got to accept what it is. What drives me is winning medals and just going out there and enjoy it.” However, on Sunday night, he said: “It means everything to me. I owe it to my country and I know I get the cheers on the track. It encourages me every day to keep grafting.” Joshua, who beat Wladimir Klitschko in a world heavyweight unification bout at Wembley in April, made a hasty exit after failing to reach the podium. The BBC also wrestled with how to reflect the cloud hanging over another of the shortlisted candidates, the four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome. The cyclist had been third favourite to win the award after making history by winning the Tour de France and Vuelta a España in the same year. But an investigation by the Guardian and Le Monde last week revealed that he had failed a drugs test during the Vuelta. He had twice the permitted level of asthma drug Salbutamol in his system. But the video in support of Froome had clearly been recorded before Wednesday’s news, and was effusive in its praise. “King of the counterattack, master of the mountains, unflappable, untouchable, unbeatable,” viewers heard as pictures showed Froome grinding up a gruelling ascent. “How about history? How about back-to-back victories? The greatest of a generation. No ego here, no celebrity ... history man, family man, stomach churning, pedals keep turning.” Balance was needed and it was up to Clare Balding, one of three presenters alongside Lineker and Logan, to provide it. Tough questions were in order but this was not so much an interrogation as a gentle stroking over the video link to Mallorca where Froome has remained on a training camp with his Team Sky team mates. “What’s your take on it and the concern caused?” asked Balding. Froome, 32, looked noticeably uncomfortable but said: “I do completely get it. I understand the concerns. I’ve been a bike rider for 10 years, I know how some people might look at our sport. That’s a responsibility that I take really seriously. “I’m an asthmatic and I have been since I was a child. I have a puffer to help me manage my asthma. I’ve never taken more puffs than I should. This is quite a horrible situation. We’re working as hard as we can to get to the bottom of it.” The four women who made the 12-strong shortlist – Bianca Walkden, Anya Shrubsole, Elise Christie and Johanna Konta - only accounted for 8% of the vote but Jessica Ennis-Hill, who has never won the main award, was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. “I’m completely overwhelmed,” she said. “Amazing women have inspired me throughout my career and a roomful of legends here to see me get this award is unbelievable.” The other winners were the England women’s cricket team, the coaches of the GB 4x100m relay team, tennis veteran Roger Federer, young Manchester City footballer Phil Foden and Bradley Lowery, the six-year-old Sunderland fan who died of cancer after a battle with the illness that captured the nation’s hearts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/17/football-liverpool-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-philippe-coutinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T21:07:29Z","webTitle":"Oxlade-Chamberlain hails Liverpool team-mate Coutinho’s class","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/17/football-liverpool-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-philippe-coutinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/17/football-liverpool-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-philippe-coutinho","fields":{"headline":"Oxlade-Chamberlain hails Liverpool team-mate Coutinho’s class","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain described Philippe Coutinho as “the most professional person I’ve seen all season” after the Brazilian playmaker dazzled in the comfortable victory at Bournemouth to thrust Liverpool back into the Premier League’s top four. Coutinho, whose start to the season was hampered by illness and a back injury after Barcelona failed with three bids to buy him, opened the scoring for the visitors, struck the woodwork from a free-kick and set up Roberto Firmino for the fourth as Jürgen Klopp’s team ran riot. Barcelona are expected to test Liverpool’s resolve to retain the 25-year-old next month but, when that matter was raised in a post-match interview, Oxlade-Chamberlain moved to intervene. “Phil’s a Liverpool player right now and he’s doing really well for us,” said the England midfielder, putting his arm around his team-mate. “He’s been the most professional person I’ve seen all season. He’s been top quality from the start and every time he gets on the pitch he does his all for the club. That’s the most important thing right now [and] it’s not fair to ask those kind of questions I don’t think. He gives us his all every game and that’s all we can ask from him.” Klopp saw Mohamed Salah register a 20th goal in 26 appearances for Liverpool, who are now unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, and praised his side’s overall approach. “We were really spot on,” the German said. “I’m really happy with the full package we showed today. We’re really satisfied. I don’t know [if Manchester City can be caught]. I don’t have a crystal ball. But they fight for everything. They are not flying at the moment, and they really work hard for it. If they struggle, like maybe nobody with their quality has struggled before, then someone should be there to use it, but I don’t see it. “But if I stopped working hard the moment I couldn’t be a league champion, I wouldn’t be here. We have so many things to play for. It’s really hard, really intense, and it’ll be unbelievable the number of points you’ll need at the end of the season to get anything. Everyone is winning up there, very often, so we need to carry on and stay on track. A lot of teams are in good shape, but City are winning all their games.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/17/2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-systematically-exploited-qatar-amnesty-international","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T20:50:03Z","webTitle":"Nepali migrant workers ‘systematically’ exploited, Amnesty says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/17/2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-systematically-exploited-qatar-amnesty-international","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/17/2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-systematically-exploited-qatar-amnesty-international","fields":{"headline":"Nepali migrant workers ‘systematically’ exploited, Amnesty says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nepali migrant workers continue to be trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation, according to new research by Amnesty International. A survey by Amnesty has found two-thirds of migrant workers have paid excessive or illegal recruitment fees. The phone survey of 414 Nepali migrant workers found 88% paid fees to agents for their jobs overseas. The fees were claimed to be so high that the majority had to borrow more than half the sum from village moneylenders, placing them in debt. More than half of the workers surveyed – 53% – said they received lower monthly salaries than was promised to them by recruitment agents. James Lynch, the deputy director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme, said: “Nepali migrant workers are being systematically and mercilessly set up. Forced to take out loans to pay the huge fees recruitment agencies charge them to work abroad, they are left so indebted they have no choice but to stay in jobs which often turn out to be low paid or dangerous. “The Nepali government’s weak enforcement of the law is playing straight into the hands of extortionists and loan sharks,” he said. “Migrant workers all too often end up trapped in a soul-destroying situation of working abroad for years simply to pay off huge, often illegal fees they were charged to take the job.

The first leg was an icy mismatch in north London in front of a paltry audience, the sequel a belter in the continent’s most atmospheric bearpit. The only common denominator was that Europe’s defending champions, for the seventh game in a row in all competitions, lost yet again. At least a crazy afternoon in the Massif Central showed Saracens are still bang up for the fight. After a week of soul-searching and home truths, they travelled away to France in search of something more than just a morale-boosting result. Their director of rugby, Mark McCall, had wanted to see a reaction to their miserable performance at Allianz Park and duly received it. Had it not been for a 50-metre howitzer of a 78th-minute match-winning penalty with two minutes left, Sarries would have had two points instead of a consolatory one. The north London side’s European hopes, nevertheless, hang by a precarious thread. They now need to win their final two games to qualify for the last eight, with their next fixture away at Ospreys in the new year set to determine which of the two clubs join Clermont in the quarter-finals. With Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje hoping to be back to reinforce the Sarries’ pack by then, it is too early to write them off yet. It is similarly too early to pronounce that Clermont are nailed on to reach for the final in Bilbao in May but on days like this it is easy to see why they have not lost here to English opposition for nine years. For all Saracens’ character and prickly defiance, Clermont would probably have won by more had it not been for some baffling decisions from the Irish referee, Andrew Brace, and his TMO, Simon McDowell. By the time Clermont had Nick Abendanon sent to the sin-bin for crashing into an airborne George Kruis after Sean Maitland and Jackson Wray had escaped for apparently worse offences, the home crowd were seething with injustice and, to a large extent, they had a point. Saracens did have two men sent to the sin-bin but Will Skelton could potentially have been shown a card a couple of times before he finally departed and there was a distinct sense of Brace making amends for previous errors, particularly surrounding high tackles, when Juan Figallo walked in the 66th minute with the visitors leading 21-18. It was always going to be tough for Saracens to hold on and, once Clermont had been restored to 15 men, the inevitable duly unfolded. First Morgan Parra slotted his sixth penalty of the afternoon and then, with the Sarries’ scrum penalised under serious pressure, Scott Spedding had one last chance to soothe Gallic nerves. The France full-back stretched his giant hamstrings, eyed up the faraway posts and added his name to the list of long-distance matchwinners alongside the likes of Tim Stimpson and Paul Thorburn. McCall, though, preferred to look on the bright side, having urged his players to focus on producing a performance – which they did – rather than simply the result. “It felt like we were much more ourselves today,” he said. “We attacked the game and we fought for everything. The players weren’t here to roll over. Everyone is saying it felt better and there is improvement in us for definite. We all know that when we get through this patch, whether it’s this week or next, it will end soon. We will get through this little period.” Something better still had looked briefly possible when Saracens stormed into a 13-0 lead inside the opening 10 minutes. They looked unrecognisable from the mediocre Monday mob, a couple of yards sharper in thought and deed, and it took Clermont time to react. They were still seeking a solution when Ben Spencer dummied cleverly into space and surged past Spedding and David Strettle to score from 25 metres out, Owen Farrell adding the conversion to two early penalties. With Maitland controversially being spared a yellow card for clattering an airborne Isaia Toeava, the home side were further inconvenienced when Alivereti Raka and Damian Penaud limped out of the fray prematurely, injured in separate collisions during a thrilling 80-metre break-out from the Clermont 22. It was becoming a different type of game and Saracens were starting to creak even before Skelton and Figallo saw yellow. They were held scoreless for 50 minutes as Parra chipped last year’s beaten finalists back into the contest, only for Alex Lozowski to stretch over early in the final quarter to give his team fresh hope. It was not to be but Sarries can at least now look each other in the eye this week knowing they have restored a significant amount of self-respect.

The seven-year-old, who has been defeated only once in 10 starts over fences, is a six-times Grade One-winning chaser. So brilliant at the 2015 and 2016 Cheltenham Festivals, winning the Supreme Novice Hurdle and the Arkle Trophy respectively, each time under Ruby Walsh, Douvan had been one of the favourites for the Queen Mother Champion Chase on his return in March. “I haven’t been happy with Douvan over the past few days,” Ireland’s champion jumps trainer said. “He appeared to have recovered from the problem that ruled him out of the Tingle Creek Chase but has been intermittently lame since we started doing more with him during the week.” Mullins added: “I have spoken to his owner, Rich Ricci, and because of the calibre of horse Douvan is we’ve decided to take a conservative approach and consequently he won’t be running this season.” Douvan last ran when suffering his only defeat over fences at the 2017 Festival when he was finished seventh, 12 lengths behind the winner, in the Champion Chase. That loss, at odds of 2-9, gave bookmakers a huge boost. A stress fracture of the pelvis subsequently emerged as the reason for that poor performance . After the Racing Post had broken the news on social media, another Mullins-trained horse – Min, a six-year-old who has won his last three races in Ricci’s colours – was cut to 3-1 from 6-1 for the Champion Chase. The market for that race is headed by Nicky Henderson’s Altior at 6-4. Altior, who won the Arkle in March, has not raced in public so far this season. At Thurles on Sunday, Killahara Castle etched her name into the history books as she became the first horse to win at 200-1 in Ireland when causing a huge upset in a Listed mares novice hurdle. The six-year-old, trained in Tipperary by John Burke, gained victory at the 21st attempt at the main expense of the 8-13 favourite True Self, from Mullins’ stable. Ridden by the trainer’s brother, Martin, and owned by their sister, Elaine, Killahara Castle led between the last two flights to run out a clear winner by five lengths. “We were just hoping for a bit of black type,” the winning rider said. “We stuck her in hoping the race would break up a bit better than what it did, but once she was in, we said we might as well run her. She has rakes of ability, but it’s all in her head, if we could get it out. “They went a good gallop and they just came back and she stayed galloping. The smaller field suited her as well, as she is usually really keen but settled lovely today and everything went right. That’s my biggest win and first Listed win.” The last 200-1 winner in Britain was Dandy Flame at Wolverhampton in July 2016, while the longest-priced winner was 250-1 shot Equinoctial at Kelso in November 1990. Elsewhere on the Thurles card, Joseph O’Brien’s Rhinestone earned a quote of 16-1 for the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham after he spreadeagled rivals in the National Hunt Flat race on his second appearance. The 11-4 chance, ridden by Derek O’Connor, was left in front when the Burke-trained Darcis Boy ran out after five furlongs and steadily pulled away to score by 19 lengths from the 4-7 favourite Sancta Simone. O’Connor said: “He didn’t rightly relax the first day, but relaxed brilliantly today and showed his full ability. “It wasn’t the strongest bumper and we’ve to be realistic, too, but it was a good performance. He’d be better on better ground and he likes to dictate.” There were Cheltenham clues, too, at Navan, where Next Destination was an authoritative winner of a novice hurdle. Next Destination was cut to 11-2 from 10-1 by one leading bookmaker for the Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham. Jamie Stier is to leave his position as chief regulatory officer at the British Horseracing Authority to take up a role in his native Australia. The BHA confirmed that Stier will leave during the first half of 2018. The BHA’s chief executive, Nick Rust, said: “Jamie has made a significant contribution as chief regulatory officer, and in his previous roles at the BHA since he joined in 2010. Our system of regulation has been improving and becoming much more transparent and progressive over the last few years. “I shall be looking for a successor for Jamie to take forward a number of key projects he has been involved in, bringing them to fruition by collaborating with all in our sport so that we can achieve our vision of a brighter future for British racing.” Stier said: “I will leave comfortable in the knowledge that the BHA is committed to consistently looking at ways in which the sport can be most effectively regulated to safeguard the reputation of racing and all those involved in it, including the real stars of the show, the horses.” Guardian tips for Monday Musselburgh 12.10 Silver Concorde 12.40 Trongate 1.10 Cousin Oscar 1.40 Sonic 2.15 Romulus Du Donjon 2.50 Doktor Glaz (nb) 3.20 Wot A Shot Plumpton 12.20 Knocknanuss 12.50 Fixe Le Kap 1.20 Sam Brown 1.50 Bears Rails 2.25 Hollywood All Star 3.00 Finnegan’s Garden 3.30 Hideaway Vic Ffos Las 12.30 Hands Of Stone 1.00 Oxwich Bay (nap) 1.30 Minella Scamp 2.05 Holdbacktheriver 2.40 Tornado In Milan 3.15 Misty Mai 3.45 Potters Tale Wolverhampton 2.00 Barnaby Brook 2.25 Ballymore Castle 3.10 Perfect Symphony 3.40 Magic Mark 4.10 Hasanoanda 4.40 Carp Kid 5.10 Wonderfillo"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/18/morning-mail-turnbull-reboots-with-positive-economic-news","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T20:12:52Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Turnbull reboots with positive economic news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/morning-mail-turnbull-reboots-with-positive-economic-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/morning-mail-turnbull-reboots-with-positive-economic-news","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Turnbull reboots with positive economic news","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 18 December. Top stories The government will point to a decline in gross debt in the end-of-year official budget forecast as Malcolm Turnbull tries to reboot his political fortunes after John Alexander’s win in the Bennelong byelection. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will unveil the midyear economic forecast today, with the document confirming debt has fallen since the May budget estimates, although the total figure remains well over $500bn. Under the revised estimates, gross debt will be $23bn less than the May budget forecast of $606bn and net debt will peak in 2018-19 at 19.2% of gross domestic product, down from the 19.8% of GDP figure forecast by treasury in May. But Labor says the new economic statement will lock in unpopular measures, such as cuts for the universities sector, tax increases for middle-income earners and tax cuts for corporations. Having secured its lower-house position courtesy of the byelection wins in New England and Bennelong, the government’s attention will now return to climate policy, and the prime minister may reshuffle his frontbench. Senior Trump administration officials have insisted the president is not preparing to fire the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is charged with investigating alleged collusion between Trump aides and Russia during the 2016 election. “There’s no conversation about that whatsoever in the White House,” said the director of legislative affairs, Marc Short. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said: “I was at dinner last night with the president and the vice-president, I haven’t heard anything about any firing.” But both men were critical of the investigation, which Mnuchin said had become “a giant distraction”. On Saturday the website Axios reported that Mueller had gained access to thousands of emails sent and received by 13 senior Trump aides before and during the presidential transition. Power prices in Australia rose almost 11% during 2017 but a new forecast says they will fall over the next two years because of the entry of 5,300MW of new generation capacity into the national electricity market – most of it renewable. The assessment by the Australian Energy Market Commission, which played a significant role in designing the Turnbull government’s proposed national energy guarantee, says the price reductions won’t last if governments don’t settle on an energy policy that provides incentives for investing in dispatchable power. It points to a rollercoaster effect in the system where the entry of wind and solar generators, which have lower operating costs than coal- and gas-fired generators, reduces wholesale electricity prices in the short term but “over time, low wholesale costs mean some gas- and coal-fired generators may not recover their operating and maintenance costs, resulting in exit from the market” and a new increase in prices. US Republicans have said they expect Congress to pass tax cuts legislation before Christmas, with a Senate vote as early as Tuesday and Donald Trump aiming to sign the bill by the end of the week. John Cornyn, the No 2 Republican in the Senate, told ABC’s This Week he was “confident” the Senate would pass the legislation, “probably on Tuesday”. Kevin Brady, the House of Representatives’ top tax writer, said he believed his party had the votes to pass the bill. “I think we are headed – the American people are headed – for a big win on Tuesday,” Brady told Fox News. If passed, the bill would be the biggest US tax rewrite since 1986 and would provide Republicans and Trump with their first major legislative victory since they took control of the White House in January, in addition to Congress. Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, Peter O’Neill, says a court’s decision to throw out a longstanding warrant for his arrest brings to an end a “witch hunt” that has lasted years. The PNG supreme court voided the warrant, issued by officers from the anti-corruption body Taskforce Sweep – which sought him for questioning over allegedly corrupt payments to a Port Moresby law firm – as defective. The supreme court found officers had not followed the arrest regulations, there was information missing from the form and it contained spelling mistakes. In addition the court found the warrant failed to meet legal requirements and was issued without jurisdiction. Several students were shot by police as they protested against O’Neill’s refusal to answer questions over the case this year. O’Neill survived a no-confidence motion last year before going on to retain the prime ministership at this year’s national elections. Sport Injury concerns over Craig Overton and Stuart Broad have added to England’s Ashes woes after they reached the end of day four in Perth on 132-4, still 127 runs short of making Australia bat again.

The French sailor François Gabart has broken the record for sailing solo around the world, circumnavigating the planet in 42 days and 16 hours – six days faster than previous record. “It’s a crazy pleasure … all this human energy,” Gabart said, arriving to crowds of cheering supporters in the French port of Brest. “I’m a solitary sailor but this is a pleasure.” Thinking time “At first blush the National Gallery of Victoria’s Triennial is playful – with nods everywhere to Instagram and selfies,” Brigid Delaney writes. “But it is also an unflinching exploration of the modern world.” Delaney guides us through the summer blockbuster’s mind-blowing collection, which covers everything from 3D printing to robotics, performance, film, painting, drawing, fashion design, sculpture and tapestry. The first thing visitors to the exhibition see is an 18-metre reclining Buddha created by the Chinese artist Xu Zhen, which is the largest work in Xu’s Eternal series. The exhibition also includes Ron Mueck’s installation Mass, which consists of 100 larger-than-life skulls each measuring 1.5 metres by 2 metres and the wonderful and weird work by the chemist and Norwegian artist Sissel Tolaas, whose medium is smells. “Oh God, they’re not like nice smells, they’re really gross,” one patron sniffs. “We’re told there’s a reckoning taking place now”, Charlotte Wood writes. “Female anger is at last finding its mark and its moment, but the speed of the avalanche, its force, feels too dangerous. My own cheering at the sight of the bastards going down feels too much like the delinquent ecstasy of a classroom run amok, and beneath this lurks the fear that when the frenzy’s over, that will be that. And then we’ll all cop it worse than before.” What were the Christmas gifts you longed for as a child but never received? In the spirit of the season, the Guardian delivered those elusive gifts to writers and readers, decades after Christmas may have lost its sparkle. For Rhik Samadder, who always wanted a pink plastic oven to practise his cooking, the Guardian’s gift sparked joy – and confusion. “I don’t know why my parents never bought it for me. I suspect it might have had something to do with being unable to afford it, but for the purposes of politicising Christmas, let’s say it was because of patriarchy,” Samadder says. “This was a gender-rigid time, when boys did not play at cooking, especially with pink ovens aimed at girls.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has said he is “days away – I hope” from releasing a “giant tax cut for Christmas”. Via a Twitter video, Trump promised the cut for American families, who are “the backbone of our country”..

Political parties depend for existence and success, not so much on the holding of identical views, as on a shared philosophy and ties of loyalty and respect between members. So there are good reasons to try to find compromises when differences emerge on a specific matter. Last week, however, I voted against my party on a national issue for the first time in my 20 years in parliament. I felt I had no option, as the attempts I had made to get the matter resolved by compromise had failed. I also considered that the matter was far too important to be ignored. The vote was not about stopping Brexit. As a matter of international law, Brexit will occur on 29 March 2019, and a refusal by parliament to approve a final deal cannot prevent this, as it could only happen by the agreement of the UK and each of the other 27 member states, either to rescind the article 50 notice or to vary the date of departure that article 50 prescribes. The problem on which I focused is that, in order to take us out of the EU, the government is seeking, in clause 9 of the withdrawal bill, very extensive powers to implement whatever changes the withdrawal agreement it is trying to negotiate may require. Yet until we know what that agreement is, the need for these powers to rewrite laws by statutory instrument is hypothetical. The government has accepted that a completely separate piece of primary legislation will have to be enacted to approve any withdrawal agreement. But the powers being sought could be used to bypass the promised parliamentary scrutiny of the final agreement, or avoid its outcome. I and a number of Conservative colleagues considered this unacceptable. I was struck by the fact that at least one government minister questioned privately if clause 9 needed to be in the bill at all. I therefore sought an amendment to ensure the powers in clause 9 could only be used once the later legislation was passed by parliament. Unfortunately the process of negotiation that seems to have been working reasonably well on other issues in the bill broke down. I cannot be certain why this was the case, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a decision was taken to deliberately face us down. We were offered assurances that did not adequately address the problem we identified , and that is why we put the matter to the vote. While I was sorry to have to do it, I do not regret the outcome. The bill has been improved and parliament’s role enhanced. MPs of all parties have come together to do the legislative job that is one of our key functions. I am very grateful to all who supported the amendment, but particularly to those Conservative colleagues who joined with me, some of whom withstood intense pressure not to do so. I do worry that the circumstances around the vote and its aftermath show a worrying slide towards irrationality in our political discourse. As a politician, I should expect sharp challenge from those who disagree with my decisions. But it is troubling that much of the controversy brought in allegations of an intention to sabotage Brexit that is far removed from what we were doing. Some of this was fuelled and orchestrated by newspapers that seem entirely disinhibited in the inaccuracies they peddle and the vitriolic abuse they are prepared to heap on those who do anything they consider to be at variance with their version of what Brexit should be. This both obscures the real issues and encourages an atmosphere of crisis and confrontation between binary positions that leads directly to the death threats that we have received. In turn, this undermines the ability of politicians to engage in rational debate or make sound judgments on issues where there is often no certain answer. I hope very much that the fallout from this episode may be beneficial. There are welcome signs from my colleagues in government of a willingness to work constructively with us and others. I have been sustained by the volume of supportive emails and letters and the willingness of many, irrespective of how they voted in the referendum, to denounce the fomenting of hatred. If parliament and government work together in their respective constitutional roles, and respect due processes, we will maximise our chances of making the right decisions as we encounter the many challenges, risks and opportunities Brexit poses for our country. • Dominic Grieve is the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, and a former attorney general"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/18/cheesed-off-visitors-complain-about-festivals-failings","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T00:31:49Z","webTitle":"A big stink: visitors complain about Giant Cheese Board festival's failings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/18/cheesed-off-visitors-complain-about-festivals-failings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/18/cheesed-off-visitors-complain-about-festivals-failings","fields":{"headline":"A big stink: visitors complain about Giant Cheese Board festival's failings","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An event promising unlimited cheese reportedly ran out of cheese but organisers refused to refund aggrieved attendees. The Giant Cheese Board, advertised as an unlimited cheese fest, promised to take revellers to “cheesey heaven” at Studio 338, south-east London, this weekend. However, the cheese connoisseurs in attendance claimed they were left short-changed as the event reportedly experienced myriad failures. As well as unlimited cheese, the promoters had promised free mulled wine, giant mice to help guests navigate the Cheese Board and a fireplace to snuggle by. But many people who paid more than £30 took to Twitter and Instagram to claim the wine was cold, the rodent chaperones fell short of expectations and that the fireplace was projected on a screen in the car park marquee. One post read: “The marketing: ‘The Giant Cheese Board’, “a massive, oversized cheese board. One you can walk around on as if you’re in a giants kitchen” – the best artisan cheeses from across Europe, including a huge baked Camembert, unlimited mulled wine, cheesecake and double-size fireplaces. The reality: plates of chopped up British cheeses, mostly hard, some caterers packs of chutney, no Camembert (baked or not), queues for cold and very sweet ‘low alcohol’ mulled wine, no cheesecake, and a screen projecting the image of a fire. Hmm.” Others were similarly unimpressed by the fare. The event was even compared to the notorious Fyre Festival in the Bahamas, at which ticket-holders were promised “a cultural moment created from a blend of music, art and food” co-organised by Ja Rule and attended by Instagram influencers, but which turned out to be a shambolic mess in a “tent city”. The organisers responded on Facebook. “Guys, if we felt that we had not provided any of the things included in your entry price then we’d be the first to hold our hands up and apologise but this is simply NOT the case,” they posted. They said the cheese was not store bought and did not run out, the cheesy music was exactly as promised, the wine was “mostly hot” and that the comedy and karaoke events, which some festival-goers had claimed did not occur, were in the Speakcheesy room, as stated on a map supplied to attendees. They acknowledged that the halloumi burger and camembert chef had fallen ill the night before, but these meals were not part of the ticket price, and said that “there categorically is unlimited cheese” at future events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/18/george-brandis-tipped-to-get-london-posting-in-turnbulls-cabinet-reshuffle","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T23:21:38Z","webTitle":"George Brandis tipped to get London posting in Turnbull's cabinet reshuffle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/george-brandis-tipped-to-get-london-posting-in-turnbulls-cabinet-reshuffle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/18/george-brandis-tipped-to-get-london-posting-in-turnbulls-cabinet-reshuffle","fields":{"headline":"George Brandis tipped to get London posting in Turnbull's cabinet reshuffle","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"George Brandis is tipped to be Australia’s next high commissioner in London as part of a reshuffle expected to be unveiled by Malcolm Turnbull this week. There has been consistent speculation about the attorney general’s position and the prime minister needs to adjust his frontbench to accommodate the departure of the special minister of state, Scott Ryan, and elevate the new deputy leader of the Nationals, Bridget McKenzie. On Monday the government was not confirming Brandis’s departure, or the timing of the reshuffle, but the shift is expected to proceed as soon as Tuesday. Internal speculation has two Western Australian Liberals, Michaelia Cash and Christian Porter, as possible successors to Brandis in the scaled-back attorney general’s portfolio. The functions of the portfolio were split earlier in the year to accommodate the desire of the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to occupy a new super portfolio of home affairs. Dutton needs to be sworn in to his new role before year’s end for administrative reasons. McKenzie, elected deputy leader of the Nationals to replace Fiona Nash, who had to resign from parliament because of her dual citizenship, will take her predecessor’s position in the cabinet. The industry minister, Arthur Sinodinos, is on leave because he is being treated for cancer, and may not continue in his current role. In an interview with News Corp, Turnbull signalled he would use the reshuffle to refresh the government after a difficult year and bring “new young people into the cabinet”. “Reshuffles occur because vacancies occur and obviously we’ve had Fiona Nash, who is very sadly no longer in the Senate, we’ve got a new deputy leader of the National party, Scott Ryan has now become a Senate president, so we’ve got a couple of vacancies,” he said. “So that’s one factor. But reshuffles are times when prime ministers can reappraise the situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/03/cambridge-university-professor-row-giulio-regeni-death","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Cambridge University professor at centre of row over Giulio Regeni death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/cambridge-university-professor-row-giulio-regeni-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/03/cambridge-university-professor-row-giulio-regeni-death","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge University professor at centre of row over Giulio Regeni death","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To his friends, there was never much doubt that Giulio Regeni was profoundly happy to be a student at Cambridge University, which seemed to be a perfect fit for the gifted and ambitious young Italian researcher. But in the two years since his tortured body was found in a roadside ditch near Cairo, a murder that many blame on forces within the Egyptian security state, Cambridge’s reluctance to be publicly involved in the investigation into the student’s death has become a flashpoint for controversy. Italian investigators frustrated by Egyptian stonewalling have also struggled to get answers to questions in the UK, such as whether Regeni was ever pushed beyond his comfort level to pursue his research of the Egyptian labour movement, and whether Cambridge ought to have done more to safeguard the 28-year-old. At the centre of the debacle lies an Egyptian professor named Dr Maha Abdelrahman, who served as Regeni’s tutor and has been a favourite target of Italian press reports, who have painted her as wilfully resisting demands for information. This month the Cambridge professor will face Italian interrogators in the UK, after she agreed to answer their questions. The move, which was seen diplomatically as a breakthrough, was announced in December after a joint meeting between the Italian foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, and the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The case has pitted calls for academic freedom against demands of Italian investigators seeking information about the Regeni case, and has provoked a rare display of finger-pointing between one of the world’s most respected universities and Italian officials. People familiar with the furore say it has also created tensions between Regeni’s parents and Cambridge. It has raised suspicions, too, that the Italian government might be seeking to shift the focus away from Egypt and on to Cambridge for political reasons. Behind the scenes, diplomats from both countries have sought to ease tensions that emerged shortly after Regeni’s funeral in Italy in 2016, which people familiar with the matter say was attended by Abdelrahman. Italian police approached her informally after the service but she reportedly declined a full interview and later failed to fully respond to questions put to her by email. Those close to Abdelrahman say that she was deeply shaken by Regeni’s death, and was fearful about the manner of questioning. In February last year, after facing down accusations that it was being less than cooperative, the then Cambridge vice-chancellor, Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, wrote a letter to Johnson to express Cambridge’s dismay at the lack of progress in the international investigation. Cambridge would be prepared to “assist Her Majesty’s government in whatever way it can to see progress”, the letter said. Italian prosecutors have made two formal requests to the UK for judicial cooperation on the investigation. The UK Foreign Office received the first in May 2016, and passed it to the Cambridge police, who requested that Italian prosecutors interview Abdelrahman. She declined. Italian officials requested to speak with Abdelrahman again in August 2017. The decision to agree to an interview now comes after a British judge approved a European investigation warrant, according to Alfano. Abdelrahman took a leave of absence from teaching after Regeni’s murder. In Italian press reports, conspiracy theories began to emerge, including unfounded accusations that she supported the banned Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and that this may have made Egyptian authorities suspicious about Regeni. A report in La Repubblica, which quoted a “confidential chat” between Regeni and a friend whom the Italian newspaper declined to identify, suggested that the Italian student and Abdelrahman had had a disagreement over her suggestion of an additional tutor who was based in Cairo, a choice that Regeni privately told his friend might be too active in politics, and could put him in the “spotlight”. Regeni had applied to several other doctoral programmes, including the London School of Economics, where he proposed similar research on social movements but was ultimately refused funding, pushing him to Cambridge. The university has declined to respond to requests for comment. It has insisted that it has been willing to cooperate, but only through formal legal channels and legal requests, not informal demands for information. Friends and former colleagues of Regeni say his research was not conducted at the behest of the university, and that he was driven to research the politically sensitive topic of unions irrespective of institution. JT Chalcraft, professor of Middle Eastern politics and history at LSE, linked the timing of Italy’s focus on Cambridge’s responsibilities to Italy’s growing business interests in Egypt. “I’d like to draw attention to the fact that as the Italian minister for foreign affairs announced to the Italian parliament on 4 September 2017 that the Italians were effectively resuming business as usual with the government that murdered one of its citizens, at that very moment he mentioned the investigation of a British institution,” Chalcraft said. “From what I understand, Dr Abdelrahman did everything correctly,” said Amro Ali, a friend of Abdelrahman and a professor who has taught at a variety of institutions across Egypt including the American University of Cairo, where Regeni was also affiliated. Yet research viewed as contentious has caused researchers to be targeted in the past. In 2015, a French sociologist from École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales Paris known only as Fanny was deported from Egypt after conducting research on the banned 6 April youth movement in Egypt’s Nile Delta region. She later recounted that she knew she had been followed and surveilled long before her deportation. Researchers and institutions alike had long factored in the risk of deportation and harassment. But the brutality of Regeni’s case shocked the academic community. “Giulio’s case was something so out of the norm,” said Ali. “[But] this woke us up to new realities. There … is often a view that academics tend to be less threatened than journalists. But there’s another way of looking at this – journalists are easily identifiable, academics aren’t. Even if the security apparatus disagrees with a journalist, they know what a journalist is.” One doctoral researcher who asked not to be named to protect the institutions they have studied at said: “A 28-year-old is an adult, and Regeni was someone who was very experienced and had spent a lot of time not just in Egypt but in Damascus as well – he had lived under authoritarian regimes for a considerable period of time. “I don’t think anybody could have predicted this and Cambridge couldn’t have done anything to stop it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/18/newcastle-worlds-biggest-coal-export-port-announces-shift-away-from-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T21:51:43Z","webTitle":"Newcastle: world's biggest coal export port announces shift away from coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/18/newcastle-worlds-biggest-coal-export-port-announces-shift-away-from-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/18/newcastle-worlds-biggest-coal-export-port-announces-shift-away-from-coal","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle: world's biggest coal export port announces shift away from coal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export port, must “urgently” diversify its traffic, the port’s incoming chairman has said, warning that the “long-term outlook for coal is a threat to the port”. The move has been received as a significant sign of the transition away from fossil fuels. Coal makes up about 90% of the New South Wales port’s throughput, including some of the world’s highest quality coal for steel production and electricity generation. The pragmatic stance of Newcastle Ports is in stark contrast to the Australian government’s rhetoric on coal, which has sought to subsidise Adani Group’s plans to develop a new coalmining basin in Queensland, and an associated expansion of the Abbot Point coal export terminal on the Great Barrier Reef. “Coal has been at the heart of the Hunter’s economy for the better part of two centuries, and it will continue to be central to the prosperity of the region and Port of Newcastle for some time to come,” said Roy Green, the new chair of the Newcastle Ports board. “However, there is also an urgent need to diversify the Hunter economy and the port’s business. “Clearly the long-term outlook for coal is a threat to the port and Hunter region, but it is also a huge opportunity. While the world’s demand for our coal is beyond our control, our ability to invest in new sources of growth and innovation is not. Among our challenges will be ensuring a level playing field for the development of a viable and competitive container terminal.” The former chief economist of National Australia Bank Rob Henderson said the announcement was “indicative of the seismic shift under way in the world of power generation and investment”. “Newcastle, the world’s largest coal port, is now transitioning to a lower carbon world and is actively planning for the time when less of the Hunter’s wealth and income will be generated from coal,” Henderson said. “It should reaffirm to investors that the transition away from coal is taking place rapidly now, that continued investment in Australian coal is a losing proposition in the medium to long term and that diversification is critical.” Last week one of Australia’s big-four banks, National Australia Bank, announced it was ceasing all lending to new thermal coal projects. Earlier this month AGL, which owns electricity generation and retail assets and is Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, confirmed it was shutting its ageing Liddell coal-fired power station, despite pressure from the government to keep it open beyond its planned life. “The Port of Newcastle is following the money trail, by adopting the position taken by major Australian banks, including my former employer NAB, over recent weeks, who have sought to distance themselves from financial ties with new coal projects and focus on the growth industries of the future,” Henderson said. The port’s announcement was welcomed by environmentalists. Glen Klatovsky, deputy chief executive of 350.org, called on the government to recognise the fear the transition away from coal would cause, and to manage a “just transition” for workers in the region. “For a positive future to become reality we need governments to be more focused on a just transition to a post-coal regional economy,” Klatovsky said. “The Hunter is a beautiful region with an existing tourism industry, agricultural wealth, world-class wineries and horse studs. Newcastle has great education resources, a vibrant health sector and the region has huge potential in renewable energy.” The chief executive of Newcastle Ports, Geoff Crowe, said Green’s experience made him well placed to manage the transition. “Professor Green also has a strong understanding of the Hunter region’s competitive advantages, having worked at the University of Newcastle through the 1990s, including close engagement with the BHP Newcastle Steelworks transition and Hunter economic development bodies,” Crowe said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/18/premier-league-ten-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T08:29:14Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/18/premier-league-ten-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/18/premier-league-ten-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) De Bruyne challenging for place among Europe’s best Pep Guardiola was lost for words to describe Kevin De Bruyne’s latest exhilarating performance, whereas those in the stands at the Etihad will never tire of praising the Belgian for his skill, passing, finishing and the fact he covered more distance than any other player on the pitch in the 4-1 victory over Spurs. Many were fearful that, without David Silva, City might not be able to dictate the play like they have with the Spaniard in the side. The worries, however, were unfounded as De Bruyne was the instigator of all things positive, exhibiting his constant desire to succeed – an attribute as important as those performed by his feet. Within the space of two minutes he was the victim of a crude challenge, before going on to score a wonderful individual goal which was too powerful for Hugo Lloris, even though it was struck with his supposedly weaker left foot. De Bruyne is one of the best three players in the Premier League and, possibly, all of Europe.

While the image of Aragonés stalking the perfume aisles looking for that elusive elixir is amusing, Benítez’s point was clear. Newcastle have lost eight of their past nine, so it is natural that chins might drop a little. But everything else Benítez said pointed the blame for this run elsewhere: most notably, he made numerous references to his squad’s inexperience, a nod to insufficient backing in the transfer market by Mike Ashley and chums. But isn’t Benítez on shaky ground trying to deflect blame when results are this bad? Of course the situation upstairs at Newcastle does not help, but equally this is not a squad full of helpless chumps who have no chance in the Premier League. The sooner Newcastle’s takeover goes through the better, but Benítez cannot use it as an excuse for everything.

Eddie Howe said as much. Defeat was not just disappointing but desperately worrying as his side were picked off by Liverpool, who eclipsed them in all departments. It does not get any easier for Bournemouth either, with trips to Chelsea and then Manchester City on the horizon. A point above the relegation zone, the Cherries, winless in six matches, are in trouble. In those half dozen games they have drawn only twice and their last win was in mid-November. Injuries to Charlie Daniels and Joshua King, groin and hamstring respectively, further dampen the mood. “We’re in a difficult situation,” Howe said. “It’s been the same in the first two years in the Premier League. The only thing that has changed is the perception and expectation around us.” Ben Fisher • Match report: Bournemouth 0-4 Liverpool: Salah on scoresheet again 4) Hughton has to make Brighton more ruthless With only nine points separating Huddersfield Town in 11th place and Swansea City in 20th, there is little justification for any side in the bottom half either to get too downcast or carried away about their current position. While West Ham and Crystal Palace have shown that it doesn’t take much to revive a struggling club’s mood, Newcastle United’s slide into danger is a warning to Brighton, who are a few more disappointing results away from a slump turning into something more serious. They are 13th, but only three points above the bottom three and winless in seven matches, having scored three goals in the process. They have failed to take advantage of some winnable home games, with Glenn Murray’s dismal penalty miss on Saturday summing up their bluntness. Chris Hughton’s side have to be more ruthless and inventive when they host Watford on Saturday. Jacob Steinberg • Match report: Brighton 0-0 Burnley: wasteful Glenn Murray skies penalty 5) Van Dijk likely to leave Southampton next month Is Virgil van Dijk finally on his way out of Southampton? He sat on the bench on Saturday. It would have been the Dutchman’s third match in a week had he played and Mauricio Pellegrino was inclined to suggest his star defender was being rested, but the more the manager talked the more he repeated that he “could not control the market”. Southampton were determined to reject all bids for Van Dijk in the summer, intent on breaking the cycle that had seen Saints sell their best players each summer since their return to the Premier League. After having to wait until September to reintegrate him to the side, he has managed 11 starts, games that have included only one win and a solitary clean sheet. It certainly appears the club have not kept a player in the best of form and will now face the prospect of having to accept in the winter what they had insisted would not happen in the summer. Paul MacInnes • Match report: Chelsea 1-0 Southampton: Alonso scorcher secures nervy victory 6) Hodgson insists Zaha is not a diver Roy Hodgson maintains that he did not deserve the flak he got for his management of England, insisting that judgments were distorted by one bad match against Iceland. He is fooling no one. But, equally, no one can deny he has done a fine job so far at Crystal Palace, who won 3-0 on Saturday. After a brilliant performance by Wilfried Zaha, Hodgson was keen to rectify what he believes to be another false impression. “He doesn’t dive, it is a fact,” he said of the forward. “After people unbalance him, he works very hard – harder than most – to stay on his feet. I don’t think it’s incumbent on other managers to make comments on other team’s players. I don’t do that. Referees should be allowed to make their own decisions and up to now no referee has admonished Wilfred Zaha for diving. I don’t know where the stories are coming from, it might be biased newspaper people.” Paul Doyle • Match report: Leicester 0-3 Crystal Palace: Benteke sparks end of away drought 7) Pochettino covering up for stumbling Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur’s trouncing by Manchester City leaves Mauricio Pochettino’s team 21 points behind the leaders, yet the manager seems to be in denial. “I think you cannot measure the difference between points,” he said. “If you finish second it’s the same to finish one point or 20 points behind. They [City] are doing so well, at the moment they are performing and for many clubs it will hurt a lot because the gap is massive. But we are doing a fantastic job in the last few seasons and the team is doing what it needs to do – learn, improve, step by step, to one day try to be in the place that Manchester City are in today.” This is a team that after finishing above City, in second place last year, are languishing in seventh. Pochettino said: “In the Premier League we are not in the position we wanted but we are fighting for the top four.” Spurs, though, were expected to contend for the title. Jamie Jackson 8) Moyes and Arnautovic both proving people wrong These are still early days but you wonder when one or two people might begin to revise their opinions of David Moyes’s managerial qualities. It is all very amusing to create caricatures of an incompetent but that does not reflect the reality and Moyes has proved that so far at West Ham, forging a unit that works hard for the cause but can also play a bit. The job he is doing with Marko Arnautovic is worthy of particular praise. Arnautovic had, Moyes says, left people at the club “a bit disappointed” after arriving from Stoke but is buying into the new manager’s work ethic. Before the 3-0 win against Arnautovic’s former employer Moyes told him “to make sure you don’t get wound up”; the response was exhilarating, suggesting the Austrian may have found a manager who can harness his mercurial talent. Player and coach are both on the way to proving their disparagers wrong.

He received a retrospective ban for a clash with Stoke City’s Joe Allen a fortnight later and he is facing another long absence after his red card in the 4-1 home defeat by Huddersfield Town. Michael Oliver, who refereed the Stoke game, did not miss the seriousness of Deeney’s offence this time, dismissing him for a rash lunge on Collin Quaner. Watford were already trailing 2-0 and perhaps the forward was frustrated. Maybe he wanted to set an example with a macho show of commitment. But there are more productive ways for footballers to demonstrate their toughness.

They are second from bottom, without a win for four months, and a change in manager has failed to deliver the “bounce”, or maybe that should be “boing” in this case, that so often happens. Alan Pardew’s four games in charge have produced two points and one goal. There were some positives to cling to at the end of the defeat against Manchester United, not least the way they finished a game that looked to be beyond them at half-time, yet there is no getting away from the fact that Albion, who have scored only 13 goals in 18 matches, badly need a proven goalscorer to either partner Salomón Rondón or play up front on his own. Finding one will be easier said than done in January, of course, but Albion’s Premier League status – they have been in the top flight since 2010 – could hinge on it.

You’ve been duped, 14 December) has discovered Professor Bill Mitchell’s book Reclaiming the State. Mitchell is a respected “heterodox” economist who specialises in modern monetary theory, and writes an almost daily blog in which he explains MMT and its political and economic implications. If Elliott were to fully learn the lessons of MMT from Mitchell’s book and/or blog, then perhaps he would not write (as he recently did) about governments of countries like the UK (which issues its own currency in a floating exchange rate system) having to “borrow” in order to run a fiscal deficit. The “borrowing” that does take place is a “voluntary” restriction placed upon the government’s freedom to spend, for reasons that are no longer valid (if they ever were), as Mitchell expertly explains, and could be dropped, if the government so willed. The alternative to “borrowing” is called overt monetary financing (OMF) as espoused by such extreme leftwingers as Adair Turner (irony intended). That the government (or Bank of England, which is owned by the government) can do this was demonstrated by QE, the creation of money “out of thin air”. If it can do it for the bankers and speculators, then it can do it for the real economy – and it is high time it did so.

As May’s Brexit team prepares to debate Britain’s future relationship with the EU on Monday before a full meeting of her divided cabinet on Tuesday, the dissident MPs believe last week’s vote should embolden her to face down hardline Brexiters. Eleven Tories defied the leadership last Wednesday to support an amendment aimed at ensuring that parliament gets a vote on the final Brexit deal before Britain leaves the EU. The defeat, May’s first over Brexit, concerned process rather than substance, but the rebels believe it should embolden the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and his cabinet allies – the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the business secretary, Greg Clark – by underlining the fact that no parliamentary majority exists for a hard Brexit. At least two of the amendment’s Tory backers, dubbed mutineers by the Daily Telegraph, have talked to senior figures at No 10, including May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, about the idea of drawing on supportive Labour MPs to form a soft Brexit caucus in the House of Commons. They believe such an approach would allow the prime minister to argue for a close future relationship with the EU, potentially including continued membership of the customs union, and have advised her to pick off Labour rebels before the frontbench hardens its own policy. One rebel told the Guardian: “At the moment, the Labour party is terribly divided and therefore there are quite a large body of independent-minded Labour MPs who would be willing to respond positively to a request to provide support to a government that is seen to be doing the right thing. I think the danger is that if she leaves it too late, the window will close on that.” Another said they had told Barwell: “If you’re clever, you will reach over the head of [Jeremy] Corbyn and go to those sensible Labour people and put the hard Brexiters back in their box.” A Tory MP said: “There has to be a discussion in government about what is realistic and what is deliverable, and they have to work with parliament to achieve that. That’s often been the case on European matters.” A well-coordinated group of prominent Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie and Heidi Alexander, believe they could draw on the backing of the majority of their colleagues to vote for continued membership of the single market and customs union, neither of which are formal party policy. Umunna said: “There is no doubt that last week’s vote has strengthened the hand of Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark, the soft Brexit advocates in cabinet. Members from across the whole house will now be looking to them to use their new-found leverage to bring some coherence and sanity to bear on the unsustainable negotiating position of the government.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, are expected argue for Britain to retain the power to set its own regulations rather than pledging to mirror those of the EU, claiming the UK would otherwise risk becoming what Johnson this weekend called a “vassal state”. His choice of phrase echoed that of another Brexit hardliner, Jacob Rees-Mogg In an interview with the Sunday Times, Johnson said: “What we need to do is something new and ambitious, which allows zero tariffs and frictionless trade but still gives us that important freedom to decide our own regulatory framework, our own laws and do things in a distinctive way in the future”. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has suggested a “Canada plus plus plus” deal, broadly based on the EU’s trade deal with Ottawa, but covering services, including financial services, and allowing closer ties because the volume of trade covered is so much larger. Such a deal would still be likely to require considerable alignment of rules and regulations, but many Brexiters prefer it to a closer relationship such as that enjoyed by Norway, which is a member of the European Free Trade Area. The EU27’s chief negotiator, however, cast doubt on Sunday as to whether the government would be allowed sufficient flexibility to strike such a deal. In an interview with Prospect magazine, Michel Barnier said: “They have to realise there won’t be any cherry picking. We won’t mix up the various scenarios to create a specific one and accommodate their wishes, mixing, for instance, the advantages of the Norwegian model, member of the single market, with the simple requirements of the Canadian one. No way. They have to face the consequences of their own decision.” Barnier reiterated the EU’s insistence that detailed talks on a future trade deal would only begin after Brexit. Davis has insisted the substance of a trade deal could be in place within the next 12 months. “The actual negotiations on the future relationship will only begin once the UK leaves the EU,” he said. Separately, government sources distanced themselves from reports that pro-Brexit ministers were keen to drop the EU’s working time directive, which prevents employees working more than 48 hours a week. The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, called the proposal, “a straight-up attack on our rights at work”. Dissident Tory MPs have faced a furious backlash in their own party and in pro-Brexit newspapers since last Wednesday’s vote. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who tabled the amendment, has blamed the lurid press headlines that followed the debate for a series of death threats he and his colleagues received. Writing in the Guardian, Grieve says: “As a politician, I should expect sharp challenge from those who disagree with my decisions. But it is troubling that much of the controversy brought in allegations of an intention to sabotage Brexit that is far removed from what we were doing. “Some of this was fuelled and orchestrated by newspapers that seem entirely disinhibited in the inaccuracies they peddle and the vitriolic abuse they are prepared to heap on those who do anything they consider to be at variance with their version of what Brexit should be. This both obscures the real issues, and encourages an atmosphere of crisis and confrontation between binary positions that leads directly to the death threats that we have received.” Anna Soubry, another rebel, said such reports fostered a climate of extremism. “That’s the thing that concerns me about all of this. We’re increasingly having a form of politics in which debate is not based on ideas. It’s based on complete and total misconceptions. It’s whipping up a storm by newspapers. It’s poisoning public life.” One Conservative MP, Nadine Dorries, even called for the 11 who voted against the government whip to be deselected, and some of them fear a backlash in their local parties. May will update the Commons on last week’s European Council meeting on Monday. She is expected to tell MPs that the government hopes to make rapid progress on agreeing the details of a post-Brexit implementation period, to “give certainty to employers and families that we are going to deliver a smooth Brexit”. The prime minister will add: “We would propose that our access to one another’s markets would continue as now, while we prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin our future partnership.” She will stress that the government hopes it can negotiate and sign trade deals during the transition that will come into force once it ends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/17/geert-wilders-calls-for-trump-style-muslim-travel-ban-in-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T16:40:15Z","webTitle":"Geert Wilders calls for Trump-style Muslim travel ban in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/17/geert-wilders-calls-for-trump-style-muslim-travel-ban-in-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/17/geert-wilders-calls-for-trump-style-muslim-travel-ban-in-europe","fields":{"headline":"Geert Wilders calls for Trump-style Muslim travel ban in Europe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"European countries should adopt Donald Trump-style travel bans to counter a wave of Islamisation supposedly sweeping the continent, the Dutch anti-immigrant politician Geert Wilders has said. Wilders, the leader of the Netherlands’ Freedom party (PVV), made his comments at a gathering of far-right leaders in Prague. He also urged Europe to adopt Australia’s tactics in turning back migrant boats and to build new border walls, as Trump has vowed to do along the US frontier with Mexico. Wilders was flanked during his press conference by France’s Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, and Tomio Okamura, the leader of the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD), which finished joint third in recent parliamentary election with nearly 11% of the vote. Security was tight at the press event, held at a hotel just off Wenceslas Square, apparently in recognition of death threats against Wilders in response to his fierce denunciations of Islam. Wilders, who was convicted last year by a Dutch court for incitement against Moroccans, cited US research he claimed showed that the Czech Republic would be bordered to the north, south and west by countries that were more than 20% Muslim by the middle of the century if current demographic trends continued. “It will be almost as if you are bordering a kind of Gaza Strip on almost every border,” he said. “We must adopt a totally new strategy. We must have the courage to restrict legal immigration instead of expanding it, even if we sometimes have to build a wall.” Trump’s travel ban, which applies to six Muslim-majority nations plus North Korea and Venezuela, has been one of his most controversial policies. It has been the subject of various challenges in court, and rulings that have overturned and suspended it. The US supreme court ruled this month that it could be implemented for now while numerous challenges were resolved. The Prague gathering came at an encouraging moment for the organisers, the European parliament’s populist Europe of Nations and Freedom grouping,. The Austrian Freedom party (FPO), one of the participants, became the only far-right party in government in a western European state on Friday, after joining a coalition with the conservative People’s party. That followed a year of setbacks for Wilders and Le Pen, who failed to make the electoral breakthroughs many had forecast. The PVV remains in opposition in the Netherlands after a poorer than predicted parliamentary election result last March, and Emmanuel Macron beat Le Pen in the second round of France’s presidential poll in May. A similar meeting last January in the German town of Koblenz was held amid euphoric expectations of major successes in 2017. Le Pen said Europe’s rightwing groups were linked by a belief that the European Union was a “catastrophic, disastrous organisation” and that the migration flows were “unbearable”. She also praised Okamura, with whom she said she had been working for many months. Tokyo born-Okamura, the son of a part-Japanese father and Czech mother, said the parties were defending European values. Wilders, Le Pen and Okamura later received rousing ovations at the weekend’s main event, a conference at the Top Hotel, a nondescript Communist-era building in Chodov, a bleak suburb several miles from the centre of Prague. The venue was cordoned off, a police helicopter hovered overhead and riot police monitored two groups of leftwing protesters. “The dangerous thing is that the extreme views we see on display here have entered the mainstream, with even the Czech Social Democrats accepting them,” said Honza, a protest organiser who declined to give his full name for safety reasons. Similar mistrust was evident inside, where security personnel scrutinised journalists closely and escorted them to and from a sectioned-off area. The independent British MEP, Janice Atkinson, a former Ukip member, invoked the Czech fight against communism, the failed 1968 Prague Spring and Margaret Thatcher to encourage her audience to campaign for a Czexit referendum that could enable the Czech Republic to follow Britain out of the EU. “As Margaret Thatcher said, Europe is stronger precisely because France is France, Spain is Spain, Britain is Britain and, just as important, Czech is Czech,” she said. “Long live the Europe of nations. Long live the Czech Republic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/19/political-discord-incitement-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T10:00:23Z","webTitle":"When does political discord escalate to incitement?

Ask Donald Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In Charlottesville this summer, white supremacist chants of “Sieg heil!” and “Jews will not replace us”, were followed by a driver who drove his car into counter-protesters. Last year, Donald Trump encouraged his followers “knock the crap out of” protesters, adding that he would cover their legal fees. And amid an upsurge of violence speech against Muslims, hate incidents against mosques and Islamic centers in the US were markedly up in the last year. This isn’t normal political discord any more. It’s not even “just” hate speech. Political speech has now veered into an even more dangerous terrain: incitement. The first amendment protects freedom of expression, but inciting another person to commit assault or murder is in itself a crime, and has been so since the founding of our republic. Standing incitement law requires that a speaker intentionally advocate the commission of a crime, where such advocacy is directed at producing “imminent lawless action” and is likely to incite the crime being encouraged. This is a high bar and was consciously designed to allow nearly all political speech, including hate speech. Yet as political speech has pushed right up against this bar, there has been a proliferation of incitement challenges in courts. Two sisters who suffered injuries after the Dodge Challenger driven by James Alex Fields Jr slammed into their car have filed a $3m lawsuit against neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups for organizing and inciting violence on social media in the run-up to the march in Charlottesville. A case is still pending against the president in US district court after a judge upheld three protesters’ right to claim damages against Trump and his campaign for inciting audience members at a rally. Judge David Hale found that Trump’s words “Get ’em out of here” were not protected by the first amendment and could constitute incitement to riot insofar as they were “an order, an instruction, a command” to his supporters to commit assault and battery. The stakes in these cases are high – balancing free speech with public safety – yet incitement law is frustratingly murky. The US supreme court has determined that courts must conduct a review of “the content, form and context of a given statement”, but it provides no guidance in determining what types of inciting speech and contexts are the most likely to trigger a violent response. Judges and juries are left to rely on personal hunches and to search for guidance from previous landmark cases, which may have a manifestly different pattern of facts. Drawing a bright line matters not only for the courts, but also private sector entities, like internet providers, whose terms of service typically prohibit incitement – the reason given by Google and GoDaddy when they stopped hosting the American Nazi website Daily Stormer. But new social science research can help fill the gap left by the courts at this crucial time. For instance, neuroscience experiments by psychologists Lasana Harris and Susan Fiske demonstrate how denigrating speech against an out-group can dehumanize and facilitate inhumane acts. In a recent psychological study conducted for my book Incitement on Trial, we used different types of speech to test participants’ willingness to empathize with members of another group or to justify violence against them. Dehumanizing language (eg, calling a person an “ape” or “cockroach”) had significant effects, but speeches that referenced past crimes and called for revenge had the greatest effect on participants’ willingness to countenance violence. Intriguingly, derogatory speech couched in religious or far-right nationalist language was not especially influential. Further, stereotyping of other groups, while offensive, may not inculcate a greater tolerance of violence. Not all types of derogatory or inciting speech are the same in their concrete effects on attitudes towards violence, and courts might take this into account when reviewing the content of speeches. Previous studies have repeatedly confirmed that listeners are more swayed by charismatic speakers who are authority figures and who use graphic, intense language that draws upon existing beliefs and prejudices. Repetition often works: a statement repeated across a variety of mass communication formats, from radio to television to social media, is more likely to be believed, even if it is patently false. The emotional state of the audience matters and a population is more receptive to inciting speakers during times of political instability, insecurity and economic austerity. Finally, an incitement to violence is more likely to be acted on if the speaker declares that there is a direct existential threat to the audience and identifies a distinct course of action to remove the threat. Many of the factors identified above apply to the stream of coded and explicit rhetoric from the current administration and substantiate the claim that President Trump has repeatedly incited imminent lawless action. Assembled into a checklist, these factors could provide guidance to judges and juries as they assess the gravity of a speech act and its likelihood of triggering violence. For incitement law to function at all, courts must define the boundary between protected speech and unprotected speech that incites a crime. Social research can make a valuable contribution in identifying the content, form, and circumstances most likely to result in imminent lawless action, and to ensure that the limits of permissible speech are based on systematic research, rather than unproven assumptions.

This announcement has spawned numerous congratulatory reports – including in the Guardian – detailing the wonderful things found, the back-stories of the lucky finders, and the sometimes extraordinary sums of money their finds have fetched. The rise in finds is attributed to improved detector technology and an increase in the number of people taking up the hobby, encouraged by recent spectacular finds and the popularity of the BBC’s Detectorists series. Within the archaeological community the response has not been quite so cheerful. Several archaeologists have complained to me about the Guardian appearing to promote metal detecting as a harmless leisure pursuit, and online there’s been a distinct rumble of archaeological discontent. So why are some archaeologists upset about the swelling ranks of detectorists and the flood of important finds they’re turning up? The explanation lies in the uneasy relationship between archaeology and metal detecting which stretches back over the last 50 years. Metal detecting as a hobby first emerged in the post-war years, when relatively cheap, portable detectors developed for the army began to be made available to the public. The number of users remained small however, until more effective and affordable models gave the pastime its first flush of popularity in the 1960s and 70s. The growing numbers of detectorists quickly came into conflict with the archaeological community. As well as fairly harmless activities, such as combing beaches, reports came in of metal detectorists increasingly impinging on archaeological sites, leaving damage and removing artefacts, many of which were finding their way to antiquities dealers or even leaving the country. Archaeologists were horrified. The problem lies in fundamentally conflicting aims. Archaeologists primarily value information about the past. Objects are important, but only within their archaeological context – their relationship to structures, deposits and the full range of finds – contributing to the wider understanding of a site or landscape. For metal detectorists, the primarily focus is the objects themselves, the collection of which by detectorists divorces an object from most of the information which makes it valuable to an archaeologist. As detectorist numbers spiked in the late 1970s, the attitude of the professional archaeological community became increasingly hostile. Various forms of legal restrictions on detecting and the sale of artefacts were proposed, strongly opposed by a detectorist community which was rapidly becoming more organised. The conflict culminated in the STOP! (Stop Taking Our Past!) campaign, launched in 1979 and championed by the Council for British Archaeology, with the support of a wide range of societies, professional bodies and organisations. The campaign aimed to raise awareness of the damage unregulated metal detecting was doing to the archaeological record and pushed to outlaw metal detecting in the UK. In response, the metal detecting community launched DIG (the Detector Information Group), with a name deliberately chosen to annoy the archaeologists. DIG lobbied to prevent the introduction of any restrictions on metal detection and was supported by detector retailers and manufacturers. Both sides engaged in a dirty war of misinformation about their opponents; the archaeologists tried to tar all detectorists with the same brush as the most irresponsible and criminal elements, wantonly damaging important sites and selling off the country’s heritage for private gain, while the detectorists painted the archaeological community as elitist, establishment figures, who wanted to restrict the study of the past to their ivory towers. The result was a total breakdown in relations between the two increasingly polarised sides. Responsible detectorists who had previously reported finds to their local museums and kept good records withdrew their cooperation. Some even destroyed their records to prevent them benefitting their archaeological enemies. Many archaeologists would have nothing to do with metal detectorists, refusing to look at finds they recovered or do anything that might endorse or legitimise metal detecting. In the end DIG prevailed over STOP! and the legacy of that victory is still felt today; the UK has the lightest regulation of metal detecting of any western European country – in most cases, only the permission of the land owner is required – but in other countries and other contexts, what is perfectly legal in the UK would be considered as looting. The failure of STOP! in the 1980s triggered a gradual change in the approach of archaeologists towards detectorists. The period of peak hostilities had only worsened the problems of destructive detecting. Huge quantities of artefacts were disappearing unseen into private collections or overseas, Nighthawking – clandestine illegal detecting – at scheduled monuments had increased, leading to high profile episodes such as the extensive looting of the Romano-British temple at Wanborough in Surrey in the early 1980s and persistent attacks on the Roman town of Corbridge (which continue to this day). After their failure to restrict metal detecting, archaeologists had no choice but to swallow their anger and try engagement. Responsible detectorists and well-run societies were to be encouraged, advised on how best to record their finds, and given a level of legitimacy. In turn, they would help to police their fellow hobbyists, encouraging responsible practices and casting out the bad apples who brought the activity into disrepute. For their part, archaeologists would gain access to the material found by detectorists though organised reporting. Cooperation and engagement has now been the accepted position of the archaeological community towards metal detecting in the UK for over twenty years, paving the way for the 1996 Treasure Act and the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which records detector finds across the country and makes the data available to researchers. Many metal detecting clubs enjoy close and mutually beneficial relationships with their local archaeology units, sharing information and sometimes working together in the field. However, it would be a mistake to think that archaeologists now live in perfect harmony with detectorists; distrust on both sides still bubbles under the surface. Many parts of the metal detecting community remain wary of archaeologists, suspecting (probably rightly) that, if they could, archaeologists would place greater restrictions on metal detecting. On the other side, most archaeologists privately believe that even responsible detectorists to do more harm than good, and the more extreme among them see all metal detectorists as little more than legalised looters driven by personal greed. For many archaeologists cooperation is a form of damage limitation; the least worst solution. Metal detecting encompasses a wide range of individuals, from the responsible society members with a genuine interest in the past, to the criminal Nighthawks, and all the detectorists who occupy the large grey area in between. The innocent and honest majority, groups like the cuddly, nerdish club depicted in Detectorists, champion metal detecting as a citizen scientist movement, democratising knowledge and encouraging a love of heritage. The problem for archaeologists is that metal detecting is fundamentally acquisitive, competitive, and potentially lucrative. It encourages a monetised view of archaeological objects and the temptation to bend or break the rules is strong. A particularly awful recent example occurred this spring when policeman David Cockle was jailed for metal detector crime. Not only had he illegally sold a hoard of gold Saxon coins he’d found in Norfolk, he had tried to conceal his crime by misreporting the nature and location of his finds, feeding false data into the county records. The man had been a detectorist for thirty years. My friends within the archaeological community have a wealth of similar stories and bad experiences. Many have worked on excavations where they’ve returned in the morning to find trenches damaged and objects stolen in the night by criminal detectorists. One discovered that the metal detectorist assisting on an excavation was only reporting worthless coins to the project and pocketing the valuable ones for himself. In the context of past conflicts and the more recent uneasy truce, it’s not surprising that news of a growing and re-energised detectorist community wielding more effective equipment has been met, at least privately, with dismay from many UK archaeologists. So, if you’ve recently taken up metal detecting and meet your local archaeologists down the pub this Christmas, you shouldn’t necessarily expect them to buy you a drink.

Where Prima was manic, cavorting around the stage, singing with gusto and playing hot jazz trumpet, Smith was the epitome of cool, her vocals like a balm amid all the mayhem. Prima and Smith were the most successful Las Vegas lounge act of the 1950s, playing season after season at the famed Sahara hotel with their supporting band, the Witnesses. Tourists loved them, as did the Rat Pack crowd and other celebrities. Barely a night passed, it seems, without Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr bounding on stage to join the party. Born Dorothy Keely in Norfolk, Virginia, she came from Cherokee and Irish stock. Her parents’ marriage foundered when she was nine, and her mother remarried Jesse Smith, from whom Keely later took her stage name. She first sang on a children’s radio show before performing with Saxie Dowell’s band at the local naval air station. At 15, she got her first paid job with the Earl Bennett band. She had seen Prima perform when on a family holiday in Atlantic City in 1947. The following year, she heard that he was playing nearby Virginia Beach, and that he was looking for a new vocalist, and so she auditioned. Prima hired her on the spot, and in 1953 she also became his fourth wife. The New Orleans-born Prima had graduated from his home town to New York’s 52nd Street in 1934, where his bandstand vitality made him a star. Reinventing himself as a comedic showman and simplifying his musical approach to take account of the burgeoning postwar interest in rhythm and blues, Prima needed a partner to offset his wild stage presence. Smith provided the show’s calm counterpoint, singing solo or in duet with Prima in a way that underlined her cool-jazz credentials. The musician and writer Leonard Feather described her as a “popular jazz-influenced comedienne-vocalist”. Regularly playing five shows a night, starting at midnight and finishing at 6am, with the ebullient tenor-saxophonist Sam Butera at their side, Smith and Prima ruled the Las Vegas roost as the perfect blend; the one controlled, the other agitated and raucous. Their fame spread across the US, fuelled by appearances on the Ed Sullivan show, their starring role in the 1959 film Hey Boy! Hey Girl! and a slew of successful albums on the Capitol label, their version of That Old Black Magic receiving an inaugural Grammy in 1958. For all the “bizarre but funny” nature of their relationship, it seemed to work. That is, until Smith tired of Prima’s constant philandering and sued for divorce in 1961. Although she continued to perform with Butera for a few years, Smith preferred to concentrate on raising her and Prima’s daughters, Toni and Luanne. Prima had insisted that she be awarded a solo contract by Capitol and this paid off for her. Her album with Nelson Riddle’s orchestrations, I Wish You Love, sold over a million copies and the single was nominated for a Grammy. Her songs also featured on the soundtracks of films by Martin Scorsese or starring Robert De Niro – notably Raging Bull and Casino – both of whom had been long-time fans. Her career under way again, Smith played sellout shows in cities across the US, her recordings including a well-received 1963 session with Count Basie’s orchestra. The following year, The Intimate Keely Smith (reissued last year) teamed her with a small jazz group, as did Keely Smith Sings the John Lennon and Paul McCartney Songbook, an album devoted to Beatles’ love songs, with arrangements by Benny Carter, and the later I’m In Love Again with jazzmen Bud Shank and Bill Perkins (1985). The general revival of interest in swing and big band music in the 90s – typified by Gap’s use of the Prima-Smith classic Jump, Jive an’ Wail for a 1998 TV ad campaign – marked an intensification of interest in Smith, which she relished, and in 2001 she was again nominated for a Grammy, this time for the album Keely Sings Sinatra. In 2005 she was invited to appear at the House of Blues in LA, followed by a successful stint at Feinstein’s at the Regency in New York. Later triumphs included a month at Café Carlyle in New York in 2007, a five-album deal with Concord records and an appearance at the 50th anniversary Grammy awards concert, where she sang That Old Black Magic with Kid Rock. She was also a popular presence on nostalgia-based package shows, including a rare UK appearance as guest of honour at Summertime Swing in East Grinstead, West Sussex, in August 2010. Her career included performing for President John F Kennedy’s inauguration, the placement of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the award of the Cherokee medal of honour in 2000. Hailed by Tony Bennett as “one of the greatest jazz-pop singers of all time”, Smith is survived by Toni and Luanne. Her third husband, the singer Bobby Milano, whom she married in 1975, died in 2006. An earlier marriage to the record producer Jimmy Bowen ended in divorce. • Keely Smith (Dorothy Jacqueline Keely), jazz vocalist, born 9 March 1928; died 16 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/17/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-dynasty-alex-ferguson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T22:30:42Z","webTitle":"Manchester City want Pep Guardiola to create Alex Ferguson-style dynasty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/17/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-dynasty-alex-ferguson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/17/football-manchester-city-pep-guardiola-dynasty-alex-ferguson","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City want Pep Guardiola to create Alex Ferguson-style dynasty","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola will discuss a new contract with Manchester City in the summer, with the club believing he possesses the same qualities that led to Sir Alex Ferguson creating a long-term dynasty at Manchester United. There is an acknowledgement at City that the modern era means elite coaches have a natural cycle of three seasons at the helm yet those in charge at the Premier League’s runaway leaders, who secured their 16th successive top-flight win with the 4-1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, believe the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager can be persuaded to remain in situ for much longer. While City do not expect the Spaniard’s reign to match Ferguson’s tenure of 26 and a half years at Old Trafford, it is understood that the chairman, Khaldoon al‑Mubarak, alongside the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, believe the 46-year-old could establish his own era of domination and success at the Etihad Stadium, and remain in place for a decade at least. His three-year deal ends in the summer of 2019 and he has previously indicated that will be the maximum length of his stay at City. The news came after it was confirmed that Raheem Sterling was racially abused and attacked by a stranger as he arrived at City’s training base on Saturday, before the Spurs match. A source close to Sterling told the Guardian that, as was reported by the Daily Telegraph, the 23-year-old was kicked and called an offensive word by a man who was waiting for him by the players’ entrance. Sterling was not injured and the club will speak to the player on Monday to ascertain if he wishes to press charges, although it is believed there is CCTV footage to back up a complaint. On a happier note, Sterling scored twice in City’s latest triumph and one that has further invigorated Guardiola. A 16th successive victory remains short of his best winning run in league football as a manager – 19 consecutive wins with Bayern between October 2013 and March 2014 – but it may be significant enough to help secure City a third Premier League title. They are 11 points clear of their neighbours after second-placed Manchester United registered a 2-1 triumph at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. In Guardiola’s debut season in charge last term, City finished third, 15 points behind the champions, Chelsea. That disappointment forced a serious rethink, making him open to advice regarding how to make the team more successful this campaign. He was given unswerving support by the club’s board and is known to be impressed by the structure of the club. The City Football Academy, which represents a £200m investment by the owner, Sheikh Mansour, was built to develop home-grown players. This is a key element of Guardiola’s philosophy because he is intent on harnessing in-house talent, and he attends as many youth-age games as possible. Against Spurs, Guardiola gave Phil Foden his league debut, the 17-year-old forward coming on as an 83rd-minute replacement for Gündogan. Foden, who has been at City since he was 10 and was a standout performer for England’s Under‑17s during their World Cup triumph this year, has also made his Champions League debut for the Spaniard this season. “There have been ups and downs, of course, at Bournemouth we won in the last minute, Southampton we won in the last minute,” Guardiola said as he reflected on City’s blistering start. “Last season was last season. This season is completely different. Tottenham Hotspur last season, I think compared to Chelsea, played the best football in the Premier League. I’m quite happy because I think this season started going well in our game in LA against Tottenham in pre-season. “Our first game in pre-season was against United and we lost [2-0]. The second one was against Tottenham and there we created eight, nine or 10 chances to score loads of goals and we missed a lot. But there we saw all together – the players as well, not just me – that is the way we have to do that. Since then, we’ve maintained that level.” Guardiola replaced Sergio Agüero with Jesus after 58 minutes on Saturday, which led to the Argentina striker dropping his gloves to the turf in a clear show of disappointment. Commenting on the substitution, Guardiola said: “A manager takes a decision and we win, always you are right. When you don’t win, you make a mistake. Simple as that. “Always when I take a decision, I think many things. It’s never personal because I trust the guys a lot, that’s why I don’t want to offend some players. I understand, I was a football player, I know they want to play. “It always breaks my heart when Danilo cannot play, when Bernardo [Silva] cannot play, when Yaya [Touré] cannot play, when the other players cannot play. That always broke my heart because they deserve it but it is what it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/17/prince-harry-interviews-barack-obama-today-programme-guest-slot","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T16:00:41Z","webTitle":"Prince Harry interviews Barack Obama for Today programme guest slot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/prince-harry-interviews-barack-obama-today-programme-guest-slot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/prince-harry-interviews-barack-obama-today-programme-guest-slot","fields":{"headline":"Prince Harry interviews Barack Obama for Today programme guest slot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If you’re set to guest edit a nation’s flagship morning radio show, it probably helps to have the Rolodex of a royal. Kensington Palace revealed on Sunday that Prince Harry had called on Barack Obama to star in his edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on 27 December. The newly engaged prince questioned Obama about his memories of the day he left office, his post-presidential work with the Obama Foundation and his hopes for the future. The interview was recorded in Toronto in September during the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured military personnel championed by Harry. In a teaser released by the palace, Harry outlines how the interview will proceed. A relaxed Obama asks whether he will have to speak more quickly, as he says he is a slow speaker – then jokingly asks if he’ll have to speak with a British accent. Harry responds “not at all” but warns the former commander-in-chief that he can expect “the face” if there are any long pauses between answers. When Harry displays an exaggerated stern face, Obama responds: “I don’t want to see that face.” Harry has given a number of heartfelt public interviews this year. In a documentary about Diana, Princess of Wales, he spoke of his struggle to come to terms with her loss. “People deal with grief in different ways, and my way of dealing with it was just by basically shutting it out, locking it out,” he said. “The 10 years that I was in the army, I just dug my head in the sand and it was just … it was just white noise. And I went through a whole period of having to try and sort myself out.” After his engagement to the actor Meghan Markle was announced in November, he revealed that he had included two of Diana’s gems in his fiancee’s engagement ring “to make sure that she’s with us on this crazy journey together”. Kensington Palace said the conversation between the prince and the former president would focus on the pair’s “shared interest in building platforms for the next generation of young leaders”. Harry and Obama have enjoyed a relaxed public friendship for several years, having become acquainted during the first Invictus Games, in 2014. Last year Obama and his wife, Michelle, posted a mock challenge to Harry on Twitter before the 2016 Invictus Games, telling him to “bring it”. The prince replied with a video of himself watching the challenge with his grandmother, the Queen. Having watched the video, the Queen simply says: “Oh really? Please.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T16:24:47Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku sets Manchester United on victory path at West Brom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/17/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku sets Manchester United on victory path at West Brom","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chase feels forlorn, and it must be even more dispiriting for Manchester United when they play the day after their neighbours have turned in yet another stirring performance, but José Mourinho and his players can at least take some satisfaction from the fact they managed to trim the deficit at the top back to 11 points. They made much harder work of it than they should have done, with Gareth Barry’s goal 13 minutes from time forcing United to endure a slightly anxious finale after they had appeared to be coasting at 2-0, but a third successive Premier League away win was eventually chalked off courtesy of the first-half goals that Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard scored. Whether their win keeps the title race alive is open to debate – and maybe not a very long one given the way that Manchester City are playing at the moment – but Mourinho certainly has no plans to raise a white flag at Old Trafford anytime soon. “We don’t want to go on holidays, we want to play until the last match,” the United manager said. All that can be said for now is that United have no margin for error, which is why it was so important that they managed to weather Albion’s late storm. Jay Rodriguez had a chance to snatch an equaliser in those closing minutes, and Mourinho would no doubt have been much more animated had that header from Chris Brunt’s superb cross landed inside David de Gea’s near post. Mourinho preferred to give credit to Albion for the way the game finished rather than raising any questions about his own players, with the United manager highlighting the home team’s set-piece threat that led to Barry turning the ball over the line after Brunt’s corner had ricocheted off Marcos Rojo. Remarkably, it was Barry’s first goal as a substitute in the Premier League since 1999. The introduction of the 36-year-old at the interval was a key factor in a much-improved second-half performance from Albion, with Alan Pardew later admitting that he was guilty of picking the wrong team. Brunt’s arrival from the bench also made a difference and Albion will take some encouragement from the way they finished a match that delivered their first goal since Pardew took over as manager. “That was psychologically important,” Pardew said. The harsh reality, though, is that Albion remain second from bottom – they will be propping up the table if Swansea win at Everton on Monday – and their club-record run of matches without a win in all competitions has now been stretched to 17. Next is a trip to Stoke, who are two points and two places above them, and Albion desperately need to come away with something from that fixture. It was one of their former players who inflicted the early damage here. Lukaku, who spent the 2012-13 season on loan at Albion, towered above Kieran Gibbs – a mismatch if ever there was one – to nod Marcus Rashford’s inswinging cross beyond Ben Foster and emphatically into the top corner. It was a fine header, although Lukaku chose not to celebrate scoring for the second game running. “I think there are two reasons for that,” Mourinho said. “He was a happy kid here and it was here that he exploded in the Premier League. And probably the second thing is, he looks at me and I don’t celebrate, too.” Mourinho put his own subdued reaction down to “experience” and the fact that he has “changed” before promising that he would be charging down the touchline again if his team score a last‑minute winner. In truth, a much bigger concern for him at the Hawthorns was the sight of Antonio Valencia, who is such a reliable performer at right-back, pulling up with a hamstring problem. “It’s what I call a December injury – the accumulation of fatigue,” said Mourinho, who has no idea how long Valencia will spend on the sidelines. Lukaku’s header was actually the first effort on target that either team had produced in a flat opening period, but United quickly followed up that 28th-minute goal with a second. There was an element of good fortune about it as Ahmed Hegazi, the Albion central defender, stuck out his left boot to try to block Lingard’s low shot from the edge of the area, deflecting the ball past Foster, who was left wrong-footed. Rashford and Lingard both had chances to add to United’s lead early in the second half, although Pardew felt the home team should have been awarded a penalty prior to Barry’s goal, when Ashley Young barged James McClean out of the way so that De Gea could gather the ball. Pardew may well have had a point, yet he also accepted that Albion failed to help themselves at times. “You can’t win games unless you have ambition,” he said. “And it was only really when Gareth Barry and Brunty came on that we looked to me like we had the ambition to go and get something.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/17/wasps-la-rochelle-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T15:31:05Z","webTitle":"Elliot Daly scores two tries in Wasps’ revenge mission against La Rochelle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/17/wasps-la-rochelle-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/17/wasps-la-rochelle-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Elliot Daly scores two tries in Wasps’ revenge mission against La Rochelle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Historically the fourth round of the Champions Cup tests a team’s mental fortitude and character as much as it does their rugby abilities, which was the case for Wasps as they looked to exorcise the demons inflicted on them by La Rochelle seven days earlier. Officially the knockout stages do not begin until April but for Wasps this was knockout rugby in everything but name. Following their 49-29 humbling in France last weekend, Dai Young’s side were forced to dig deep to stay in the European competition. Wasps were knocked from pillar to post at the Stade Marcel-Deflandre last Sunday but still managed to score four tries on limited territory and possession. That was key at the Ricoh Arena on a cold December afternoon with the Aviva Premiership finalists of last season fully aware that if they could turn possession and territory in their favour they could hurt the French side with their dynamic back division. Elliot Daly was the beneficiary of Wasps’ improved forward effort, crossing twice. This vitally important victory pleased Young, although the Wasps director of rugby was frustrated at his side’s inability to turn pressure into points in the first half. “Defensively we stood strong and set-piece wise we were pretty good while in attack we caused them loads of problems,” he said. “Coming away from the game the only thing you could be a little bit disappointed about is, first half, we didn’t turn enough pressure into points. We were on top in most areas of the game. The only thing we did not control was the scoreboard. “It would have been nice if we could have got at least a couple of scores up earlier than we did. We felt we really had to stand up and physically match them. Before you can go round a team you have to go through them a bit as well. We won the gain line both sides of the ball which allowed us to play with a bit of freedom.” Young calmed fears over the England and Lions wing Daly, who was forced to leave the field with his ankle heavily strapped. “He is walking about – he was not stretchered [off] or anything like that. By his reaction it does not look like something that will keep him out for a long period. But the first 48 hours will determine how bad it is.” In typical French fashion the visitors tinkered with a winning side, making eight changes for their visit to Coventry. Following their annihilation in France the Wasps pack knew they had to respond and, to their credit, they did. Unlike seven days ago Wasps won the collisions and were able to play the game on their terms. Young’s side started with great intent, stretching the visiting defence when Ashley Johnson released a sumptuous offload to Dan Robson who raced up the touchline. The ball was recycled before Christian Wade was bundled into touch just short of the try line. Wasps’ ambition paid off when Daly crossed in the left-hand corner following a long pass from Robson after the home pack made serious yardage on the gain line. For all their dominance in the first half, however, Wasps held a slender 7-0 lead at half-time. The hosts finally got their just rewards when Daly crossed for his second try after a lovely pass from Kyle Eastmond and a weaving run from Willie le Roux, whose offload put the England man over. La Rochelle finally got on the board when Brock James kicked a simple penalty after a powerful surge by the former All Blacks winger Rene Ranger. The Wasps pack’s redemption was complete when Tom Cruse bundled his way over following a powerful driving lineout to close the gap at the top of Pool One to five points.

Speaking at her old school to launch a new strategy to increase the number of people speaking the language, the Welsh government’s language minister, Eluned Morgan, said: “I was one of a handful of children from my estate in Cardiff who had my education through the medium of Welsh and distinctly remember having stones thrown at our bus as they objected to having a Welsh-language school in their neighbourhood.” When Morgan attended Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, it was the only Welsh-language secondary school in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. There are now three in Cardiff and one in the vale. The Welsh government has set an ambitious target of a million people, about a third of the population, being Welsh speakers by 2050. There are currently about 570,000. Other targets set out in the report include increasing the number of primary teachers able to teach in Welsh from 2,900 to 3,900 by 2031 and to 5,200 by 2050. The target for secondary teachers in to increase their number from 1,800 to 3,200 by 2031 and 4,200 by 2050. The government is planning to invest more money on sabbaticals to give teachers time to learn how to teach in Welsh and on incentives to encourage teachers to teach the language or other subjects in it. Morgan, who went to school in the 1970s and 80s, said: “I am delighted that the attitude towards the language has changed fundamentally from when I was a child and that we now have the opportunity to build on this goodwill. “Reaching a million Welsh speakers by 2050 is a significant challenge. Inspiring the next generation, particularly those from non-Welsh speaking families, to embrace the language and to use it in all contexts is vitally important in achieving this target. “Whether our children attend Welsh-medium schools or learn the Welsh language in an English-medium school, education is key to the success of this ambition. This is why the Welsh in education action plan is so important and why it is a priority for the rest of this assembly term.” There was alarm in Wales when the 2011 census found the number of Welsh speakers had fallen to around 562,000. Today, there are 420 primary schools providing Welsh-language education to almost 67,000 learners and 49 secondary schools to almost 35,000 learners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/17/england-craig-overton-stuart-broad-ashes-injuries","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T14:46:00Z","webTitle":"Craig Overton and Stuart Broad injury concerns add to England Ashes woe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/17/england-craig-overton-stuart-broad-ashes-injuries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/17/england-craig-overton-stuart-broad-ashes-injuries","fields":{"headline":"Craig Overton and Stuart Broad injury concerns add to England Ashes woe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Craig Overton is facing the prospect of his Ashes series ending early, and Stuart Broad is struggling with a knee problem that may require surgery at the end of the tour as the problems continue to mount for England and Joe Root. Overton had been bowling through the pain of a cracked rib during the third Test. But he again fell on the troublesome area when diving in the field. Having bowled only one over at that point, he did not return to the attack as Australia posted 662 for nine declared. The 23-year-old Somerset seamer has claimed six wickets and impressed with his attitude since making his debut in Adelaide, and England may retain him in the squad in the hope he is fit in time for the fifth Test in Sydney. The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne is considered a doubt, however. Broad has been battling a problem in his left knee that required the draining of fluid before the third Test. England insist it remains a niggle and his bowling workloads have not been affected. Broad’s wicketless form with the ball in Perth represents a headache for Root along with a lack of runs from himself and Alastair Cook. England’s record-breaking opener has a top score of 37 from six innings – a miserable 150th Test was capped off when chipping a catch back to Josh Hazlewood on 14 – while the captain is averaging 29. Hazlewood, who also removed Mark Stoneman early in England’s second innings, said: “We’re very happy. We put importance on those wickets as it applies pressure to the middle order, the guys who are a bit more inexperienced. We have plans for Root and Cook and have done well against them. They are quality players.” James Vince, fresh from making 55, talked up the pair at the close. “Those two guys, if they don’t score runs in one innings, you expect them to do it in their next. They don’t often have long periods without scoring runs. It won’t happen for them all the time, but they are both mentally strong and capable,” he said. The England No3 had batted fluently for his second Test half-century before his off stump was detonated by a Mitchell Starc special that, from around the wicket, struck a crack in the pitch and jagged across the right-hander like a leg-break. Vince said: “It’s still frustrating to get out, but it’s easier to take than the ones you feel like you’re at fault yourself. If I faced that another 20 or 30 times I think it would get me out every time. You give him credit there, sweep it under the carpet and move on. “I felt in previous innings on tour I was a little bit hesitant. I’ve got in a few times and got out. I was trying to be more positive in my mind, to help my decision-making and footwork. For the time I was out there I felt pretty good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/17/doug-jones-democrat-roy-moore-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T15:13:25Z","webTitle":"Democrat Doug Jones: Trump shouldn't resign over sexual misconduct claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/doug-jones-democrat-roy-moore-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/17/doug-jones-democrat-roy-moore-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Democrat Doug Jones: Trump shouldn't resign over sexual misconduct claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Doug Jones, the Democrat who won a shock victory in the Alabama Senate election, said on Sunday he did not think Donald Trump should resign as president in light of sexual misconduct allegations against him. It was time, Jones said, to “get on with the real issues that are facing the people of this country right now”. Multiple women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. The president, who was recorded saying he could “grab” women “by the pussy”, denies all such allegations. The White House has said all the women are lying. Last weekend, however, cabinet member Nikki Haley said the women who have accused Trump “should be heard”. A group of Trump accusers subsequently called for a congressional investigation and a group of Democratic senators led by Kirsten Gillibrand of New York called for Trump to resign. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Jones was asked if he would join new Senate colleagues including Cory Booker of New Jersey, who campaigned for him, in calling for the president to resign. He said: “Where I am on that right now is that those allegations were made before the election. And so people had an opportunity to judge before that election. I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues. “Let’s get on with the real issues that are facing people of this country right now, and I don’t think the president ought to resign at this point. We’ll see how things go but certainly those allegations are not new and he was elected with those allegations at front centre.” Jones echoed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who told reporters on Monday: “The people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process.” Trump said before his election victory over Hillary Clinton that he would sue all his accusers after the election. That has not happened and more accusers have come forward. Since the downfall of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein over multiple allegations including sexual assault and rape, which he denies, a number of powerful men have been the subject of allegations of sexual misconduct. On Saturday a third congressional Democrat, Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, announced he would quit Congress over allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. Two Republicans, Trent Franks and Blake Farenthold, have also announced the end of their congressional careers. On CNN, Jones was asked why Al Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota who announced his resignation over accusations of sexual misconduct, should have to resign over offences allegedly committed before he was elected if Trump did not. Jones said: “Again, I go back to the fact that those allegations were made and he was elected president of the United States and I think the American people have spoken on that at this time. “There’s other things out there but I think at this point we need to move on and try to work with some real issues that are facing the country and not worry about getting at odds with the president any more than we have to.” Jones, who also appeared on Fox News Sunday, was asked about his opponent Roy Moore’s refusal to concede the Alabama election. “I think it’s time to move on,” he said, adding that Moore was “hurting the people of Alabama”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/universal-income-no-panacea-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T06:00:52Z","webTitle":"Universal basic income is no panacea for us – and Labour shouldn’t back it | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/universal-income-no-panacea-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/universal-income-no-panacea-labour","fields":{"headline":"Universal basic income is no panacea for us – and Labour shouldn’t back it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There aren’t many ideas that unite trade unionists, the libertarian right, the green movement, and the Silicon Valley tech scene . But that’s the rainbow alliance backing a universal basic income, a centuries-old idea posited as the solution to a range of 21st-century problems. Is its surprising coalition of bedfellows a sign of an idea whose time has at last resoundingly come – or a symptom of a catch-all, superficial fix in search of a problem? Universal basic income, sometimes called a citizens’ income, is the idea that the state should pay every adult citizen a regular, modest income. It is a no-strings payment, so unlike benefits currently available to people of working age, it is not means tested. You get it regardless of whether you have a job, are looking for work, or whether you are even willing to work. A basic income has long counted on support from the political fringes. It has appealed to radical feminists and greens frustrated by capitalist failure to properly value non-monetary work, such as care. The libertarian right embraces it as an opportunity to roll back the bureaucracy of the state, replacing public services with a simple, regular cash payment, to be spent as people wish. But the real reason for basic income’s unlikely elevation to idea of the moment is the growing chorus of thinkers who seem to believe the modern economy can’t function without it. Tech utopians talk up the rise of robots and the development of artificial intelligence, which they say will leave less work to go round. They argue that this is the perfect opportunity to embrace a four-day working week and top everyone up with a basic income payment. Labour market dystopians, on the other hand, rightly point to growing insecurity in the low-paid labour market and the millennials bouncing from gig to gig, never quite pinning down the security of a permanent contract. For them, a basic income is the poverty backstop that could help people cope with this brave new world. Ken Loachian welfare critics, meanwhile, denounce today’s convoluted benefits system, worlds away from the contributory, insurance-based system of the past. It has become overloaded with sanctions as politicians compete to become ever more punitive to demonstrate there’s no such thing as something for nothing. So people who have been laid off find themselves pushed further into hardship after having their benefits docked for reasons outside their control. Wouldn’t it be easier to eradicate that inhumane, overbearing complexity, and replace it with something that gives people more breathing room to find the right job? But, like so many ideas overstretched to become the answer to all problems, a basic income falls short on all of the above. If we could be bothered, we could fix the caring issue simply by increasing the generosity of the stingy state benefits paid to those who care full-time for older people or adults with disabilities. If we were so inclined, we could get rid of punitive benefit sanctions and replace them with a welfare-to-work system that puts much more emphasis on training and support for people to find the job that is right for them, not the first that comes along. But it is in its most ambitious and radical incarnations that basic income runs aground. People have been predicting the end of work for a long time. Guess what: whether they count themselves utopian or dystopian, they have always been proved wrong. The wheel, the loom, the washing machine, the PC: as innovation after innovation has replaced some forms of human labour, the steady march of progress has replaced that labour with something else. It’s tempting to think our inventions are more transformative than those of our ancestors. But it’s much more likely that, as in the past, technology will radically reshape the world of work without reducing its sum total. That’s partly because the idea that there is a set amount of paid work to be done is an error, which economists call the “lump of labour fallacy”. In fact, the richer we get, the more cash we have to spend – creating more demand and more jobs. None of this should take away from the fact that we have some serious challenges ahead. The idea that the labour market is being reshaped rather than shrunk won’t be very comforting to taxi drivers losing their jobs to self-driving cars and finding they lack the skills for the new ones being created. But paying people a meagre basic income won’t help: we know from deindustrialisation in the past that leaving people who get laid off languishing on long-term benefits wreaks untold damage on working lives curtailed decades too early. Britain has also always had too many low-skill, low-paid jobs offering poor prospects of progression. That should seriously worry us, particularly in the light of new research that suggests having a low-paid, stressful job is even worse for your mental health than unemployment. Far from robots stealing jobs, the reality of today’s economy is that many companies are underinvesting in technology, suppressing productivity growth. In some sectors, labour is so cheap and easily exploitable it doesn’t make sense to modernise – for instance, Leicester’s garment industry is still heavily reliant on old-fashioned sweatshop models. In sectors such as parcel delivery and logistics, technology itself is being used to turn workers into quasi-robots. Wrist-based devices measure routes workers take round the warehouse or delivery rounds to check them for speed and efficiency, and track them right down to how long they take for toilet breaks. The answer cannot be to accept this sorry state of affairs and try to patch things up with a basic income. It must be to address the fundamental power imbalances that allow employers to shift risk on to their employees by forcing them to become self-employed contractors, or refusing to pay them for breaks. And to develop long-term solutions for improving the quality of work. You can see the attractions of a basic income for Silicon Valley. Firms such as Uber, whose drivers are classified as self-employed “partners” rely on this risk-shift model. Even as Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, heaps praise on a basic income, the tech giant does all in its legal power to avoid tax and dodge paying its fair share towards the social infrastructure it relies on. The left must not allow itself to be seduced. A basic income is a distraction from these core issues of economic power; a radical-sounding excuse to look the other way from the less glamorous, more complex question of how to ensure labour market rights are properly enforced. Accepting a deterioration in employment rights and working conditions in exchange for a basic income could be dangerously counterproductive. The tax credits that function as income top-ups for people in low-paid work have steadily been eroded by Conservative chancellors over eight years. Labour rights are more future proof: it’s impossible to imagine the government being able to cut statutory maternity leave, the minimum wage or limits on the working week without a much tougher fight – although if they are not properly enforced these rights can end up meaning little in practice for workers with unscrupulous employers. The left will have to pick its battles. It must focus on winning the right to a decently paid job for all, not sell out by extolling a basic income as a panacea for the ills of the modern labour market. It must choose the fight for power, not the fight for a dribble of cash. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/17/tottenham-floored-by-manchester-city-problem-pochettino-guardiola","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T13:19:13Z","webTitle":"Tottenham are the latest challengers floored by the Manchester City problem | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/17/tottenham-floored-by-manchester-city-problem-pochettino-guardiola","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/17/tottenham-floored-by-manchester-city-problem-pochettino-guardiola","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham are the latest challengers floored by the Manchester City problem","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The title race is done, Manchester City’s excellence beyond all previous experience. They are less a football team now than one of those apparently unsolvable maths problems: Fermat’s Last Theorem, the Riemann Hypothesis, the Hodge Conjecture, the Guardiola Impossibility. How on earth do you beat them? Soon some American foundation will put up a prize to stimulate investigation. In 30 years, there will be a biopic about the savant who finally achieves it, his Eureka moment captured in a montage of unslept nights, screwed-up paper and huge roller blackboards from which chalked formulae spew. Perhaps we need Brendan Rodgers back with his tea and toast and long, dark nights of the goal at Melwood. Mauricio Pochettino tried on Saturday. He did not just pack men behind the ball. He did not look to deny City space and scrap and spoil. As he has done before against Pep Guardiola sides, he tried to pressure them, to squeeze them high up the pitch. The theory, at least, is sound: had Tottenham won, Pochettino would have become the first manager to beat Guardiola three times in league games. No one has achieved more victories against Guardiola than Jürgen Klopp, whose method is always to press high. An early goal-kick gave notice of Spurs’ approach with their three forwards positioned high to prevent Ederson playing the ball short to either full-back or Fernandinho. And they did trouble City for periods, they did make them change their style of play, they did not let them settle into their usual rhythm. They were still comfortably beaten 4-1. City only had 53% possession against a season average of 65.5%. Tottenham had more of the ball against them than any other side this season. And it didn’t matter. That is perhaps the greatest strength of this City side: they can strangle you with possession, but they can also hammer you with rapid transitions. Play a high line and they will use their pace to get in behind you; play a low block and, although Guardiola will get irritated if you do it well enough, City will eventually wear you down. And, most surprisingly of all, they have developed a recent habit of scoring key goals in big games from set plays. Ederson, denied the possibility of rolling the ball out short, took to pinging accurate passes towards the halfway line instead. Overall in the league this season he averages 3.7 long balls per game. On Saturday he hit 19. His pass completion, it’s true, did drop from a season average of 83.6% to 78.8% but by and large he still found his man; it’s just that man tended to be 50 yards further up the pitch. Yet it was hard to avoid the thought that Tottenham were complicit in their own downfall. It’s probably the case that City’s relentlessness, both with the ball and without, creates pressure and leads to errors, but still there were needless moments of sloppiness. The opening goal was perhaps the most eye-catching example as Dele Alli ended up jumping into Harry Kane while Harry Winks looked on, allowing Ilkay Gündogan to wander in and head Leroy Sané’s corner in unchallenged. But there were also numerous barely explicable misplaced passes in the City half. Their pass accuracy was down to 79.9% from a season average of 84.2%. Perhaps it would have been different had at least one of Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sánchez and Victor Wanyama been available and Tottenham, as they had against Real Madrid, been able to field a back three. Certainly then there would have been extra protection for Kieran Trippier, and his struggles against Sané might not have been quite so damaging. Perhaps – but you suspect City would still have found a way. So how do you stop them? The decisive shift in Guardiola’s final season with Barcelona came when teams – first Marcelo Bielsa’s Athletic Bilbao and then José Mourinho’s Real Madrid, in the second leg of a Copa del Rey game having gone 4-1 down on aggregate – were emboldened to take the game to them. It became apparent that their weakness was at the back and so the best way to combat them was, in a controlled way, to try to take advantage of that. But this City are more versatile. That is not to say they are better, but they are more varied in approach. They can beat opponents in a number of different ways. Pochettino’s gamble made a certain sense, to try to disrupt City high up the pitch, to pressure them where they are weakest, but to play like that entails a dreadful risk. City are now so good, their reputation so awesome, that many opponents seek no more against them than simply to avoid humiliation. That’s not good for the spectacle and it’s not good for the league, but it is a right City have earned. At the moment they present a problem that nobody seems able to solve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/17/family-appeal-information-death-commons-deputy-speaker-lindsay-hoyle-daughter-natalie","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T13:25:49Z","webTitle":"Family appeal for information on death of Commons deputy speaker's daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/family-appeal-information-death-commons-deputy-speaker-lindsay-hoyle-daughter-natalie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/family-appeal-information-death-commons-deputy-speaker-lindsay-hoyle-daughter-natalie","fields":{"headline":"Family appeal for information on death of Commons deputy speaker's daughter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The family of Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, the daughter of the Commons deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle, have appealed for information about her death.

Her mother, Miriam Lewis, a Maldon councillor, asked for anyone who had been contacted by Lewis-Hoyle on Thursday night to notify police. She said her daughter’s phone was missing and may have been left on a train from London Liverpool Street to Ipswich. She wrote on Facebook: “It is with unbearable sadness that I have to announce the sudden death of my beautiful, much-adored daughter Natalie. “If Natty contacted you by phone, text, messenger or any other means on Thursday evening, 14 December, between 20.00 and midnight, please let me know through this page or contact A/Insp Jon Loudon at Essex police, incident no 158.

He wrote on Twitter: “Our family will never be the same without our loving granddaughter, sister &amp; aunty.

But privacy is not absolute, and in journalism, as in law, privacy may need to give way to the public interest. This is a familiar and serviceable approach, but often a blunt one. It is possible to try to calibrate editorial judgments more finely. Categories of the public interest have received attention. Codes tend to list public interest considerations such as exposing crime or miscarriages of justice, protecting public health, preventing the public from being misled, and raising or contributing to a matter of public debate. Less attention has been paid to developing a taxonomy of fame. Privacy belongs to people (not corporations or governments), and some people are famous or, in the language of journalism, newsworthy. Some trade privacy for the benefits that publicity can bring, and fame follows. As Bob Dylan observed in his memoir Chronicles, “privacy is something you can sell, but you can’t buy it back”. Not everyone who becomes newsworthy trades, and in deciding how much privacy anyone’s fame reasonably costs, it can be useful to ask what type of fame the person enjoys/endures. The type of fame, considered in combination with whatever public interest factors may be relevant in the particular circumstances, can help in making decisions about the degree of justifiable intrusion. My conclusion, after years of seeing court judgments and journalism ethics cases about privacy in several jurisdictions, is that the category of fame into which the claimant fits can be a factor – often unarticulated – in the outcome, whether they win or lose. Broadly, there are five categories of fame: • Fame by election or appointment. Politicians, judges and others in public office trade some privacy for a share – usually temporarily held – of power that derives from the public. Accountability can justify some privacy loss. • Fame by achievement comes to film, TV and music stars, sporting champions and others who lead big organisations or make transformative contributions in their fields. • Fame by association. People associated with those who are famous (or infamous) – the spouses, children, parents, siblings – have reflected fame, but not always glory. Invasions of their privacy ordinarily need careful justification. The spouse of a politician is not synonymous with the politician, but it may be necessary to disclose the share dealings of the spouse when the companies are relevant to the politician’s public role. • Fame by chance happens to previously anonymous people randomly caught in tragedy or disaster or, less often, good fortune. Initially at least, they do not trade privacy, but rather have it taken from them by a chance event that at the same time is usually traumatic. They have no preparation for being in the public eye, and often they have one of the most powerful motives to retreat into the seclusion which is one aspect of why we humans value privacy: to restore ourselves when damaged, to grieve. • Royal fame is unique. How to decide where to draw a line between the public and the private in the lives of those who are born into, or marry into, royalty? Since the mid-20th century at least, they exist to be in the media. As early as 1955 the British Press Council identified the issue. When the Queen’s press officer argued that “the Queen is entitled to expect that her family will attain the privacy at home which all other families are entitled to enjoy”, the council wondered if that was realistic because “everything that touches the crown is of public interest, and there can be little escape from ‘that fierce light that beats upon a throne’.” (Tennyson’s preceding line is “Before a thousand peering littlenesses…) There were limits, yes, but where? For those in other categories of fame, what makes them famous tends to be only one aspect of their lives: they appear in big-budget movies, they play tennis better than anyone in the world, they are elected to govern, their child is missing, their brother is a serial killer, a president once sexually harassed them. A judge caught this point beautifully when the fashion model Naomi Campbell sued for breach of privacy following press publication of a photograph of her in the street outside the venue where she was attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Lady Hale wrote: “If this had been, and had been presented as, a picture of Naomi Campbell going about her business in a public street, there could have been no complaint. She makes a substantial part of her living out of being photographed looking stunning in designer clothing. Readers will obviously be interested to see how she looks if and when she pops out to the shop for a bottle of milk. There is nothing essentially private about that information nor can it be expected to damage her private life. It may not be a high order of freedom of speech but there is nothing to justify interfering with it.” Acknowledging that it was in the public interest to disclose that Campbell had lied about her addiction, the court nevertheless found 3-2 for Campbell. In effect, the majority included in her zone of privacy the details of where and how she was dealing with her drug problem. That was the zone the newspaper was penalised for invading. Her therapy was an aspect of her life that was not related to her work as a model. It was her work, her achievement, as a model that was the reason for her fame, her newsworthiness, and she could have no complaint about a photo of how she looked when she went out shopping. Royals are marketed as exemplars, symbols – from birth, into school, university, military and other activities routinely and willingly publicised; on through engagement, marriage, perhaps divorce; parenting on into grandparenting; and funeral rites too. If a life is designed for public consumption, it gets consumed. Life episodes for which most people, including people in other categories of fame, reasonably expect privacy may be episodes in which royal fame dooms a person to considerable exposure. These categories are rarely neat, but trying to use them – and being willing later to explain how, if called to account – can contribute to the legitimacy of decisions editors make about the privacy of others. • Open door returns on 15 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/saturday-night-live-llama-kevin-hart-scarlett-johansson","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T12:51:10Z","webTitle":"Saturday Night Live: excited llama makes rest of Kevin Hart-hosted show seem stiff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/saturday-night-live-llama-kevin-hart-scarlett-johansson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/saturday-night-live-llama-kevin-hart-scarlett-johansson","fields":{"headline":"Saturday Night Live: excited llama makes rest of Kevin Hart-hosted show seem stiff","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A special Christmas message from the White House: Alec Baldwin as Trump announces that the war on Christmas is over, “because it will soon be replaced by the war with North Korea.” Cecily Strong stands by his side as sad Melania. “Soon, white Santa will be coming from house to house,” Trump says, “taking presents from Muslims and illegals and giving them to real American children.” He’s decorating his tree with ornaments decorated with “losers”, brought in by a parade of his assistants: Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon), Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant) and Mike Pence (Beck Bennett). “Are you here to deck the halls, Mike?” Trump says. “Oh,” says Pence, “I don’t like that song, because it has the words ‘gay apparel’.” Leslie Jones as Omarosa pounds on the window and then Scarlett Johannson arrives, as Ivanka. “Where’s Jared?” says Trump. “He’s packing a go bag before the FBI arrives,”she says. Outside, Omarosa plays the theme song to the Apprentice through a boombox. Live from New York, it’s Saturday night. Kevin Hart is the host! He’s recently had his third baby. It’s not easy. “I wasn’t excited about having a baby in the beginning … don’t judge me …I didn’t want to deal with that two-year-old age again … All you do is repeat yourself all day.” Fathering is stressful, he explains. Moms aren’t fun. Dads have to be. “All of the fun responsibility falls on the shoulder of the father,” he says, “the fun becomes the hardest job is because the kid does not know how to turn the fun off.” A little Christmas advertisement for “the gift every woman desires: a beautiful charm from Pandora.” From a Starbucks coffee cup to a dress to a dog, “We take one little fact about your wife, and turn it into jewelry. And now it’s a charm.” Truly the meaning of Christmas. In Hart’s first sketch he’s in a meeting and, well, he really needs to go to the bathroom. But instead of just excusing himself, he pretends he’s being called away by a family emergency. “It always sounds like a family emergency, but then you’re always back in like, eight minutes,” McKinnon says. My husband wanders into the room and glances at the screen. “He’s gotta poop?” “Yes,” I say. Next, Hart is Captain Shadow and the Cardinal, his sidekick, is played by Chris Redd. They get pulled over by a cop and the results are, predictably, bad for the Captain. As a critique of police treatment of black men, it doesn’t hit hard enough. Inside the NBA: Hart is a completely addled Shaquille O’Neal while Kenan Thompson is a very cutting Charles Barkley: “Shaq, you gotta get it together man …” he says, “I think you’re the only basketball player whose brain has aged like a football player.” Shaquille replies with a jumbled monologue that concludes: “Cats come out at night. Freaks come out at night. Shaq a freak.” It’s a bit mean until Hart comes out from behind the anchor desk and reveals that he’s standing on enormous stilts. Foo Fighters are the musical guest. Dave Grohl wears a classic red and black checked flannel shirt. The band plays a song that sounds like many other Foo Fighters songs. Weekend Update! “Black people aren’t really Democrats, we just vote for the guy who looks less likely to put us on a boat,” Michael Che says, recapping the Alabama Senate election. He moves on. “I actually think President Trump should at least consider resigning. You’ve made your point dude … the political system is broken … If this was a Christmas movie, this would be the point where you winked at the camera and disappeared and we realized you lived inside of us this whole time.” Jones swings by again as Omarosa, and then Alex Moffat returns as The Guy Who Just Bought A Boat. “It’s beginning to look a lot like Sexmas,” he sings. “Let’s talk gifts of gold and frankincense that will have her coming back for myrrh.” He struggles to read his sex puns off the teleprompter. Bryant introduces a church nativity play. “The role of the wise man’s camel will be played by a llama with a bean bag hump,” she says. Then Heidi Gardner comes out as the llama handler, explaining that it’s llama mating season. The curtains open. It really is a llama! I’m impressed. Day, Bennett and Hart are the wise men, and they’re very afraid of the llama, who actually seems pretty chill. But then it gets an erection. “Lo,” says Hart, “a manger … I’m sorry everybody, but the llama mad horny right now.” Jones gives the llama’s penis a standing ovation. At a Christmas party, Jones is Hart’s overbearing wife. “She just knows what’s better for me,” Hart says. “Kiss that teddy bear like you mean it,” she says, “show them what I have to deal with every night.” The encounter with the bear escalates and the onlookers at the party seem to feel the same way as me: confused, maybe a little uncomfortable. A PBS pledge drive! Retro. Hart plays Active Jack Taylor, a 70s children’s TV host in a stylish maroon jumpsuit with a manic demeanor. After 40 years, Strong explains, the original cast is back to perform the theme song. Active Jack is now played by Kenan Thompson in a white wig, while McKinnon is an ancient jump roper who says “my doctor says if I exercise my hip will shatter like a wine glass”. Baldwin introduces the Foo Fighters for their second song. I hope Kevin Hart is OK. Dave Grohl is wearing a nice Christmas sweater. The band plays the beginning of Everlong and then moves into Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) and then finishes with the Peanuts theme song. Very seasonal. And then the cast says goodbye from the Rockefeller Center ice rink! Kevin is fine, he was just putting his skates on. I watch the credits for longer than usual, to try to figure out who the best skater is. I think it’s Kate McKinnon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/17/london-symphony-orchestra-simon-rattle-leonard-bernstein-review-barbican-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T13:50:15Z","webTitle":"LSO/Rattle review – celebrating Bernstein's irrepressible versatility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/17/london-symphony-orchestra-simon-rattle-leonard-bernstein-review-barbican-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/17/london-symphony-orchestra-simon-rattle-leonard-bernstein-review-barbican-london","fields":{"headline":"LSO/Rattle review – celebrating Bernstein's irrepressible versatility","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Simon Rattle’s contribution to the London Symphony Orchestra’s centenary tribute to its former president, Leonard Bernstein, celebrated the irrepressible versatility of Bernstein the composer. On the one side there was the concert version of Wonderful Town, his frothy 1953 musical comedy set in New York, while on the other there was the second of his three profoundly serious symphonies, The Age of Anxiety, completed four years earlier. Last month, Marin Alsop launched the LSO’s celebration with Bernstein’s other two symphonies. Like those works, The Age of Anxiety doesn’t fit into any conventional symphonic template. Inspired by WH Auden’s epic poem of the same name, it’s also a piano concerto of sorts. The rich mix of early 20th-century musical styles – Stravinsky, Nielsen, Hindemith and Copland, throwing in a 12-note row and a jazzy episode too – doesn’t always hang together, even, as here, with the great Krystian Zimerman as the soloist. He, though, was clearly ailing, alternating typically dazzling playing with bouts of coughing; there was even a false entry at the beginning of the second part. But Wonderful Town was an unqualified, uncomplicated delight. This was the hour-long concert version, which sacrifices narrative continuity to preserve the best numbers in Bernstein’s score. Though no stage director was credited, there was a theatrical framework of sorts, including a conga that embroiled most of the London Symphony Chorus in the fun. Rattle’s performance had just the right brassy pizzazz, with a cast led by the irrepressible Alysha Umphress as Ruth and Danielle de Niese as Eileen, the two sisters who arrive from Ohio determined to launch their careers; Nathan Gunn, David Butt Philip and Duncan Rock took smaller roles, all slick and nonchalantly brilliant. The other concert in Rattle’s pre-Christmas brace took up the theme of late works, which threads through his first London season. Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde was prefaced by Strauss’s Metamorphosen for 23 solo strings. Both are valedictory works of enormous emotional potential, which these performances never came close to realising. In the Mahler, Rattle had opted for a baritone as the second soloist alongside Simon O’Neill’s rather acerbic tenor; that was Christian Gerhaher, whose meticulous, lieder-style approach was rather overwhelmed by the vividness of the colours that Rattle conjured from the orchestra. It was a bit too brilliant, a bit too dry-eyed. At the Barbican, London, on 21 December. Box office: 020-7638 8891.

The England captain’s default setting is one of natural effervescence but here, with Nathan Lyon wheeling away in celebration and Australia closing in on the Ashes, the fizz was gone. Lyon had only just come on. His first delivery, though the widest the off-spinner has sent down in the match on the surface least suited to him so far this series, was a length ball and not the half-volley Root saw. He wafted, he edged and, via the leg of Tim Paine behind the stumps, Steve Smith gobbled it up like a Four’n Twenty pie slathered in sauce. And, boy, did it taste good. Smith was every bit as pleased with himself as at the various milestones during his career-best 239 in Australia’s first-innings 662 for nine declared. His players had spoken before the series about targeting the England captain and though Root had rightly called it out as verbal compost – you strive to get every batsman out, right? – the hold they have had over him during this series is inarguable. For Smith’s average of 142 so far, Root’s is 29.33. There have been two centuries of utter match-defining dominance from the Australian to the Englishman’s pair of fifties. The home captain has heavy artillery at his disposal in the field while the tourist has been largely trying to contain and confound with willing but condition-blunted weaponry in the hope the opposition batsmen blink first. Bar some minor tabloid titillation at Lyon’s new love interest, the Baggy Green camp has been free from off-field drama. England? A lurching script of largely self-inflicted distractions. As the series has entered its third chapter Root has become ever more restless as a batsman. In stark contrast to Smith’s apparently Zen-like mindset out in the middle – bar Adelaide, when England got into his face with words and into his technique with lateral movement – the Yorkshireman has tried to force the issue. In his side’s unfulfilled first innings he tickled Pat Cummins down leg on 20. Second time around, with the score 60 for two come the start of the 15th over and with 14 to his name, he forgot to take a look at Lyon first. Much of what has been eating Root has been beyond his control and goes back to the absence of Ben Stokes. Though this has been felt both off the field – in terms of extra scrutiny on behaviour – and on it, by way of the all-rounder’s talent, his front-foot approach and the balance he brings being missing, there has also been the impact of losing his deputy in the dressing room. Stokes was rightly made Root’s vice-captain in February. He is the close friend with whom an ascent through the age groups to the Test team has been shared and the move to empower the pair in a rising generation – and allow Alastair Cook, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to take more of a backseat and focus on their own personal stellar careers – looked a shrewd one. Without Stokes, and given a squad otherwise made up of followers and those still establishing themselves, Root has turned back to the big three for support at a time when they are facing their own battles. Anderson has, in fairness, returned 12 wickets at 25 to hit 50 for the year. But a public gripe with the coaching staff after Adelaide, and his centrality to the Ben Duckett incident, was not exactly what Root needed at 2-0 down from his newly installed vice-captain. Broad, after a frustrating summer of 11 dropped catches and largely unrewarded efforts in Brisbane and Adelaide (the first day notwithstanding), hit a bit of a wall in Perth. His none for 142 from 35 overs represent his worst Test figures and sat only four runs better than Andy Caddick’s Ashes low for England at The Oval in 2001. It is 23 months since Broad’s last five-wicket haul – the epic one-spell slaying of South Africa at The Wanderers – and his last five Ashes wickets since the famous eight for 15 at Trent Bridge have cost 72 runs apiece. He and Anderson may have gone two wickets past Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh’s 762 from Tests played together to become the all-time seam-bowling partnership, but the last nine of them have been claimed by the senior man. Cook, victim in the second innings of a ball that stopped in the pitch and produced a wonderful one-handed return catch from Josh Hazlewood, has seen his 150th Test become one of seven and 14 runs, making it 83 for the series at 13.83 and prompting the latest round of speculation as to his longevity – by the huge cast of Australian commentators in particular. These were brushed off before the match, with Cook rightly pointing out that only he knows how he feels beyond an obvious loss of form. He will battle on, no doubt providing an understanding ear for Root after going through the mill in the role himself four years ago. But what the captain needs most from the senior players – himself included – is performances, and fast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/17/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-self-exclusion-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T00:04:15Z","webTitle":"Gambling addicts still hooked on machines as bookies fail to enforce scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-self-exclusion-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/17/fixed-odds-betting-terminals-self-exclusion-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Gambling addicts still hooked on machines as bookies fail to enforce scheme","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A government scheme that is meant to allow staff at betting shops to bar problem gamblers has drawn fresh criticism after an investigation found that addicts are still being allowed to bet. An undercover reporter posing as a known problem gambler who should have been ejected from bookmakers when attempting to use fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was asked to leave only two out of 21 betting shops. The reporter had signed up to the multi-operator self-exclusion scheme, a Gambling Commission initiative that helps problem gamblers by circulating their photograph and details to betting shops in the area where the gambler lives or works. This should ensure the gambler is not served in those businesses. The exercise, carried out by BBC Five Live Investigates, raises questions over attempts by the gambling industry to discourage addicts. It was conducted in Grimsby, chosen because the Lincolnshire town has one of the highest concentrations of bookmakers in the UK. It took until the 17th visit to a betting shop before the reporter was finally recognised and asked to leave under the self-exclusion scheme. The system was introduced last year following industry consultation to “strengthen social responsibility”. Central to the debate was tackling the spread of FOBTs, which are disproportionately found in poorer parts of Britain and which in 2015 generated £1.7bn in revenue for bookmakers. Described by critics as the “crack cocaine of gambling”, FOBTs allow stakes of up to £100 to be laid on machines every 20 seconds. Rather than being ejected, the reporter found that on several occasions he was offered tea and coffee to help make his betting experience more comfortable. Responding to the findings – aired on Radio 5 Live on Sunday – the industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, said it was “concerned”. Sarah Gardner, executive director of the commission said: “We are determined to drive improvements in behaviour across the industry in terms of the effort they put in to reducing gambling-related harm and it really is getting to the stage where there is nowhere to hide. What we would like to see is much more emphasis from gambling businesses on intervening at an early stage.” George Kidd of the Senet Group which operates the self-exclusion scheme called the findings “a bit of a wake-up call”. A statement from the Association of British Bookmakers said: “This is a disappointing result, however it was conducted in artificial circumstances, involving a small sample, over a short period of time and the individual concerned was not a problem gambler or previously known to shop staff. “By its very nature, those who self-exclude are normally known to the staff in the shops they exclude from.” It referred to an independent review of the self-exclusion scheme which found 83% of participants saying it had been effective in reducing or stopping their gambling activity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/18/downsizing-satire-alexander-payne","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"High-concept satire Downsizing is dwarfed by its white saviour narrative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/18/downsizing-satire-alexander-payne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/18/downsizing-satire-alexander-payne","fields":{"headline":"High-concept satire Downsizing is dwarfed by its white saviour narrative","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There was a time when Alexander Payne was, as far as the critical majority was concerned, close to unassailable in the ranks of modern American auteurs. His 1996 debut, Citizen Ruth, earned only a niche following, but the five features that followed, from 1999’s sourball classroom satire Election through to 2013’s mournful father-son comedy Nebraska, earned him a reputation as a kind of jaundiced observational poet of sad-sack America, a body of work bound by grim-faced humour, mundane tragedy and white male heroes with scarcely any heroic virtues at all. It’s a run that has netted him two Oscars, a flood of other honours, and repeated critical comparisons to Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges and even John Updike. David Thomson himself gushed: “Payne is one of America’s quiet and persistent treasures, like maple syrup, the St Louis Cardinals or the apparent tranquility of our deserts.” Yet all hot streaks must come to an end, and Payne’s first film in five years, Downsizing, has landed him in unfamiliarly tepid territory. It looked promising from the outset. Payne’s first foray into fantasy is his most conceptually ambitious work to date, its absurdist premise – what if ordinary people could permanently shrink themselves to Mrs Pepperpot proportions for financial gain? – giving way to a host of more substantial questions about community, social consciousness and economic desperation. Reviews started strong: it opened the Venice film festival to a raft of raves and “masterpiece” claims, though the opposition formed early. When it travelled to Telluride and Toronto days later, the temperature of the reception plummeted several degrees; the dreaded word “problematic” started getting thrown around by critics doubtful of the film’s liberal political integrity. The chill steadily sapped away at the film’s awards buzz: when the Golden Globe nominations were announced earlier this week, it scored but a single bid for supporting actress Hong Chau, failing to place even in a best comedy/musical field that found room for the Hugh Jackman campfest The Greatest Showman. What did Downsizing do wrong? Once again, the film itself is a case of promising beginnings, swiftly undone. As someone who hasn’t been in the Payne fanclub for several years, I found myself unexpectedly tickled by the first act of Downsizing, which sees the director – beginning proceedings in the dun Nebraskan nowhere that has backgrounded most of his films – laying out his lunatic sci-fi premise with a dry, droll matter-of-factness and attention to daft visual detail more akin to Spike Jonze. Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig’s gormless suburbanites observe the growing national trend for “downsizing” (a medical shrinking procedure that leaves patients inches high, with vastly reduced costs of living) before taking the plunge themselves; Payne illustrates the dreary practical concerns behind their decision, and the prefab luxury of the miniature midwestern McCity that awaits them after the procedure, with a ruthless specificity that plays to his coolest instincts as a middle-American satirist. We laugh at the vulgarity of “downsizing” culture, which as oddly recognisable as it is fictionally outlandish, even as we wonder, fleetingly, if we’d follow the same herd for the sake of 9,900% increase in the value of our assets. A natural misanthropist, Payne is at his best when dwelling on the craven weaknesses of consumerist society – masculinity, in particular – that sets its material goals higher than its spiritual ones, gleefully taking in the spectacle of people literally wasting themselves away to gain a lifestyle of dream kitchens and country clubs. (There are environmental benefits to the shrunken life too, but no one seems especially excited about those.) It’s as dispassionately perceptive and witty as the war of petty institutional power structures that fuels Election (still Payne’s greatest film by a country mile) or About Schmidt’s doleful dissection of a life lived in pursuit only of comfortable retirement. It’s when Downsizing attempts to go warmly humanist on us that it becomes sorely unstuck. Damon’s schlubby everyman Paul finds downsized life no shorter on ennui or existential aimlessness than before: his romantic and professional circumstances take a drastic dip alongside his property portfolio. Yet when his path crosses that of a disabled Vietnamese refugee Ngoc (Chau), a political dissident shrunk against her will as punishment for her liberal provocations, his problems are put rather bluntly in perspective; cue a moral awakening dramatised with a sledgehammer touch, as Paul, his eyes opened to a downsized but nonetheless sprawling underclass, is invited to heal the world one charitable gesture at a time. Which is all well and good, but for a film hinged on one man’s realisation that the world doesn’t revolve around him, Downsizing itself never shifts on its axis or allows another character to come fully into focus. The enlightenment of Damon’s privileged white hero is supposedly inspirational, but Payne and Jim Taylor’s dense, shaggy-dog screenplay is so wincingly ungenerous to Ngoc – a strident ethnic stereotype, embodying little more than victimised goodness, whose pidgin English is milked repeatedly for laughs–— that his new perspective is never meaningfully tested or challenged. Chau, evidently the film’s last Oscar hope, essays the role with valiant good humour and flashes of salty wit, but can’t bring it to complex, conflicted life: Ngoc is written as so selfless that her self never entirely emerges. What’s left, against its most noble impulses, is a white saviour narrative with no vivid human world to save. This turn towards insincere condescension – the barbed cynicism that was once Payne’s trademark awkwardly swaddled in a cosy, synthetic blanket – is not, from where I’m standing, a new development in Payne’s work. His most recent films have been startlingly disingenuous in their emotional uplift: The Descendants, a widower-reborn story hailed as a celebration of family and legacy, had a bitter undertaste of misogyny and cultural lip service throughout; his last film, Nebraska, attempts simultaneously to draw sneering comedy from the uncouth lifestyles of midwestern yokels, and to elegiacally mourn the passing of a simpler, purer America. The tricky, acrid bait-and-switch of Downsizing is not a world away from these films in theme or tone, despite its more extravagantly wacky premise, yet its mild reception thus far is in stark contrast to the universal hosannas and honours that have greeted those previous works. In Trump’s America, does Payne’s particular brand of human satire ring less true than before? Is it no longer enough to obsessively scrutinise the weaknesses of America’s Average Joe without seeking to tell other people’s stories? Or is the film just an odd duck, too eccentric and narratively hobbled to reach its expected fanbase? Either way, the worldview of one of America’s premier auteurs has never seemed quite so, well, downsized. Downsizing is out in the US on 22 December and in the UK on 24 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/28/coach-jbl-wwe-champion-john-layfield-beyond-rugby-bermuda","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"'Coach JBL': WWE champ John Layfield wrestles with rugby and social change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/28/coach-jbl-wwe-champion-john-layfield-beyond-rugby-bermuda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/28/coach-jbl-wwe-champion-john-layfield-beyond-rugby-bermuda","fields":{"headline":"'Coach JBL': WWE champ John Layfield wrestles with rugby and social change","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I’d love to have been a No8,” says John Layfield, with a laugh. “Oh, man, I’d love that, a big No8 coming off the back of the scrum. I never had the opportunity to play but I’d have loved to give it a go.” At 6ft 6in and close on 300lbs, the towering Texan is more than big enough for No8. But he’s 51 now and though he played college football and flirted with the NFL probably the main reason he never played rugby union was that he was busy being an all-time wrestling great. In a picaresque career he made his name under another one: JBL, the longest-running WWE Smackdown champion, a cowboy-hatted villain. Before that he was Bradshaw, half of the Acolytes Protection Agency, and variously Bad Santa, Death Mask, Johnny Hawk and someone or something called Vampiro Americano. You can see him on the internet, throwing John Cena through the windscreen of a car. Such exertions cannot go on forever. In retirement, Layfield made successful forays on Wall Street, worked as a WWE commentator and Fox News analyst – a rare “centrist” on the channel, he says – and authored a self-help book called Have More Money Now. He has also found rugby, by a route that like our interview involved a few increasingly sociable beers. “It was 2010,” he says, “the football World Cup in South Africa, I went back to a bar after a game in Cape Town to try to get the vuvuzelas out of my ear. And apparently I agreed to go to a shanty town with Nick Keller the next morning.” Keller is the British founder of Beyond Sport, a nonprofit that seeks to use sport to tackle social problems. “You know how you get that phone call the next day and you think, ‘Oh my God, I’ve done something again, something stupid’? I told Nick, ‘I know I’ve promised you I will do something, whatever it was I will do it as long as it’s within reason.’” The ensuing visit, to a programme seeking to use athletics to help children out of poverty, didn’t really work out: it was raining so no one was running. But just by talking to the organisers Layfield was converted to what he calls “the power of sport for good”. Back in Bermuda, where he lives most of the year, he looked for a sport and a cause. He found them. Bermuda has a flourishing rugby scene but it is not just a comfortable home to the expat bankers and shipping insurers who typically play the game. It has impoverished areas and disadvantaged communities. Layfield cites a 2011 Columbia University study which found a 50% high-school dropout rate for black Bermudan males; according to the US state department, travelers on the island “should be conscious of the presence of gangs and illegal drug activity”. Layfield thought rugby would be well-suited to helping keep young Bermudans in school and away from gangs, not despite of its often brutal nature but because of it. With help from the Bermudan rugby union and the Family Centre, a charity that manages the educational side of things, Beyond Rugby Bermuda was born. “I had seen the ethos of rugby and I was very much an admirer,” Layfield says. “For us it’s a beautiful sport, what I guess what Pele called soccer in Brazil. It’s so simple, it’s easy to understand, you can play five on five or 15 on 15. I would be so much better coaching American football, but you need 22 on each side and all the equipment and everything. With rugby you just need a mouthpiece and grass. “We have issues with gangs and with drugs in Bermuda but we want to attract the most hardcore kids. We want the gang leaders, because they’re going to be leaders either in a gang or on the rugby pitch. And we’ve had a lot of success. “We have super-tough kids who grew up in super-tough environments and they enjoy getting out there and knocking each other around and having a piece of pizza and going home.” There are now “about 350” boys and girls “playing rugby every week”, out of every public school on the island and with “about 100 in a very intensive programme”. Every week, Layfield happily mows the grass and marks the lines. The players know him as “Coach JBL”. ‘We need to be able to keep up with these kids’ Layfield was speaking to the Guardian at a New York fundraiser for Memphis Inner-City Rugby, a programme from one of the most impoverished American cities. Mark Griffin, founder of New York-based Play Rugby USA, was also in attendance. “Sport for good” is spreading and Layfield is well placed to consider its future challenges. “We’ve done a great job keeping kids in school,” he says. “The problem we have is that we get with the kids really well until they’re 18- or 19-years old. The integration with senior rugby has been a problem. It’s a real gap for us. “I would like to create an island team and my partner Gareth Nokes, who has really saved youth rugby in Bermuda, has the idea that you create a team that is Under-23 and is just island kids, and then they go into a draft for the main teams. I think that would be very helpful. “You know there’s not much similarity between a black kid who grows up in a disadvantaged area and a 36-year-old accountant that’s white and from the UK or New Zealand or whatever. It’s just tough for the integration process and we need that because we need to be able to keep up with these kids in later life.” That future may also contain more visits from English pro teams, Layfield having brought Harlequins and Saracens over already. There may also be a stronger connection with the US: in his own words, Layfield is “part of the organisation that is going to bring professional rugby to New York, as part of Major League Rugby”. To wilfully misuse Faulkner, though, Layfield’s past isn’t even past. He recently stepped down as a WWE commentator but as we speak wide-eyed New Yorkers constantly ask for selfies. He obliges, happy to apply his celebrity to his newfound cause. He also tells stories of his career in the ring, in all its surreality and swing. Most are very funny. Many are not printable. With care, one might be. It’s about a USO tour in Iraq and it reads like something by Joseph Heller or an outtake from an update of Apocalypse Now or M*A*S*H. In his wrestling persona, at a combat base somewhere near Baghdad, JBL joined a prominent celebrity who is now – how shall we put this – soon to be a former senator. In front of a crowd of hardened fighting troops, the wrestler and the future politician performed a comedy sketch. The future senator was dressed as Saddam Hussein, Layfield says, and handcuffed. Then the base was mortared. Everyone scattered to the nearest bunker, JBL and Celebrity Saddam skittering for their lives over sand. But the guy with the key went the other way. The shells rained down and the future senator dressed as Saddam lay face down in a concrete hole, handcuffed and terrified, scrabbling for cover in the dirt. Next to him lay JBL, cowboy hat askew, creased in hysterical laughter. Fortunately for all involved, the base was not overrun. It’s a great story. The morning after telling it, perhaps through a slight hangover, Layfield is on an early flight to Bermuda. There’s grass to cut, lines to paint and rugby to coach and play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/15/uber-letter-richard-jacobs-spying-secret-team","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T01:06:42Z","webTitle":"Uber stole trade secrets, bribed foreign officials and spied on rivals, filing says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/15/uber-letter-richard-jacobs-spying-secret-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/15/uber-letter-richard-jacobs-spying-secret-team","fields":{"headline":"Uber stole trade secrets, bribed foreign officials and spied on rivals, filing says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Uber allegedly engaged in a range of “unethical and unlawful intelligence collections”, including the theft of competitive trade secrets, bribery of foreign officials and spying on competitors and politicians, according to an explosive legal document published on Friday. It’s the latest chapter in the discovery process for the company’s messy legal squabble with Waymo, Google’s driverless car spin-off, which has accused Uber of stealing trade secrets. The details were outlined in a 37-page demand letter filed by the ex-Uber security manager Richard Jacobs, who left the company earlier this year. The document paints a picture of a team of employees dedicated to spying on rivals and “impeding” legal investigations into the company. Jacobs alleges that when he raised concerns over the techniques being used, he was given a poor performance review and demoted as “pure retaliation” for refusing to buy into the culture of “achieving business goals through illegal conduct even though equally aggressive legal means were available”. He had sent the letter to Uber’s in-house counsel with his allegations about possible criminal activity carried out by the special group in May this year, threatening to sue the company. Uber did not provide the letter to Waymo as part of legal discovery before the trial started. An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement: “While we haven’t substantiated all the claims in this letter – and, importantly, any related to Waymo – our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly, on the strength of our ideas and technology.” Jacobs worked at the ride-hailing company from March 2016 until April 2017. After his attorney sent the demand letter to Uber outlining potentially criminal activities within Uber’s “strategic services group” and “marketplace analytics” teams, he and Uber reached a $4.5m settlement. This included a non-disparagement clause and a one-year consulting contract to help Uber “root out bad behaviour”, Jacobs said when he testified in federal court last month. The letter alleges, among other things, that Uber planned to use certain hardware devices and software to conceal the creation and destruction of corporate records so they “would never be subject to legal discovery”. Such records would, the letter states, “implicate ongoing discovery disputes such as those in Uber’s litigation with Waymo”. The letter also outlines a range of intrusive techniques that Uber allegedly used to extract intelligence from politicians, regulators, competitors, taxi organisations and activists. Uber’s intelligence team allegedly infiltrated private event spaces at hotel and conference facilities that a group of competing executives used during their stay. Jacobs claimed that Uber recorded and observed private conversations among the executives including their real-time reactions to the news that Uber would receive $3.4bn from the Saudi government. Live updates, photos and videos were then allegedly transmitted back to the “War Room” at Uber’s headquarters, where the company’s former CEO, Travis Kalanick, along with other members of Uber’s executive team, could observe. Uber operatives also impersonated taxi drivers, Jacobs said, to infiltrate private Facebook groups and WhatsApp groups of opponents. Matthew Umhofer, an attorney representing four members of Uber’s security team mentioned in the letter, added: “The competitive information gathering that was done at the explicit request of management was unremarkable and no different than what’s done by law-abiding companies across the country and Uber’s own competitors.” Umhofer also described the letter as “character assassination for cash” and said that Jacobs “is nothing more than a failed Uber employee who underperformed and got demoted, and then retaliated against his supervisors”. During his testimony last month, Jacobs repudiated some of the allegations made in his demand letter, saying that he had only reviewed it for 20 minutes before his lawyer had sent it. Among those was the allegation that “Uber used the marketplace analytics team to steal trade secrets at least from Waymo in the United States”. Jacobs said that the team primarily worked overseas, but in the US had researched “protest and threat groups targeting Uber”. Waymo sued Uber in February, alleging that the ride-hail company’s acquisition of the self-driving startup Otto, founded by the former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski, was actually a scheme to acquire secrets stolen from Waymo. The federal judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the trade secrets case, was only alerted to the existence of the explosive demand letter by federal prosecutors on 22 November in a separate letter in which they confirmed that there was an open criminal investigation into Uber. “You should have come clean with this long ago,” he subsequently told Uber’s lawyers in court. Because such a key piece of evidence had been withheld, Alsup delayed the start of the trial. “If even half of what’s in that letter is true, it would be a huge injustice to force Waymo to go to trial” as scheduled, he said. At the time, a spokeswoman for Waymo called the new evidence “significant and troubling” and welcomed the trial delay as an “opportunity to fully investigate this new, highly relevant information”. But an Uber spokeswoman, Chelsea Kohler, said in a statement then: “None of the testimony today changes the merits of the case. Jacobs himself said on the stand today that he was not aware of any Waymo trade secrets being stolen.” Uber maintained that it did not withhold information because the letter was outside of Waymo’s discovery demands. The special master, a court official helping out with the trial, did not agree, concluding in a report filed on Friday that “Uber should have produced” the Jacobs demand letter in response to Waymo’s discovery requests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/15/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-title-race","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T22:30:45Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp believes Manchester City already have the title in the bag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/15/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-title-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/15/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool-title-race","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp believes Manchester City already have the title in the bag","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool are competing to be “the best of the rest” behind Manchester City because the Premier League title race is over. Liverpool trail the unbeaten league leaders by 18 points after 17 games and their manager admits only a dramatic loss of form can stop Pep Guardiola’s team. Klopp also discounted Manchester United’s championship credentials, claiming José Mourinho’s side are not genuine challengers despite sitting second in the table. “This season nobody is really fighting any more for the title,” the German said. Klopp insists he is being realistic rather than defeatist and that finishing above United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, or beating City in the Champions League, remain “fantastic targets” for Liverpool. He drew parallels with the 2012-13 season when his Borussia Dortmund team finished 25 points behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga but lost narrowly to their arch-rivals in the Champions League final at Wembley. “If you make your own targets because of your neighbour then you can never move on,” said Klopp of City’s flying start to the season. “If you want to have the nicer garden, the nicer garage or the nicer car then you will always be a little bit behind. You have to make your own targets and go for it. You face the other team twice a season, maybe in the FA Cup for the third time or in the Champions League for a fourth and fifth time. That’s probably possible. That’s the only moment you should be concerned about them or think about them. “We cannot chase City, like we could not chase Bayern that season but we could have beaten them in the Champions League final 100%. We were not worse; it was an open game and nobody saw in this game a team 25 points ahead. We didn’t play a bad season, we got to the Champions League final and had some of our best moments in our life in that campaign. “This season nobody is really fighting any more for the title. I don’t think United are. We will all try to come as close as possible but if City doesn’t have any drop then they will probably win it so does that mean all the others have to stop? To be the best of the rest could be a fantastic target. So it is to try to have the best position in the table which for us for the last – I don’t know how many years – is probably third or second.” Liverpool, who visit Bournemouth on Sunday, are fifth in the league and their manager maintains the biggest difference between his team and Guardiola’s is not quality but consistency. He insists consecutive home draws against Everton and West Bromwich Albion is no reason to doubt Liverpool’s ability. Klopp added: “Yes, City are ahead of us at the moment but our performances show we could do it if we bring them often enough on the pitch. That’s what we are thinking about. I can’t imagine why we would think about things that would disturb our development. We know we could have won the last game but we didn’t. Teams ahead of us won games like this. We didn’t have a lot of situations so far this season where we say: ‘Wow, that was a lucky situation.’ Not giving the penalty, not seeing the handball, not having offside goals against us. We could still say we won 3-2 at Watford but we didn’t because of a goal that should have been disallowed. Now we have this situation. “If we had four points more it would look completely different, we would be three points behind United. Everything is fine. I cannot make the biggest difference about drawing twice even when I don’t like the result. You cannot be that disappointed after Everton that you theoretically cannot perform in the next game. If you win you don’t celebrate for five weeks after so it makes no sense to suffer for five weeks if you draw.” The manager has denied Naby Keïta could move to Anfield next month. Liverpool have agreed a club record £48m fee to sign the RB Leipzig midfielder next summer, paying a premium to secure his signature in advance, and Klopp confirmed the deal could not be brought forward. “No, he is a player of Leipzig,” he said. “There is an agreement with the club that he will come in June or July to Liverpool. Of all the things Leipzig have said, they said they do not have to sell any player so we don’t think about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/architecture-erno-goldfinger-high-rise-apartment-south-london","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"The flat Ernö Goldfinger built: ‘We fell in love’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/architecture-erno-goldfinger-high-rise-apartment-south-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/30/architecture-erno-goldfinger-high-rise-apartment-south-london","fields":{"headline":"The flat Ernö Goldfinger built: ‘We fell in love’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At a busy roundabout in Elephant and Castle, south London is a small cluster of 1960s high-rises, built as offices by the legendary Hungarian architect Ernö Goldfinger. When Nic Roome and his partner Francesco Petillo moved to London from Rome and bought their two-bedroom flat on the 10th floor of one of these 16-storey blocks, they weren’t thinking so much of the Goldfinger design. “We are fans of brutalist architecture,” Roome says, “but we were looking for an affordable base in London. This was the first place we saw, and we fell in love with it.” The original three buildings, once known as Alexander Fleming House, were used by the Ministry of Health. By the early 90s they had been bought by developers, converted into 400 flats and renamed Metro Central Heights. A fourth tower was later added and in 2013 the complex was awarded Grade II listing. True to Goldfinger’s signature, the couple’s apartment has an unfussy layout, with all rooms leading from a narrow hallway. It’s also packed with light, thanks to an entire back wall of floor-to-ceiling windows, which overlooks a long balcony with magnificent views of the city. Despite the clatter of the trains below and the stark architecture, it has a surprising warmth. “When we bought it, it felt like a soulless serviced apartment,” Roome says, “so we got rid of everything that wasn’t true to the original design, such as beige carpets, storage heaters and glass-topped tables. We stripped the paint off the window frames to expose the metal structure, and poured concrete on the floor and painted it dark grey. Once the walls were white, it became the ideal canvas for our furniture and artwork.” As creative types – Roome is a former designer for Burberry and now a manager for Airbnb, Petillo an art and design curator – the pair have created an unshowy mix of old and new. The living room, which is zoned by seating – a Matthew Hilton for SCP sofa and an exquisite original Franco Albini daybed – has an open feel, which Roome believes is down to the lack of a television: “With no TV, there’s no particular direction in the room, and I like that. I’m also not into overhead direct lighting, so the soft glow of lamps is much more subtle.” An old Heal’s wooden sideboard bought from Brick Lane market houses Roome’s pottery collection. “I’m from Stoke-on-Trent, so these pieces are important to me.” Off to the side is a galley kitchen, with a bistro table in the corner. The existing cabinets were given a 60s-style lick of peppermint paint, while open wooden shelves are former pottery boards used for drying slipware, found at Kempton Park antiques market. The small second bedroom is used as a dining room and library. In the master bedroom the large bed is made by friend and architect Anna Maria Sacconi, using broom handles as a headboard. Furniture aside, much of what gives this place personality is the artwork, from large scarab paintings to colourful prints and street artworks, and a portrait of Petillo in the hallway. “On rainy Saturdays we sometimes rehang it all,” Roome says. “It keeps the place fresh.” And when the sun’s out, the view “makes you feel utterly connected to the city”. House rules Best thing about the apartment? The extraordinary views of London. Worst thing? The trains throw up lots of dust. Your biggest extravagance? The scarab artwork by Dimitris Ntokos. Worst decorating mistake/purchase? Painting our hallway deep red… it felt like a drab tunnel of doom. Most treasured possession? The daybed. We never grow tired of its postmodern simplicity. Your favourite room? The dining room: it’s the most sparsely decorated, with the fewest distractions. What are your house rules? Our doors are always open! Best thing about Elephant and Castle? You can get east to west in a snap of your fingers. And Borough Market is so close, it’s like our local grocer’s. Worst thing? The redevelopment of the area, awash with banal and dissonant architecture. Favourite local haunt?

The early-morning dispatches from the iPhone of Donald Trump, often sent while he lies in bed, propped up on a pillow, lack the poison punch they packed in the 140-character era. They ramble a bit now, losing focus. But they still command attention and dominate the news to an extent no one on the planet can match. This week it was Trump’s swipe at Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York senator who had called for the allegations of sexual harassment made against Trump during the 2016 election campaign to be investigated. Trump called Gillibrand a “lightweight” who used to “come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)”. That parenthesis was a misogynist smear, implying that a senior female politician had offered Trump sexual favours in return for cash. It duly dominated the US news cycle for 24 hours. On other days, it’s not Trump’s tweeting habit that fills the airwaves, but the newest twist in the continuing saga of alleged collusion with Russia to tip the last election. The latest on that is the concerted work by Trump’s Republican enablers on Capitol Hill and beyond to prepare the ground for the firing of Robert Mueller, the former FBI director now serving as special counsel in the Russia investigation. Never mind that Republicans hailed Mueller only a matter of months ago as an unassailably neutral public servant, or that removing him would be a Nixon-level abuse of power, they are doing what they believe their party interest demands. Both these things matter. Trump’s tweets trample daily on the norms that underpin a democratic society, as well as trafficking in the most inflammatory racism and sexism. The Russia question could not be more grave: to collude with a hostile, authoritarian foreign power in subverting a free election is an assault on democracy itself. The trouble is, they keep us looking the other way. Just as they consume Trump’s energy, they divert ours, preventing us from paying attention not to what he says via Twitter, or what he may have done with Moscow, but what he’s doing right now from his desk in the Oval Office. On that score, it’s tempting – and fair – to assess his first 11 months in office as a failure. He has failed to fulfil so many of his signature promises, from building that wall to repealing Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. Today Republicans hoped to unveil a bill that would cut the taxes of the very richest, but even if that gets passed next week it will be the only piece of major legislation Trump has managed to get through a Congress where his party enjoys the rare luxury of a majority in both chambers. And yet, he has not done nothing. On the contrary, bit by bit and in ways that rarely command the front pages, he has done a lot to shape the way Americans, and others, will live for decades to come. Start with Thursday’s decision by a Trump appointee to scrap the rules governing access to the internet known as “net neutrality”. It may sound of interest to nerds only, but it could affect the online realm inhabited by all of us. Put simply, until now your internet service provider has been obliged to treat all websites equally, so that a neighbourhood blog is just as accessible as a major corporate site. Your broadband provider has had to be neutral between blokeinhispottingshed.com and Amazon, and not operate a fast lane for one and a slow lane for the other. Thanks to Trump and his man at the Federal Communications Commission, that obligation is binned. Now those ISPs can offer premium access to some and deny it to others. The big players will be able to pay the extra cash to ensure they stay in the fast lane, but the cost will shut out startups. The next challenger to Netflix or Facebook may be strangled at birth by prohibitive fast-lane tolls. That’s a loss for those would-be innovators and for us, who will never see what they might have produced. Power online will be ever more concentrated in the hands of a few giants. But there’s a more direct political dimension. Take the blog maintained by the residents of Grenfell Tower, which warned of disaster before it struck. To ensure their warnings were heard, their US equivalents would now have to find a home on one of the mega-platforms, posting their material on, say, Facebook. But how confident could they be that Facebook, if confronted by an irate local council, would continue to host and shield those residents, or people like them? A defining feature of the internet was that it was open and a broadly level playing field. Thanks to Trump, it will now be more equal for some – including the rich corporations – than for others. No less enduring is the impact Trump is having on the upper reaches of the US judiciary, especially on those courts that decide critical questions of civil rights and discrimination. Trump, backed by a Republican Senate, has been working at breakneck speed to fill vacancies with hard-right conservative judges, including some who are ostentatiously unqualified. Just watch the excruciating Senate grilling of one nominee for the bench as he was asked basic undergraduate questions of law, and could not answer any of them. Needless to say, 91% of Trump’s nominees are white and 81% are male, re-stacking the judiciary with white men at a rate unseen for 30 years, reversing decades of steady progress towards a bench that resembles the society it judges. Trump knows what he’s doing, hailing this shift as an “untold story” that “has consequences 40 years out”. He’s right about that. Judges are appointed for life. A judiciary made in Trump’s image will live on long after he’s gone. That’s truer still of his record on the environment, which seems to have no purpose beyond vandalism, erosion of the Obama legacy and the enrichment of his corporate pals. One of Trump’s first acts was lifting the ban on mining companies dumping waste in rivers and streams. Since then he has told national parks they have to resume selling bottled water at sites including the Grand Canyon, even though the ban had prevented the dumping of up to 2m plastic bottles. Name a good rule, and the Trump administration has shredded it, whether it’s protecting whales from fishing nets or preventing drilling for oil and gas in pristine Alaska. His withdrawal from the Paris accords on climate change made the news, but every day Trump is doing what he can to make the planet uglier and sicker. It’s a similar story with gun control, where Trump and his Republican henchmen have scrapped even the small moves Obama had made to keep the most dangerous guns out of the most dangerous hands. They even rolled back the restrictions that made it harder for fugitives and people with a history of mental illness to buy firearms. These developments are not as thrilling as a racist tweet or an FBI probe inching closer to the Trump inner circle. But they represent the most tangible part of the Trump legacy now taking shape. He’s a showman with a brilliant gift for misdirection. The least we can do is keep our eyes on his hands. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/prosecutor-downpour-of-evidence-led-to-charges-in-fifa-corruption-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T19:26:06Z","webTitle":"Prosecutor: 'Downpour' of evidence led to charges in Fifa corruption trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/prosecutor-downpour-of-evidence-led-to-charges-in-fifa-corruption-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/prosecutor-downpour-of-evidence-led-to-charges-in-fifa-corruption-trial","fields":{"headline":"Prosecutor: 'Downpour' of evidence led to charges in Fifa corruption trial","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than two and a half years after a dawn raid on a hotel in Zurich unveiled the US government’s sprawling investigation into corruption at football’s governing body Fifa, a New York jury on Friday convicted the first sports officials to stand trial. It had been five long weeks of detailed evidence in a trial awash with controversy. The jury took five full days to find José Maria Marin, the former head of football in Brazil, and the Paraguayan Juan Angel Napout – the former chief of South American soccer’s governing body (Conmebol) – guilty on most of the charges. The jury has yet to reach a decision on the fate of Manuel Burga, the third defendant and the former head of football in Peru, who is charged with a single count of racketeering. The convictions come after more than 40 individuals and entities were indicted by US prosecutors as part of the investigation. About two dozen have already pleaded guilty, with some testifying against their former colleagues during the trial. The investigation remains ongoing as some of the key players in the scandal, involving at least $150m in illicit payments, fight extradition to the US. The evidence against the three men was so overwhelming it was like torrential rain, said assistant US prosecutor Sam Nitze during his summing up. “In this case it’s a downpour,” he told the jury, urging them to find the three men guilty on an assortment of charges related to the receipt of bribes. The downpour came in the form of devastating testimony from 28 witnesses, who told the jury about meetings, recordings, ledgers and bank records, that implicated the men in a years-long, multimillion-dollar scandal involving the rights to some of South America’s most prestigious football tournaments, including the Copa América and the Copa Libertadores, the region’s premier club competition. Ledgers, using thinly disguised code names, documented the amounts they were to be paid by corrupt sports marketing companies in exchange for the rights to these events. Witnesses testified about when and how they had sent the six- and seven-figure sums. Bank records revealed how the money was transferred. And secret recordings captured one, Marin, seemingly negotiating a bribe directly. In the margins, the court also heard evidence of bribery surrounding the vote for the 2022 football World Cup, which was awarded to the Gulf nation of Qatar. The circumstances of that vote – held in 2011 – have often been questioned, given Qatar’s abundant wealth but lack of football pedigree. But the court in Brooklyn heard direct testimony that a senior Fifa official had received at least $1m in exchange for his support. What was presented at trial is undoubtedly a fraction of the evidence the US government has in its possession. The three defendants had argued that although endemic corruption existed at South America’s governing body, they had not been a part of it and sought to push the blame on their colleagues. None of the three men testified in their own defence. The courtroom was awash with tension before the partial verdicts were handed down – Marin, 85, rocked frantically back and forth on his chair and Napout, his wife and children in the public gallery, held his head in his hands. Both stared straight ahead as the verdicts were announced. The court had heard eye-watering evidence of greed. Marin, for example, had complained that a seven-figure annual bribe for the rights to the Copa Libertadores had not yet arrived in his bank account, during a May 2013 meeting in which he negotiated another $3m bribe for the rights to the Copa América. The account of the meeting was delivered by Alejandro Burzaco, a government star witness who has already pleaded guilty for his own role in the scheme as the former CEO of an Argentinian media company that facilitated bribe payments. According to prosecutors, Burzaco deposited millions into a shell entity controlled by Marin in early 2014, as shown in bank records displayed by the government. Shortly after that the Brazilian went on an international spending spree at luxury designer stores in Paris, Las Vegas and New York. Marin has remained under house arrest at trial, commuting from his $3.5m apartment at Trump Tower in Manhattan every day. Napout, the jury heard, took his payments in cash. The former chief of South American football sent his personal chauffeur on 30-hour round trips, driving from Asunción in Paraguay to Buenos Aires in Argentina, to deliver cash payments to the powerful head of the Argentinian football association Julio Grondona. Ledgers revealed that six-figure cash sums were regularly withdrawn for Napout under a codename “Honda”. He also collected payments in the form of lavish gifts, according to witness testimony, including tickets to a Paul McCartney concert in Buenos Aires worth over $10,000 and payments on a luxury property in Uruguay. Between 2010-2016, prosecutors said, Napout was owed $10.5m, Burga $4.4m and Marin $6.55m in connection to various bribery schemes. At times Napout’s defense argued that the overwhelming circumstantial evidence meant nothing as there was no eyewitness testimony showing money had ever changed hands. His lawyers seemed set on challenging the most minute details in the prosecution’s case and even declined to confirm whether such a McCartney concert had ever taken place. As a result, the prosecution called on pop star Kevin Jonas, of the teen group the Jonas Brothers, to testify that he had been present at the event. During three minutes of evidence he confirmed that he had attended and described the concert as “pretty special”, despite him missing the first two songs. Nitze, the assistant prosecutor, dismissed the defense’s efforts in his closing by returning to his rainfall metaphor: “A couple of people come in and say I’m soaked and the defence says, where’s your photograph?” Napout had remained upbeat throughout the trial – once joking with security officers as he pointed to his electronic ankle bracelet entering the courthouse, and even pulling the Guardian aside during jury deliberations to talk about the best music concert he ever attended (Led Zeppelin at Earls Court in 1975, he said, mimicking Jimmy Page on guitar). The jury convicted the Paraguayan on three of five counts and the Brazilian on six of seven counts. Each count carries a maximum of 20 years in prison. The partial verdict was read after last-minute legal wrangling between attorneys who debated whether they could keep the partial verdict under court seal. The scenes throughout the trial were not always so riveting, however. The evidence involved dozens of records and contracts showing payments to offshore shell companies and complex banking transactions, which formed the backbone of the case. One juror, a young man who had been asleep for significant portions of the first two weeks of evidence, was eventually dismissed by the judge, Pamela Chen. “As I’m speaking to you, you’re yawning,” Chen told the juror as he was instructed to take his belongings and leave the court. Amid concerns over intimidation, Chen had instructed that the jury remain anonymous and be driven to and from court under guard. Metal detectors were erected outside the courtroom and some witnesses entered the box through a protected doorway also used by the jury. The tension boiled over during Burzaco’s testimony as Burga, the former head of football in Peru, was accused by prosecutors of making “slicing motion across his throat” towards the witness during proceedings. Burga’s lawyers argued their client had simply been “simply itching” his throat due to dermatitis he had contracted in the new New York climate. Nonetheless, Judge Chen imposed harsher bail restrictions on the Peruvian, removing his ability to use a phone or a computer, or even leave his apartment without the presence of his lawyer. Hours earlier a former Argentinian government official, 52-year-old Jorge Delhon, had, according to authorities, committed suicide in Buenos Aires shortly after Burzaco told the court he had paid him annual $500,000 bribes. The evidence presented at trial went far beyond the three defendants. The court heard of multimillion-dollar bribes paid to other Conmebol officials also indicted in the conspiracy. Grondona, formerly Sepp Blatter’s number two at Fifa until his death in 2014, was the official alleged to have accepted at least $1m in exchange for his vote supporting Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, Burzaco said. The former media executive, a close confidant of Grondona’s for years, testified he had witnessed Grondona approach a group of Qataris after the vote and demanded a further $80m or a letter to the press saying he had never accepted any bribes. A group of Qatari investors, too, had been close to buying out another of the allegedly corrupt sports marketing companies, Full Play Group, but pulled out shortly after its owners, father and son Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, were indicted by US authorities. Santiago Peña, a former finance executive at Full Play told the court how the deal, worth $212m and known by a codename “the New York Project” had been kept almost entirely secret within the company. The Jinkis family would remain in operational control of the organization, associated with millions of dollars in bribes in the scheme, despite being bought out by Qatar. But it was Grondona – who ledgers revealed was nicknamed the Pope due to his supreme power at Conmebol – and Brazil’s former football chief Ricardo Teixeira along with former Conmebol chief Nicolás Leoz, who were the most corrupt, according to Colombia’s former soccer president Luis Bedoya. Leoz and Teixeira have been indicted but not extradited to the US. Bedoya himself has pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy and was brought to trial to testify against his former close associates. He told the story of how he and a group of six other officials – including Napout and Burga – attempted to wrest power away from these three ageing juggernauts in 2009. In doing so they secured bribes for themselves in relation to the tournaments, he said. Burzaco’s testimony led to other bombshell accusations on the sidelines. The former CEO alleged that other international broadcasters he partnered with had been involved in the payment of bribes for tournament rights. These included Brazil’s TV Globo and Mexico’s Televisa. Burzaco added Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Sports to the list as well, a claim that was bolstered later by reporting by the Guardian that revealed US prosecutors agree that senior executives at Twenty First Century Fox, including the former CEO of Fox International channels Hernan Lopez and the current head of its Latin America division, Carlos Martinez, provided “agreement and support” for bribes in exchange for the Copa Libertadores rights. Fox had partnered with Burzaco’s company in an offshore venture that held the rights to the tournament until 2015. Fox Sports and Lopez deny wrongdoing. As Fifa prepares for the World Cup in Russia, 2018 should have been a showcase for the sport. But Friday’s verdict – a stunning victory for the US justice department – means it is likely that the corruption investigation will continue to cast a dark shadow over world football."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/18/desperate-uk-homeowners-are-cutting-prices-warns-zoopla","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T07:47:40Z","webTitle":"Desperate UK homeowners are cutting prices, says Zoopla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/18/desperate-uk-homeowners-are-cutting-prices-warns-zoopla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/18/desperate-uk-homeowners-are-cutting-prices-warns-zoopla","fields":{"headline":"Desperate UK homeowners are cutting prices, says Zoopla","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Price cutting by homeowners desperate to shift their property in a slowing market has reached the highest levels in six years, according to an analysis by website Zoopla. Just over 35% of the homes marketed on the site have marked down their price in the hope of achieving a sale, with the biggest discounts in the London property market. The 35% figure compares with 29% just before the EU referendum in 2016, although it is below the levels recorded in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Sellers in Richmond and Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, both relatively prosperous areas, are among those to have made the deepest reductions in sale prices. Zoopla put the average mark-down by sellers in Kingston at £84,244. It added that around half of all the properties for sale in Kingston and other nearby locations such as Mitcham and Camberley in Surrey have been reduced since their first listing, indicating that sellers are having to significantly readjust their hopes in the light of the Brexit vote. Lawrence Hall, at Zoopla, said it was good news for first-time buyers trying to get on the property ladder. “A slight rise in levels of discounting is to be expected at this time of year when house-hunters are likely to be delaying their property search until activity picks up in January,” Hall said. “Those on the look-out for a bargain should consider looking in Camberley or Kingston upon Thames in the south, or areas of the north-east – home to some of Britain’s biggest discounts.” The average asking price reduction across the country currently stands at £25,562, according to Zoopla. The property website said towns in Scotland and northern England have proved more resilient to discounts. About 16% of homes in Edinburgh have been reduced in price, followed by 19% in Salford, 22% in Glasgow, and 25% in Manchester - all below the national average. In London, 39% of property listings have recorded a price reduction, up from 37% in July. Economists predict that a number of factors will weigh on house price growth in 2018, including falling real wages and weak consumer confidence as Britain’s future outside the EU remains uncertain. “We see house prices rising a modest 2-3% in 2018,” said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group, the EY Item Club. “The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging over the coming months with consumers’ purchasing power continuing to be squeezed by inflation running higher than earnings growth. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and a limited willingness to engage in major transactions.” Archer added that the Bank of England’s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade could be another factor to dampen the housing market in the months ahead. “While the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% [to 0.5%] and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, the fact that it was the first rise since 2007 could have a significant effect on housing market psychology,” he said. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/19/usain-bolt-justin-gatlin-beat-100m-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"When Usain Bolt lost his final race: ‘It felt like we’d all done something wrong'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/19/usain-bolt-justin-gatlin-beat-100m-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/19/usain-bolt-justin-gatlin-beat-100m-final","fields":{"headline":"When Usain Bolt lost his final race: ‘It felt like we’d all done something wrong'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As booing echoed around the Olympic stadium in London on 5 August, the on-track cameraman circled Justin Gatlin as he bowed at the feet of Usain Bolt. The American had stunned the world by beating Bolt in the Jamaican’s last 100m final, only to be received as a pantomime villain. While commentators reached for new adjectives, in the background of the shot, almost a blur in the whirlwind, a British athlete paced down the outside lane, hands on his hips. “I was just confused,” Reece Prescod recalls. After a training session in Loughborough, where the 21-year-old sprinter is based when not at home in Walthamstow, north London, he is preparing a mid-afternoon snack of chicken stew with a side of tomato and mozzarella tortellini. “Normally after a race everyone just claps, but this was weird. It felt like we’d all done something wrong. And then Bolt started his lap of honour so they were still booing, but then cheering at the same time. I didn’t know what was going on.” Gatlin had held a finger to his lips in an attempt to silence the the crowd, for whom he had had been cast as the former drugs cheat who would dare to rain on Bolt’s farewell parade. Prescod had received his home-crowd cheer when the announcer introduced him on the start line, but then he became a spectator, too. “I saw it all happen in front of me,” says the sprinter, who ran in lane eight, next to Gatlin in seven. “I saw someone win the world championships right in front of me. In terms of learning and experience, in a way I couldn’t have asked for more.” Prescod was largely unknown outside athletics. But when he unexpectedly won the national trials in July, he earned automatic qualification to the world championships on his home turf. He talks about it with the confidence of youth, and the composure of a young man trained to “execute his race model”. But two years earlier, Prescod had been working the bar at an Essex golf course and toying with the idea of becoming an estate agent. This was big. He stormed through qualifying with a 10.03 sec personal best in the heats, and came second in his semi-final, almost beating Jamaican former world champion Yohan Blake. On the start line for the final, he looked as relaxed as Bolt ever did. “You can take one of two approaches at the start,” Prescod says, admitting that his parents and friends were more nervous than him as they watched from the stands. “Either it’s tunnel vision, where you block out everything and everyone. But that kind of focus takes a lot of energy. The opposite is my approach, which is to relax and embrace the situation.” But the heat and semi had drained any reserves, and Gatlin opened up a big gap right from the gun. Prescod finished seventh of eight runners, in 10.17 sec. Matching his new personal best would only have earned him one more place, but he was nonetheless disappointed after the immediate confusion at the finish. “For about an hour I wasn’t happy, because I don’t like losing. But then, after my competition mode kicked out, it was a case of, ‘You know, I’ve done really well for myself’,” he says. Prescod was right. Support from Nike and others had already allowed him to train full-time. But making a world championship final elevated him to a new rung of the UK Sport funding ladder, as an athlete with Olympic podium potential. That means more security, and more freedom to train harder and smarter. He’s now working on his start before next summer’s European championships in Glasgow, with a view to maturing as a sprinter in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Perks have followed Prescod off the track, too, where his 6ft 4in frame attracts new attention in supermarket aisles and on red carpets. He won the best newcomer award at the Sports Journalists’ Association sports awards, following in the footsteps of Wayne Rooney and Lewis Hamilton. He gets invited to parties, including the launch of Fifa 18, the computer game. “They gave me it a week before it came out, which was cool,” he says. “Everybody ended up coming round mine to play it.” Does he ever flick over to YouTube to watch the race of his life, when two retiring giants of the track clashed just as he was arriving on the field? “I’ve got it on my phone, but I don’t know, sometimes it’s good, especially when you’re an elite sportsman, not to dwell on the past, because something else is always coming,” he says, before sitting down to eat. “I can look back at the end of it all. Now, I’m just looking forwards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/16/modern-life-lonely-isolation-hardwired-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"Modern life is lonely.

We all need someone to help","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hopping on the bus home on Wednesday night, I was greeted by the sight of a young woman hunched over her phone, alone in a seat, bawling for England. Or, as it turned out, Scotland. As I plonked myself down beside her and asked her what was wrong, various slumped passengers burst into animation as if a switch had been thrown, and started beseeching me to tell her that she must stay on this bus until such and such a stop, then get the bus with such and such a number. Clearly, I’d missed some of the drama. But I knew what the drama had been. A young person, feeling vulnerable, needing some comfort, had been showered instead with practical solutions to a practical problem, which had just upset her even more. Having recently seen the episode of Parks and Recreation where pregnant Ann kept complaining of her discomforts, only to have Chris annoyingly try to “cure them”, I understood that this young girl needed only for me to tell her that, yes, swollen ankles suck. Though first I had to get her to stop crying, which consisted of both of us sitting up straight, taking in a deep breath for seven counts, holding it in for four, and letting it out for seven. So it actually was quite like an episode of Parks and Rec. It turned out that she was 22, had been in London for a few weeks, had just been to her new job’s Christmas party, and had become overwhelmed with the misery of homesickness. Originally from Cornwall, she’d been to Edinburgh University, had fallen in love with the city, and was missing it every moment of every day. A quick chat back at mine about the virtues of Edinburgh (which was still there and could be returned to), a cup of tea, a biscuit, an Uber, and she was right as rain. Bonus: she thought I was an Angel of Kindness. Which I am. The next morning I was boasting about my Angel of Kindness status to my friend Mary. A young woman she knows had trained as a physiotherapist, got a job in the geriatric ward of a hospital in an unfamiliar town, and shared a flat with older men with whom she had nothing in common. Without the means to break her contract and move, she became so lonely that it made her ill. She had to go home to be looked after by her parents. What these stories illustrate is the way in which the threat of loneliness is hardwired into modern life. Practical people doing practical things – travelling far for a job opportunity, opting for the accommodation they can afford, under unbending rules – learn the hard way that human beings can only take so much practical. Loneliness always increases as societies modernise. Loneliness is an ailment of modernity. It’s terrific that the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness has highlighted this large and growing problem. Many of the points made at the end of a year-long study are sound ones. Working out what to do about the problem, though, that’s harder. The commission’s prescription is for many small changes to be coaxed into being, overseen by a government minister who takes a lead on the bigger picture. Yet loneliness is a feeling. Engineering a large-scale change in people’s feelings – it’s a hard thing to do. Most people understand that loneliness is neither necessarily felt by people who are alone, nor alien to people who are always with others. The great prophylactic against loneliness is feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself – a family, a friendship group, a community, a benign universe, whatever. Even a community with little in the way of material resources finds some contentment in being in a group of people who are all in it together. Individualism is the opposite of that. It demands that you represent only yourself. It is an atomising philosophy, an ideological machine for creating loneliness, a wrong turn from the progress of humanity that makes people narcissistic and self-absorbed, and therefore isolated. This simplest of equalities – just the feeling that your worth as a human is the same as everyone else’s, no more, no less – is all that is needed. For many, however, such a psychological goal is anathema. Inequality makes people lonely – even at the top. The Cox report mentions social institutions that are becoming a less and less common aspect of people’s daily lives – church, local pub, workplace, social club. Even schools feel like high-pressure environments rather than places where people are nurtured and coaxed through childhood. Even corner shops have changed beyond recognition, more than once in my lifetime. My local shopkeepers, Mike and Reena, have known many of the adults in the community since they were babies. They have seen my kids grow up. The Co-op is a member of the Jo Cox Commission. But this week, four shopfronts down from Mike and Reena, the chain opened a new store. It may well crush them. I’ll shop there myself. It’s easy to know what’s wrong, but hard to resist greater convenience – literally, in the form of a shiny new convenience store with fresh produce. (Hurrah!) The report also mentions the contemporary obsession with gate-keeping, box-ticking, conforming. Just being a human being is no longer a qualification for anything. How can a person be expected to be happy with, and in, themselves when the eternal message is: “Try harder, do better, climb higher, don’t fail”? Failure is judged so harshly. How anyone at all still manages to feel secure in their own company is the real mystery of life today. • Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

This misunderstands the nature of opposition to Trump’s pandering to the alt-right and apparent endorsement of Britain First, which should be opposed not because those groups have fascist connotations, but because they promote segregation and hatred based on skin colour in our world today. There is no comparable impact in Corbyn’s sympathy for Cuba. Corbyn’s Labour attracts support, not because of his views on other governments, past or present, but because people believe he will tackle problems in Britain today, whether underfunding of the NHS, welfare and transport systems, the creeping privatisation of the state, the ongoing failures of austerity or foreign wars of aggression. If Labour’s moderates want to regain control of their party, they would do better to concentrate on presenting a credible vision that engages with these issues than to attempt to smear the current leadership by association with their supposed ideological bedfellows. Ned Harrison Ipswich Psychiatry still too custodial Barbara Ellen reminds us that anorexia is a mental illness and we should treat it properly (Comment, last week), while you report well-justified “alarm at use of force in mental health units” (News, last week). It is greatly to the credit of NHS Digital that figures about restraint are published and it is encouraging that use of face-down restraint has fallen. Overall, though, use of restraint is rising and psychiatry remains too custodial. The rate of involuntary admission in England is more than double that in Ireland. Mental illnesses are real and should be treated properly. With high-quality timely services the proportion of people with mental illness who require involuntary admission and restraint should be tiny. Brendan Kelly Professor of psychiatry Trinity College Dublin A gift from the Greeks In the Lord’s Prayer, the word “temptation” is a straightforward translation of peirasmos, the Greek word used by Matthew and Luke. (“Sorry Francis, but you haven’t got a prayer”, Barbara Ellen, last week). In the Septuagint – the ancient Greek translation of Jewish scripture used by the authors of the New Testament – the same word is used to translate Hebrew that appears to mean “testing” rather than “temptation” (Exodus 17.7). What the pope is questioning therefore is not those who have translated the Lord’s Prayer, but the ancient scholars who translated the Old Testament into Greek – and the gospel writers themselves. Peter McKenna Liverpool Jerusalem’s role is vital In making his case against the American decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Raja Shehadeh (Comment, last week) lists a set of grievances. It is worth highlighting two crucial facts that he omits: 1. Since Jerusalem was reunited in 1967, religious freedom has been rigorously maintained, with all the sacred sites staunchly protected. These protections are enshrined in law and ensured in practice, with each faith administering their respective holy places: Muslim sites are overseen by the Islamic Waqf, Christian sites by their respective churches, and the Jewish sites by the Rabbinate. 2. When asked their opinion, Jerusalem’s Arab population – who make up approximately one third of the city – have consistently expressed a preference for Israeli citizenship over that of a future Palestinian state. Freedom of worship and the protection of holy sites is undoubtedly one reason among many behind this. Shehadeh would do well to remember that in a volatile and violent Middle East, where religious minorities have been forced to flee and holy sites have been desecrated – including in the Palestinian Territories – Israel’s capital stands out as a shining example of diversity and pluralism. Mark Regev Israeli ambassador to the UK London W8 No rowing back now Congratulations, Bradley Wiggins. There is nothing quite like a celebrity to take indoor rowing from comparative obscurity to national prominence. To me, he was just another performer with the expectations and anxieties of being in his first indoor rowing race… and the inevitable disappointments that result. (I suspect, like me at the end of my first race, he left immediately afterwards because he was personally embarrassed with his performance.) The delight shown in his comparative failure is typical of the British. We just love the people we set up as heroes to subsequently fall from grace, providing us with a satisfying opportunity to make snide remarks about them. Keep on racing, Bradley.
