Prince’s recording went unreleased, the Family’s version became a barely heard album track, but Sinéad O’Connor’s smash 1990 reimagining let the world hear what is now acknowledged as one of Prince’s greatest songs. Today, as Prince’s more electronic, rockier original is finally made public, Peterson – who has been married to Julie for 28 years – is back in his mother’s house. He has just listened to the recording he last heard in 1984 and admits: “I’m freaking out here, man.” Prince’s sound engineer, Susan Rogers, goes back further: she witnessed Nothing Compares 2 U’s birth. In summer 1984, Prince was working in the Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse – his huge rehearsal space before creating Paisley Park – and was on “a creative roll, cranking out a song a day”. He was also in a relationship with the Family’s Susannah Melvoin (who can be heard on backing vocals, alongside St Paul, on Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U). “It was clear that she was becoming more important than the other girls he’d dated,” Rogers says. “Simultaneously, his young housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, had to leave suddenly to be with her family because her father died of a heart attack. Sandy ran Prince’s life. He kept asking, ‘When’s Sandy coming back?’” One day, he went into a room with a notebook and, within an hour, emerged with the lyrics to Nothing Compares 2 U. Rogers, who witnessed many such bursts of creativity, remembers, “The song came out like a sneeze.” As usual, she rolled the tapes as Prince laid down instrument after instrument, mixing and overdubbing in the same session (Eric Leeds overdubbed the sax part three days later). Rogers felt the finished song was “exceptional, in his Top 10”, but has a compelling theory about why Prince didn’t release the song under his own name (a live duet with Rosie Gaines appeared years later, on the 1993 compilation, The Hits/The B-Sides). “He wasn’t living with anyone, but he was a young man writing about domesticity. The line ‘all the flowers that you planted in my back yard went out and died’… it would have been Sandy who planted those flowers. ‘And I know that living with me baby is sometimes hard, but I’m willing to give it another try…’ There was no romantic relationship with Sandy. It’s not a pained ‘Help me, baby’ track. It’s: ‘You’re gone and I miss you,’ which is probably why he felt comfortable giving the song away to the Family. He released his material based on what he wanted us to know about him and, wonderful as it is, he didn’t want it to represent him.” Rogers argues that in setting up his own label, Paisley Park, Prince had “bitten off more than he could chew” and was too busy running his own career to properly promote the Family, who he had signed. So when Peterson heard O’Connor’s version – and saw the famous tearful video on MTV – he first thought, “That should have been me,” but later loved it and told Prince he was pleased that [Prince would] get lots of money from her recording. “He went: ‘Money?! It’s not about money!’ He told me he didn’t like it [O’Connor’s version]. Unless he asked them, he didn’t like anyone covering his songs.” “Prince was the most courageous person I ever met,” Rogers explains. “He realised he had to socially handicap himself to be the artist he wanted to be, and that to do that without being an asshole he had to be a complete enigma. My gut feeling is that everything he recorded should be released, so that people can understand where he came from and keep his memory alive.” • Nothing Compares 2 U is available as a stream and digital single. A 7in picture disc is exclusively available via the Prince official store. A black vinyl 7in is out on 25 May. The Family now tour and record as fDeluxe, and appear at the annual Paisley Park celebration in Minneapolis, which runs until 22 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/19/registering-eu-citizens-uk-needs-proper-strategy-migration-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T12:52:05Z","webTitle":"UK urged to launch EU citizen registration drive in pubs and schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/19/registering-eu-citizens-uk-needs-proper-strategy-migration-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/19/registering-eu-citizens-uk-needs-proper-strategy-migration-policy","fields":{"headline":"UK urged to launch EU citizen registration drive in pubs and schools","bodyText":"The government needs to be far more ambitious in its plans to register the estimated 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, with outreach programmes in pubs, schools, hospitals and libraries, a thinktank report has said. The Migration Policy Institute Europe recommended “outreach strategies” such as updating official guidance, but also allowing Britons in Europe and EU citizens in the UK to register to stay in “a range of accessible and familiar settings” which are less intimidating than official forms. Without proper handling there could be a large “unauthorised population of Britons left without legal status” after Brexit, it said, warning that this could also encourage fraud. It raised particular concern for Britons settled in the EU, noting that while Theresa May has been “forced to show her hand” and come up with a post-Brexit plan for EU citizens, this is not the case in other member states. “Many EU countries have yet to begin planning for issues likely to affect their UK nationals after Brexit, with officials interviewed in a number of member states reporting they are unsure of whose remit these Britons will fall under,” the report said. The report comes as the EU raised fresh concerns about the treatment of its nationals after Brexit. The European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said MEPs would be vigilant about the rights of EU citizens after Brexit, following a growing row about threatened deportations of people who moved to Britain from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s. The Brussels-based MPI recommends that governments should consider working with leading behavioural insight specialists to develop innovative ways of increasing registrations. It says member states need to make sure they are not disqualifying people who are eligible to remain in the company of their choice, by forcing them to document their history in the country. “Retrospective requirements in which applicants are asked to track down documents to prove their work, residence or family status in the past, could lead to large-scale denials.” As EU citizens who migrate start the clock on their permanent residency rights just three months after their move, it suggests that current documents would be enough to demonstrate eligibility. The Home Office has said it will reveal more details about its registration system in the summer, but has promised “a new, streamlined, user-friendly scheme for EU citizens”. It has also said it is “committed to ensuring that applications will not be refused on minor technicalities and that caseworkers processing applications will exercise discretion in favour of the applicant where appropriate”. A DExEU spokesperson said: “We are engaging with Member States across the EU to ensure citizens in the EU and the UK are prepared for our exit. “We are actively holding outreach events with citizens both here in the UK and in the EU to explain the actions they need to take and to raise awareness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/29/okkervil-river-in-the-rainbow-rain-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:59:37Z","webTitle":"Okkervil River: In the Rainbow Rain review – surgery meets soft rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/29/okkervil-river-in-the-rainbow-rain-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/29/okkervil-river-in-the-rainbow-rain-review","fields":{"headline":"Okkervil River: In the Rainbow Rain review – surgery meets soft rock","bodyText":"Perhaps because of a perceived lack of glamour, tracheotomies have never featured prominently in song lyrics. Okkervil River’s ninth album seeks to address that historical oversight. Famous Tracheotomies poignantly recounts how singer Will Sheff underwent the procedure as a consequence of a near-death experience when he was one – “I was my parents’ only kid and they had lost two before that” – before he details how Gary Coleman, Mary Wells and Dylan Thomas had the same operation, all set against a backdrop of lushly orchestrated soft rock. Sheff finally gets to the 13-year-old Ray Davies, explaining how the experience would later inspire Waterloo Sunset, before its refrain is picked out on a synth. It’s a compelling and moving opener to In the Rainbow Rain, but nothing else here scales the same heights. In places, the sombre mood and muted instrumentation of 2016’s Away have been superseded by sly humour (on Don’t Move Back to LA) or more upbeat arrangements, the likes of The Dream and the Light channelling Arcade Fire’s passion without getting bogged down in their bombast.

If I could, I’d do the same","bodyText":"Remember when we all lambasted Jay-Z for partying at his club 40/40 in New York just 12 days after his daughter Blue Ivy was born? Remember when we criticised David Beckham for going surfing a month after his daughter Harper Seven was born? No, me neither. You don’t have to have a womb to notice that the media moral crime of “leaving your children at home” is committed, almost exclusively, by mothers. Fathers, particularly famous fathers – the sorts of fathers who travel the world, go to nightclubs, watch sport, drink in bars, surf, play golf, go to strip clubs, dance at festivals, eat in restaurants – are rarely if ever criticised for “leaving their children at home” in order to pursue their personal pleasure. But if a mother, let’s just say here for the sake of argument a mother who makes her living from being in the public eye, goes out in public without her baby a few months after pushing her offspring into the world? Then she, of course, is branded horrible, terrible, unfit, shameful. Last weekend, Kylie Jenner was labelled a “horrible mother” on social media after going to Coachella for the weekend two months after the birth of her daughter, Stormi. The fact that Stormi’s father, Travis Scott, also decided to go to Coachella, rather than stay at home and look after his baby, doesn’t seem to have quite reached the Instagram radar. I mean, why would it? It’s not like a bottle-fed baby can be just as adequately bathed, dressed, soothed, rocked, played with and loved by a father as a mother. Oh wait, no, hold on: they can. They absolutely can. (I assume Jenner is no longer breastfeeding, simply because the titanic effort to express enough breast milk to cover a weekend away would leave most women red-eyed husks. But however she’s feeding her baby is, of course, none of my business, nor anyone else’s.) There is such inherent sexism in describing Jenner as “barely a mom”, and urging the universe to #TakeAwayThatBaby, while utterly ignoring her baby’s father, and the hundreds of fathers that undertake precisely the same behaviour unremarked: going out, pursuing their career, leaving others to look after the baby. Such statements also ignore the specific circumstances of Kylie Jenner’s life; she is a wealthy, 20-year-old woman, living in the public eye; she can probably afford to provide a safe, secure, nurturing childcare environment for a weekend; the rest of her peer group probably aren’t parents and will still be going out and dressing up; she makes money from an existence that circles around social media, social events and social aspiration. You might not like her life, but that doesn’t necessarily make her a bad mother. It’s so hard not to internalise the judgments made against mothers – to let the guilt, the shame and self-loathing slide down into your bones – that part of me genuinely congratulates Jenner for giving all that mum-shaming shit two sweaty fingers in a pink wig. I didn’t go to any festivals when my baby was two months old but that’s because I was a 32-year-old, of modest income, breastfeeding through a particularly snowy British winter. I did, however, go out running. It might not be three days in the heat and dust of Indio, California, but just two and a half weeks after giving birth I strapped my milk-heavy breasts under two sports bras, laced up my trainers and went out for a 45-minute run, leaving my partner to look after the baby. In the following months I went swimming, went to therapy, went for walks, even went to the pub, all without my baby. Each time I had to remind myself: a happy mother makes a happy baby, I am not a medieval aristocrat, this isn’t confinement, child development centres around the loss and rediscovery of the mother, I need to get out. I need to be a woman, not just a mother, just for a moment. And yet, I still felt guilty. Even though I had spent 23 and a quarter of the last 24 hours with my baby at my side, those short windows of non-mothering would lay heavy on my conscience. There would, probably, have been uproar had Jenner chosen to take her daughter with her to a festival. There would have been sniping comments about whatever she chose to wear, whoever she socialised with, however she fed her baby. To be a mother, particularly a mother in the public eye is, alas, to be in a near-constant state of failure; the failure to live up to the specific expectations of strangers on the internet. You can’t win, so is it any surprise that some of those millionaires choose to spend their money on nannies and parties? On pink wigs and makeup? On beer and boats? On having their fun while they can? For many women, particularly the thousands of women bringing up their babies in a government-designed austerity, the need to go out and earn money forces them away from their babies long before they might feel ready. The pressure to provide for a family when your rent, your heating, your home are all just a week’s wages away from being lost entirely makes it impossible to do anything but “leave the baby” with someone else. Do we really think some of those women might not also crave a weekend of dancing, of sunshine, of eating with both hands, sleeping past 6am, not carrying a rucksack full of nappies, forgetting where they put their keys, wearing something that doesn’t smell of vomit on the shoulder? But they can’t, of course, because they can’t afford it. That’s not a question of mothering; it’s a question of capitalism. Which is a very big question indeed. • Nell Frizzell is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/19/four-fingered-kitkat-set-lose-eu-protected-trademark-status","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T12:05:05Z","webTitle":"Choc horror: four-fingered KitKat set to lose protected EU status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/four-fingered-kitkat-set-lose-eu-protected-trademark-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/19/four-fingered-kitkat-set-lose-eu-protected-trademark-status","fields":{"headline":"Choc horror: four-fingered KitKat set to lose protected EU status","bodyText":"The shape of the four-finger KitKat bar is set to lose its EU-wide protected trademark status after the European court of justice was instructed that the chocolate was not well enough known in Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. An appeal by Nestlé, the maker of KitKat, against an earlier ruling should now be thrown out, the court’s advocate general advised judges sitting in the Luxembourg court. The company had only provided evidence that the chocolate was sufficiently well known in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the UK, the advocate general, Melchior Wathelet, said. For the trademark to be valid the KitKat would need to be recognised as distinctive across all the EU’s states, as had been ruled by the general court, the second highest in the EU, in 2016. The decision by the advocate general, whose advice is not binding but is generally followed, means the KitKat shape will now be open to imitation by competitors. It follows a decision by appeal judges in the UK in favour of stripping KitKat of its UK-only trademark on the basis that the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product had “no inherent distinctiveness”. The appeal court heard then that that Nestlé had spent between £3m and £11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010. The legal skirmish in the European court of justice is part of a wider battle between Nestlé and Mondelēz International, previously known as Cadbury Schweppes, which filed the original challenge to the EU trademark in 2007, a year after it had been granted. Nestlé, in turn, is challenging Mondelēz’s British trademark for the shade of purple wrapper on its Cadbury’s Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The EU intellectual property office was said to have erred in law when it granted trademark status to the four-finger shape in 2006. Nestlé has not sought such a status for its two-finger bar. A spokesman for Nestlé said: “We believe his [Wathelet’s] final conclusion is based on incorrect factual findings. Nestlé did submit sufficient evidence to prove acquired distinctiveness of its iconic KitKat four fingers shape to meet the advocate general’s proposed threshold, including in the few countries where evidence was challenged.” Gaining trademark status for shapes has proven to be particularly challenging for companies. In 2016 the Rubik’s Cube lost a decade-long battle to secure trademark protection for its own distinctive character. However, Toblerone, which is owned by Mondelēz, has successfully trademarked its “zigzag prism” shape."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/experience-i-was-trapped-in-a-sewer-for-12-hours","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Experience: I was trapped in a sewer for 12 hours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/experience-i-was-trapped-in-a-sewer-for-12-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/27/experience-i-was-trapped-in-a-sewer-for-12-hours","fields":{"headline":"Experience: I was trapped in a sewer for 12 hours","bodyText":"Earlier this month, I was having a family picnic on Easter Sunday in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, with my auntie and cousins. While the little kids did an Easter egg hunt (I’m 13), me and my three cousins went off to play soccer. After kicking the ball around for a bit, we found an abandoned building on the edge of the park, so we climbed over the fence and started playing tag. I wasn’t looking where I was going when I felt a piece of wood underneath me break, and I fell 25ft into a pipe. I landed into water and it was running pretty fast. It felt like being on a waterslide, but the water smelled nasty, like a toilet. It was dark, so I grabbed my phone from my pocket to use as a flashlight, but the water knocked it out of my hand and I lost it. In those first few moments I panicked – I thought I was going to die. After a few minutes of sliding, I found I could put my hands against the wall of the pipe and stand up. The walls were slimy and cold, the water was up to my knees and the pipe was about 4ft wide. I shouted for help but I could just hear my own voice echoing back to me and the sound of rushing water. I started crying a little because I was so scared. I was in the dark, alone, thinking, “Where am I?” and, “Will I ever get to see my family again?” I kept seeing the face of my little sister, who is 18 months old, and my Mom, who’s pregnant. I wondered if I’d ever get to meet my baby brother. I thought about trying to carry on walking through the pipe to find a way out, but it looked scary so I decided it was better to stay put and hope that someone would find me. I was praying to God, “Please, please get me out of here safe.” We pray a lot at home, but that day I was really praying. Not too long after that, I heard helicopters and I knew people were looking for me. I started relaxing and thinking I was OK, I was going to be rescued. But when nobody came after what felt like hours, I went back to thinking I was going to die. I wasn’t really hungry or thirsty or tired, I just knew I had to wait. Over 12 hours after I’d first fallen in – around 5am – I saw a light above me and I heard someone shout, “Here’s the kid!” I started calling for help, and a rope got lowered down with a platform at the bottom of it, so I just held on and they pulled me out through a manhole. I felt disoriented when I came to the surface. I was by a freeway with all these flashing lights. They gave me a phone and I called my mom. I said, “Mom, I’m good. Where you at? You need to come pick me up.” She was crying and saying, “Oh my God, where are you?” over and over again. The firefighters took my T-shirt off, hosed me down and wrapped me in a plastic sheet. Someone gave me a Gatorade, but I only drank a little bit because I don’t really like it and I didn’t feel thirsty. At the hospital I took a hot shower and they gave me a change of clothes and put me on an IV drip. After a couple of hours the doctor told me I was fine – I just had grazes on my knees and knuckles from the fall – and my mom and stepdad took me home. All my family were waiting for me, and I hugged them and went to sleep for a few hours. When I woke up, there were news reporters outside waiting to interview me, which was weird. I found out that when I fell into the pipe my cousins ran back to my family and the adults phoned 911, but it took a long time to find me because I’d travelled about a mile from where I fell. They’d sent cameras down to look for me. They only found me because a camera picked up my handprints in a pipe. Over 100 people were involved in the search, so I felt bad I’d caused all that drama, but happy that they hadn’t given up on me. I heard there were toxic gases down there, so I was lucky. Three days later, I went back to school – I just wanted to get back to normal. Everyone in my class was asking if I was OK. Sometimes in my mind I go back to the moment when I fell and think about what would have happened if they had never found me. Thank God I got another chance. • As told to Kate Wills.

Seventy artists – including several stars of the country’s emerging art scene – clubbed together and 168 pictures were sent to the UK for exhibition and sale. “As artists,” they wrote, “this was the best way we could find to express to the English our admiration and solidarity.” Britain’s ambassador in Rio de Janeiro wrote to foreign secretary Anthony Eden, asking for £25 to cover transport costs, pointing out that the Brazilians had framed the paintings themselves so “that we should be spared the difficulties [of doing so] in wartime”. The pictures were duly shipped, but it took some high-level arm-twisting to persuade the Royal Academy to exhibit them. “It is amusing to read that the RA turned us down on the grounds that they didn’t like the pictures!” wrote one exasperated British Council staffer. “Neither do we: but that was not the point.” The show finally opened in November 1944, and went on to tour the country – though not without some eye-popping condescension, even from the critic who wrote the catalogue prologue. Sacheverell Sitwell drew parallels between Villa-Lobos, “who has written too much music”, and Diego Rivera, “who has over-painted”. He loftily concluded: “The progress of painting has been fast on this prolific soil, so fast that we may hope it will become slower and more serious.” So blinkered was the British art establishment about the potential value of any of the works that all but 25 of them left the country. Those that remained were doled out to 20 galleries around the UK, from Glasgow to Plymouth. They have had a sad afterlife, languishing unseen in storage – until this month, when a feat of sleuthing by an energetic Brazilian Embassy cultural attache has reunited all but one for an exhibition, The Art of Diplomacy, in London. This reminder of a time when Europeans had no idea what to make of Latin American art comes just as Brazil’s artists appear to be in higher demand internationally than ever. London alone will be showcasing three of them this summer, with Beatriz Milhazes at White Cube Bermondsey, Luiz Zerbini at the South London Gallery and Paulo Bruscky at the Richard Saltoun Gallery. Zerbini and Bruscky are making their UK solo debuts, as are the collective OPAVIVARÁ! who will invite visitors to sip herbal tea and swing in a giant rainbow hammock at Tate Liverpool. Meanwhile, Cinthia Marcelle – whose installation The Family in Disorder is at Modern Art Oxford – offsets OPAPIVARÁ!’s politics of community with a vision of order and chaos: humble building materials such as bricks, planks and paper are neatly stacked in one room and exploded in another, as if they were destroyed by riots or bulldozed by city planners. In the US, New York’s Whitney Museum recently staged a major touring retrospective of the neo-concretist Hélio Oiticica, while the city’s Museum of Modern Art has just opened a retrospective of Tarsila do Amaral, one of the 14 female artists who – unnoticed by Sitwell – contributed to the 1944 exhibition. So what’s so special about Brazilian art and why did it take the old world so long to recognise it? Tarsila, as she is affectionately called, was a member of the influential Grupo dos Cinco, a close-knit circle of five artists and writers who, as far back as the 1920s, had been making a case for a uniquely Brazilian modernism. “I feel myself ever more Brazilian,” she wrote to her family in 1923 from her base in France. “I want to be the painter of my country. Don’t think that this tendency is viewed negatively here. On the contrary. What they want is that each one brings the contribution of his own country … Paris has had enough of Parisian art.” But the Cinco were ahead of their time. As art historian Michael Asbury writes in The Art of Diplomacy catalogue, it would take decades for Brazil to be recognised as a major player: “The idea of exhibiting modernist works from outside the main economic and cultural centres would have been considered […] an exercise in showcasing derivative modern art.” The 1944 show came at a turning point for Brazilian art. The country was about to make a visionary investment in its cultural heritage, as RA curator Adrian Locke points out. Between 1947 and 1948 – when much of the world was exhausted by the second world war – Brazil opened three major galleries, one in Rio and two in São Paulo. In 1951, it took the audacious step of founding the world’s second biennale, which set out to rival Venice. Brâncuși, Picasso and Jackson Pollock were among the artists featured in the first two editions of the Bienal de São Paulo. The respect was slow to be reciprocated. Dawn Ades – who curated a landmark exhibition, Art in Latin America, at London’s Hayward in 1989 – tracks the turning point in the UK to two decades earlier, in 1969, when the Whitechapel featured an installation by Hélio Oiticica that has become a benchmark. Tropicália, a scaled-down version of which went on display at Tate Modern last autumn, aimed to evoke the higgledy-piggledy homes of Rio’s favelas, complete with tropical foliage and live parrots. “It was proto-performance art as well as this most wonderful construction,” says Ades. Oiticica, who died in 1980 at the age of 42, was “fascinating because, on one level, he was completely international, but he thought of himself as having Brazilian roots.” Guardian critic Adrian Searle noted as far back as 2007 that Tate Modern had been buying Oiticica’s work, revealing the increasing influence of a group that also included his friends and associates Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape. “Theirs was a modernism freed from northern, protestant restraint, and an art that strove to go beyond the gallery and the closed world of the market.” For Ades, the question of what makes Brazilian art so special is itself wrong-headed. She argues against the “irrelevant and dangerous tide of nationalism” that has pervaded the history of art for the last century, citing Cildo Meireles as another example of why its artists should be judged on an international level. His 2001 work Babel – a circular tower made of hundreds of old radios tuned to different stations – was also recently purchased for Tate Modern. On the coincidence of so many Brazilian solo shows in the UK, she says: “It might just be chance or it might be that there’s a very rich ferment going on in the country right now. There’s a real energy, but I certainly wouldn’t put them in a box that says Brazilian art. There’s a great exhibition to be done on the wave that goes from Brazil to Italy – arte povera – art that is on the edge of being an object in the real world.” The 24 pictures in The Art of Diplomacy might not all be world-class art but they contain forewarnings of this coming wave. The most powerful is a sinister oil painting in deep blues and browns of a small girl on a moonlit night, her head at an unnatural angle, as if she might be possessed by the toy she holds aloft on a stick. After the sale, which raised £1,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund, The Scarecrow (The Half-Wit), by artist, ceramicist and poet Cândido Portinari, was donated to Harrogate’s Mercer gallery. A soft-porny landscape of bare-breasted women on a beach was the Tate’s only memento, gifted to the gallery by a Tory MP with more beneficence than taste. Even Cardoso Junior – the retired schoolteacher who painted the work, called They Amuse Themselves – might chuckle at the company he now keeps. • The Art of Diplomacy is at the Embassy of Brazil, London, until 22 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/19/terry-gilliam-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-premiere-close-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T12:55:21Z","webTitle":"Terry Gilliam's Don Quixote film to receive premiere at Cannes after two-decade wait","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/19/terry-gilliam-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-premiere-close-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/19/terry-gilliam-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-premiere-close-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Terry Gilliam's Don Quixote film to receive premiere at Cannes after two-decade wait","bodyText":"Terry Gilliam’s long-awaited The Man Who Killed Don Quixote will receive a world premiere at the Cannes film festival, as the event’s closing film, it has been announced. This is in addition to confirmation of Lars von Trier’s return to the festival after a seven-year ban. The screening of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote comes despite an ongoing court case, arising from a dispute between Gilliam and the film’s former producer Paulo Branco. However, the film-makers recently issued a statement denying that Branco had the power to block the film’s release. Gilliam started work on the film over two decades ago, though a previous attempt to film it (with Johnny Depp in the lead role) in 2000 was abandoned after Depp’s co-star Jean Rochefort became ill. The completed film now stars Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce, and will be released in France on the same day it screens at Cannes. The inclusion of Von Trier’s The House That Jack Built had been all but confirmed by the festival’s artistic director, Thierry Frémaux, in a radio interview on Tuesday, but the former Palme d’Or winner’s new film will not be eligible for the top prize, since it is in the out of competition section. A serial-killer drama set over 12 years, The House That Jack Built stars Matt Dillon, Riley Keough and Bruno Ganz. Frémaux and festival president Pierre Lescure had to convince the festival board to readmit Von Trier, when the director was voted “persona non grata” after making Nazi-related jokes at the 2011 edition. Allegations of sexual harassment against von Trier by Bjork, star of Dancer in the Dark, do not appear to have swayed opinion against him. Two other big-name auteurs are also late additions to the festival line-up. Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the Turkish winner of the Palme d’Or in 2014 with Winter’s Sleep, has been selected for competition with The Wild Pear Tree, about a writer who returns to her father’s village in rural Turkey; Sergei Loznitsa, the Ukrainian director of In the Fog and A Gentle Creature, will open the un certain regard section with Donbass, a new drama about the recent Russian-Ukraine conflict in the region. Cannes has also found room for Ayka, the first film in a decade from Kazakh director Sergey Dvortsevoy (best known for steppe drama Tulpan); Whitney, a new documentary about Whitney Houston by Touching the Void director Kevin Macdonald; the new HBO adaptation of dystopian sci-fi parable Fahrenheit 451 starring Sofia Boutella and Michael B Jordan; and Knife + Heart, directed by Yann Gonzalez, in which Vanessa Paradis plays a gay-porn producer. Meanwhile, the festival selections have triggered some political rows: Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been under house arrest since August 2017 on embezzlement charges, has had his detention period extended until July 2018 in the wake of the inclusion of his new film Leto in the competition line-up, while Taiwan has protested at the festival’s official description of jury member Chang Chen as “Chinese” and demanded it be corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/19/which-decade-was-best-to-live-in-heres-what-we-learned-at-the-movies","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T14:30:08Z","webTitle":"Which decade was best to live in?

Here's what we learned at the movies","bodyText":"You’d live in the 1950s, wouldn’t you? You have seen Grease and Stand By Me and Back to the Future, so you know it was a carefree decade full of dancing and childhood adventure and songs about cars that can somehow bring schoolgirls to orgasm. Even now, 40 years after it was first released, Grease still feels like an escape. For the most part, cinema has been kind to the 50s. The Shawshank Redemption found uplift in suicide and incarceration, M*A*S*H retroactively transformed the Korean War into a goonish cavalcade of knockabout high jinks, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull managed to take the decade’s constant palpable fear of comprehensive nuclear obliteration and leverage it into a vehicle for slapstick fridge jokes. So long as you ignore stuff such as Vera Drake and Badlands and The Last Picture Show, you would totally live in the 1950s. But, using a similar formula, would you want to live in any other recent decade? Let’s find out. 1960s Nope. No. Absolutely not. Sure, it was the decade of free love and the Beatles, but watch almost every post-60s film and you will know what a relentlessly abhorrent decade the 60s was. Gay? A Single Man taught us that you would experience enough loss to give you a fatal heart attack. Mentally unwell? One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest depicted the outright savagery you would encounter. And if you were young enough to be drafted, God help you. Two words: Apocalypse Now. And three more words: Full Metal Jacket, not to mention Platoon or Born on the Fourth of July or Good Morning Vietnam. However, if you still need convincing – and, truly, I am sorry to have to point this out to you – Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was also set in the 1960s. The horror. The horror. 1970s Once again, hard pass. Judging by the films made about them, the 70s were almost comically bleak. Look at Zodiac and Summer of Sam and you’ll see that the entire decade was absolutely riddled with real-life serial killers. Watch Rob Zombie’s one-two of The House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil’s Rejects and you’ll see it was just as full of fictional serial killers. If you lived in the 70s, you were doomed from the outset. The haircuts were bad, the politics were bad and the clothes were bad. Even something as treacly as My Girl was essentially a dire warning that anyone with the temerity to fall in love in the 1970s would end up dead by bees. Avoid. 1980s Hey, now we’re talking. Cinematically the 1980s was the decade of The Wedding Singer, Adventureland and Hot Tub Time Machine; a decade where nothing bad happened and everyone could get rich and goof off like it was the 1950s all over again. Even Fargo and American Psycho (both set in 1987) could shrug off numerous grisly murders with Phil Collins references, because what the hell? It was the 80s! But the haircuts, boy oh boy. What were those guys in Precious and No Country for Old Men thinking? Thank God nobody could tag Anton Chigurh on Facebook back then. 1990s Of course, being more recent than the other decades, there are fewer 90s revivals to choose from. However, Edward Zwick’s Love and Other Drugs, – which is genuinely intolerable to sit through – can’t help but paint the decade poorly. Other 90s movies include I, Tonya and The Informant!, along with some of Straight Outta Compton, some of Notorious, some of One Day and some of the Adam Sandler film Click, none of which do enough to conjure a full picture of what the decade was really like. However, you could argue that cinema doesn’t need to remind you what the 90s were like, because I’m still alive and happy to tell you at length how rubbish they were. Honestly, just ask."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/19/march-retail-sales-fall-slump-demand-petrol-beast-from-the-east","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T12:06:34Z","webTitle":"Snow joke: March retail sales fell 1.2% amid beastly weather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/19/march-retail-sales-fall-slump-demand-petrol-beast-from-the-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/19/march-retail-sales-fall-slump-demand-petrol-beast-from-the-east","fields":{"headline":"Snow joke: March retail sales fell 1.2% amid beastly weather","bodyText":"Retail sales fell steeply in March owing to a slump in petrol sales when the “beast from the east” hit Britain. Volume of sales fell 1.2% in March from February, with petrol sales down 7.4%, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS blamed the slump on the cold spell, when large parts of the UK were brought to a standstill by heavy snow and bitter cold weather. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 0.5%. Sales were down 0.5% between January and March compared with the previous quarter, the worst performance in a year. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, said: “Retail sales fell in the first quarter due to a large decline in March with petrol sales seeing a significant slump as a result of the poor weather keeping many shoppers indoors. However, the snow actually helped boost online spending with department stores in particular seeing growth in their web sales. “Various shops also reported increased spending on gifts in the run-up to Easter and Mother’s Day, which also helped boost online sales.” The department store sector was the only one to enjoy sales growth in March at 0.8%. Online offers for Mother’s Day and Easter led to greater internet sales than usual during the cold wave, the ONS said. Food stores and non-food stores both posted declines of 0.6% last month. Within food stores, supermarket sales fell while specialist food stores such as butchers, bakers, fishmongers and convenience stores posted strong growth as they were easier to get to during the snow. Clothing retailers experienced a 0.7% fall. Sales in household goods stores slipped 0.2% while those in other stores such as jewellers and bookshops dropped 1.8%. The forecasting group EY Item Club said the figures suggested GDP growth slowed to 0.3% at best in the first quarter of this year, and could well have been as low as 0.2%. But it believes this is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in May, even though it comes after inflation weakened to a one-year low of 2.5% in March. Howard Archer, EY Item Club’s chief economic adviser, said: “The monetary policy committee expected the economy to take a hit in the first quarter from the severe weather and sees a bounce back in activity in the second quarter. It is also keen to gradually normalise monetary policy.” Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Sales should rebound in April as people jumped back in their cars and finally started to buy spring clothing.” However, he added: “Households also have adopted a more cautious mindset in recent months, having thrown caution to the wind last year. Savings intentions have increased to their highest level since September 2008, according to GfK’s consumer confidence survey, suggesting that retailers won’t benefit much from the forthcoming modest recovery in real wages. In short, consumers still are not in a position to drive the economy strongly forwards.” Department store group Debenhams reported an 85% slump in pre-tax profits on Thursday, after the “beast from the east” forced the retailer to temporarily shut almost 100 stores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/20/regulator-needs-stronger-powers-to-deal-with-bank-misconduct-choice-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T20:24:11Z","webTitle":"Regulator needs stronger powers to deal with bank misconduct, Choice says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/regulator-needs-stronger-powers-to-deal-with-bank-misconduct-choice-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/20/regulator-needs-stronger-powers-to-deal-with-bank-misconduct-choice-says","fields":{"headline":"Regulator needs stronger powers to deal with bank misconduct, Choice says","bodyText":"The corporate regulator should be given stronger powers, and the ability to impose larger penalties, to help it intervene more quickly when it discovers bank misconduct, the consumer group Choice says. The call comes after another week of shocking revelations from the banking royal commission in which Commonwealth Bank admitted some of its financial advisers have been charging dead clients for financial advice. Earlier in the week, an AMP executive admitted that the company had misled the regulator by saying it had mistakenly charged customers fees for no service, despite it being a deliberate policy. “It’s clear the likes of AMP and CBA feel no compulsion to abide by the law and that’s why the law needs to change and we need to see bigger penalties,” the Choice chief executive, Alan Kirkland, said. “Bank executives have fought tooth-and-nail against changes designed to help Australian consumers like the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) reforms.” The FoFA reforms were introduced by the Gillard Labor government in 2012 in an attempt to clean up the financial services industry. They banned conflicted remuneration structures, including commissions and volume-based payments. They also introduced a duty for financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients and made it harder for financial advisers to charge their clients ongoing automatic fees for financial advice by requiring clients to have to “opt in” at regular intervals. In 2014, under former prime minister Tony Abbott, many elements of the FoFA reforms were watered down including the duty of financial advisers to act in a client’s best interests, as well as the removal of the opt-in obligation for ongoing fee arrangements. Kirkland said latest estimates showed more than 300,000 Australian customers had been ripped off $216m by financial advisers who charged fees for no service. It demonstrated the need for tougher powers for Asic and revisiting the FoFA reforms to get rid of exemptions, he said. “It is time to address the carve-outs and exemptions the banks managed to negotiate when the FoFA legislation was introduced. The ‘grandfathering’ of advice arrangements that predated FoFA means that the system is still riddled with conflicted, commission driven. “While there was a general ban on commissions, conflicted commissions in life insurance are still exempt because it would have hurt the profitability of advice firms.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/01/football-transfer-rumours-max-meyer-for-liverpool-butland-to-wolves","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T07:23:57Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Max Meyer set for Liverpool?

Max Meyer has got the wheels in motion, kicking up a fuss about the Schalke sporting director Christian Heidel, to the point where he has been banished from training. The Bundesliga club’s manager, Domenico Tedesco, is frustrated things have turned sour but one man who is delighted is Jürgen Klopp, who fancies adding him to his Anfield attacking armoury. Better still, the 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer, although they may have to fight off Arsenal to secure his services. Worried a £20m bid for Joe Allen might not reflect Wolves’s true financial clout, they are planning a club-record transfer that really would make the rest of the Premier League sit up and take note. Nuno Espírito Santo – himself a former goalkeeper – is said to have the eyes for Jack Butland, and the club are reportedly ready to splash out the big bucks – £35m to be precise – to land the Stoke City shot-stopper. Top of the bill in manager tittle-tattle is news that Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca is reluctant to show his hand for the Everton job given that he fancies a crack at replacing Arsène Wenger at Arsenal. The first job for any new chief at the Emirates is to tie down Jack Wilshere, with the club open to the idea of bulking out his contract in a bid to stave off Everton and Wolves. In the NorthEast, with Chris Coleman sent packing, Sunderland are hunting high and low for a new man and have come up with the idea that former striker Kevin Phillips would be perfect. The 44-year-old, who scored 116 goals in 210 league games for the now League One club, is currently a coach at Derby. Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola insists Manchester City will make the “right decision” about Joe Hart’s future, with the goalkeeper unlikely to stick around playing second-fiddle at West Ham United.

The settlement, which is subject to approval by the federal court, resolves a class action involving hundreds of claimants, lead by Lex, Cecilia and Agnes Wotton. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The parties have agreed on a $30m settlement for 447 claimants, including interest, applicants’ legal costs and administrative costs, and the delivery of an apology,” said the Queensland attorney general and minister for justice, Yvette D’Ath. “Assuming the court approves the settlement, I know that all parties involved in this settlement hope it will provide some measure of closure and a way forward for the community of Palm Island.” Queensland’s deputy premier and minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships, Jackie Trad, said the government would seek to work with the Palm Island community on a “fitting way” to recognise the apology. “I know that for many Palm Islanders this was an incredibly difficult time in their history. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the community as we move forward together,” she said. The 2004 riots were sparked by the death in custody of Mulrunji Doomadgee, from extensive internal injuries, including a ruptured liver. Lex Wotton was jailed for inciting the riots on Palm Island, during which the home of the arresting officer, Chris Hurley, and the police station were torched. The riots began after a coroner ruled Doomadgee’s death was an accident. It was later revealed a senior officer had given inaccurate information and failed to give relevant information to the coroner. Wotton finished his post-sentence parole period, which restricted him from speaking publicly, in August 2014. He launched the legal action in 2015. In 2016 he told Guardian Australia there were two sides to the story and the public had favoured one. “We don’t say the police are all bad, but it was portrayed in that way in the sense of the Indigenous community uprising,” Wotton said. “It made us out to be not law-abiding citizens and that the police were in the right to do what they did. It took this particular case to turn things around in some sense, I suppose.” Doomadgee had been arrested for public nuisance and locked in a police cell on Palm Island in November 2004. Hurley initially claimed Doomadgee had tripped, but was charged with manslaughter over the death. He was acquitted in 2007. The 2016 ruling by Justice Debbie Mortimer found the treatment of the Palm Island community by police was discriminatory and “an affront to the law”. Mortimer’s ruling determined that officers operated with a sense of impunity and had committed unlawful discrimination in their response to Doomadgee’s death. “The commanding and investigating officers of the QPS [Queensland police service] had no regard for any sense of (justifiable) outrage that might have been generated in some or all of the members of the Palm Island community from the way the investigation team interacted with, and treated, SS [Sr Sgt] Hurley,” she ruled. The police command and its officers would not have had that attitude in a non-Indigenous but otherwise similar community, she said. The unlawful actions included officers failing to treat Hurley as a suspect in Doomadgee’s death and allowing Hurley to continue to work as an officer on Palm Island in the days following the death. It also included the failure of any officer to “communicate effectively with the Palm Island community and defuse tensions within that community” in relation to the death, and the use of emergency response officers to arrest Lex Wotton. Wotton was awarded $220,000 in damages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/01/queensland-farmers-rally-against-laws-to-curb-land-clearing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T02:32:12Z","webTitle":"Queensland farmers rally against laws to curb land clearing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/queensland-farmers-rally-against-laws-to-curb-land-clearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/01/queensland-farmers-rally-against-laws-to-curb-land-clearing","fields":{"headline":"Queensland farmers rally against laws to curb land clearing","bodyText":"The Queensland government is expected to pass new land-clearing laws on Tuesday amid fierce protests by farmers on the steps of the state parliament. The laws are an attempt to rein in soaring clearing rates and restore environmental protections that were scrapped in 2013. The Climate Council estimates bushland more than seven times the size of Brisbane – about 1m hectares – was cleared between 2012 and 2016. About 500 farmers from across the state, wearing green shirts and waving signs that proclaimed them the “true environmentalists”, demonstrated on the grounds that the changes will harm the state’s agricultural sector. They didn’t miss the opportunity to point out that city dwellers’ smashed avocado and soy lattes were, in many cases, products of Queensland farming. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Jacqui Tickell, a cattle farmer, said there were misconceptions about the role of pastoralists in land clearing. “We’re not broadscale clearing,” she said. “We’re just managing the regrowth of trees. If we just leave that there, there will be a huge problem with thickening, no sun will hit the ground, and there will be no grass there, no grass for any of the animals. “We can’t just walk away. We need to fight these laws and let Queensland know that we’re for the environment.” The Palaszczuk government attempted to pass similar laws during its first term, but they were defeated by the crossbench. Labor won a majority at the 2017 election and now has the numbers to pass the reforms. One Nation senator Pauline Hanson, who told News Corp she would oppose land clearing for solar farms if the laws were passed, and Katter’s Australian party MPs attended the rally and joined in chants of “no farmers, no food”. Nationals senator Matt Canavan also told News Corp on Tuesday he would consider challenging the vegetation management laws in the high court, on the basis that they may breach the Racial Discrimination Act by stifling economic development opportunities in Cape York. A parliamentary committee that had been scrutinising the laws earlier this month recommended the government give priority to measures to “better support Aboriginal landowners to realise sustainable agriculture development opportunities”. It is unclear yet whether the bill will be amended as a result of this recommendation. The Queensland Conservation Council says farmers’ concerns are misleading, and challenged claims that tougher laws will affect the productivity of agricultural land. “We have seen periods of both rapidly declining and rapidly rising rates of land clearing in Queensland over the last 20 years, reflecting stronger and then weaker laws,” the council’s head, Tim Seelig, said. “Over this time, agricultural productivity overall has been pretty stable. “There is simply no evidence that stronger land-clearing laws will impact on agricultural productivity, which is actually affected by commodity prices, exchange rates, droughts and weather events. “Of course, land clearing has a devastating impact on wildlife and essential habitats. It affects water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and releases massive volumes of carbon into the atmosphere.” The Wilderness Society said on Tuesday the government needed to close loopholes that remain in the legislation to protect the state’s rivers, not just those in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. The Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, said the government’s consultation and committee report had been farcical. “We saw [the premier] Annastacia Palaszczuk stand up before the committee report was even handed down and say she was going to ram this legislation through the parliament,” Frecklington said. “She’s refusing to listen to these people who are out here today, taking time away from their families and businesses to be here. These laws will hurt farmers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/01/facebook-rolls-out-trial-of-dislike-button-for-downvoting-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T00:45:34Z","webTitle":"Facebook rolls out trial of 'dislike' button for downvoting comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/01/facebook-rolls-out-trial-of-dislike-button-for-downvoting-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/01/facebook-rolls-out-trial-of-dislike-button-for-downvoting-comments","fields":{"headline":"Facebook rolls out trial of 'dislike' button for downvoting comments","bodyText":"Facebook is trialling new technology on some Australian and New Zealand users which allows people to give comments an “up” or “down” vote.

But the quick action to remedy a stuttering start was broadly welcomed and the club’s replacement, equally surprisingly, has worked wonders with a side leaking goals. Arsenal had conceded eight times in three league games before Joe Montemurro’s arrival from Melbourne City and a promising squad with four European Championship winners was quickly falling behind the pack. Since then they have let in eight goals in 12 league games, with an Ellen White hat-trick for Birmingham on Sunday responsible for a hefty chunk of that. They have turned a negative goal difference (-2) into +14, been on a nine-game unbeaten run which included eight clean sheets, won the Continental Cup and fought their way to Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Montemurro has form when it comes to building solidity. The Australian’s Melbourne City side conceded five goals in their 14-match 2015-16 W-League season, scoring 42. They won every game, one on penalties. At the heart of Montemurro’s new defence the 21-year-old Leah Williamson has thrived. Williamson, who made her senior debut for Arsenal in 2014, aged 17, puts the transformation down to the manager getting them to rewind. “Joe came in, he recognised those weaknesses in our play and he just took us back to basics,” she says. “No task is too little when you’re a defender. I think being a footballing team that likes to be on the ball, we were forgetting our defensive responsibilities, or maybe just putting them second to being on the ball. “But obviously in a game of football you’re not on the ball the whole time and he just reminded us that as defenders our sole purpose is to defend. I know that sounds silly but it can be taken for granted sometimes. So he just took us back; basic movements, covering each other, working as a four and just tidying up. Once you strip it all down and go back to basics you realise how easy the changes are to make. And I think that’s how we were able to have such a rapid turnaround.” There is also a fresh focus on pressing and putting themselves in the position to play the possession football they like. “We want to have the ball all the time, so as soon as anybody in the team turns it over we want to win it back as soon as possible and set them on their way again,” Williamson says. “The transition from attack to defence is so dangerous – that’s what other teams in this league are good at. And we recognised that stopping the counter can save you 40 yards of running. It’s about managing the game for 90 minutes; the sooner you win it back the less running you’re doing. Little changes like that make a big difference in the end.” The team’s backs-to-the-wall Continental Cup final victory against the holders, Manchester City, in March, won by Vivianne Miedema’s 33rd-minute goal, slotted through the legs of the goalkeeper, Ellie Roebuck, showed they can dig deep when needed. “It meant a lot to us, that game,” Williamson says. “One game and everyone views you differently. Before that we were a write-off. “Being about to hold on to a 1-0 lead was something that we weren’t capable of before, for whatever reason. So it’s good to get that bit of confidence and then to know that, when we need to stick it out, which is not Arsenal’s style, it’s not what we like to do, we can.” Montemurro’s maiden trophy came during an impressive run of eight clean sheets, which ended with a Fran Kirby goal in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea. “We were really gutted that we let in a goal against Chelsea because we were really proud of that record,” Williamson says. “It shows how your priorities change. Clean sheets go hand in hand with wins and points – there’s no secret there. We know we’ve got the talent to nick a goal.” Saturday’s meeting with Chelsea is a repeat of the 2016 final, which Arsenal won 1-0. Williamson, who received her first England call-up last November, knows where the greatest threat will come from: “Fran Kirby is in unbelievable form – she has been all season. You can see when she doesn’t play, considering she scores a couple a game, they’re lacking. But they’ve been solid too. They’ve got a good defensive record and they haven’t lost a game yet in domestic competitions.” Yet both clubs will be looking to put weekend disappointments behind them. Chelsea have just been humbled by a 5-1 aggregate defeat by Wolfsburg in the Champions League and Arsenal’s 3-0 loss to Birmingham ended any title ambitions they might have held. Arsenal have not beaten Chelsea this season, and after Kirby’s double on the break in Chelsea’s semi-final against Manchester City, Williamson is wary: “We’ve got the talent going forward and the goals are coming from all over. We just need to trust in the process, don’t go searching for a goal and leave ourselves exposed. Chelsea’s second goal against City was one long ball and Fran got on the end of it. We just need to tighten up and reduce those spaces and try and limit that threat.” Talking points • There will not be an English representative in this season’s Champions League final after Lyon beat Manchester City 1-0 and Wolfsburg put two past Chelsea to set up a repeat of the 2012-13 and 2015-16 finals (one win apiece). The former City right-back Lucy Bronze struck a wonderful volley for Lyon, the only goal of the tie. Lyon’s midfielder Camille Abily, who has won 10 league titles and seven French cups, has announced she will retire at the end of the season. If Lyon beat Wolfsburg in Kiev it will be her fifth European title. Second-half goals from Wolfsburg’s Pernille Harder and Ewa Pajor ended any hopes of a Chelsea fightback. • The Switzerland forward Ramona Bachmann has signed a new deal at Chelsea to 2021. Bachmann joined from Wolfsburg in January 2017 and has 10 goals in 33 appearances. • Blackburn Rovers came from behind against Leicester City to win the WPL League Cup. After going a goal down to a Sophie Domingo strike, the captain, Lynda Shepherd, coolly converted a penalty to equalise. Ellie Cook then headed Rovers ahead before Saffron Jordan sealed the 3-1 win in their first final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-committal-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T02:43:06Z","webTitle":"George Pell pleads not guilty to historical sexual offence charges before trial – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-committal-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/may/01/cardinal-george-pell-committal-trial-historical-sexual-offence-charges-live","fields":{"headline":"George Pell pleads not guilty to historical sexual offence charges before trial – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s been a critical day in the Pell case. He was committed to stand trial in the county court on multiple charges involving multiple complainants, but also managed to have many other allegations, including the most serious, thrown out. Pell for the first time entered formal pleas of not guilty to the remaining charges. My colleague Melissa Davey has written a more comprehensive report on today’s judgment. She will continue to follow the case as it progresses towards a trial. What next? We’re still a while away from a trial. But Pell will go to the county court for the first time tomorrow for a directions hearing on the remaining charges. Directions hearings are generally administrative in nature. We’re going to wind down the live blog for now. Thanks for sticking with me, and for your patience as we navigated the legal complexities of live reporting on the committal. Until next time. Cardinal George Pell has left the Melbourne magistrates court after his committal. He was flanked by his lawyer, Robert Richter, QC, and police. Protesters shouted at Pell as he was escorted away. One yelled: “Hip, hip, hooray.” There’s still a crowd outside the Melbourne magistrates court, comprising media, police and protesters. They are all still waiting for Pell to emerge from the court. We can expect more chaotic scenes when he does. While we take a breath, it’s worth rereading this summary of the four-week committal hearing. Much of the evidence was heard in closed court, preventing media access, but the parts that were open were illuminating. Melissa Davey writes: Pell sat each day in courtroom 22 on level five of Melbourne magistrates court in the same seat, head bowed, sometimes taking notes, always dressed in the same outfit; black pants, black shirt and a beige jacket. His friend and director of communications for the Archdiocese of Sydney, Katrina Lee, sat in the court with him most days, one row behind him, one seat to his left. Occasionally, Pell looked up at the witnesses. Apart from being softly asked the occasional question by Richter – who is a progressive atheist – or accepting well wishes from supporters before court began each day, Pell was largely silent. The committal hearing is now closed and court attendees broke into applause once the magistrate, Belinda Wallington, dismissed the court. He has been committed on multiple charges. More than half were thrown out. The trial will first be heard on 2 May at 9am for a directions hearing, which is purely to go over administrative matters. Pell’s plea has been entered as not guilty. The trial will go for many months. Pell’s bail is being set and the court has heard he has agreed he will not leave the country. But Richter says: “There may be an overseas visitor who comes and arrives who the cardinal may see.” Robert Richter QC has told the court he wants it known that the most serious charges against Pell have been thrown out. He has also indicated he may push for separate trials against Pell, given the nature of the remaining charges. Wallington has now finished delivering her judgment. A large number of charges have been thrown out, including the most serious. But roughly a third of the charges against Pell will proceed to trial. He today pleaded not guilty to all of the remaining allegations. That’s the first time Pell has formally entered pleas to the charges. Cardinal George Pell has just been committed to face trial on a batch of charges. The magistrate tells him he can plead not guilty or guilty at any point. Pell tells the court he is not guilty. He has long denied the charges but has now formally entered the pleas. We’ve just received some vision of Pell arriving at court. The cries of protesters are clearly audible as he makes his way into the court building, escorted by police. As Wallington continues to deliver her decision, just a reminder that the complexities of this case make some details difficult to report. Further description of the charges cannot be given for legal reasons. But what we know so far is: Pell will face trial on multiple charges relating to multiple complainants. Many charges against Pell, including the most serious allegations, have been thrown out. The Archdiocese of Melbourne has issued a short statement. It simply says: The Archbishop of Melbourne Denis Hart has declined to make any comment in relation to the decision of the magistrate Belinda Wallington to commit Cardinal Pell to face trial in the county court. Archbishop Hart expressed his confidence in the judicial system in Australia and said that justice must now take its course. The magistrate is still delivering her decision. But my colleague Melissa Davey says the magistrate has indicated that Pell will face trial on multiple charges, from separate complainants. A number of charges against Pell have been withdrawn. We already knew that would occur. We’ve also learned that Wallington has thrown out further charges relating to one complainant. She said it was impossible for the offences to have occurred given that the complainant did not live at St Joseph’s boy’s home during the 12-month period when he said the alleged offences occurred. Another charge based on an allegation by another complainant has also been thrown out. The court hears that Pell is likely to stand trial on at least one charge. But many other charges have been thrown out. If you’re new to this story or need a refresher, I strongly recommend this excellent explainer from Melissa Davey. The piece tells us about the history of the case, its importance, the nature and seniority of Pell’s role in the Vatican, and the broader background of the royal commission. It’s well worth your time. Reporters are not able to tweet from inside the courtroom. It may be some time while the magistrate, Belinda Wallington, delivers her judgment. While we wait, let’s recap what we expect will happen this morning. First and foremost, we will learn whether Cardinal George Pell will face trial on historical child sexual offences. The hearing began in the Melbourne’s magistrates court about 10am, and will run for about an hour-and-a-half. Wallington will use the time to deliver her judgment on the committal, working through four weeks of evidence and submissions from both sides. Much of the evidence was delivered in closed court, as is standard for cases of this type. Pell’s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, used the committal hearing to argue the evidence against his client is uncorroborated and unreliable. Wallington will need to decide whether the evidence against Pell warrants a trial. Guardian Australia’s Melissa Davey is in the courtroom and will bring us updates when she can. The magistrate, Belinda Wallington, has arrived. The proceedings have commenced. A few more shots of Pell’s arrival are emerging. They show a frenzied scene. There are three courtrooms to accommodate the media and public here to witness Belinda Wallington’s decision on whether Cardinal George Pell will stand trial. Dozens of local and international media are present. Pell, the Vatican’s financial controller and third in line to the Pope, walked into the court just before 9.30am and was confronted by protesters both in support and against him. Dozens of police remain outside the magistrates court in Melbourne. If his case goes to trial, it in unclear when such a trial will occur but it would likely go for months. Cardinal George Pell has arrived at the courtroom before the judgment on his committal. The scene was predictably chaotic. A cordon of police held back the waiting press pack, as Pell and his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, made their way into the court building. The case against Pell has attracted a huge contingent of media, interested members of the public and police outside the Melbourne courtroom. It is, of course, to be expected. Pell is the most senior Catholic to be charged with historical child sex offences. Today is no different. Already, there is a significant media and police presence outside the magistrates court. My colleague Melissa Davey is there. Hello and welcome to what is a critical day in the proceedings against Cardinal George Pell. We are returning to the Melbourne magistrates court for a decision on whether Pell will face trial over alleged historical sexual offences The decision comes after a four-week committal hearing, during which Pell’s lawyers sought to punch holes in the prosecution’s case, and prove it was not strong enough to warrant a trial. We’ll be bringing you live updates as they happen from Melbourne. An early note of caution, however. There are legal complexities to this case that may make reporting with speed difficult. Please do bear with us. We’ll do our best to bring you updates on the critical moments in the courtroom as they happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/30/quentin-tarantino-harvey-weinstein-company-owes-royalties","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T21:32:18Z","webTitle":"Quentin Tarantino: Weinstein Company owes me over $4m in royalties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/30/quentin-tarantino-harvey-weinstein-company-owes-royalties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/30/quentin-tarantino-harvey-weinstein-company-owes-royalties","fields":{"headline":"Quentin Tarantino: Weinstein Company owes me over $4m in royalties","bodyText":"Quentin Tarantino has filed court papers to state that he is owed over $4m in royalties from the Weinstein Company. The failed film company is currently taking bids for its assets yet before any sale is made, the film-maker has posted an objection along with a host of other big names, including Jennifer Lawrence and Jake Gyllenhaal. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the director’s lawyer has filed papers referring to “numerous uncured monetary and non-monetary defaults” that he is owed before any sale is made. He is seeking $300,000 for Grindhouse, $575,000 for Inglourious Basterds, $1.25m for Django Unchained and nearly $2.5m for The Hateful Eight. Tarantino’s long-running friendship with Harvey Weinstein was put under the spotlight after the producer was accused of sexual assault and harassment by a long list of women in the past year. “I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard,” he told the New York Times in October last year. “If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.” The film-maker cut ties with Weinstein and moved his next project, the ensemble drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, to Sony. Other stars have also involved their lawyers in the fight for royalties including Gyllenhaal, who is after money from his boxing drama Southpaw alongside co-star Rachel McAdams, as well as Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep for August Osage County. According to Deadline, an unidentified New York-based bidder is putting together an offer that would see the Weinstein Company remain an active studio as well as provide compensation for the women who claim that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/02/madeleine-sackler-film-nan-goldin-opioid-oxycontin-activism","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"Madeleine Sackler's films praised, but she faces scrutiny over opioid-linked wealth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/02/madeleine-sackler-film-nan-goldin-opioid-oxycontin-activism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/02/madeleine-sackler-film-nan-goldin-opioid-oxycontin-activism","fields":{"headline":"Madeleine Sackler's films praised, but she faces scrutiny over opioid-linked wealth","bodyText":"Madeleine Sackler’s debut feature film and accompanying documentary won applause at this year’s Tribeca film festival for their groundbreaking material. Both the feature OG and the documentary It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It were shot with rare access inside a men’s maximum security prison in Indiana, with inmates working as actors on OG and playing key roles in making the documentary. “I wanted to let people walk in their shoes for a moment,” the Emmy-winning director, 35, told the Guardian. “It was really moving for all of us.” Dealing with the scourge of mass incarceration and endless prison sentences, her movies tell the prisoners’ complicated life stories and highlight a system one prisoner described as “a wasteland of human potential”. But Sackler – the granddaughter of one of the Sackler brothers who built Purdue Pharma – has also faced criticism related to her family background. Two branches of the Sackler family control Purdue, which developed and continues to make OxyContin, the narcotic prescription painkiller regarded as the “ground zero” of America’s opioids crisis. Forbes magazine estimates that a core group of 20 Sacklers in these branches of the family are collectively worth $13bn. The celebrated New York art photographer Nan Goldin, who underwent rehab in 2017 for addiction to OxyContin and other opioids and has since become a campaigner against the Sacklers, called Madeleine’s films “reputation-washing”. “She presents herself as a social activist but she has been enriched through the addiction of hundreds of thousands of people,” Goldin told the Guardian. “I lost years of my life to OxyContin and that’s the drug that connects the dots between her family and the raging opioids crisis.” OxyContin was launched in the mid-90s by Purdue Pharma and aggressively marketed as a safe way to treat chronic pain. But it created dependency in many even as prescribed, and the pills were easy to abuse. Mass overprescribing has led to an addiction and overdose catastrophe across the US, more recently rippling out into rising heroin and fentanyl deaths. Madeleine’s late grandfather Raymond Sackler and her late great-uncle Mortimer Sackler built the Sackler-owned company, Purdue Pharma, that invented OxyContin as a new type of controlled-release, morphine-type painkiller and made it a bestseller. Her father, Jonathan, is a director of the Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma. Particulars of ownership and income distribution are not made public and Madeleine chose not to discuss her personal wealth. Sackler was passionate when discussing the criminal justice system, but she became uncomfortable when asked about her connection to the opioids crisis, saying: “I’ve been working more than full-time for the last four and a half years on these two films. That’s been my sole focus.” She did not dispute that she benefits richly from OxyContin profits, but when asked if she had a problem with that, she said: “With what, exactly?” Pressed, she added: “I think it’s an important issue for people to be shedding light on and my heart goes out to people who are impacted by addiction and loss of any sort … I hope that there are very productive conversations that happen around those issues.” She added that she had “never worked at the company or had any influence in it”. Asked if she felt any obligation to respond to the crisis, Sackler repeated: “As I’ve said, I’ve been really focused on the films,” adding: “I mean, I’m hopeful that they are a positive contribution, you know?” Sackler said she did not put her own money into her new films except for income from sales of her previous documentaries, although she did not give details. The issues of criminal justice and addiction intersect: most of the men on screen had dealt drugs and were behind bars for related murders. One inmate said his mother was addicted to prescription painkillers. “I hope there are solutions to the crisis that can be created, that can help address addiction properly with care and compassion,” said Sackler. “There’s a tendency to reduce pain or problems, whether it’s crime or anything else, and not to look at the deeper drivers, so I hope those examinations start to happen and that solutions arise and I always am interested in being a part of solutions, especially when care and compassion is at the heart of them.” Follow-up questions were met with versions of: “That’s all I can say about it,” until she declared: “I have to go,” and the interview ended. Later that day the Guardian had its press invitation to the screening of her documentary withdrawn and a scheduled interview with Kareem “Biggs” Burke, Jay-Z’s record company partner and an executive producer on Sackler’s films, canceled. The Guardian managed to attend the documentary screening anyway. Goldin was in the front row and as the event ended two large security guards approached her and swiftly ushered her out. “They told me not to cause trouble,” said Goldin, who has launched a campaign to shame members of the Sacklers who share in the money from OxyContin, as well as arts and academic institutions that have benefited from their philanthropy. “The Sackler name has become synonymous with the opioids crisis,” she told the Guardian. “I want to ask Madeleine, is that the legacy you want? Why not use your name, money and influence to address the crisis, and take responsibility?” Outside the screening, Burke told the Guardian: “To talk about the criminal justice system like this, she [Sackler] is taking action and trying to change what’s happening in America. That’s what I would focus on, rather than what happens in the family.” Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union and advocacy groups Color of Change and Hudson Link who took part in a panel discussion about Sackler’s film said they were unaware of her controversial wealth and refused to discuss any ethical dilemmas surrounding it. The ACLU and Tribeca film festival declined to comment. Sarah Holtman, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota, said: “If you evaluate this from the perspective of ‘Am I doing the right thing?’ you would say to yourself: ‘Is my judgment tainted by the fact that in my background I think that my family has done some deep wrong from which I have benefited?’” Holtman also suggested possible legal reasons why someone in Sackler’s position might not address her wealth publicly. “But if you are a documentary-maker who wants to expose moral failings, you want to take this issue on in your work, don’t you?” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-amber-rudds-resignation-now-change-the-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T17:19:33Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Amber Rudd’s resignation: now change the policy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-amber-rudds-resignation-now-change-the-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-amber-rudds-resignation-now-change-the-policy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Amber Rudd’s resignation: now change the policy","bodyText":"Amber Rudd had to resign as home secretary on Sunday night for two reasons: first, because she deceived MPs about her own immigration policy and, second, because the Guardian exposed the deception. In the end, her own words brought her down. Ms Rudd denied that she had a target for removing illegal migrants under the “hostile environment” policy. However, this newspaper was then able to show, from internal Home Office documents, that this was untrue. Last week Ms Rudd said she knew nothing about these targets. The documents showed she had a policy target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18 and had told the prime minister in 2017 that she wanted a 10% increase in migrant removals. Once the scale of her misleading answers became clear, she had to go. This was a textbook example of the press holding government to account and a classic illustration of the importance of that effort. But it is not just Ms Rudd who was exposed by it. It was also the policy itself. The wish to expel an arbitrary level of illegal migrants managed to catch hundreds of legal arrivals – notably the Windrush-era migrants who arrived without modern papers – in the net. That should not have happened and it must cease. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, must therefore change the policy as a priority. He made an effective start in the Commons on Monday, with a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to give justice and security to the Windrush cases. But he faces practical obligations too, including a comprehensive support and compensation programme for the Windrush families. He must also end a target culture that may encourage a culture of disbelief among officials. And he must provide a new adjudication system, with checks and balances, for handling cases, in order to reduce injustices. These are large challenges, but they are also a big opportunity to press the reset button. Targets are not wrong in principle. They can be useful tools for measuring the quantity and quality of delivery. But targets must also be fair, credible and should be understood and explained in the public interest. The hostile environment targets were none of these things. They were indiscriminate, unachievable and riddled with too much injustice and fear. Ms Rudd’s approach to them was cynical. She adopted fierce targets because that was the line of least resistance, politically speaking. It allowed her to prove her support for their ultimate author Theresa May, whom she rightly supported against the recklessness of the dogmatic Brexiters. But she also seemed a reluctant believer, unable and unwilling to make the case for them. In the end she was caught out saying one thing to one audience and a different thing to another. She should not have followed the policy in the first place – the public can sometimes be much fairer than politicians imagine – and she should not have blamed her officials when it all went wrong. Ms Rudd is a liberal pro-European Conservative. Her fall has been an object lesson in the perils facing liberal Tories when they allow cheap rightwing rhetoric to outweigh their better and more practical instincts in important areas of public policymaking. The Home Office has increasingly found itself an arena for this dilemma in recent decades. Successive home secretaries of all parties have lapsed into gesture politics and facile toughness rather than thinking calmly, strategically and effectively. They have been encouraged to do this by the tightness of public money in a continuingly low tax age, and by the tendency of political leaders, in the absence of expanding state welfare and spending projects, to try to justify themselves to an anxious public and a febrile press in more authoritarian ways. Yet it simply does not have be this way. Ms Rudd is the fourth member of Mrs May’s post-election cabinet, and its second senior woman, to go in just over 10 months. The wastage rate is high. It indicates the fragility of the cabinet, the government and the Tory party. It does not bode well for the Tories in the local elections. What it says above all, though, is that this government currently lacks the confidence, ability and shrewdness to generate effective and routinely fair policy delivery, making lives better and strengthening social solidarity. That is the larger task that Mr Javid must undertake if he can."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/moorcock-inn-west-yorkshire-head-spinningly-good-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Moorcock Inn, West Yorkshire: ‘Head-spinningly good’ – restaurant review | Jay Rayner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/moorcock-inn-west-yorkshire-head-spinningly-good-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/moorcock-inn-west-yorkshire-head-spinningly-good-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Moorcock Inn, West Yorkshire: ‘Head-spinningly good’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"Moorcock Inn, Moorbottom Lane, Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire HX6 3RP (01422 832 103). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £50-£100 You will soon hear an awful lot about the Moorcock Inn. It will feature on “hot right now” lists. Your annoying friends, the ones who structure weekends away around a single dinner, will start talking frothily about mini-breaks in Halifax. Social media will fill with over-lit, porny shots of intriguing-looking food, plonked in rough-hewn tableware. And for once every single bit of this sweaty, over-heated clamour will be utterly deserved. The new incarnation of the Moorcock, high on the West Yorkshire moors at Sowerby Bridge, is by turns the most self-assured and self-possessed, poised and absurdly wistful launch in years. What in God’s name possessed them, apart from great taste, fearsome cooking skills and a “sod it, let’s do it” attitude? I first heard about it a few weeks back via a greedy friend on my personal Facebook page who lives nearby. Frankly, it was a revelation. I thought Facebook was now only good for personal data capture, the dissemination of fake news and edging us towards World War Three – not great restaurant recommendations. The pub had reopened with little fanfare, my friend said. The changing bar menu included things like trotters on toast, horseradish fritters with rose pickles, and platters of their own charcuterie. At weekends they were roasting whole pigs for Sunday lunch. What’s more, it was all as lip-smackingly, head-spinningly, “spank-me-twice-and-call-me-Alice” good as it sounds. Nobody in the neighbourhood knew anything about the people involved. There was, however, a good reason for this. Australian/British chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor, and Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, spent years together at the highly regarded In De Wulf in Belgium. Before that, they were in Australia. They may be new to the nuanced business of running a British pub, but feeding people well is something they know all about. At first it doesn’t look promising. A white-knuckle drive up vertiginous lanes leads to a monolith of a pub built against the elements. (During the Beast from the East, no car could get within half a mile.) You enter round the back, where firewood is stacked high and a massive charcoal grill sends smoke pirouetting into the evening sky. Inside all is raw wood and beam. To one side is the restaurant space; to the other, the bar still occupied by the locals, who can’t stop themselves telling you just how bloody delighted they are that this pub has happened to them. There are two spaces and two menus: a restaurant “tasting” job of nine parts, which is cracking value at £35, and a pub menu with dishes from £3 to £7. As ever, we are committed to our labours – we sit in the bar and work our way through both. From the pub menu a venison Scotch egg is a shamelessly crisp boulder of a thing, with a runny yolk and an intense gamey overcoat. A plate of their charcuterie is a flag waver for the kitchen’s interest in aromatics. Gossamer-thin slices of pork shoulder, with a ribbon of translucent fat, are served the right side of room temperature, lifted by the grassy waft of chamomile. There are slices of pork neck with the push of juniper and strips of pancetta, the saltiness of which has been soothed by a treacle cure. Alongside are hunks of their own sourdough, with a crisp, dark crust and an equally treacly crumb to be smeared heavily with their salty cultured butter. Cream gives way to the cheesy tang of light fermentation. That bread comes in handy with the pork rillettes, spun through with smoked bone marrow. This makes it sound like balls-out macho food, but it really isn’t. For here are pearly fillets of hot smoked Torbay sole, with bright slices of pickled apple on one side and tangles of pickled onion on the other. Carrots, the colour of a moors sunset, are smoked and dressed with sunflower seeds, and a sweet-bitter porter glaze. Best of all are spring greens, given only a few moments in a hot pan, with what’s described as a pork and seafood sauce, but which Alisdair, who delivers all the dishes, says is closer to a Chinese XO sauce. It is a grand hit of umami. Potatoes have been long-smoked over that fire outside, until split, sweet and saggy, then dropped into the deep-fat fryer to crisp. Only someone with a grown-up appetite would do such an outrageous thing. The restaurant menu isn’t much more refined. It’s just about the creation of an order. There is the revelation of raw mackerel that has been “aged”, like beef, for three weeks, to become deep, dense and intense, served with the bitter hit of brassicas. Stumps of young leek have been braised in butter, then dressed with new-season garlic, pickled plum and the intense savouriness of miso. White and brown crab meat from Whitby is bound in the crisp green of fresh spinach and ground elder leaves. A dish called “dock pudding”, made with the soft bite of braised pearl barley, uses young dock leaves and then lifts them with the addition of an oyster cream. There is nothing overwrought about any of this. Each is just a couple of thoughtful ideas working together. There is only one meat dish: hogget, held over the grill until soft and pink and outrageously smoky, with a sweet, piquant ground-ivy jelly. After that we are given a pot of tea made with wild mint, gooseberry and birch leaf. I expect a subtle infusion. Instead it is sweet and sour, powerful and completely soothing. We finish with a “rowan shoot” ice cream, smothered with a berry compote. I have no idea what rowan shoots are meant to taste like, but this is fragrant and earthy, like the waft of the best perfume caught on the air. Finally, in a nod to locale, there is punchy ginger parkin with honeycomb. I suppose I could moan about the all-natural wine list, but Aimee recognises the need for something that doesn’t taste like it’s been filtered through a porcine duodenum.

As a very well established lighting designer designing tours for acts such as Beyoncé, Sam Smith, Take That, ELO and many more, the news of this regulation is terrifying. Pretty much every single tool that we use as lighting designers will be rendered obsolete by these rules – incredible, as over the recent past as an industry we have adopted the latest in energy-saving LED technology and a lot of tours are totally LED. However, as we use bright sources compared with domestic, this equipment is not efficient enough for the European Union. Brexit will not save us from this edict, as it will be well adopted before we leave and even if we were to avoid it, all of Britain’s amazing cultural exports would be very dark once they tour to the continent. Lighting in shows helps to convey emotion, drama and energy and while the artist is always at the centre of what we do, performing in the O2 in the stark light of the cleaners’ work lights will not quite offer audiences the same exciting experience. If you multiply the ban out to how enormous the effects of it could be, pretty much every lighting source for television and broadcast will also be dead in the water, leading to a need for new genres of television such as shows like Strictly Come Dancing In The Dark.

All month long, it will be turned into a politically charged nightclub. “Clubbing has always been political,” said Collins. “The vogue scene, LGBT clubs, gay and lesbian clubs – they are definitions of freedom.” But it’s not only a space to dance, but one to foster a debate around America’s prison system. “Switch on the TV and see endless reports on the legal system, police brutality and lawyers, trials, which is our main focus in pop entertainment,” said Collins. “It is represented as a violent, sensationalized [issue] in Hollywood, but prison is a very broken space.” According to a 2016 report from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, America has the largest prison population in the world with 1.5 million inmates behind bars. It isn’t cheap, either, as the country’s spending on prisons has tripled since 1980. To help those in need, Collins is releasing a benefit album, which features classic house covers recorded by former convicts alongside New York’s underground musicians. All proceeds are going to Critical Resistance, a New York group advocating for jail prevention. House music surfaced in the early 1980s in Chicago, Detroit and New York and was the voice of black, often queer, working-class musicians who paired drum machine, sampler and synth-made beats with soulful, empowering lyrics on love, individuality and community. This project honors Bring Down the Walls, an often overlooked 1986 album and namesake song by Chicago record producer Larry Heard and musician Robert Owens. “It’s one of the greatest house records ever, it totally changed my life,” said Collins. “It brings everything together for the whole project.” The song was written on toilet paper by Owens while he was working in the shipping and receiving department at Evanston hospital in Chicago; it quickly became the voice of the underground, marking the beginning of house music. Collins draws a parallel between the growing popularity of house music and the rise of prison intake. “This notion of cash bail, detention, sentencing and parole are all targeted towards rolling back civil rights gains,” he said. “While the 1980s criminalized people and locked them up, queer and black musicians changed everything in emancipatory ways that built bridges between class, gender, sexuality and race.” To Collins, there is a strong correlation between the two, more so than most realize. “These two things go hand in hand,” he said. “The body is locked up and punished, but house music is a place of transformation in a place of oppression; their spirit is free.” House music did make its way to the top of the charts in the 1990s, but many underground classics are overlooked, which is why he wanted to make an album of cover songs. “They’re still marginalized when they’re so vividly important,” said Collins. The album features house icons like Heard and Owens, “my two biggest heroes”, said Collins, alongside cameos from Kyp Malone from the TV on the Radio, R&amp;B vocalist Ian Isiah and MikeQ, a DJ in the queer ballroom subculture who is hosting a House of Vogue party on 12 May. The firehouse will also feature talks and workshops hosted by Black and Pink, an organization of LGBT prisoners, and Baz Dreisinger, author of Incarceration Nations. “There is a point and a profit in locking people away – and choosing who is locked away subverts race and ethnicity, so what does it mean to be trans or queer in prison?” asks Collins. “There are so many things that still remain invisible to us.” Bring Down the Walls begins on 5 May at Firehouse, Engine Company 31 in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/30/time-for-a-better-definition-of-job","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T17:20:51Z","webTitle":"Time for a better definition of job | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/time-for-a-better-definition-of-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/30/time-for-a-better-definition-of-job","fields":{"headline":"Time for a better definition of job","bodyText":"Isn’t it about time the media stopped giving out misleading employment figures (Opinion, 30 April)?

He knew he had inherited a win that with three laps to go was looking like a third place and a further deficit to Sebastian Vettel in the world championship. He came out of it on top and rightly did not opt to celebrate as he might have were it a harder won victory. He is four points ahead of Vettel but made it clear that relying on good fortune would not be enough in what is shaping up to be a highly contested season. The reality, Hamilton knows, is that with the exception of Melbourne, Mercedes have been unable to match Ferrari. The issue of unlocking performance from the car by working the tyres at the correct temperature is key and as things stand Ferrari do not face the same problem. How Mercedes fare at the next round in Barcelona, in a European climate similar to that we are likely to see at many summer meetings, will be telling. If they struggle at the Circuit de Catalunya it may be that far from last year’s diva, this year they have created a monster. Red Bull’s dilemma The stewards found both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen at fault for the accident that caused the crucial safety car in Azerbaijan. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, in public at least, said he held both drivers responsible and that both would be required to go to the factory in Milton Keynes and apologise to the workforce. Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko also blamed them both. “We let the drivers race and then they are doing that. Unbelievable. Both were wrong,” he said. Verstappen’s ill-advised moves against Hamilton and Vettel already this season have put him under more scrutiny than most but it is hard to ignore that moving as he did in Baku is always increasing the likelihood of contact. Red Bull do let their drivers race and until that moment it had been hugely entertaining. They insist they will continue to do so. It has proved costly but absolutely gripping for the sport. Let’s hope they stick to it. Leclerc delivers Azerbaijan is becoming a race of some import for the Monégasque rookie Charles Leclerc. Last year in Baku on his way to the F2 title, he won here just three days after the death of his father. An emotional weekend in which he wanted to deliver in his father’s honour. He repeated the feat this weekend. His sixth place in the Sauber was a magnificent drive and absolute confirmation of the exceptional promise he has previously displayed. The 20-year-old’s opening race weekends have been patchy at best as he comes to terms with an F1 car and his team do the same with a design that is completely new, conceptually brave and still in the process of being understood. However, on Sunday Leclerc looked absolutely in the groove, controlled, fluent and unafraid to attack. He described his first F1 points-scoring result as feeling like a win and with a few more performances like this Ferrari may consider promoting him to the Scuderia sooner rather than later. Vettel too hot Vettel was insistent that he “had to try” his attempt to pass Bottas on the restart and from a psychological perspective, it is likely a claim as much to reassure himself as anyone else. But the move, which ultimately cost him an almost certain second place and potentially a win, could have been given greater consideration. There were three laps to go at that point, time still to close on Bottas and plan the overtake. Moreover, out of the pressure cooker of the restart he would likely have been able to take a calmer approach to it. Certainly Hamilton was harrying him on the restart but he could have gone defensive. Instead he committed to the attempt, did so clumsily and failed to pull it off. There were shades of the costly start in Singapore here, the bigger picture lost in a moment. Last season those moments were ultimately crucial in the championship; he cannot afford to repeat them. Pérez makes history Sergio Pérez’s third place was the culmination of a quite superb race. He had been hit by the Williams of Sergey Sirotkin on lap one, which pushed him into Kimi Räikkönen, breaking his front wing and requiring an immediate pit stop. He then took a five-second penalty at his second stop for a safety car line infringement. Yet he came back with remarkable resolve. Finally finding himself behind Vettel when the German flat-spotted his tyre on the final restart, Pérez spotted his chance and went for it, taking fourth. But he then had to hold the place – a huge task as Vettel came back at him. He did so brilliantly. “I had to give it everything in the last two laps,” he said. “My pace was unbelievable and I think they were the best two laps of my life.” His eighth podium is a new Mexican record, one more than Pedro Rodríguez scored with second place at the 1971 Dutch GP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T18:35:57Z","webTitle":"Sainsbury's chief sings 'We're in the Money' after Asda merger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-mike-coupe-sings-were-in-the-money-itv-asda-merger","fields":{"headline":"Sainsbury's chief sings 'We're in the Money' after Asda merger","bodyText":"The chief executive of Sainsbury’s has been filmed singing “We’re in the Money” on the same day he announced a blockbuster merger with Asda.

The announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which bought HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed in 2017 for committing the fraud, which centred on the Reading branch of the bank. It was described by the judge as an “utterly corrupt scheme” that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. The scam took place between 2003 and 2008 and involved a former HBOS employee, Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses. He was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans on to struggling companies and refer them to Mills’s business. Many of the firms went bankrupt and some of the owners lost their homes. However, while the jail sentences handed down totalled more than 47 years, controversy over the case has continued to rumble on. The NCA said it would lead a pre-investigative evidential review into allegations of fraud concerning the HBOS branch in response to a request from Thames Valley police. It added that the review, which is set to take six months, would look at allegations that fell outside the scope of the original police investigation. The NCA said a number of companies had reported allegations of significant fraud, and that “these include allegations of asset-stripping through the use of corrupt consultants as well as allegations of fraud and money laundering. The sums of money involved could be significant, running to many millions.” Lloyds had denied there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted, but in September 2017, the police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley police claimed HBOS must have known of the fraudulent activities inside its Reading branch as long ago as February 2008. Lloyds said it “welcomes” the enquiry and would fully assist the NCA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/30/tories-flounder-in-attempt-to-launch-operation-save-theresa","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T17:25:01Z","webTitle":"Tories flounder in attempt to launch Operation Save Theresa | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/30/tories-flounder-in-attempt-to-launch-operation-save-theresa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/30/tories-flounder-in-attempt-to-launch-operation-save-theresa","fields":{"headline":"Tories flounder in attempt to launch Operation Save Theresa","bodyText":"With Operation Save Amber finally derailed after two weeks of fire-fighting the former home secretary’s failing memory – by the weekend she couldn’t even remember what targets she was meant to have forgotten – the Tory party’s attention turned to Operation Save Face. Aka Operation Save Theresa. With Amber Rudd out of a job, the prime minister has been left with no one else to take the blame for her hostile environment policy that caused the Windrush scandal. First out of the blocks on Radio 4’s Today programme was the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a zen master of never saying anything interesting. It took a while for Green to even admit that Rudd had been forced to resign and even then he restricted himself to a laconic: “She had to go.” Which made one wonder why he and so many other Conservatives had spent the previous week saying she had to stay. Next on the airwaves was Chris Grayling, which showed how much of a panic the government was in. The transport secretary is just about the only minister who makes David Davis look quick-witted and is the last person who should be sent out in a crisis. Sure enough, Grayling self-destructed in 10 seconds. After demonstrating he had no grasp of the situation by insisting a fourth cabinet resignation within six months was merely “unwanted noise”, he went on to say that May wouldn’t have known about the targets letter Rudd had sent her in 2017. After all, if the home secretary couldn’t remember writing the letter, then why on earth should the prime minister be expected to recall having read it? Over in Downing Street, May let out a shriek as Grayling inadvertently tried to get her the sack as well. The transport secretary pressed on. What it came down to was this: no one was really to blame for the Windrush debacle and Rudd was every bit as much a victim as the many thousands who had found themselves deprived of work and healthcare and threatened with deportation. More so, in fact. It had been a real advantage to have someone in charge of the Home Office who didn’t know what she was doing and it was a tragedy that she had resigned. Rudd’s tragedy was that she was just too good for this world. She had just made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her boss. Shortly after appointing Sajid Javid as her new home secretary, it was May’s turn to face the cameras. She looked and sounded terrible, as if she was featuring in a hostage video. Yes there had been targets when she had been home secretary, she mumbled, her eyes numb with terror. It was near enough a confession that she knew Rudd had misled parliament but hadn’t thought it important enough to mention to anyone. Amber could be very proud of her time as home secretary, she added. It’s not everyone who gets to preside over one of the department’s biggest failures in its history. Having posed with his legs thrust astride outside his new office – the department had needed a bit of manspreading to shake it up – Javid soon found himself inside the Commons to face his first urgent question as home secretary. Understandably, he chose to keep his opening remarks short and sweet. He was Windrush. Kiss the badge. Nobody cared about Windrush more than him and he would do whatever was necessary to put things right. Labour’s Diane Abbott wasn’t convinced. She had heard much the same from the last home secretary and what was required was actions not words. Would he reverse the 2014 immigration act and commit to making sure that no other Commonwealth citizens were treated in the same way? “She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger,” Javid snapped indignantly, before going on to show that he still hadn’t fully understood the nature of the problem by failing to acknowledge it had been the prime minister’s hostile environment policies that had resulted in British citizens being threatened with deportation. Several Labour MPs tried to put him right, but Javid wasn’t having any of it. He refused to recognise the term hostile environment. “It’s a compliant environment,” he protested. Compliant as in being as beastly as possible to anyone who looked foreign without being actively hostile. Words matter. Tory Nick Boles invited the new home secretary to distance himself from legacy policies that were fundamentally wrong. Sajid declined. He’d only just got the promotion and was not about to do anything that might get him sacked on the first day. He knew where his priorities lay. His job was to appear to be different. Not be different."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/06/john-outram-postmodernist-british-architect-interview--john-soane","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"John Outram: architectural alchemist who loves a good yarn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/john-outram-postmodernist-british-architect-interview--john-soane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/06/john-outram-postmodernist-british-architect-interview--john-soane","fields":{"headline":"John Outram: the definition of British postmodern architecture","bodyText":"A classical landscape of cypresses, antique fragments and umbrella pines is raised on a concrete entablature above Egyptian-scaled columns. To the right a grand staircase descends, outpaced by cascades of water. The whole edifice is shown, in the style of the images of Sir John Soane’s Bank of England building that the architect once commissioned from the artist Joseph Gandy, poised between construction and ruin. Then, going beyond Soane-Gandy, the painter – Carl Laubin – makes the columns and stairs grow out of the storm-gnawed rock of some promontory washed by an unnamed sea. All this imagery goes to describe no more than an office block, an entry by the architect John Outram in a 1987 competition to design a replacement for the Financial Times’ old headquarters, Bracken House, near St Paul’s Cathedral. Laubin, playing Gandy to Outram’s Soane, tries to show in a single canvas not only the form and fabric of a building, its past and its future, but also the ideas that lie behind it. Both painting and project are ripe, dense, heroic – you might say a touch preposterous – and unconstrained and unconcerned by the calculations of letting agents or critical assessment. The image and the building, if they are of their decade in their excess, also oppose the commercial tendencies of their time, which was to slice and dice architecture and to confine expression to the ever skinnier wrapping of the ever larger money factories built to serve the Big Bang. In this work Outram, with Laubin’s help, protested against the epoch’s evanescence of built substance and against modernism’s reduction of the rich imagery of traditional architecture to function and abstract form. He wanted to enact his conviction that architecture should mean something, that it should recover its “universal” power to communicate myths, beliefs and ideas. If you inquire further you will find that the Bracken House project, like all his work, is based on an omnivorous, lifelong fascination with ancient mythologies – classical, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Vedic – their gravity leavened with a certain giggling mischief. It is only scratching the surface to know that Laubin’s painting shows the “river of time cut through the forest of infinity”. A building, for Outram, should be “metaphysical”. Which, if it sounds remote from contemporary ways of discussing architecture, is unquestionably how it was considered for most of what Outram calls “the 9,000 year history of architecture”. He loves stories, but it’s not all talk. Outram knows how to alchemise building materials, to play with the colours and casting of concrete, to add (for example) crushed brick and broken glass to the mix, to polish it and incise it, until it looks animate, or geological, or edible, or any combination of the three. He can assemble colours and shapes of brickwork to impart energy, mass and depths of imagined time. Given the chance, he will saturate a surface with polychromy and ornament and what he calls “scripting”. “You have to keep your eye on Outram,” said Michael Graves, an American architect who was also fond of decoration. “He never knows when to stop.” Outram, now a young-looking 83, is the most compelling British exponent of the style called postmodernism, for which reason he can be expected to be the star of a show on the subject that opens this month at Sir John Soane’s museum in London. One of his buildings, a pumping station in the Isle of Dogs, has been listed under Historic England’s programme of protecting postmodern masterpieces, and more will be announced soon. Except that, like most architects assigned a label, he resists it. “I quote Malvolio,” he says: “Some people have postmodernism thrust upon them.” He is indeed sui generis. His personal history plays a role in his cross-cultural fascinations. Although palpably British, with a courteous, quietly genial, witty manner that recalls the actor James Mason, he can also view Britishness from the outside: he was brought up in colonial India, and through family connections of his wife, Rima, knows Cyprus well. There, as in other Mediterranean cultures, he says, “the metaphysical is something ordinary. They feel at home with it. It doesn’t inspire the fear and dread that it does in northern climates.” He was never, in his Indian childhood, taken to see Hindu temples. “The imperial government regarded metaphysics as a sort of weakness that could be exploited in the subject peoples,” he says. Then, postwar and after the independence of India, condescending government “applied the same principles to the British. The British put up with it because we thought we were the top people.” The result was an austere form of official modernism, “a ‘this hurts me more than it hurts you’ sort of thing”, that “was supposed to be good for you”. His career as the leader of singular architectural practice was “an accident”. In 1974, after stints in the architects’ department of the London county council and in commercial practices, he was about to emigrate with his family to Cyprus “when we opened the Sunday papers and found that a war had started” – the Turkish invasion that left the island divided to this day. He stayed, started his own business, and got by on kitchens and bathrooms commissioned by supportive relatives – until, with a combination of luck and resourcefulness, he got to design some warehouses at Poyle, west of London. These, in contrast with the prevailing fashion for hi-tech metal sheds, had brick walls and high vaulted roofs, somehow bringing the aura of the ancient Roman working buildings – the shops of Trajan’s market or the port buildings of Ostia – to a location under the descent into Heathrow airport. Poyle won him more industrial projects. It also clinched the commission to design a quite amazing house in Sussex for the Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Märit Rausing, who saw in Poyle the quality they wanted, of something that “looked as if it had always been there”. With the house for the Rausings, on which he worked, one way or another, from 1978 to 2008, Outram could fully explore his love of increasingly fruity concrete, shiny black, rich blue, malachite green, white, wriggling and seething with pattern. It in turn led – after a trustee saw the house featured in a magazine – to the greatest fulfilment of Outram’s ideas, the Anne and Charles Duncan Hall, a centre of computational engineering for Rice University in Houston, Texas. Here Outram could “script” every surface of the astonishingly decorated interior, walls, floor and ceiling, with the story of “the ontogenetic and phylogenetic coming-into-being of humanity”. “They are hungry people, the Texans,” he says. “If you offer them a meal, they will eat it all.” He did and they did. It is striking that Outram should have found fertile ground in Houston, a modern city as far as can be from his ancient Mediterranean inspirations. An attraction of opposites, perhaps. But despite Outram’s immersion in antiquity he is also fascinated by the technology of the modern age. A 1958 student project for a “curvy fibreglass boilerhouse” was described by a guru of such things as the very first example of what would later be called hi-tech. An RAF pilot during his national service, he knows something about machines, and there can be something aeronautic as well as temple-like in the low-pitched pediments he gave to some of his industrial units. There is a paradox in Outram’s work. It seeks a shared ground, a way of experiencing the built universe that is both profound and accessible to all, but his burrowings into ancient mythologies make it esoteric to almost all modern viewers. “You can’t expect architecture to ‘think the truth of being’,” he says, citing Heidegger, “unless you can halfway read the ornament.” And an article like this can’t begin to explain the complexity and range of his imagery. Recently he was invited to visit an extension to the Cambridge Judge Business School, which Outram designed in the 1990s. The extension is by Stanton Williams, whose cool modernism is the opposite of Outram’s style. “It put me in deep shock. I felt like a ghost,” he says. “There was a refusal to do discourse with me.” This tale seems to confirm Outram’s position as singular and out of the mainstream. Yet, thanks to his genius for translating stories into matter and space, his buildings have a directness that is anything but obscure. You know that something significant is going on that is at least partly familiar, even if you don’t entirely know what it is, which wouldn’t happen if there weren’t the stories behind what you see. Outram’s buildings reach out and grab you. Once seen, they are not forgotten. They move you and engage you. Which is not something you can say of most new buildings.

Increasingly, I have conversations that centre around housing. Not of the “Have you seen these lovely tiles?” variety, but about the difficulty of having a long-term home. So, I am not surprised that this is the issue many people say they hear about on the doorstep as they canvass for the upcoming local elections. Housing is where “politics” lives. Brexit and issues around antisemitism remain abstract in ways that having a home does not. Housing is fraught with emotion and need. It is where people express their dreams for themselves and their children. It is where they feel their desperation and insecurity. I know many young folk who are exhausted by renting, moving their stuff every few months. I know several people my age who are priced out of the rental market. I know people who are anxious about stalling house prices, not because they are monstrous property developers, but because their home is their pension. Meanwhile, TV shows feature architects frothing over dream homes and couples buying castles to do up. The Thatcherite idea that home ownership is the way to lock in a Tory government for ever is now derelict. The market is not a benign force. It has pursued an unsustainable boom. An ideology that preached that social housing was about dependency and home ownership was morally superior has left generations without access to either – particularly in London. Some Tories are starting to join the dots, since it looks as though London will pull further away from the rest of the country. Estimates of the Labour vote from 2010 to 2017 suggest it has gone up in the capital, from 37% to 55%. Home ownership, meanwhile, is in decline, having peaked in the 90s. If current trends continue, London will have far more renters than homeowners in a few years, about 60%. For all the media’s preoccupation with the technicalities of Brexit or the magnetism of Corbyn, these trends tell us something politically significant: that London as a city state may be a preview of the future. This is the city of Grenfell, with cranes dangling over every new-build, with “communities” that once would have been socially housed clinging on in precarious, crowded conditions. The idea that the last election was a youthquake is wrong. The turnout was significantly bigger in the 25-44 generation, and this is where the swing from to Tory to Labour happened. These are the renters. I don’t think the significance of this can be overestimated. This is the point where demography, social mobility and the generational divide become as real as rotting window frames and paper-thin walls. This is how people live: thirtysomethings with parents; children with no space but a screen. When the majority are renting, this cannot be defined as moral deficiency or shirking – the ideology of home ownership is bust. Voters will look for a politics that recognises this. There is not simply one Generation Rent, but several – enough to trigger the rentquake that will kill the Thatcherite dream once and for all. Comedians: the new public intellectuals I didn’t find anything Michelle Wolf said at the White House correspondents’ dinner funny. Searing, necessary, on-point – but not funny. Nothing the comedian said made me laugh, but then I mostly like silliness and situations. Not jokes. Most comedy doesn’t make me laugh, but I am not sure it is supposed to. It is almost like we need a new word for what comics do now. Wolf not only told truth to power, but she also told it to the press, who have absolutely normalised Trump’s behaviour and who have often profited from it. This new mode – it is not satire, exactly – makes comedians the new public intellectuals, drawing attention to all that is wrong in the world. They are at the forefront of an oppositional cultural politics. This space often feels unchallenging, for it exists not to comfort the afflicted, but to comfort the mildly socially concerned – all of Radio 4, in other words. Brexit is very bad for comedians’ creative processes. At a recent gig, the punchline of every joke was that everyone who voted leave was a nasty racist. This was north London patting itself on the back. Into this milieu comes Jonathan Pie to educate us on the value of free speech. Pie – a fictional reporter played by the comedian Tom Walker – exists in his libertarian way to shake up the lefty consensus. Walker co-writes with one of the Spiked crew and, like them, his libertarianism ends up being dull and mostly rightwing. His recent comments – defending the right of people to make racist comments, on the grounds that he can then “debate” them – were profoundly lacking, to say the least. In practice, someone like Frankie Boyle challenges his audience far more than Pie ever manages. There is not a line Boyle won’t try to cross. This is not comforting, but it is funny. These days, comedians can be the most serious people around. Stop blaming women for being murdered Whose fault is it that men rape, torture and murder women? Women’s, apparently. If a woman has got away from an abusive man, he is often so “lovesick” or “heartbroken” that he must kill her – and sometimes her children. The Golden State Killer had to do the awful things he did because he could not get over a woman, Bonnie, who had rejected him. The ludicrous reporting on “incels” last week often bought into their own delusional narrative about who was to blame for their own feelings. We live in a culture that pretends that women are emotional and men are rational, yet in every other way suggests that men have certain emotions that are uncontrollable. This is a dangerous lie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/netanyahu-accuses-iran-cheating-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T19:52:18Z","webTitle":"Nuclear deal: Netanyahu accuses Iran of cheating on agreement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/netanyahu-accuses-iran-cheating-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/netanyahu-accuses-iran-cheating-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear deal: Netanyahu accuses Iran of cheating on agreement","bodyText":"Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of continuing to hide and expand its nuclear weapons knowhow after a 2015 agreement with global powers, presenting what the Israeli prime minister claimed was “new and conclusive proof” of violations. Netanyahu presented a series of slides and photographs of documents that he said were drawn from a half-ton cache obtained by Israeli intelligence “a few weeks ago”. The New York Times reported that Mossad had broken into a warehouse in January and smuggled them to Israel the same night. The report did not say how such a large amount of documentation was transported in secret. However, key documents highlighted by Netanyahu had previously been seen by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as early as 2005 and made public by the agency in 2011. The IAEA judged that substantial work on nuclear weapons development ceased in 2003, and that there was no evidence of weapons research after 2009. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, the task of investigating Iran’s nuclear past was handed to the IAEA. In a televised primetime speech, Netanyahu said Israel had tens of thousands of documents from what he called Iran’s “Atomic Archives”, which he presented as new evidence, and which he said had been shared with the US. “Iran lied, big time,” he said, speaking from Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv. “Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons programme.” Netanyahu’s presentation came less than two weeks before Donald Trump is due to decide whether to continue to abide by the 2015 deal by waiving US sanctions on Iran. Asked about the Israeli evidence on Monday, Trump said it proved he was “100% right” about the flaws of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) “I’ve been saying it’s happening” Trump said at the White House. “They’re not sitting back idly.” Asked about his intentions on 12 May, the deadline for the sanctions waivers, the president said: “So we’ll see what happens. I’m not telling anyone what I’m doing.” Trump added that if he did pull out of the JCPOA it would send the “the right message” to North Korea. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the documents showed that Iran lied about its pursuit of nuclear weapons and that its deception undercuts the international nuclear deal it signed in 2015. Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said his department first saw the documentation that Netanyahu presented in 2005. The safeguards department that Heinonen ran came to the conclusion that the evidence of weapon design work known as the Amad project was credible, but that substantial work on the project ceased in 2003. Heinonen gave a classified briefing on Amad to the IAEA board in 2008. After watching Netanyahu’s presentation, Heinonen said: “I just saw a lot of pictures I had seen before.” “Some of the images that we saw I briefed to the board in closed session in February 2008,” Heinonen said. He added that the IAEA did not see the full archive of Amad documentation, but was given the most important evidence. The IAEA made public some of its evidence on Iran’s past nuclear weapons work in 2011. It found that some research work had continued after 2003, but found no evidence of such research activities after 2009. Netanyahu had lobbied hard against the 2015 deal that lifted some sanctions on his arch-enemy Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, labelling it from the outset as “a bad mistake of historic proportions”. He has backed Donald Trump’s threats to walk away from the Barack Obama-era deal, which the US administration has sought to discredit for its limited, 10-year-duration and its failure to address Iran’s long-range missiles programme. Netanyahu, who is known for theatrical presentations, pulled black sheets from a cabinet filled with folders that he said were copies of 55,000 pages of “incriminating” evidence. He revealed a screen to which close to 200 CDs had been affixed, saying they held videos and photos of clandestine Iranian nuclear research and development. “Even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons programme for future use,” he said, speaking in English. Netanyahu did not detail how Israel obtained what he said was a half a tonne of “evidence” from a warehouse in Tehran, or say if the maps, diagrams, powerpoint slides and spreadsheets would be shared with the public. However, he said Israel would forward the cache to the IAEA. “The Iran deal, the nuclear deal, is based on lies,” he said, adding that he was sure, Trump would “do the right thing” when deciding on whether to pull out of the Iran deal. Based on the documentation that the IAEA reviewed, its director general, Yukiya Amano, said in December 2015: “The agency assesses that these activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies, and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences and capabilities.” “The agency has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009,” Amano said. “Nor has the agency found any credible indications of the diversion of nuclear material in connection with the possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme.” The JCPOA delegated the task of looking into Iran’s past weapons work to the IAEA, which produced a “final assessment” of the outstanding nuclear issues at the end of 2015, summarising what it knew about Iranian nuclear weapons work. “It was a political agreement,” Heinonen said. “But what you need to do is go and meet the guys who were involved in this work and see what they are doing now.” “Without going through it with a fine-tooth comb, what Netanyahu is presenting is broadly consistent with what the IAEA has reported,” said James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But Acton added that the main purpose of the presentation was to influence Trump before the 12 May sanctions deadline. “He had an audience of one so we wait to see what influence it had on that audience of one,” he said. Netanyahu spoke by phone with Trump this the weekend, according to the White House, which said the two leaders discussed “the Iranian regime’s destabilising activities”, a nod to Tehran’s military reach across the Middle East. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has said that if the US pulls out of the nuclear deal, Tehran would be “highly unlikely” to remain inside and the consequences “will not be very pleasant for the United States”. After Netanyahu’s presentation, Zarif described it on Twitter as a “rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the IAEA”. He suggested it had been orchestrated to justify Trump’s looming decision to “nix the deal”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/women-can-be-incels-too","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T17:21:16Z","webTitle":"Women can be incels too | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/women-can-be-incels-too","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/women-can-be-incels-too","fields":{"headline":"Women can be incels too","bodyText":"Ironically, misogyny isn’t just a result of being an “incel” (involuntary celibate) man (Raw hatred: How the Incel movement targets women, G2, 26 April), but is also quite often the cause of women becoming incels too. Having been widowed in my early fifties, I tried, after a period of time, to meet possible new partners on the internet. Here I quickly found that any expectation that I’d be attractive to men my own age (my very attractive husband had been five years younger than me, so it hadn’t seemed too arrogant a hope) was sadly misplaced. Almost every man my age on the sites I visited had set age limits for potential female partners at anything from 10 to 30 years younger than themselves, and made clear good looks were vital to any potential relationship, despite often not being any great shakes themselves. Given that I had already lost one husband and was statistically likely to outlive other men my own age, the idea of taking on a man 15 to 20 years older than me was unappealing. I felt these men were selfishly seeking physical beauty now and a care plan for later, with little evidence of what they felt they were offering in return. I have since read theories that they are often successful because younger women desperate to have children before their time runs out struggle to find men their own age willing to settle down. As a result I remain an incel, and seem likely to spend the rest of my life alone for the crime of seeking an equal partner. The number of older women living out their lives alone hugely exceeds that of older men. Another hidden result of misogyny. Needless to say, however, I have not felt driven to massacre innocent people as a result!

His pre-National breakthrough was as Romeo to Judi Dench’s Juliet at the Old Vic in 1960. Kenneth Tynan hailed Franco Zeffirelli’s production as “a revelation, perhaps a revolution,” in that the lovers’ passion was, for the first time, so young, immediate, contemporary and palpable. The play was re-born. And Stride double-booked his place in the history books with the first professional performance of Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead in 1967, playing the garrulous, amiably philosophical Rosencrantz opposite Edward Petherbridge’s irritable and sarcastic Guildenstern; in the opening coin-tossing scene of a play that placed the attendant lords centre stage with the tragedy of Hamlet as its scenery, Stride had called 85 “heads” in a row – correctly. The show, said the critic Peter Lewis, came out of the dark like a spot-lit jewel full of vibrations. Stride could be brusque off stage, said Petherbridge, but was always impeccable on. He was a strikingly good-looking juvenile, with cherubic features, fine bearing and a voice that was God-given, according to another friend and contemporary, the actor David Weston: “John spoke verse as well as anyone I’ve ever heard.” But after his great bulge of success in the 1970s, Stride’s career foundered in the 80s and petered out with a florid performance as an ageing actor trying to make a come-back in Melvyn Bragg’s King Lear in New York, at the Chichester Festival theatre in 1992. It was as though, starting as Peter Pan, a “Tennant’s boy” in the West End – hired by the all-powerful Binkie Beaumont of HM Tennant – and then Romeo and a National Theatre star, he failed to adjust to an older, middle-aged model. He was born into a working-class family in South Norwood, south-east London, one of the five children of Alfred, a gardener and mechanic, and his wife Margaret (nee Prescott). He won a place at Alleyn’s school, Dulwich, then a direct grant grammar school, where he played soccer and water polo to high standards; he had extremely large hands, which earned him the nickname “Navvy”. The key figure in his early life was the Alleyn’s English and drama master Michael Croft, who would later found the National Youth Theatre, in 1956. In a school production in 1952, Croft cast Stride as Hamlet, followed by Macbeth, and then as Antony. As a result, Stride won a scholarship to Rada – to the disapproval of his parents – alongside Alan Bates and O’Toole. He did his national service for two years with the Royal Artillery before playing a season at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1957 and making his West End debut in 1959 in Peter Shaffer’s Five Finger Exercise, a role he took over from Brian Bedford. He then joined the Old Vic where his roles, apart from Romeo, included Lysander, Prince Hal and Gratiano in The Merchant of Venice. With the Old Vic he made his New York debut in 1962 as Malcolm in Macbeth and as Romeo. With Olivier’s new National, he was a fine Cassio in Othello (with Olivier and Maggie Smith), Dunois in Joan Plowright’s Saint Joan, Valentine in an exquisite production of Congreve’s Love for Love, Andrei in Three Sisters and the title role in Brecht’s version of Marlowe’s Edward II. As he eased away from the National, the film career he had started in 1963 as a sympathetic barman in Bitter Harvest (1963) – starring Janet Munro as a Welsh innocent abroad in London, and based on a Patrick Hamilton novel – picked up with roles as Ross in Roman Polanski’s Macbeth (1971), with Jon Finch in the title role and Francesca Annis as a stunning, nakedly sleep-walking Lady Macbeth, John Wayne in Douglas Hickox’s Brannigan (1975) and with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in Richard Donner’s The Omen (1976), in which he played a psychiatrist. But in none of these films did he make the same impact as in The Main Chance on television, and that is where he stayed, with a couple of significant sorties into the commercial theatre: co-starring with Eileen Atkins in Marguerite Duras’ Suzanna Andler in 1971 at the Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford; and with Vanessa Redgrave and Jeremy Brett in Michael Blakemore’s superb 1973 West End revival – retrieval, really – of Noël Coward’s Design for Living at the Phoenix; this “disgusting, three-sided erotic hotchpotch”, as one of the “excluded” characters in the play dubs it, as restored to the repertoire as a modern classic. His TV follow-up to The Main Chance was Wilde Alliance (1978), in which he and Julia Foster were a husband and wife team of amateur detectives, but it lasted for only one series. After playing Bluntschli in Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man at the Oxford Playhouse in 1976, he became a stranger to the stage until the Bragg play in Chichester. And in this same year, 1992, he scored heavily, for the last time on television, as two debauched characters: a lecherous businessman, Sir Bernard Bellamy, in Fay Weldon’s Growing Rich; and as the promiscuous Welsh “media type” Alun Weaver in Andrew Davies’s adaptation of Kingsley Amis’s The Old Devils. By the time he played Bragg’s actor-laddie, he seemed to be a caricatured, bloated version of his former self. The play, anyway, was a poor re-tread of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser (1980), in which Freddie Jones (and, on film, Albert Finney) played a version of Donald Wolfit as Lear during the blitz; Stride’s Lear in modern Manhattan, besieged by two wives, a strident television gossip journalist and a drug addict daughter, was too forced a dramatic analogy, and Stride himself seemed to have morphed into a snowy-haired, bibulous and bulging version of Bragg’s old director buddy Ken Russell. It was, nonetheless, a memorable and agreeably growling performance, and approved by the critics, who were collectively delighted to see him back in action. Stride was twice married, first in 1958 to his Rada contemporary Virginia Thomas (the marriage ended in divorce) and then, in 1972, to the actor April Wilding. She died in 2003 and there are friends who say he never fully recovered from this blow. His last years were spent in a nursing home near Oxford. He is survived by two daughters from his first marriage and one from his second. • John Edward Stride, actor, born 11 July 1936; died 20 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/30/jeff-bezos-plane-amazon-location-hq2","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T18:28:59Z","webTitle":"Where will Amazon's new HQ be?

Flights records show the Amazon CEO’s aircraft, N271DV, was in Boston just before and after Amazon announced the HQ2 search and landed in Washington DC the day the 20 finalists were announced in January, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. Of the HQ2 candidate cities on Amazon’s shortlist, Bezos’ plane – which has a range of 7,500 miles – has also touched down near Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and Newark, New Jersey. “While they aren’t necessarily an indicator of the company’s likelihood of choosing one of these cities for its second headquarters, Bezos’ familiarity and frequent travel to some of the cities could weigh in his decision on where HQ2 ends up,” the Journal reported. However, the publication warned that the flight records it obtained may not reflect every flight the plane has taken, nor do the flights that have been tracked contain a passenger manifest. The plane tracking site flightaware.com lists Bezos’s aircraft as “not available for tracking per request from the owner/operator”. For the sake of Bezos’s convenience, Amazon might naturally chose Washington DC for HQ2 since it is where the multibillionaire’s Washington Post is published and where he recently purchased the city’s largest house, with 25 bedrooms. Amazon has said it plans to create 50,000 jobs and invest over $5bn in the chosen city. However, the beauty contest has also attracted criticism, especially over the generous tax incentives and other inducements some cities have offered. Included in Amazon’s top 20 finalists are Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Mongomery County in Maryland and Nashville, Tennessee. An Amazon spokesperson, however, has warned not to read too much into the movements of Bezos’s aircraft, telling the New York Observer “there is no connection between Bezos’ personal and business travel and the HQ2 search”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/30/active-measures-review-documentary-putin-trump-election-meddling","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T02:48:29Z","webTitle":"Active Measures review – middling doc on Russian election meddling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/30/active-measures-review-documentary-putin-trump-election-meddling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/30/active-measures-review-documentary-putin-trump-election-meddling","fields":{"headline":"Active Measures review – middling doc on Russian election meddling","bodyText":"The most widespread affliction facing documentary cinema today is known as Wikipediitis, a malady wherein a feature-length film would be better served by the form of a written article. Telltale symptoms include questionably necessary animated interludes, an excess of padding via points restated ad nauseam, and an overall prioritization of the subject material over its method of presentation. Too many recent nonfiction films have attempted to fill a 90-minute bag with 40 minutes of informational manure, but the Hot Docs premiere Active Measures goes a touch too far in the other direction. Director Jack Bryan synthesizes dozens upon dozens of articles for a more circumspect view of Russia’s ongoing meddling in American politics, running the risk of overloading his viewers instead of, er, under-loading them. If something like Three Identical Strangers could’ve been an encyclopedia entry taking all of 10 minutes to read, Bryan’s film is a paperweight-class book an audience needs more than two hours to get through. Which is all a rather ambivalent way of saying that Bryan is extremely thorough in his research and collation of facts. He begins at the beginning of the beginning, with the turbulent circumstances of Vladimir Putin’s conception and birth into a Russia fraught with hardship. A portrait of Putin as a ruthless crime boss in the guise of an elected official promptly takes shape – Tony Soprano, but without the psychological conflict to earn him the empathy. He’s then posed as the architect of what the film touts as “the single largest intelligence operation in history”, a multi-decade scheme to get Donald Trump under the Kremlin’s thumb as a conduit for money and influence at the highest level of American authority. Of course, it all adds up. Two years’ worth of newspaper headlines have told this story piecemeal, but seeing it all arranged just so communicates the enormity of the purported con. Bryan methodically charts the increasing Russian presence in Trump’s business and social lives, from the allegations of his allowing gangsters to use Trump Tower as their personal money laundromat up to the DNC email hack and even the Cambridge Analytica data-mining mischief. Trump is all fraying threads; yank on any one and it leads back to some para-governmental ghoul with a body count and a corruption charge or two. Bryan’s done his homework, mapping out an elaborate network of past wrongdoings with news clippings and TV footage. If the just deserts that this film demands ever come to pass, it will almost certainly be the most copiously photographed treason in a long and illustrious American tradition. That there is so much to cover ultimately works against the film, however. In 112 dense minutes, Bryan shoehorns a crash-course timeline of 20th-century Russian politics, a granular analysis of an elaborate money-moving scheme, twinned short biographies of morally bankrupt men, a blow-by-blow account of how the White House was won and a hundred miniature tangents about Putin’s endless list of henchmen. As Bryan progresses into the present and trains his focus on the 2016 presidential election, he trots out some high-profile talking heads including Hillary Clinton and John McCain. But the sheer volume of experts buries a viewer under a fast-moving avalanche of names, dates and figures. This film’s greatest shortcoming also happens to be the Trump administration’s greatest strength: pile enough shocking scandals on top of one another and the public won’t know which one to keep an eye on. Just as every day brings some new surreal miscarriage of power, so too does Bryan cycle on to the next point of outrage every five or so minutes. Though by the film’s conclusion, that outrage is the only thing he’s got. For all the mountains and mountains of evidence that Bryan has organized, it’s strictly circumstantial. As thorough as his reportage may be, this documentary was never going to be the thing to discover the smoking gun definitively proving Trump’s guilt. Without being able to break that news, the film can’t help but end on a note of inconsequentiality. More troubling still, Bryan compensates for the ebbing drama by ratcheting up the attack ad aesthetics (spooky inverse coloration, overtaxed musical cues, flurries of associative cross-cuts) to extremes approaching fear-mongering and paranoia-stoking. The inherent limitations of this effort aside (and discounting the patent futility of persuading any current Trumpistas using a documentary that premiered in Canada, for God’s sake), Bryan’s done some good and noble work. But until investigative committees provide him with the final act of this story, the rest of us will just have to hold out for the pee tape.

As the widower of a late multiple sclerosis sufferer I also see this political ambience in a number of other areas. Disabled people have been discriminated against over the past several years and have certainly been subjected to a “hostile environment”. And society, in general, has also suffered from the “hostile environment” of the austerity agenda perpetrated on us over the past several years by the “nasty party”. Common to all of this has been Mrs May. I trust that she and her Brexit hardliners will not throw us out into a world economic “hostile environment”. Dr Stan Moore Wrexham • It does not surprise me in the least about the hostile environment for immigrants. I wish the Guardian could discover similar targets for reducing the number of sickness benefit claimants, which has caused so much suffering that many people have killed themselves. Anne Williams Hove, East Sussex • Amber Rudd claims to have understood the Windrush cases as individual rather than as a symptom of a system. The previous week the DWP reported that “only 1% of claimants” have had benefit problems. I convene a small local charity disbursing grants to individuals who are in desperate need – probably people in that 1%. Nearly every case we deal with is an individual difficulty that is actually systemic. Needs are rising faster than we can keep pace with due to benefit sanctions, universal credit delays, lack of mental health support, housing costs beyond people’s means, inhumane immigration decisions, and the costs involved in challenging unfair rulings. These costs are met by individual donors, many of whom are pensioners, and often support is administered by volunteers, also mainly pensioners. When this patching-up “system” fails because people have to work longer and have smaller pensions, who will then sort out the problems that Amber Rudd and others think are individual cases? The whole system places performativity above care, relying on charities and overstretched caseworkers to pick up the pieces, and then is surprised when it fails. Anne Watson Oxford Friends Action on Poverty • What turned a general problem into the Windrush catastrophe for people who have lived in the UK for decades? Quite simply, the decision by the government to make the production of “proof of residency” compulsory in a range of situations, with the obligation to check pushed down to employers, landlords and hospitals. This policy was introduced, it would seem, with no regard to the potential for “collateral damage” to people legally in the country but without the requisite paperwork, despite the bitter arguments at the time when a proposal was made – and defeated – to introduce national ID cards. Are we sleepwalking into another fiasco as early as Thursday this week, when a pilot is being undertaken that requires voters to present ID before they can vote in the local elections? Are we about to see the disenfranchisement of another group of people, denied their right to vote because they don’t have the right papers? Any thoughts on what sorts of people are likely to be in this group? Not content with throwing people into detention or out of the country, the “nasty party” in government seems now intent upon denying many who have managed to cling on, their right to vote for a better outcome.

Another supposedly decisive meeting of the Brexit subcommittee is scheduled for Wednesday, at which ministers are due to discuss which of two competing visions of customs cooperation Britain wishes to see happen when it leaves the European Union. Though both ministers originally voted to stay in the EU – and therefore technically maintain the rough balance of leavers and remainers on either side of the prime minister – Javid’s more hard-nosed attitude since the referendum suggests the reshuffle will strengthen the hand of those who wish to see the committee favour the less cooperative of two government customs proposals on offer. “British people gave politicians clear instructions through the EU referendum,” he wrote just last week. “[This] includes leaving the customs union, an intrinsic part of the EU. Britain must leave [the customs union] and be able to negotiate and sign its own trade deals.” Rudd, by contrast, was last week forced to deny suggestions she was still secretly in favour of keeping things pretty much as they are. Had she survived the Windrush scandal, Rudd would almost certainly have been more supportive of Theresa May’s preference for staying close to the EU. But the idea that the big choice in British politics is simply between which of the government’s suggested Brexit options will prevail was once again blown out of the water on Monday by a timely intervention from across the Irish Sea. After a meeting with the taoiseach, EU negotiator Michel Barnier spelled out that neither of the two customs proposals on the table in London is seen as remotely credible to anyone outside the Westminster bubble. Just in case cabinet hardliners were tempted to shrug off the warning when they meet on Wednesday, Barnier also reminded them that without some form of mutually-agreed customs solution to the keep the Irish border open, all bets are off. The collapse of talks that would ensue if Britain ignores this challenge threatens all progress so far, including a tentative agreement for a two-year transition phase that is seen as essential by the business community. To the extent that the UK has any meaningful say over a process so far dictated almost entirely by Brussels, it is arguably parliament that matters more than the cabinet. It is here, in the House of Commons to be precise, that the real showdown is looming when MPs finally get a chance to have their say on customs policy. Downing Street has continually pushed back a vote, probably now at least until after local elections on Thursday, but it cannot ignore forever the mounting evidence of a majority against both of its suggested options. Judging from the latest outbreak of scepticism among Tory rebels during a non-binding debate last week, there could instead be as many as 17 backbenchers willing to vote with Labour in favour of staying in a full customs union with the EU. Rudd may not immediately join them. Whether or not she has further ministerial ambition, it would be very hard just yet to abandon a government of which she was so recently a member. Nonetheless, like former education secretary Justine Greening, and Cabinet Office minister Damian Green before her, she joins the growing ranks of senior Tory backbenchers with only thinly-disguised misgivings about the direction of official Brexit policy. This may not even be the last resignation to rock the cabinet this week. If May was tempted to avoid defeat in the Commons by caving in to calls for a full customs union with the EU, she risks the possible resignation of eurosceptics like Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and – despite denials to the contrary – possibly even the Brexit secretary, David Davis. A rebellion in the Commons almost certainly won’t be last parliamentary defeat either. Barely a day goes by without the House of Lords signalling its unhappiness, possibly forcing an even bigger showdown this autumn. And customs policy is not the only potential Brexit consequence of the Windrush scandal. With a chastened Home Office now likely to take a more liberal approach to immigration, it is inconceivable that the new secretary of state could follow through with original leaked plans for an even more draconian border policy in future. Instead a weakened prime minister could once again be forced to confront the angry eurosceptics in her cabinet who wonder whether she is heading for “Brino” – Brexit in name only. With enemies on all sides already, May has lost an important ally in cabinet, gained a potential rebel in parliament and is further than ever from finding a plausible way out of a looming collision with the reality of a broken Brexit strategy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/britain-home-hostile-environment-damage-spread-beyond-windrush","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T17:06:11Z","webTitle":"‘Britain is my home’: how the hostile environment damage has spread","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/britain-home-hostile-environment-damage-spread-beyond-windrush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/britain-home-hostile-environment-damage-spread-beyond-windrush","fields":{"headline":"‘Britain is my home’: how the hostile environment damage has spread","bodyText":"As controversy over the government’s “hostile environment” policy rumbles on in the wake of the Windrush scandal, more stories are emerging – this time of people from other Commonwealth countries beyond the Caribbean who have been affected despite living and working in the UK for decades. Paul Sinodhinos has lived in the UK for 56 years. The 77-year-old arrived from Canada in 1962 having “grown up reading English books” and decided to stay. He has always held a Canadian passport, but pays taxes in the UK, has a national insurance number, an NHS number, is on the electoral register and votes in the UK, owns property and has a civil partner of eight years, Spencer Butler, a British citizen, with whom he lives in Dorset. “Britain is my home,” he told the Guardian. In March 2016, he received his most recent Canadian passport and decided to apply for a “right of abode” certificate, which superseded the old stamp of entitlement to “enter the UK for an indefinite period”. But he was refused. Between 1972 and 1998, the passports Sinodhinos held had the stamp of entitlement. After his mother died in 1995, he had no need to travel outside the UK and decided not to reapply for the stamp until 2016, when it was refused. He is now too afraid to visit his sister in Canada, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Fighting back tears, Sinodhinos said he had been left “deeply upset” by the experience. “I am now left feeling I should not travel outside the UK in case I am denied entry on my return or – worse – that if I appeal the decision and make a stand for the right to live here that I was granted through the stamp in most of my passports, that I shall be incarcerated in a detention centre.” Butler, his partner, described Sinodhinos as one of the kindest people he knew and said he was enraged by the situation. “When the Home Office refused Paul’s application, they informed him that he could seek advice from another of their departments, if he paid an enormous fee,” Butler, 69, said. “It’s a racket.” The couple have written to their constituency MP, Oliver Letwin, but are yet to receive a response. Azad Miah: ‘I felt like an utter failure’ It was only when Azad Miah tried to organise his dying wife’s burial abroad that he discovered that if he travelled, he would not be able to return to the UK because he did not have the correct paperwork. Miah’s wife developed cancer four years ago at just 31 and her last wish was to be buried in Bangladesh near her mother. “I went to the travel agent to sort it out, but when I showed them my Bangladeshi passport, they said that if I left, I might not be able to return,” he explains. “I had to come home and tell my wife, who had just a few days left to live. She was in tears … I felt like an utter failure.” The 52-year-old – who arrived in Britain with his family aged six in 1972 – did not have the correct documentation in his passport. His previous passport, which has now expired, was stamped with the “no time limit stamp”, but due to Home Office changes in 2014, he was told he needed a biometric residence permit (BRP). Like those of the Windrush generation, Miah came from a Commonwealth country, although it was east Pakistan (now Bangladesh) rather than the Caribbean. He worked and lived in Britain for 46 years before realising that he was not considered a British citizen. When he realised he could not bury his wife abroad, he says, he was shocked, but it paled into insignificance compared with what he was dealing with. After his wife’s death, he realised he could no longer work because he did not have a biometric permit. This was despite the fact that he had been working – as a sales director and senior project manager – before his wife became ill in 2014. He gave up his job to look after her when she became unwell. Miah’s mother applied for a naturalisation certificate for him in 1982, but when he tried to obtain it he was told that they only had records dating back to 1986. “For some reason, I was still getting benefits, but obviously I wasn’t allowed to get a job because I didn’t have a permit … I had one branch of government telling me to go to look for work, and another hindering my chances of getting employment. It’s lunacy,” he says. As soon as Miah heard about the recent Windrush generation stories, he realised his rights and called the Home Office. “Getting it sorted means the stress will go, but I should never have been put through it all in the first place,” he says. The Home Office said Miah has had indefinite leave to remain for a number of years, but was not currently a British citizen. They said they would encourage him to contact the freephone helpline to discuss his citizenship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/27/nothing-like-a-dame-judi-dench-maggie-smith-eileen-atkins-joan-plowright","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T14:42:43Z","webTitle":"Judi, Maggie, Joan and Eileen: all hail British theatre's great dames | Michael Billington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/27/nothing-like-a-dame-judi-dench-maggie-smith-eileen-atkins-joan-plowright","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/27/nothing-like-a-dame-judi-dench-maggie-smith-eileen-atkins-joan-plowright","fields":{"headline":"Judi, Maggie, Joan and Eileen: all hail British theatre's great dames","bodyText":"Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest. The wheeze of bringing together four of Britain’s distinguished theatrical dames – Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith – and letting them reminisce has yielded an extraordinary film which opens in cinemas next week before being shown on BBC TV under the Arena banner. Called, inevitably, Nothing Like a Dame, and directed by Roger Michell, it is both hilarious and, in its mix of present-day recollection and past footage, extremely touching. It also reminds me of the truth of David Hare’s observation that acting is ultimately “a judgment of character”. The four dames have known each other a long time and have much in common. Between them they have played all the great roles: Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Saint Joan, the Duchess of Malfi. They have lived through radical changes in the approach to verse-speaking. And they have experienced the humdrum delights of theatrical digs: one legendary story involves an actor returning unexpectedly to pick up a script and discovering his landlady spreadeagled on the kitchen table with the milkman, only for her to shyly declare: “You must think me a terrible flirt.” Looking at the personalities, as well as the careers, of the four actors, what strikes me is their quirky individuality: each has some essential, defining quality that makes for stardom. In the case of Maggie Smith, it is an acutely developed sense of irony that she has applied to the great high comedy roles such as Beatrice in Much Ado, Millamant in The Way of the World and Amanda in Private Lives. Her forte has always been a faint scepticism built on a fastidious use of language. You see it in the film when, as they discuss what it’s like to be a dame, Plowright observes that, as Lady Olivier, she has the difficulty of possessing a double title. “You’ll just have to grapple with it, Joan,” remarks Smith with wry coolness. But she can also pierce to the heart of a character. I’ve never forgotten how, when she played Titania at Stratford, Ontario, she made something inexpressibly moving out of the fairy queen’s grief at the death of her votaress in childbirth. Judi Dench is no less famous for conveying the contradictions within a character. Over the course of a long career, she has played just about everyone from the anguished heroine of John Hopkins’ TV drama Talking to a Stranger to Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria on the big screen. But although she was a magnificent Lady Macbeth and Cleopatra, what I admire most is her ability to catch the silvery contrasts of Shakespeare’s comic heroines. When Beatrice in Much Ado denies that she was born in a merry hour, Dench’s voice seemed to crack as she claimed: “No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.” All of Dench’s capacity to mix bubbling mischief and plangent melancholy was caught in that line. For all her dual titles, Joan Plowright strikes me as the earthiest of the four dames. You see that in the film when she recalls someone telling her: “You’re no oil painting, but you’ve got the spark.” That spark was evident from the start in her sensational Beatie Bryant in Arnold Wesker’s Roots and her unforgettable Sonya in Olivier’s production of Uncle Vanya: her climactic speech to the broken-hearted Vanya, full of a defiant endurance, was one of the most moving things I’ve ever heard in a theatre. Eileen Atkins’s career encompasses everything from the classics to TS Eliot, Marguerite Duras and Samuel Beckett, and she is soon to return to the West End in Florian Zeller’s The Height of the Storm. If I had to single out any one performance, it would be her astonishing recent incarnation of Ellen Terry at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, in which she transported us in a second from Juliet’s terror to Lear’s thunder and from Rosalind’s lyrical ardour to Portia’s practical compassion. But Atkins’s defining gift is a no-bullshit emotional directness that, to borrow the words of James Agate on Jean Forbes-Robertson, I would describe as her “steel-true and blade-straight quality”. Watching Michell’s film is like eavesdropping on the freewheeling conversation of four old friends. At the same time, it unlocks our personal memories of past performances by four great actors and reminds us of their cherishable uniqueness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/27/desmond-elliott-prize-new-fiction-reveals-female-shortlist","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:22:37Z","webTitle":"Desmond Elliott prize for new fiction reveals all-female shortlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/desmond-elliott-prize-new-fiction-reveals-female-shortlist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/27/desmond-elliott-prize-new-fiction-reveals-female-shortlist","fields":{"headline":"Desmond Elliott prize for new fiction reveals all-female shortlist","bodyText":"Three women have been shortlisted for one of the most prestigious prizes for debut novelists. The Guardian writer Paula Cocozza, Gail Honeyman and Preti Taneja are all in the running for the 2018 Desmond Elliott prize. The chairman of the prize’s trustees, Dallas Manderson, said the three selected from the longlist of 10 were those who showed most promise for the future. “It is never an easy task and the authors featured in this year’s longlist were all exceptional,” he said. Cocozza is shortlisted for How to be Human, which explores themes of delusion and imagination as a woman becomes obsessed with the fox that visits her garden as her marriage disintegrates. She was praised by the judging panel, including the author Sarah Perry, the journalist Samira Ahmed and Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White, for having created “a persona as winning and as wily as her invited guest”. Perry said: “In evocative and elegant prose Cocozza delves deep into the psyche of a strange and troubled woman. The reader is invited to share in her intense connection to a fox and will admire the author’s mordantly witty dissection of contemporary manners.” Honeyman’s Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine won the Costa first novel award in January. The judges described her novel, which it to be turned into a film produced by Reece Witherspoon, as “a coming to life rather than a coming of age”. The voice of its hero is “so vital that the reader accepts without question her intense loneliness, so that her tentative journey towards a redemptive kindness becomes profoundly moving”, said Perry, who is this year’s chair. Taneja is shortlisted for We That Are Young, a retelling of King Lear in modern-day India. It charts the downfall of a family dynasty, with the judges praising its “sensual” and “revelatory” prose. Perry said: “The scope of Taneja’s ambition is breathtaking. We That Are Young is both universal in its themes of familial duty and personal failing, and exquisitely specific in its depiction of contemporary Indian society.” Manderson praised the judges, saying: “Sarah, Samira and Chris have done a tremendous job and it is with great joy that we present their chosen shortlist. I look forward to finding out which of the three titles they deem most worthy of winning in June.” The winner of the £10,000 prize will be revealed at a ceremony at Fortnum &amp; Mason in London on 20 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/may/01/if-student-maintenance-grants-are-coming-back-who-will-pay-for-them","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T06:30:34Z","webTitle":"If student maintenance grants are coming back, who will pay for them? | David Morris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/01/if-student-maintenance-grants-are-coming-back-who-will-pay-for-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/01/if-student-maintenance-grants-are-coming-back-who-will-pay-for-them","fields":{"headline":"If student maintenance grants are coming back, who will pay for them?","bodyText":"Back when student maintenance grants were abolished in 2015, universities seemed relatively relaxed. Ignoring the student protests over how they would cope with high costs of living, universities were quietly satisfied that at least the changes came in tandem with an inflationary rise in tuition fees, linked to their performance in the teaching excellence framework. How times have changed. Three years on, and the inflationary increase for tuition fees is gone. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, has now hinted strongly in the review of post-18 education and funding that maintenance grants will return, to remedy the high levels of debt among graduates from the lowest-income households. May was in the cabinet that abolished maintenance grants. But it seems she’s changed her mind now that reintroducing them makes sense politically. Students in further and higher education – particularly those without the good fortune to be supported by parents or relatives – fit the definition of the “just about managing” (or Jam). And help with living costs appeals not only to students but also to the many parents who find themselves covering the gap between the standard maintenance loan and the cost of rent. Indeed, research by MoneySavingExpert suggests the government expects parents to contribute up to £5,552 annually. Reintroducing grants to help students with the cost of living would also provide relief for the government by drawing political attention away from the thorny matter of tuition fees. Evidence from the National Educational Opportunities Network [pdf] suggests that fears about the cost of living are preventing some university applicants from selecting their ideal choice of university or course. Expensive rent is probably far more of a barrier to widening access than expensive fees, since students don’t repay these until after graduation. Furthermore, grants make the system fairer. A new report from the National Union of Students argues that the barriers caused by experiencing poverty during education create additional costs that many middle-class students don’t have to face. As well as the additional debt taken on for maintenance, students from poorer backgrounds who go on to higher earnings have to pay the additional interest accrued. This “poverty premium” can also be found in tuition fees for access courses, additional time navigating the complexities of hardship funds or the benefits system, longer travel times to study, private renter guarantor schemes, and interest accrued on commercial debts such as payday lending. The question, it seems, isn’t about whether to reintroduce maintenance grants – that case has already been made. Instead, it’s about how it will be done, and who will pay for it. In theory, if May really wants to address student support, she might look to Wales. Its recent review of higher education funding, chaired by Sir Ian Diamond, will result in students receiving living cost support equivalent to the National Living Wage for 37.5 hours per week, for 30 weeks. The poorest students will get almost all of this in grant form, and all students will receive at least £1,000 of their maintenance allowance as a grant. The problem with imitating the Welsh system is that it was funded by replacing a government tuition fee subsidy with full fees now equivalent to the English system. The government in Whitehall has no such headroom, and has explicitly declared that the latest review “must be consistent with the Government’s fiscal policies to reduce the deficit”. This suggests that there is no spare cash to give away, unless it can be found from somewhere inside the current system. The obvious place for the government to look might be in existing tuition fees, or whatever is left of the current teaching grant. This is why Universities UK has caveated its support for reintroducing maintenance grants, which it argues should be “funded by new investment”. In recent years universities have usually won the political tussle with students for government funding. Fees have trebled despite student protests, and average university incomes per student have increased significantly despite the abolition of the teaching grant. For many students it will feel unfair that their maintenance support has not grown at anything like a similar rate. This time around, universities will have to convince government to find additional spending, or it will be their pockets that are raided.

The notion that we are innocent until proven guilty is sacrosanct for one – but for me as a journalist? The freedom of the press. When I applied for press accreditation to attend the Labour party conference in June 2017, I assumed there’d be no issues. I pay my subs to the National Union of Journalists and have a press card, identification formally recognised by all police forces in the UK. I’m an active member of the Labour party and have interviewed its leadership on many occasions, in Westminster, at Glastonbury, or on the tube. I’ve also never been arrested, charged, convicted or cautioned for a criminal offence, and have reported from party conferences before. For those who report and comment on politics for a living, the event is unmissable, and so I made preparations to attend. Months went by and I received no confirmation that I’d been accepted. There was no issue from the Labour party – I was told they were awaiting the police to sign off my security check. It was only on 20 September that I received an email informing me I hadn’t passed the police test. The Labour party told me all I could do was contact the police. I honestly thought it was just a mistake. A sergeant told me bluntly the force would “not divulge the reasons” for this infringement of my civil liberties. My only right of recourse was to pay a fee to find out what information the police held on me through a subject access request. This process takes up to 40 days, by that point the conference would long be over, and in any case it wouldn’t change their decision. Despite my best efforts to communicate directly with the force, this was the extent of what any officer would say to me. I felt I had little choice but to instruct solicitors to try to get some answers. It has been an arduous (and expensive) process ever since, but on Wednesday, my case will finally be heard in a court of law. From institutional racism to deaths in custody, there are many graver examples of police forces in Britain needing to be held to account. But as the enforcers of the law, it’s vital that police actions are scrutinised and don’t go unchecked. We are now a little closer to understanding what the police have been doing for years, but far from providing reassurance and answers, this legal process has unearthed some uncomfortable realities about the way the police conduct themselves. The police had long been using a secret policy to determine who they deemed fit to go to party conferences, with police intelligence (whatever that might mean) regarding an individual’s “mental illness”, “immigration offences”, “dishonesty” and “protests” all listed as possible reasons to refuse their right to attend. This unpublished policy may well prove illegal: secret policies compromise fairness and transparency, which are crucial when upholding the rule of law. My legal action has exposed something even more sinister: the rationale for refusing my access to this Labour party conference. The police have based their decision on the fact that while I was a student I engaged in peaceful protests, and secondly that I work as a journalist – it’s as simple as that. Witness statements from the officers cite my time as a student campaigner as a reason to bar me: a time when I was elected as a student union officer and was voted on to the National Union of Students’ national executive council. The criminalisation of peaceful protest is all too common; I was dragged through a long and arduous ordeal when my vice-chancellor decided to boot five students (myself included) out of our university for being part of a peaceful political campaign. The university made defamatory allegations against me, and agreed to apologise as part of an out of court settlement. A statement was read out in court that set the record straight. This attempt by the police to punish me sets a worrying precedent: engage in politics and peaceful activism as a student, and it’ll come back to haunt you one day. The other reason cited for labelling me as an “extreme leftwing” activist is my journalism. The police force in question cite the coverage of a specific story, one that saw me report on a group of activists in the summer of 2016. I received a text message from an unknown source – a tipoff – and so I headed down to a central London location with a photographer, not entirely sure what to expect. In response to immigration raids at the Byron Burger chain, I watched as bugs were let loose by activists in one of their branches. I filed my story, and gave it little more thought. My reporting was picked up by the Guardian and ITV – this was a national news story, and I had broken it first. The police are now saying my presence indicated I was “involved” in the action, an entirely baseless accusation. They say that by reporting on a story I indicate I think it is “acceptable”, because I chose not to “intervene or walk away”. This is not the first time police forces have treated journalists as extremists for doing their job. A fundamental tenet of journalism is that we aren’t responsible for that which we report on, we are observers who document what we see. Access to exclusives or stories that might otherwise go unreported are dependant on sources, and the foundation of these relationships is trust. It would undermine press freedom if journalists were required to act as an arm of the state. Labelling journalists extremists for carrying out their work is an affront to press freedom, and criminalising individuals for taking part in peaceful protests – as students or otherwise – must not be normalised in a functioning democracy. It shouldn’t take a court case to point that out. • Michael Segalov is news editor at Huck magazine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/summit-north-south-korea-peace-kim-jong-un","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:59:04Z","webTitle":"At this summit, North and South Korea took a real step towards peace | Mary Dejevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/summit-north-south-korea-peace-kim-jong-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/summit-north-south-korea-peace-kim-jong-un","fields":{"headline":"At this summit, North and South Korea took a real step towards peace","bodyText":"One of the striking features of the usually ponderous world of diplomacy is how fast events can move if the political will is there. Today’s meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea at Panmunjom, and those few steps by Kim Jong-un on to southern territory, as he held Moon Jae-in’s hand, must represent one of the sharpest and speediest diplomatic turnarounds in living memory. The leaders later issued a joint statement calling for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and agreeing to talk about formally signing a peace treaty. Can this rapprochement last? There are already plenty of observers, on all sides, counselling caution. This one meeting, however cordial, whatever its historic significance, could remain just that – a promising beginning left to peter out, rather like the Korean “sunshine diplomacy” of the 1990s. Once the two sides try to get into the detail of nuclear capabilities and missiles, everything could fall apart. The periodically volatile politics of the South could also play their part. But sharp and speedy turnarounds in diplomacy do not have to be fleeting. They reflect an investment by all sides – and in this case a considerable investment by erstwhile “rocket man” Kim Jong-un. It is less than six months since he was ordering nuclear tests, boasting of missiles that could strike the US, and essentially yelling at the US president across the airwaves. Now, as the television pictures from the Korean demilitarised zone, showed, there would seem to be a new, calmer, Kim – who looked not only less belligerent, but somehow older and more considered. It is not hard to identify the obstacles in the way of defusing one of the longest and potentially most dangerous sources of tension in the world today. But there are many new positives, too. After a rocky, and at times ruthless start, Kim appears to have consolidated his authority. He may now have space to negotiate. Moon, for his part, has family in the North, and visited as a junior diplomat during the “sunshine” period; he may be more open to a change in the situation than some of his predecessors. In taking that step into the South, becoming the first North Korean leader to do so, Kim broke a taboo about recognising the country’s division that has hitherto thwarted moves to conclude a formal peace treaty. The lack of such a treaty is a reason why the Korean peninsula has remained such a source of regional tension. Within the space of a few months, Kim also appears to have accepted almost every concession demanded as the price for a meeting with Donald Trump. Denuclearisation will be on the table; missile tests have been suspended, perhaps halted. There will be no demand that the US end its military presence in the south. The bluster of those few months ago – the “my button is bigger than your button” exchange – needs to be seen for what it was, and the nuclear boasts, too: less a threat to world peace than a reflection of vulnerability, and a plea for recognition and help. Barack Obama had half-understood this. He modified aspects of the regular joint US-South Korean military exercises, when he realised how panicked the North was by US stealth bomber flights. He discerned in Kim’s offensive stance not action, but reaction. Trump went further: he played the – perilous – rhetorical game, while also daring to dangle the prize Kim really wanted: recognition, respect, direct talks. Trump’s role here was crucial. He gambled that he understood Kim’s motives, and risked putting the dignity of the US presidency on the line. But there has also been regional underpinning. Last month, Kim made his first – semi-clandestine – foreign trip as North Korean leader to China, which had quietly been applying an economic squeeze to its difficult neighbour. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, met Trump (again) in Florida last week. Today’s scenes from Panmunjom had, if not blessing, then at least acquiescence in the region. Not all diplomatic statements deserve to be taken at face value. But some do, and there are dangers to always looking for malign secondary meanings that are simply not there. This is how South Korea perceived Kim Jong-un’s intentions: “[He] said that he came here to put an end to the history of conflict, discuss and remove obstacles between us … He said let’s meet more often and we should be determined not to go back to square one … let’s live up to all the expectations and create a better world.” Is it not worth, for once, giving optimism a chance? • Mary Dejevsky is a former foreign correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-late","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'late'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-late","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/29/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-late","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'late'","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘late.’ Share your photos of what late means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

The 34-year-old ended with a moment to treasure, driving Antey past Barry Geraghty on a more fancied rival to steal the race by a nose. Without telling anyone beyond her immediate family, Walsh had been planning for about a fortnight to retire when she next rode a winner, wherever it happened to be. That it should happen at this prestigious week which closes the Irish season was pure luck, as she was picked for the ride on Antey about five minutes before climbing on his back. Noel Fehily was originally booked but he was injured during the day and was soon joined in hospital by Danny Mullins, the first choice to replace him. Willie Mullins, trainer of Antey, then asked for Rachael Blackmore, only to be told she had gone to hospital too, to keep another injured rider company. Such are the perils of jump racing, which Walsh will now be spared. A desperate Mullins was scanning the weighing room for a rider who was still in one piece when she crossed his path and was beckoned over. It turned out to be the final booking of her career. “It’s just the right time for me,” said Walsh, adding that “next on the list” is having children. “Marvellous career, nothing but unbelievable memories. I’d like to go out while this is all going. I’d be the first person, sitting at home, saying: ‘Jaysus, when is she going to hang up her boots?’ I wanted to go out on my own terms.” Along with her sister-in-law, Nina Carberry, Walsh proved that a woman can have a long and successful career as a jump jockey, her highlights beginning with a double at the Cheltenham Festival in 2010. She won an Irish Grand National, had winners in France and Australia and took part in six Grand Nationals, completing the course five times. Perhaps most significantly of all, Seabass was sent off as the National favourite on both occasions she rode him in the Aintree race. While they came up short, finishing third in 2012, for Britain’s punters to trust a female jockey with their money in the most demanding race of all represents a major change in attitude from the position before her career began. Walsh’s announcement was just the latest moment of drama in a week of shocks here, which included the earlier fall of the hotly fancied Samcro in the Champion Hurdle. He came down at the third-last, taking with him the last hopes of a first championship for his trainer, Gordon Elliott. “It’s a great game to level you,” said a rueful Elliott, who started the week with a lead of more than €400,000 over Mullins. “But we keep smiling and keep going.” The previously unbeaten Samcro was reported unhurt and no decision is likely to be taken for some time about whether he continues as a hurdler next season or goes over fences. The race was won by Supasundae, retrieving something from the week for his jockey, Robbie Power, and his owners, the Potts family, who were robbed of possible glory on Tuesday when Finian’s Oscar was carried out at the final fence by an errant rival. “I’ve been knocking on the door all week,” Power said. “I was always told, if you keep knocking on it, it eventually opens and thank God it did.” Mullins, champion trainer for the 11th time in a row, said: “I’m gutted for Gordon. I know what it’s like and he’s got a fantastic team of people around him and they’ve worked very hard for it. I like winning it but I certainly don’t take any pleasure out of beating a very good competitor. We’re all in the one game, it’s a small country over here and it would have been great if it could have been a draw because his team works hard and he works hard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/my-heart-ticks-when-i-have-sex-and-it-affects-my-performance","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"My heart ‘ticks’ when I have sex and it affects my performance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/my-heart-ticks-when-i-have-sex-and-it-affects-my-performance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/30/my-heart-ticks-when-i-have-sex-and-it-affects-my-performance","fields":{"headline":"My heart ‘ticks’ when I have sex and it affects my performance","bodyText":"I had heart surgery to insert a mechanical valve and now I can hear it ‘ticking’ away loudly when I am on top during intercourse.

Of course, my partner worries that it is her that I don’t find her attractive, but that is not true. Many people find that intrusive thoughts, images and other distracting stimuli affect their ability to sustain arousal through to orgasm. But if the experience itself is largely imbued with pleasure, the waxing and waning of an erection as a perfectly normal part of the process really doesn’t matter, does it? The idea that a sexual experience must start with desire or arousal then continue straight through to climax without a hitch is simply mythology. Try to embrace this idea and relax. Focus on the giving and receiving of pleasure without having a goal of reaching orgasm in a specific or timely fashion – or even at all.

It’s an everyday picture, even when one of them falls over. Except the boy hits his head. The injury is serious. That night the boy dies. One of his pals is Calixto Bieito and this early encounter with the fragility of life will come to obsess Bieito, one of Europe’s most sought-after theatre and opera directors. “I started to see death very near,” he says. “It brought a lot of fear that I would lose my parents when I was a child.” Anxiety disorder set in. Bieito threw up at school, suffered disrupted sleep and developed phobias. Years later, he found it harder and harder to fly. From his home in Barcelona, he would take the train: to Edinburgh for the international festival, to Dublin via the ferry, to Copenhagen, Salzburg, Paris … “It was crazy,” he says. After two years of this, a friend pointed out how absurd his overland travelling had become. His wife, the actor Roser Cami, was equally troubled. She worried that he was permanently scared something would happen to her and their young son. Finally, he sought medical help. His doctor prescribed medication to treat his anxiety. Within two weeks he was taking planes again. “Anxiety and depression have things in common, but in simple terms, with anxiety, you are worried about everything and with depression, you don’t care about anything,” Bieito says. “Anxiety, anguish or angst is something that is inside all of us. I am not special in this – it is common.” Twenty years on, the 54-year-old explores mental illness in his latest production, a music-theatre collage called The String Quartet’s Guide to Sex and Anxiety. “It’s a kind of poem, a kind of concert,” he says, just off the plane from his home in Basel, when we meet at Birmingham Rep. “I hope it gives people a lot of hope.” When I suggest his entire career could be boiled down to music, sex and anxiety, he is initially surprised. There are, he points out, productions where he has taken other routes, such as his spiritual version of Wagner’s Parsifal in Stuttgart in 2010. “I’m very associated in Britain with sex and violence, and when you are doing Verdi or Shakespeare, of course, it’s full of violence,” he says. “But my landscape is much bigger. Like everybody, I have not just one face.” Yet this is a director who has blazed his way through the worlds of theatre and opera with productions that are as revelatory as they are frank. It was Bieito who set Mozart’s Die Entführung aus dem Serail in a brothel, complete with fetishism, masturbation and urination. His adaptation of Michel Houellebecq’s Platform came complete with dead-eyed pornographic video footage. And if it’s anxiety you’re after, he staged a production of Hamlet just weeks after he lost his own father. “It was very tough,” he admits. But as we talk, he warms to my suggestion. “It’s a very personal show,” he says, sitting in front of a mirrored rehearsal room wall plastered with images evoking depression and isolation to inspire the company. “The topics of sex, anxiety and music have recurred a lot in my life.” Had it been down to him, he’d have called the show The Anatomy of Melancholy, after the encyclopedic study by 17th-century scholar Robert Burton, whom he calls the British Montaigne. With a nod to the box office, however, he’s gone for a title that sums up a show in which the Heath Quartet will play angsty Ligeti, while four actors draw on texts ranging from WH Auden’s The Age of Anxiety to Byung-Chul Han’s The Burnout Society. “The show is not just about anxiety disorder,” he says. “It is also about existential thinking and music, which is a very important part of my whole life.” The actors see it the same way. “I feel as if Calixto is directing us musically, like an orchestra,” says Mairead McKinley, who stars alongside Cathy Tyson, Miltos Yerolemou and Nick Harris. “I don’t feel I’m being directed; I feel I’m being orchestrated.” Personal it may be, but Bieito refuses to see his working life as therapy. “To have a rehearsal with music every day and the possibility to express myself is important,” he says. “Therapy is not the right word, but it gives me freedom and a lot of hope. I love my work. It’s the place where I’m completely relaxed.” The String Quartet’s Guide to Sex and Anxiety is at Birmingham Rep, 12–19 May. Box office: 0121-236 4455. Then at Brighton festival, 23–24 May.

At least that is how it appeared as the world’s newest double act – the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in – met at the world’s most militarised border. There was no enmity as the two greeted each other at a uniquely peaceful point on the 155-mile (250km) border, and both men took great pains to ensure their meeting produced a positive appearance. Moments after Kim crossed into the South, Moon asked when he would be allowed to visit the North and in an unscripted moment the two held hands and hopped over a low concrete barrier that marks the frontier. The good-natured atmosphere was the best both sides could have hoped for. Kim wanted to project the image of a capable statesman on the international stage, not the youthful leader of a pariah nation. Moon ensured the day’s events were filled with symbolism that reinforced concepts of peace and unity. The two planted a tree that dated from the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, and Seoul’s unification ministry commissioned five perfumes to be blended based on stories of elderly North Koreans who fled south during the conflict. A dinner menu was devised to highlight the leaders’ backgrounds, and delicacies from both sides were served. In many ways Moon had been preparing for this moment his entire life. He was the presidential chief of staff during the last inter-Korean summit, in 2007, and his election marked a shift in policy towards Pyongyang after a decade of conservative presidents in the South. After posing for photos, the pair walked along an red carpet to review an honour guard, some of whom wore traditional garb, perhaps a nod to a shared history when all Korean soldiers had the same uniform. In the face of the South Korean military band Kim was noticeably nervous, breathing heavily while standing stiff as Moon saluted his troops. When Kim and Moon finally sat down, Kim pledged to “write a new chapter” in their peninsula’s troubled history and Moon hailed the visit to the border village of Panmunjom as “a symbol of peace not division”. The North Korean leader’s eccentricities were also on display, serving as a reminder of his isolation and paranoia. A phalanx of bodyguards jogged around Kim’s black Mercedes limousine as he drove back and forth. A North Korean security team reportedly swept the summit room for listening devices and explosives, as well as spraying disinfectant on the chairs and guestbook. In the afternoon, the two took a stroll on a bridge where Moon did most of the talking and Kim again appeared nervous, frequently adjusting his tortoiseshell glasses. The only smile was a quick flash for the camera, and then he returned to a deep frown that would remain for the rest of the day. “The mood, atmosphere and chemistry was good between the two leaders, you could tell they both really wanted a good outcome,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum. “You can tell they shared common objectives for peace, firmly rooted in the two Koreas determining their future and not being swayed by outside forces.” The day ended with a joint declaration promising peace and “complete denuclearisation”, but it remained to be seen how these would be achieved. After signing the agreement, Kim and Moon embraced and posed for photos with their hands held high. Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, arrived just before dinner, a further step in her husband’s effort to craft an image of an ordinary head of state, and another round of commemorative photos ensued. Even Kim remarked: “We’ve taken a lot of pictures today.” The cultivation of a positive mood and chummy relationship was clearly meant to provide momentum to any meeting between Kim and Trump, which could take place as early as next month. “We hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today,” Kim said, standing next to Moon as they announced the joint declaration. “We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/27/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-signs-of-plastic-even-swiss-mountains-are-polluted","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T12:16:29Z","webTitle":"The hills are alive with the signs of plastic: even Swiss mountains are polluted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-signs-of-plastic-even-swiss-mountains-are-polluted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/27/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-signs-of-plastic-even-swiss-mountains-are-polluted","fields":{"headline":"The hills are alive with the signs of plastic: even Swiss mountains are polluted","bodyText":"Microplastic pollution contaminates soil across Switzerland, even in remote mountains, new research reveals. The scientists said the problem could be worse in other nations with poorer waste management and that research was urgently needed to see if microplastics get into food. In the first major study of microplastics in soil, the researchers analysed soil samples from 29 river flood plains in nature reserves across Switzerland. They found microplastics, fragments under 5mm in size, in 90% of the soils. The scientists believe the particles are carried across the country by the wind. Research on microplastic pollution to date has largely concentrated on the oceans, in which it is found across the globe, including the Arctic. The particles have been shown to harm marine life and can absorb toxins from the water. Record levels of microplastics were revealed in rivers by research released in March and last year tap water around the world was found to contain plastic fibres. Other studies have found microplastics in bottled water, which prompted the World Health Organization to launch a review, as well as in beer, honey and salt. However, almost no research has yet been done on whether the particles end up being widely consumed by people and whether they are harmful. Michael Scheurer and Moritz Bigalke at the Geographical Institute of the University of Bern, conducted the new research, which is published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. “These findings are alarming,” Scheurer said. “For example, new studies indicate that microplastics in the soil can be harmful to and even kill earthworms in the soil.” Microplastics were found even in remote mountain regions that can only be reached by foot. “We were really surprised,” said Bigalke. “All the areas were in national parks. We thought we might find one or two plastic particles, but we found a lot.” Between 70-80% of the particles found were smaller than 0.5mm and the researchers said they are most likely to be blown across the country. “We think it has to be transported by the wind,” said Bigalke. “There is no other explanation – there are no settlements there [in the mountains], no tourism.” Almost 100% of the plastic used in Switzerland is either recycled or incinerated, the highest rate in Europe. In places where waste management is poorer and more plastic enters the environment, soil contamination could be higher, Bigalke said: “The problem could be even worse in other countries.” “There is a need for research into the question of how microplastics affect food production, and whether it can get into the food chain,” he said. Microplastic contamination in agricultural soils could be even worse, said Bigalke. They are known to be present in the sewage sludge produced at water treatment plants and this sludge is sometimes used as fertiliser on fields. Another new study found microplastics in fertiliser produced from food and garden waste. Bigalke said it was estimated that the application of sewage sludge to arable land alone could transport more could microplastics into the soil than that entering the world’s oceans. One of the very few studies into microplastics in food examined backyard chickens in Mexico. The researchers found 57 particles per gramme in the gizzards of the chickens. “Chicken gizzard is a specialty in the Mexican kitchen and the intake of the present plastics form a strong risk for human health,” the scientists said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/windrush-scandal-uk-immigration-chagos-islands-benjamin-zephaniah","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:03:30Z","webTitle":"Windrush is only the latest UK immigration scandal: just ask the Chagossians | Benjamin Zephaniah","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/windrush-scandal-uk-immigration-chagos-islands-benjamin-zephaniah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/windrush-scandal-uk-immigration-chagos-islands-benjamin-zephaniah","fields":{"headline":"Windrush is only the latest UK immigration scandal: just ask the Chagossians","bodyText":"I am the Windrush generation.

And I know that I would feel it even more if it wasn’t for the fact that I was born in England.

Lives that they have been building for more than half a century in some cases. When I hear the story of the father who missed his daughter’s wedding, I feel a fire burning in the pit of my stomach. When I hear of a mother mourning her son who she saw driven to death by the stress caused to him by the Home Office, that fire burns more, because I know that could have been me, and that could have been my mother.

But the plight of these people has caused me such pain – and I cannot understand why this feeling is not shared by all. Yes, the Chagossian community is relatively small. Roughly 3,000 live in the UK and several thousand more live abroad, which might be why they are often overlooked – but their story is equally tragic and has echoes of the tragedy of the Windrush generation. The Chagos Islands are a UK Overseas Territory, like the Falklands or Gibraltar. They are members of the Commonwealth – that place where equality and democracy are promoted. That place where we are supposed to take care of each other. But in the 1960s and 70s, the islands’ inhabitants were violently removed by the UK government and discarded on the docks of Mauritius and the Seychelles. The UK government had leased Diego Garcia, the archipelago’s largest island, to the US military. Since being forced out of their homeland, the Chagossians have faced extreme racism and poverty. Many valiantly fought for their right to return, and continue to do so, but so far they have been unsuccessful. The campaign continues. But today, many Chagossians in the UK face an altogether different challenge. Marie Milaze, 44, was born in Mauritius to Chagossian parents. Following a legal change in 2002 she, like all the first generation of Chagossians born in exile, was given British nationality. She has three children stuck in Mauritius, and now lives in Crawley with her son, Mervin. But Mervin, who has just turned 18, could face deportation if Marie cannot raise the money for a visa. The Home Office is asking for £2,500 for his initial visa – never mind the cost of obtaining citizenship by “naturalisation”, which could set her back more than £10,000 over five years. Outrageous, I say. She and her children have done no crime. They did not ask to be taken from their homeland and made stateless. Marie’s story is sadly typical. Many Chagossian families do not meet the income criteria to bring children with them and even the few who do struggle with immigration fees. For half a century the Chagos Islanders have suffered at the hands of the UK government. That they are being punished for trying to build a life in the country that caused them this hardship is frankly insulting. Of course, the legal reasons for the problems experienced by the Chagossians are different to those of Windrush – but there are a number of striking similarities. Both groups are now trying to live and contribute to a country that has already caused many of them – and their ancestors – a level of hardship unimaginable to most. Both are now facing deportation for doing so. The UK’s largest Chagossian community is in Crawley, West Sussex. In January, the local MP Henry Smith tabled a bill that seeks to allow anyone of Chagossian descent to register as a British national. It is not the revolution I would like – but I and the community have seen in the bill a glimmer a hope. “It will not solve everything. But it would make my life so much easier,” says Marie. The bill is unlikely to become law unless the government supports it. The people of the Chagos – like those of the Windrush generation – have been treated with utter contempt by their government. As the government begins to make amends with those of the Windrush generation, the home secretary has a unique opportunity to show some integrity and some willing – and stop the horrific second exile of the Chagos Islanders. Make some noise for the Windrush generation, then make more noise for the Chagos Islanders, because none of us are free until all of us are free. • Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet and patron of the UK Chagos Support Association"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/dark-clouds-west-brom-relegation-premier-league-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T12:42:00Z","webTitle":"Dark clouds over the Black Country as West Brom await their relegation fate | Stuart James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/dark-clouds-west-brom-relegation-premier-league-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/dark-clouds-west-brom-relegation-premier-league-championship","fields":{"headline":"Dark clouds over the Black Country as West Brom await their relegation fate","bodyText":"Adrian Chiles has been contemplating his beloved West Bromwich Albion’s seemingly inevitable relegation from the Premier League, trying to explain what it all means in the context of football tribalism in the region and picturing the nightmare scenario that would deliver a few more painful blows. “There was a famous year when we overhauled Wolves after being 11 points behind them and ended up getting promoted to the Premier League and they didn’t,” Chiles says, referring to the 2001-02 season. “I remember [the former Led Zeppelin singer] Robert Plant saying at the time that as a Wolves fan he didn’t dare go out unless it was under cover of night. Well, I think we’re feeling exactly the same way now. It’s a bitter pill to swallow. And don’t forget we’re facing the perfect storm, where Wolves have gone up, Villa could go up and Middlesbrough, managed by [Tony] Pulis, could go up as well. Then we’d have a triple kick in the Niagaras, as Gary Megson might have called it.” For Albion, who have been flying the Premier League flag for the West Midlands for two seasons, a chastening return to the Championship beckons. Despite Darren Moore’s best attempts to breathe new life into the club since replacing Alan Pardew, Albion’s fate is all but sealed as they travel to Newcastle on Saturday eight points adrift of safety with three matches remaining. It has been such a miserable season, delivering two victories in the past 33 league games and an endless flow of bad news, that it is tempting to think dropping down a division may be no bad thing in the short term if it gives fans the chance to rediscover the joy of watching their team win again. Chiles is the wrong person to try to convince with that argument. “I was at QPR in April 1986, when we got relegated. Everybody was sure we would come straight back up. I was just going off to university at the time, aged 19. By the time we got back in the top flight I was 35 and half a lifetime had gone by. So there are no guarantees.” Although Albion won promotion four times in nine seasons before this stint in the top flight, the difference between then and now is that the club was geared up for that yo-yo existence a decade ago. After seven successive years in the Premier League, no one was thinking about Championship football, especially after finishing last summer’s transfer window with the division’s fifth-highest net spend. “I’ve seen very bad seasons,” reflects Norman Bartlam, a local historian who has been following Albion for 50 years. “The Don Howe and Ron Saunders eras were just awful but in a way we grew to accept it because we expected bad things. But this season we didn’t. We thought we were established in the Premier League. So it’s come as a real shock.” Bartlam lays the blame largely at the door of the Albion hierarchy. “The inertia in the board – the club just froze and didn’t do anything about it. Those of us on the terraces were screaming: ‘Get rid of Pulis.’ Then we were screaming: ‘Don’t get Pardew.’ And then within three games of having Pardew, we were screaming: ‘Get rid of Pardew.’ The board were just like rabbits in the headlights. What was really shocking for me as well was seeing the players drained not just of confidence but interest.” Albion’s decision to sack Pulis still fuels an ill-informed debate outside of the Hawthorns, namely that getting rid of a man who had never been relegated was their biggest mistake. It is an argument that overlooks the fact Albion had won two of their previous 21 league matches – Pulis’s worst run of results for 13 years – and just how fed up supporters were with the style of football. On top of that, Pulis, as anyone who sat through his final two press conferences will tell you, looked and sounded as if he wanted to be out the door. “I like Tony and I thought he was right for us at the time,” Chiles says. “I interviewed him last season and he could not have been more positive about the club’s future. But something started going wrong at the end of last season and had gone completely wrong by the time we played Huddersfield away [in early November]. When the entire away support has turned against you, your days are numbered. Something had stopped working and, I must say, that’s partly a problem when you’ve got an absentee owner. “We’ll see what he [Guochuan Lai] is made of now. I don’t judge him at all. He seems like a good guy and he’s put money in the club. But if you’re not smelling the same air as the fans, if you’re not at the games week in and week out, you can’t really know what’s going on. And from where he was sitting, it might have seemed premature to get rid of the ‘dead cert’ Pulis. But I promise you, if he’d made the journey to Huddersfield, he would have known that Tony had to go then.” As for Pardew, the local Express &amp; Star probably summed it up best when it wrote he is “destined to go down as one of the worst managers in Albion’s history, if not the worst”. Pardew’s appointment was nothing short of a disaster, contributed to three board members being sacked, and will be forever remembered for the ill-fated trip to Barcelona that led to four senior players – Gareth Barry, Jonny Evans, Jake Livermore and Boaz Myhill – breaking a curfew and allegedly stealing a taxi. “That shows how much respect they had for that manager – and that showed on the pitch,” says Ally Robertson, who played more than 500 games for Albion. “Now Darren has come in, he’s Albion through and through, the loveliest lad you could wish to meet, and you can see the players wanting to win. I’m just hoping we can get some respect back in the last few games and build for next season.” Rebuilding will be far from easy. Ben Foster and Chris Brunt, two stalwarts, have pledged their future but many others will depart in pursuit of the Premier League football they signed up for and, in other cases, to enable the club to recoup some money. There is also the not-so-small matter of identifying a new manager and, with all that in mind, it feels like a curious decision to appoint Giuliano Terraneo, a 64-year-old Italian who has never worked in English football before, as technical consultant. Whether that works or not, Albion know that the balance of power has shifted in the West Midlands for a season at least and that few people other than Albion fans will lose any sleep over it. “It pains me to say this,” Chiles adds, “but in terms of the impact on the community and the area, if Villa and Wolves end up going up, that fills the credibility gap that we’ve left behind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/may/01/tracy-brabin-put-joy-back-into-early-years-education","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T05:45:33Z","webTitle":"Tracy Brabin: ‘We need to put the joy back into early years education’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/01/tracy-brabin-put-joy-back-into-early-years-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/01/tracy-brabin-put-joy-back-into-early-years-education","fields":{"headline":"Tracy Brabin: ‘We need to put the joy back into early years education’","bodyText":"When the former TV soap star and screenwriter-turned-MP Tracy Brabin took up the office of shadow minister for early years last July, she knew she wasn’t an obvious choice for the role. “I’m not an educationist. I haven’t come from a political background. But I was a free-school-dinners kid and I’ve got a lot of common sense.” Earlier this year, the MP revealed she endured homelessness as a young child, after her family lost their home and were waiting to be rehoused by the council. Her father was a factory worker. Education, she says, made a big difference to her life. Brabin was elected MP for Batley and Spen in a byelection triggered by the murder of Jo Cox, who had become a friend after the two women knocked on doors together during the 2015 general election. When they met, Brabin found the younger woman impressive. “She was an amazing, extraordinary woman. I did think: oh my God, Batley and Spen is bloody lucky to get her.” She saw Cox as a champion for causes close to her heart and gave her first political speech at Cox’s fundraiser during the election campaign. “My sister is a nurse, my mum is a pensioner and my niece is a teacher. They were her constituents and I needed to know they were safe.” At the time, Brabin – who was born in Batley and educated at nearby Heckmondwike grammar school – was best known for her role as Tricia Armstrong on Coronation Street in the late 1990s. The first person in her family to get a degree, she studied drama at Loughborough University and did an MA in screenwriting at the London College of Communications, before going on to write for Heartbeat, Hollyoaks and Shameless. “Jo was the one who said to me, Tracy you should think about doing politics.” Her remit, early years, is an important one. By the time pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds leave secondary school, they are 19.2 months behind their more affluent peers, a recent report by the Education Policy Institute [pdf] shows. In the early years, however, the gap is just 4.2 months and multiple studies have indicated that interventions at this point have the potential significantly to narrow the attainment gap over the long-term. Despite this, the EPI report concluded that at the current rate of government intervention, it will take 50 years for the UK to close the gap. Brabin says: “We have to make sure that, wherever a nursery is located in the country, the funding is at a level that will close the social mobility gap. For me, that’s a powerful driver.” Nurseries should be hiring graduates and be graduate-led, she says. Increasing wages would help. “But it’s not just about higher wages. We also need to encourage research and development, and be curious about best practice. We need talented staff to be given opportunities for professional self-development.” This will be music to the ears of nursery owners and childminders, who have been arguing for years that the government’s funding of the sector is insufficient. Between 2009 and 2016, figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies show spending per pupil in early years was cut by about 17% in real terms. Since the 2015 election, Ofsted reports there has been a net loss of more than 1,000 good or outstanding nurseries. Brabin is worried the early years sector is in crisis: “a ticking timebomb”. The UK is virtually alone in western Europe in providing early years education via the market, even though there is evidence that state-provided nursery schools employing trained teachers secure better long-term outcomes for children. In 2017, the Low Pay Commission [pdf] reported that one in six workers in the childcare sector are paid the minimum wage and, as a result, some settings expect to close after rises in the minimum wage this year. “That is madness,” says Brabin. “It’s a sector that’s been undervalued.” She sees the government’s plans for new baseline assessments in reception as a step backwards. “Talking to practitioners, it seems pretty unanimous that baseline assessments are unpopular. To assess all children in a setting on just one day when they might be tired or unwell seems inefficient, when the adults caring for them, day in, day out, might be better placed to judge each child’s abilities. There’s also a troubling emphasis on maths and English when creativity and play can be powerful indications of capabilities among young children.” As Labour calls for opinions from the public about what its proposed National Education Service should look like, Brabin doesn’t want to talk about how her party intends to address some of the broader issues – whether it should phase out grammar schools, or what the party would do about increasing local accountability in academies, for example, although she personally thinks “local authority input in schools is vital, absolutely vital”. She is also reluctant to say exactly how much more money Labour would invest in early years. Detailed policy plans are still at “a development stage”. “Just at the moment, it’s about listening to the sector and working with the most successful practitioners.” She has one clear aim in mind. “I think that joy has been knocked out of the sector because of Ofsted and gradings and wages and pressure from on high. Let’s find the joy. It isn’t about money always, it’s about a quality of positivity. We have to trust early years practitioners to know what they are doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/06/seven-stories-newcastle-browse-a-bookshop","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"Browse a bookshop: Seven Stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/06/seven-stories-newcastle-browse-a-bookshop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/06/seven-stories-newcastle-browse-a-bookshop","fields":{"headline":"Browse a bookshop: Seven Stories","bodyText":"“We are a children’s bookshop attached to Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children’s Books,” says coordinator-buyer Stephanie Hodgson. “We cover ages from birth through to young adult.

Speaking at the end of an extraordinary day that began with a lingering handshake across the demarcation line separating their countries, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, issued a joint statement that was short on detail but offered cause for optimism as the world looks ahead to a summit between Kim and Donald Trump. The US president, in his first comments on the declaration, tweeted: “Good things are happening, but only time will tell!” He later added: “KOREAN WAR TO END!” Speaking at the White House, Trump warned that the US was “not going to be played” by North Korea, later the US president said he was getting close to choosing a venue for talks with Kim. “We’re setting up meetings now,” he said. “We’re down to two countries... and we’ll let you know what that site is.” At a joint press conference with Angela Merkel, Trump said: “Maximum pressure will continue until denuclearisation occurs. I look forward to our meeting, which will be quite something.” The Panmunjom declaration, named after the truce village that hosted the talks on Friday, committed the two Koreas to seek the “complete denuclearisation” of the peninsula. “South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” it said. “South and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and agreed to carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.” The statement did not specify what Pyongyang expected in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons – the regime’s best deterrent against what it regards as a hostile US. Speaking outside the peace house on the southern side of the border that has divided the Korean peninsula for 65 years, the leaders also pledged to push for talks with the US, and possibly China, to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war with a peace treaty to replace the uneasy truce that stopped hostilities. Noting that more than a decade had passed since the countries’ leaders last met, Kim and Moon agreed to talk regularly by phone and meet more often, starting with a summit in Pyongyang in autumn. They vowed to work more closely on a host of bilateral issues, including reuniting families divided by the Korean war and improving cross-border transport links. Months after relations between the two countries sank to their lowest level following North Korean missile launches and its sixth nuclear test, Moon said he and Kim were aware that the hopes of 80 million North and South Koreans rested on their shoulders. “We were able to stand together today and agree that we should denuclearise the Korean peninsula,” Moon said, according to a translation provided by South Korea’s Arirang TV. With Kim standing nearby behind a separate podium, he said. “To completely denuclearise, we declare that we will cooperate to bring about an everlasting peace on the peninsula.” Moon applauded Kim’s “courage and determination” and vowed that “there will be no going back” to an era of tension and provocation that has occasionally brought the neighbours to the brink of conflict. “We are giving a great present to the citizens of the two Koreas,” he said. The goodwill measures would begin with a halt to “all forms of hostility” on land, at sea and in the air, the declaration said. The demilitarised zone – the heavily armed border separating the two countries – and the western maritime border will be turned into “peace zones”. From Tuesday, both countries will suspend all loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts and dismantle broadcasting equipment. They will also stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border. Kim said: “We hope we will not repeat the mistake of the past. I hope this will be an opportunity for the Korean people to move freely from North to South. We need to take responsibility for our own history. “We have waited for this day for a very long time. We are tied by blood and cannot be separated – we are the same country, the same people, and should not be separated by hostility. “We hope we can open a new road towards a new future, and that is why I crossed the demarcation line today. We hope for a new era of peace, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to that.” Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, said the wording of the statement was encouraging, as Kim prepares for his summit with Trump in late May or early June. “It’s good that the nuclear language is in there, and including ‘complete denuclearisation’ is a win for Moon,” she said. “It’s really aimed at setting up the meeting with Trump.” But she said it would have been easy for Kim to agree to the statement since “it reiterates what their position has been all along”, and from Pyongyang’s perspective, denuclearisation would include significant concessions from the US on its military presence in South Korea. “In the grand scheme of things, this declaration is continuing the spirit of the 2007 agreement, and much of what we see in this declaration has been agreed to before,” she said. “But it’s still a long and complicated road ahead.” Earlier, the two leaders signed the joint statement before standing to shake hands. At Moon’s instigation, they joined hands and raised their arms aloft, ending the exchange with an embrace and more of the broad smiles that were a feature of their joint public appearances throughout the day. International reaction to the summit was largely positive. China, the North’s main ally and its biggest economic partner, described the leaders’ handshake as a historic moment. “We applaud the Korean leaders’ historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage,” Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. “We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.” The White House said in a statement that it was “hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean peninsula … [and] looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks”. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, sounded a more cautious note. While “very encouraged” by the summit, he said: “I don’t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea’s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting. Absolutely.” Virginie Grzelczyk, a senior lecturer at Aston University, said: “This is a very long game, and confidence-building will take a lot of time. I am not sure a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump would add anything to this particularly good development in inter-Korean relations today, and it might be that this would blur the line.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/27/cardi-b-sued-for-10m-by-former-manager-and-co-writer","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T13:14:35Z","webTitle":"Cardi B sued for $10m by former manager and co-writer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/27/cardi-b-sued-for-10m-by-former-manager-and-co-writer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/27/cardi-b-sued-for-10m-by-former-manager-and-co-writer","fields":{"headline":"Cardi B sued for $10m by former manager and co-writer","bodyText":"US rapper Cardi B is being sued for $10m (£7.25m) by her former manager, Klenord “Shaft” Raphael, who has accused her of breach of contract and defamation. In a claim filed on 26 April and seen by Variety, the dispute centres on Cardi’s departure from Raphael’s company, World Star Marketing Group, and her new deal with Solid Foundation. The latter is the management arm of Quality Control, the label to whom the rapper’s fiance, Offset, is signed with his group Migos. A statement from a representative for Raphael claims: “Since discovering Cardi B in 2015, Shaft has played an integral role in developing her music career and public image … Shaft is disappointed by her actions to freeze him out of her career, which are detailed in the complaint.” Raphael is credited as a producer and songwriter for Cardi B’s biggest hit, Bodak Yellow, which reached No 1 in the US. He also appears on the songwriting credits of many other songs by her, plus tracks by rap and R&amp;B stars G-Eazy and Tinashe. He claims Offset “is responsible for steering Cardi B to Quality Control”, and that the rapper sent him threatening text messages. He also accuses Cardi B of defamation after she allegedly told Offset and others: “Shaft is robbing me.” Cardi B has yet to comment on the claims. The Guardian has contacted her representatives for comment, but has not yet received a response. Raised in the Bronx, Cardi B was a stripper and was affiliated with a gang. Her music career took off after she was featured in the reality show Love &amp; Hip-Hop, and she gained a huge fanbase for her charismatic Instagram videos. After the success of Bodak Yellow, she has scored other big solo hits such as Bartier Cardi, guested on tracks by Migos and Bruno Mars, and released her widely acclaimed debut album which reached No 1 in the US earlier this month. She is pregnant with her first child, and unveiled the pregnancy when she became the first person to co-host The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. She has since cancelled some forthcoming concerts, but performed at the Billboard Latin music awards this week, and said she will return in September to tour with Bruno Mars. “I might be off from doing performances for a couple of months but in the meantime ima be working my ass off,” she wrote on Twitter. “So many songs, features to do. Working on a lot of deals I sign up for and most importantly nesting. I’m already overwhelmed from the new work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/04/country-diary-wild-boar-rotovating-forest-of-dean","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T04:30:13Z","webTitle":"Country diary: wild boar have been rotovating the woodland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/country-diary-wild-boar-rotovating-forest-of-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/04/country-diary-wild-boar-rotovating-forest-of-dean","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: wild boar have been rotovating the woodland","bodyText":"You can’t miss the signs of wild boar in the Forest of Dean – the road verges appear to have been enthusiastically but amateurishly rotovated. When we visited in January hundreds of square metres around the car park had been worked over, and it did not take much by way of fieldcraft to spot the culprits. A small sounder (family group) of mother and three young were only metres from the cars, intently truffling for root, grub and worm, a blackbird following them as a gull follows the plough. They wield their proud snouts like a blade, slicing into the root layer then slashing vigorously from side to side with a deft twist that turns the ground over. Our fascination turned to alarm as we wondered about the plants – roots that weren’t eaten were severed, mashed, turned up to the sky. On a more recent visit there was still much bare ground (burrowing bees were already making use of it) but then there is still some spring to go in this late season. And, all higgledy-piggledy, the plants were pushing through. Bluebells – buds still cowering in a shawl of leaves – were poking out sideways from upturned clods. Wood sorrel was already in flower, foxgloves and pignut spreading their leaves across the hog-shaken ground. Pignut (surely a piggy favourite) is a member of the carrot family with a swollen root that was a tasty snack of my parents’ childhood (though hard to dig out with mere human tools). The shaded swathes of bluebells were largely untouched – the boar prefer to dig in grassier clearings. Unfortunately this preference for grassy areas brings them into conflict with human inhabitants of the forest, who, like most of us, tend to prefer their lawns and recreation grounds to remain unploughed. It is not hard to imagine the damage that could be done by repeated foraging in a limited area, especially to favoured food-plants. But here the woodland plants had surmounted the onslaught. Wild boar may have only relatively recently been reintroduced to the forest but, blindly guided by evolution, these tough little plants were showing their mettle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/28/sunshine-on-leith-review-proclaimers-musical-goes-the-distance","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Sunshine on Leith review – Proclaimers musical goes the distance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/28/sunshine-on-leith-review-proclaimers-musical-goes-the-distance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/28/sunshine-on-leith-review-proclaimers-musical-goes-the-distance","fields":{"headline":"Sunshine on Leith review – Proclaimers musical goes the distance","bodyText":"Whisper it, but West Yorkshire Playhouse might just be making a case for the much-maligned jukebox musical.

James Brining directed the original 2007 production and this new staging is a return and an ending. It’s an opportunity to revisit the greatest hit of his time as artistic director of Dundee Rep, while concluding one chapter of the Playhouse’s story before it closes for refurbishment. In coming back to the show, he marries the strengths of the piece with the strengths of the space. In this version, an on-stage boozer spills out into the stalls of the Quarry theatre, creating a sense of lager-scented community in an auditorium that can so often feel cavernous and impersonal. Community is also central to the show itself. Stephen Greenhorn’s plot springs from some of the recurring concerns of the Proclaimers’ back catalogue: home, identity, love and Scottishness. In many ways it’s a tale of homecoming, opening as old mates Davy (Steven Miller) and Ally (Paul-James Corrigan) return from war to their beloved Leith and the relationships – both familial and romantic – of civilian life. The more politicised strain of the Proclaimers’ songwriting is briefly reflected in swipes at NHS cuts and nods to gentrification. There’s no escaping the sentimentality at the exposed, beating heart of this show. While skilfully braiding in various Proclaimers tracks, its narrative ticks all the big emotional boxes: love, loss, parenthood. In aiming squarely for the universal, though, Greenhorn’s script often lacks specificity. His characters are foremost daughters or sons, fathers or mothers, husbands or wives – defined by their relationships with one another rather than by any quirks or idiosyncrasies. The detail is instead supplied by Brining’s production, which teems with the stuff of everyday life. In an early Edinburgh street scene, as returning squaddies Davy and Ally weave past joggers, leaflet-pushers, buskers and coffee-guzzlers, Emily-Jane Boyle’s choreography brilliantly evokes the bustle of city pavements – real city pavements, not the high-kicking sidewalks of Broadway. Colin Richmond’s set, meanwhile, is crammed with the minutiae of the mundane, from Asda signs to wellies atop bus shelters. And while the on-stage bar inevitably recalls Once – the Musical, it’s more working men’s club than romanticised tavern. You can almost taste the Tennent’s. The real masterstroke is bringing the band on to the stage and among the actors. It’s not an original thought, but it’s perfect for the spirit of this piece. Guitar players pop up from behind bars and reception desks, as though the Proclaimers’ music has seeped irresistibly into the city. When a drinking session turns into a singsong (Over and Done With) or a pub full of Hibs fans offer marriage proposal advice (Let’s Get Married), the tunes somehow burst organically from the action rather than feeling imposed on to it. And while the biggest hits are used with admirable restraint, by the opening riff of I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), resistance is futile. At West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until 19 May.

His Booker-shortlisted debut Under the Frog (1992), a hilarious and moving tale of Hungarian basketball players, established him as one of the most inventive writers of his generation. The novels that followed developed an increasingly surreal comic vision, seemingly intent on finding more and more bizarre ways of making us laugh. In The Thought Gang (1994) a philosopher teams up with a one-armed villain in an intellectual caper story, while in The Collector Collector (1997) an entire novel is narrated by an ornamental bowl. How to Rule the World features Baxter Stone, a film-maker from south London, and is set in something called the “Vizz”, which one takes to be the world of documentary television. There’s a playful snap, crackle and pop to the prose style and a brutal slapstick quality to the action. A Thai policeman is described as having a “puppy-hammering face”. A series of curious characters with names like Jack the List and Zyklon Annie are introduced and dispatched in set-up-gag rhythm to varying effect. An incompetent academic is particularly well skewered. “He should be cleaning out the cages in a pet shop, a small provincial pet shop, not shaping anyone’s youth.” As an extended monologue it has tremendous energy; Baxter is constantly riffing on the world around him. “I don’t want to be in this room,” is a repeated mantra at the beginning of the novel, and yet Fischer’s world-weary protagonist is continually working the room, in a tireless tirade that takes us from Tooting to Bangkok, from Jerusalem to Iraq and the Turkish stone circle of Göbekli Tepe. In his pursuit of the one-liner Fischer has a hardline commitment to the purely comic. In a rare moment of unmediated horror, Baxter witnesses a car-bombing in Baghdad and fails to make a quip: “Some things you can’t make a joke about.” It’s only a matter of time, though, he concludes. “It’s the next generation of Iraqi stand-ups who’ll benefit from that material.” Baxter’s career has been the pursuit of a documentary that might bring him success and his discourse is one long complaint at the lack of it. The story of the struggling freelancer in a cynical and moribund media milieu is as old as George Gissing’s New Grub Street. There are echoes of Gordon Burn’s Fullalove, a deeply melancholic take on a dying Fleet Street, but How to Rule the World is far too busy to find actual depths of despair. Instead a febrile sense of desperation drives the narrative, though it’s hard to know why the protagonist is quite so bad-tempered, or how much of the spleen vented is shared by the author. When Baxter shares his worldview, it doesn’t seem quite enough to justify his anger. “I get annoyed with those who are convinced they’re being picked on because they are black or gay or trans or come from some strange village or speak with a northern, southern, western, eastern accent, and are missing the big picture: that most of the time we’re all munching shit.” Hmm. Perhaps if Fischer had simply set his novel in the world of publishing he could have come up with something a bit more heartfelt. Because he is undeniably part of a tradition, an exemplar of the postwar English comic novel, which was once something of a family business. The dystopian “big picture” of his work resembles what Kingsley Amis defined as the “comic inferno” in his 1962 SF survey New Maps of Hell, and Fischer acknowledged Martin Amis’s influence on his clipped, aphoristic style even while he savaged him back in 2003. The metafictional irony is that Fischer’s funniest, most quotable line remains his assessment of the novel Yellow Dog by Amis junior. Dismissing it as “not-knowing-where-to-look-bad”, he likened the experience of reading this once-loved author as “like your favourite uncle being caught in a school playground, masturbating”. The genius of this line is that it so accurately pinpoints the problem with this kind of comic novel: the extended male rant can too easily be characterised as a kind of avuncular self-pleasuring. There’s a sense that the performer is having more fun than the audience. When cynicism is the method as well as the subject, the conclusions of comedy can be quite dull and reactionary. “It’s very hard to make an audience laugh,” Jerry Seinfeld remarked recently, commenting on the comedian Louis CK who was, literally, caught masturbating in public. “You don’t say: ‘I think I’ll do this, or I think I’ll do that,’ you do whatever you can that they will laugh at.” For a routine this is enough, but it’s hard to sustain for a whole novel. And despite all the travelling around I never felt we went anywhere. I was reminded of those stadium comedians who walk up and down a massive stage endlessly, as if giving us some sort of journey. Fischer is a great literary comedian, but with this novel there’s not so much a sense of an author running out of steam but a whole genre dying on its feet.

The so-called “Australia chapter” has been removed from the UN report “Does Improved Irrigation Technology Save Water?” published online by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Dr Chris Perry, an internationally respected water expert and co-author of the UN report that originally included a section about the Murray-Darling basin plan, has described his “shock” at the “complete ineptitude” of the Australian government’s response to the UN report. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Perry and Pasquale Steduto, a Rome-based senior water policy analyst for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, analysed the effectiveness of new irrigation technology in14 countries, including Australia, China, the US, India, Egypt, Spain, Morocco and Zimbabwe. For the Australia chapter, they used available data as well as the published work of several Australian water academics, including that of Quentin Grafton, professor of economics and Unesco chair at the Crawford school at the Australian National University. The chapter focused on water efficiency projects, a big plank of the basin plan. It concluded that the Australian government’s multimillion-dollar subsidies to farmers had probably achieved a negative outcome, increasing on-farm water consumption and reducing rather than increasing return flows to the environment. Published in 2017, on the third-party platform ResearchGate, the chapter on Australia says the Murray Darling basin plan’s “subsidy programs” to save water have been “ineffective, poorly conceived” and have “primarily benefited private individuals”. The “investments have had no discernible impact in terms of reduced water use on a per-hectare basis, or release of water to alternative users”, the original report said. The chapter criticised the government’s lack of scientific evaluation. There is “no apparent basis for assessing whether subsidised introduction of high-tech systems will actually release water to alternative uses, or simply increase consumption by the extra amount allocated to the farmer,” it says. Perry, an occasional consultant to the FAO, said his knowledge of Australia’s water changes had prepared him for an unwelcome response by Australian officials to the report’s conclusion that the technical underpinning of the multibillion-dollar program was unsound. “The FAO report clearly arrived at a politically sensitive moment,” he told Guardian Australia. “But that said, I was still shocked at the complete ineptitude of the intervention made by Australia.” Although the report described how other countries’ irrigation technologies had also failed to save water, it was only Australia that objected to the UN analysis. According to Perry and Steduto, the Department of Agriculture insisted on a process to rewrite the chapter. “We put the publication on hold, removing it from the FAO website, to allow time for a possible review and editing of the section, which we welcomed,” Steduto said. The Department of Agriculture says it disagreed with the report’s claim that water savings from irrigation efficiency improvements were not real savings. A department official said “empirical information” from several sources was provided to the FAO. Both authors say the Department of Agriculture did not have any data or scientific measuring system in place to back its claim that water saved through the Murray-Darling basin’s efficiency projects was making its way back to the river system. “Fair enough if they had data or even a competent analysis to contradict the findings we summarised, but there was none. Instead, their response was a prime example of exactly the type of flawed analysis we criticised in the body of the report,” Perry said. Steduto insists he and Perry were open to Australia’s arguments in the hope of improving the chapter. “Nevertheless, there wasn’t evidence to support their counter-argument.” The months-long attempt to produce an amended version acceptable to the Australian government failed, ending in a stalemate. The Department of Agriculture said no agreement could be reached on key technical points. “Unfortunately, after some time, having not reached an agreement on a mutually acceptable version of the text, it was decided that a fair solution to the matter was to withdraw the Australian section from the paper,” Steduto told Guardian Australia. Dr Emma Carmody from the Environmental Defenders Office NSW said urgent law reform was needed to improve the transparency of water efficiency projects. “Billions of dollars are being spent on projects that on evidence may not be achieving their intended purpose of increasing the volume of water in our rivers. Money needs to fund quantifiable water savings.” More water-saving projects are in the pipeline. The Murray Darling Basin Authority has proposed that irrigators be allowed to extract an extra 605GL, based on 36 projects that are supposed to achieve equivalent environmental outcomes with less water. The projects are conceptually the same as the on-farm efficiency projects criticised by the UN water experts. The amendment is before parliament and subject to a disallowance motion in the Senate on 8 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/15/funny-cow-maxine-peake-rhona-cameron-rachel-fairburn-shappi-khorsandi","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Standups on Maxine Peake's Funny Cow: 'It made me proud of everything I've been through'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/15/funny-cow-maxine-peake-rhona-cameron-rachel-fairburn-shappi-khorsandi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/15/funny-cow-maxine-peake-rhona-cameron-rachel-fairburn-shappi-khorsandi","fields":{"headline":"Standups on Maxine Peake's Funny Cow: 'It made me proud of everything I've been through'","bodyText":"Rhona Cameron For a long time I felt – like Maxine Peake’s character – that life was easier on stage than off. Funny Cow left me pissed off because I wanted to write that film! But I was moved, too, because so much of its emotional core resonated with me. I couldn’t leave my seat for a while because I was so upset. I felt relieved that someone was finally talking about the seriousness of comedy, through the journey of a working-class female standup. I don’t identify as a “woman comic” or indeed a “woman”. I am Rhona. I’ve always been very non-binary gender in my thinking, feeling and actions. But I did notice, as a younger comic, that an unknown male could go on stage and he’d be given a chance. He was allowed to take his time, to indulge, even. But if you were a woman, you had to be “bang, bang, bang, bang” right away, no breaths. So I thought the scene in the club where she demolishes a fat, drunken, thick guy was very powerful. There’s one line that will stay with me: “It’s fuck all to do with being funny, it’s to do with surviving.” That is so true. A comedian is part-gladiator, part-psychologist, part-preacher, part-actor, part-self-harmer, part-poet, part-clown. If you’re screwed up from life and go out on to this risky tightrope of adulation or hatred – running this extreme gauntlet every night – and then go back to this desolation of self, it takes its toll. That’s what makes comedy the mothership of the arts. It’s so fucking dangerous. Rachel Fairburn It’s every northern cliche rolled into one. The performances are brilliant, but I felt that a lot of the film was stereotypical. You have a female character from the north of England, and it’s like: “Of course she’s northern, she’s beaten by her husband. Of course she’s northern, her dad was an alcoholic.” I’ve never written a film, and I hate slating other people’s work, but I just found it a bit empty. You don’t really see any of the reasons why Peake’s character would want to become a standup. She makes two funny comments as a child – using humour as a defence – but doesn’t come across as particularly witty. I suppose, as a kid, she was an outsider and a bit of a showoff. That was relatable: when I was a kid, I was either showing off or I was really quiet, and I always had a side of me that wanted to perform. But it wasn’t clear why she would have wanted to be a standup, other than suddenly going to a comedy night and enjoying one person’s set. I get fed up of the idea that people do standup because they’ve had a hard time when they were young or that they must be sad really, which the film suggests. It’s not true. There are lots of different reasons why people start performing comedy. This could have been an opportunity to have a female standup character who wrote her own material and was different, and that’s why she is funny. But she just goes on stage and does the exact same jokes that a bloke had done. The older comic, Lenny (played by Alun Armstrong), says to her: “It’s not a job for women; women aren’t funny.” She sort of proves his point by then doing his jokes. Shappi Khorsandi In one scene, Peake goes on stage and can’t speak, and the audience starts heckling. I’ve never frozen like that, but what made it powerful to watch, as a comic, was knowing how badly she wants it, and then seeing her sabotaged by her own nerves. It’s the personification of every bad gig, every bad feeling that you have when you die on stage. They got that bit beautifully, and that made me feel so proud of all that I’ve been through as a professional comic. I thought: “Yes, babe – being a female comic, I get that.” But Funny Cow is not a film about standup comedy. It’s not a film about a woman making her way in the comedy world. It’s a film about child abuse. In the first few minutes, a child gets brutally, viciously attacked with a chain belt. It wrecked my head, to the point where I got into a fight with a man in the audience who was being rude to some women. It’s not a subtle film about the delicate soul of a standup; it’s about a spirited child being broken by her parents. She could have decided that, in order to get out of her head, she wanted to be a cartoonist or a landscape gardener. It doesn’t get into the nitty-gritty of being a comedian. I didn’t find anything nuanced about it. There’s a scene where Paddy Considine’s character, a bookshop owner, takes her out to dinner. They do this whole Educating Rita thing, and he says to her: “Who took away your self-esteem?” It’s like: “I see, what happens is comedians don’t have self-esteem – got it!” It didn’t leave much to the imagination. But what made the film, for me, were the spectacular performances. Kevin Eldon’s brilliant turn, John Bishop’s gorgeous cameo. And I could not take my eyes off Peake. She’s an utter superstar, and I now want to see everything she does. Funny Cow, written by Tony Pitts and directed by Adrian Shergold, is out now. Rhona Cameron is currently developing the screenplay of her first book, 1979. Shappi Khorsandi is touring the UK until June 2018, including London’s Soho theatre, 15-19 May.

In the white pulse of spring, with dazzling blackthorn and wild cherry above and an under-flow of wood anemone, wild garlic, white deadnettle (where all the carder bees are), and cow parsley coming, less flashy plants such as garlic mustard are often overlooked. There are the blues of forget-me-not (some of which are also white), ground ivy, bluebell, dog and sweet violet and the yellows of dandelion, cowslip, primrose and the last of the celandines. But spring is not all about colours, it’s also about scent. When touched, the leaves of garlic mustard smell, as their name suggests, of a mustardy garlic. Those of ground ivy, Glechoma hederacea of the mint family, smell somewhere between catnip and cat pee. The hedgebank is full of the fragrance of verdure. I collect leaves of garlic mustard, ground ivy, nettle, dandelion, cow parsley and lords and ladies, roll them into a ball and inhale their fragrance as if the green grenade of hedge weeds is a rose. It’s not a fragrance that unravels itself into its constituent parts but instead creates something else. The smell is funky and fresh, full of the chemical language of plants, sending signals into the damp spring air to flow and make meaning through the hedges, just like birdsong. This smell is full of the doings of plants that have pushed out of the earth, bringing something of its dark essence into the light. Sharp and almost sweet, the fragrance creates a space for an experience that is more than that of vegetable matter; it may be mostly rain and sunlight bound together in the molecules of millions of cells, but these glistening leaves animate life. Plant phytoncides are said to affect human parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves; they increase the production of the serum adiponectin, a hormone responsible for combating obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders.

L&amp;G said it was in the process of recruiting a management team to run the new division, which is expected to build and buy homes to address a “chronic shortfall” of affordable housing. “Affordable housing is a classic example of underinvestment with minimal new equity capital being deployed to the sector,” the L&amp;G chief executive, Nigel Wilson, said. “This is not a sustainable position – either for the sector or for the 1.3m households currently on a waiting list.” The affordable homes business marks L&amp;G’s latest move into the UK housing market, where it is becoming a significant player. The insurer is already investing about £1.5bn in the build-to-rent sector, with sites in Bristol, Edinburgh, Salford, Bath, Brighton, Leeds and Walthamstow. It aims to have 6,000 build-to-rent homes in planning, development or operation by the end of 2019. L&amp;G has also promised to revolutionise the housebuilding industry by constructing thousands of prefab homes from its new modular housing factory in Leeds. The homes are made and fitted out in the factory before being transported to their destinations on the back of trucks. The new affordable-homes business will become a subsidiary of Legal &amp; General Capital (LGC), which focuses on areas where there has been a lack of investment and innovation. L&amp;G said it would offer a more “sustainable” approach to providing affordable homes after housing associations have taken on a lot of debt over the years to fund developments. Theresa May has described the “national housing crisis” as one of the biggest barriers to social mobility in Britain, with 300,000 new homes a year needed to address the shortage. She has argued that key workers such as nurses, teachers and firefighters should be the priority for affordable homes. A shortage of homes in the UK has helped to support house prices in recent months, despite a slowing economy and weaker consumer spending. The average price of a home edged up 0.2% to £213,000 in April, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide, following two consecutive monthly falls. It pushed up the annual rate of growth in house prices to 2.6%, from 2.1% in March. “Looking ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market but also with respect to interest rates,” the Nationwide chief economist, Robert Gardner, said. “Subdued economic activity and the ongoing squeeze on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing-market activity and house-price growth this year.” Nationwide is predicting UK house-price growth of about 1% this year, down from 2.6% in 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/27/daily-express-apologises-article-about-violence-liverpool-roma-match","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T13:26:52Z","webTitle":"Daily Express sorry for article about violence before Liverpool-Roma match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/27/daily-express-apologises-article-about-violence-liverpool-roma-match","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/27/daily-express-apologises-article-about-violence-liverpool-roma-match","fields":{"headline":"Daily Express sorry for article about violence before Liverpool-Roma match","bodyText":"The Daily Express has apologised after it published an “ill-informed and wrong” article suggesting Liverpool fans shared responsibility for violence before a Champions League semi-final match. The article, which was described as “an appalling slur” by the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was published on the paper’s website after Sean Cox, 53, a Liverpool supporter, was left seriously injured after an alleged attack by Roma fans before the game at Anfield on Tuesday evening. He is in an induced coma in hospital. Filippo Lombardi, 20, has been charged with violent disorder and causing grievous bodily harm, and Daniele Sciusco, 29, was charged with violent disorder. Both men are from Rome. In the article, which has since been deleted, the journalist Colin Mafham wrote that trouble seemed to follow Liverpool fans like “bees round a honey pot”. He said he feared that after the stadium disasters at Heysel and Hillsborough, the latest generation of the club’s supporters “could well add another chapter to England’s footballing book of condolences”. A statement on the Express website said: “This article was ill-informed and wrong. It did not, in any way, reflect the views of the Express. It should never have been written and was very quickly removed. We unconditionally apologise, both for the article itself and any offence, understandably, caused. “The journalist who wrote the piece was immediately suspended. Express.co.uk is conducting an inquiry into how the article came to be published on our website.” In the comment piece with the headline “Liverpool must take serious action after Roma violence or risk further trouble”, Mafham wrote: “You would have thought the deaths of 39 Italians at the European Cup final Liverpool lost to Juventus in 1985, plus the five-year ban on English clubs that consequently came after that, would have had a sobering effect. “You would have thought the horrors at Hillsborough and 96 more deaths that followed only four years later would have made everyone more aware of their responsibilities to each other. “Those two tragedies, in which the central figures were sadly mostly from Liverpool, are arguably football’s most painful Achilles and hopefully will never happen again. “So why do I fear that the latest generation of that club’s supporters could well add another chapter to England’s footballing book of condolences?” He added: “When you have a team capable of playing the joyous football Liverpool have for most of this season, how on earth are their fans always seemingly involved in such horrific altercations on big European nights. Why does trouble seem to follow them like bees round a honey pot?” Writing on Twitter on Thursday night, Anderson asked why the paper thought it acceptable to publish the article, two years to the day of the Hillsborough verdict. He called on the Daily Express editor, Gary Jones, to “face the city and apologise”. Anderson later tweeted that he had received a “really passionate, sincere [and] heartfelt apology” from Jones and “the journalist concerned has rightly been suspended and an investigation is being held”. Margaret Aspinall, a leading Hillsborough campaigner, said in a letter to the editor of the Express: “Yet again ill-informed journalists feel the need to spew out stories that breed contempt and bad feeling. “There still seems to be an awful lot of misunderstanding about what happened on that terrible, terrible day [of the Hillsborough disaster] and I feel as if certain members of the media are continuing to play a role of tarnishing our fans and survivors at this crucial time when our families still have so far to go to get accountability.” She concluded: “I would like to end this letter by saying to you that I am not a whinging Scouser. I’m a mother who lost her beautiful son James when he went to his first away game and never returned home. I am a Scouser who is proud of my city, its people, its club and most importantly its fans, especially the survivors of that terrible day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/27/abc-and-sbs-forced-to-justify-competing-with-commercial-media-in-news-and-streaming","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T07:57:36Z","webTitle":"ABC and SBS forced to justify competing with commercial media in news and streaming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/27/abc-and-sbs-forced-to-justify-competing-with-commercial-media-in-news-and-streaming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/27/abc-and-sbs-forced-to-justify-competing-with-commercial-media-in-news-and-streaming","fields":{"headline":"ABC and SBS forced to justify competing with commercial media in news and streaming","bodyText":"The public broadcasters will be asked to justify to a government inquiry why they should continue providing free online news and catch-up TV when they are competing with commercial media players.

Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon An issues paper published on Friday revealed that the strong performance of catch-up TV and its impact on the streaming services Foxtel and Stan would be put under the microscope. “With a substantial back catalogue of popular and niche entertainment and informative content, SBS On Demand competes directly with subscription on-demand services such as Stan, Foxtel and Netflix for content and viewers,” the paper said. ABC and SBS now have big audiences for their digital products, it said, and ABC news had reached No. 3 in the online news rankings behind news.com.au and nine.com.au. The paper noted that in 2013 the charters of both the ABC and SBS were amended to explicitly allow both organisations to provide digital media services, because originally the charters specified TV and radio only. “In this context, commercial media companies have raised concerns about the impact on competition of the activities of the national broadcasters,” the issues paper said. “These concerns have been expressed in a range of forums and centre around the broad principles of competitive neutrality as they apply to the national broadcasters.” The paper quoted critics including the Fairfax chief executive, Greg Hywood, and the commercial free-to-air TV lobby complaining about competition from the ABC and SBS. It cited a Free TV submission to the government saying: “Over recent years there has been a marked rise in the extent to which the ABC and SBS directly compete with commercial free-to-air TV to acquire content with commercial appeal. This trend is accelerating as SBS, in particular, has launched or expanded its Viceland and Food Network channels.” A statement from Hywood to a parliamentary inquiry was also quoted in the paper: “We are not anti-ABC. The ABC is part of the Australian community. It has been for many years and does very good work. They are a partner with many stories. It is just aspects of the new world of media where we have to be careful that the decisions that government institutions make do not impinge upon the diversity and the commercial environment that I think we all value.” Questions to be asked by the panel include whether the broadcasters take “undue advantage of their government ownership, to the detriment of competitive outcomes” and about the different regulations governing public and commercial broadcasters. Another question the panel is seeking to answer in its report later this year reads: “Are you aware of any specific instances where the ABC or SBS may have received any other competitive advantage, due to their public ownership, to the detriment of a private competitor?” An ABC spokeswoman said: “The ABC will continue to cooperate with the inquiry and will provide a submission by the required due date.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/port-of-rotterdam-infrastructure-plans-stall-amid-brexit-uncertainty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:58:32Z","webTitle":"Rotterdam reveals Brexit fears over port capacity – but says Dover has it worse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/port-of-rotterdam-infrastructure-plans-stall-amid-brexit-uncertainty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/port-of-rotterdam-infrastructure-plans-stall-amid-brexit-uncertainty","fields":{"headline":"Rotterdam reveals Brexit fears over port capacity – but says Dover has it worse","bodyText":"Officials at the port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe, are stalling on investments in Brexit infrastructure amid renewed hope that Theresa May will make a U-turn after the local elections on the UK leaving the customs union. EU officials, however, have warned that global trade rules will stand in the way of a UK “fudge” on the customs union issue. With the debate in full swing in the UK, officials at the port handling 40m tonnes of UK trade in goods annually said plans for the construction of new customs inspection posts, parking spaces and cool warehouses for flowers and vegetables were on hold. While fearful that Brexit paperwork at the port could lead to five-mile queues of trucks on its doorstep, Mark Dijk, the port’s head of external affairs, said the level of the investment required by the the port and its ferry companies meant certainty was needed. Dijk said: “It is all dependent on what kind of free trade agreement they work up and the customs union discussion which is interesting. “After these local elections [next Thursday] then probably there will be some new discussions on the customs union, which might be very interesting for us because that solves the whole problem. “It’s a very difficult decision, of course, because we don’t know what is going to happen and those investments are not cheap. And we do not know if they are possible.” Dijk said there were concerns that the necessary land would not be available around at least one of the four ferry terminals servicing the UK, although he suggested Dover faced greater issues. “I saw in the UK they have larger problems with the infrastructure,” he said. “The port of Dover, which has got no space to grow, and other ports are pleading for public investment to facilitate this growth.” Last week, Bart Jan Koopman of the Dutch shippers and exporters’ organisation, Evofenedex, told MPs in the Netherlands parliament: “Our concern is on the British side. Their preparations are far from the level of the Dutch. This underestimation also applies to other EU countries. That can really cause chaos.” The home secretary, Amber Rudd, is the latest politician to signal that the debate on the UK’s future customs arrangements with the EU is ongoing within the cabinet. Labour is seeking to force a change of policy in an upcoming Commons vote. Roel van’t Veld, the Dutch ministry of finance’s Brexit and customs adviser, said that the scale of the investments and changes required on both sides, should the UK go through with Theresa May’s plan to leave the customs union, were well understood in the Netherlands. Even with the signing of a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK, an extra 750 new Dutch customs officers will be needed, the first 150 of whom have just started their training, with selection proceeding for the second batch. “We started collecting the statistics and they are rather frightening,” Van’t Veld said. “Trading between Southend and Rotterdam will be as trading between Rotterdam and Morocco, and people have to realise that. We have a huge number of companies that have no idea what trading outside the EU means. We have 35,000 companies trading with the UK who have no knowledge of customs. They are not known in our system.” Even with “maximum facilitation”, a proposal by the UK for trusted trader schemes to reduce the necessary paperwork, Van’t Veld said there would always be companies outside such arrangements who would probably slow everyone else down at the ports. Van’t Veld said he was advising the Dutch waste industry about the nine extra processes that would have to be followed for them to import British waste, in particular from Westminster from where a large amount of rubbish emanated, for treatment in the Netherlands. In Brussels, EU officials said the was little clarity about the UK’s position following the rejection of the customs proposals made last year by the British government, which were designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Officials said they also expected a fresh proposal on customs from the UK after local elections, which would attempt to match the benefits of a customs union without it being described as such, to avoid a domestic row. A senior official involved in Brexit negotiations warned, however, that World Trade Organisation rules would stand in the way of such a ploy. The official said: “When they they come with a big fudge – custom partnership, customs facilitation, special customs arrangement – well, actually a fudge has its test and the test is article 24 of the WTO. “If you give preferential arrangement with a third country outside a customs union, you have to apply it worldwide under the most favoured nation rule. Imagine if the arrangement doesn’t qualify as a customs union, they will have to open their borders to the whole world. They have no trade deals to negotiate any more. “Whatever fudge they are brewing, it has to match the criteria set,” the official added. “Otherwise it is not a customs union and we end up with a free trade agreement, with the customs arrangements that you make with any third country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/28/cricket-somerset-yorkshire-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T18:33:21Z","webTitle":"Matt Renshaw hits another century for Somerset before Yorkshire collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/28/cricket-somerset-yorkshire-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/28/cricket-somerset-yorkshire-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Matt Renshaw hits another century for Somerset before Yorkshire collapse","bodyText":"The ripples of that curious incident in Cape Town have not completely subsided. One consequence has been that Cameron Bancroft never made it to Somerset; he was hastily replaced by another Australian Matt Renshaw, whose visit to his grandmother in the north of England mid-April was suddenly overtaken by a significant career move. There are now those in Taunton who are quietly delighted by the shenanigans of Steve Smith and Warner against the South Africans, which eventually led to the acquisition of Renshaw. For it is highly unlikely that Bancroft, even if his life had not been thrown into turmoil, could have contributed quite as Renshaw has done in his first two games for Somerset. Against Worcestershire last week he hit a vital century in the first innings. Here was something more spectacular. Renshaw thumped a hundred before lunch in 86 balls, including 14 fours and four sixes. He is supposed to be a bit of a blocker but take the Yorkshireman out of Yorkshire and then pitch him against Yorkshire and anything can happen. Renshaw got off the mark with a six; he reached his 50 with a six and on 94 he hooked another over the ropes. It is unlikely that any first-class batsman has ever done that before. Maybe Renshaw has worked out that on these early-season pitches there is no point in hanging around since there is a ball around the corner with your name on it. It is imperative to make the opposition bowl badly. Certainly he imposed himself with pulls, hooks and meaty bottom-handed drives that sailed over the heads of Yorkshire’s opening bowlers. As the day progressed, the value of Renshaw’s runs soared as if in a bull market. The wickets just kept falling after a surreal morning in which Renshaw caused havoc. At one point Somerset were 145 for one, George Bartlett having offered fine assistance to his new team-mate. Then they lost nine wickets for 71 (all out 216) with Jack Brooks, as ever, recognising the virtue of pitching the ball up and letting it swing. Only Craig Overton of the rest of the Somerset batsmen threatened much resistance as they all kept playing their shots. Yorkshire tried to go about things in a more traditional manner in reply but that did not work any better. They were bowled out for 96 despite facing more overs than Somerset. There was the handicap of losing Adam Lyth to a wanton run-out before a run had been scored. Then the Somerset seamers set to work. No matter the temperature was in single figures with stoic spectators huddled in their anoraks yet still spellbound by the rapid progress of the match. The wine-dark Duke ball kept swinging. Harry Brook countered impressively; Cheteshwar Pujara and Gary Ballance tried blocking but could make no progress. Then with Yorkshire on 64 for four there was mayhem. In consecutive overs Tim Groenewald and Lewis Gregory both found themselves on a hat-trick. Groenewald benefited from two slip catches by Marcus Trescothick, then Gregory, who was managing to swing the ball in both directions – though not with the same delivery - dispatched the Jacks, Leaning and Brooks: 64 for four had become 64 for eight, then 96 all out. If the wickets had been taken by spinners there would have been outrage and calls for points deductions. But heigh-ho, it is April. That is what happens. There was time for Renshaw to return to the crease for two overs and, to the home side’s delight, he was still there alongside Trescothick at the close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/28/proportion-home-owners-halves-millennials","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T20:30:24Z","webTitle":"Millennial housing crisis engulfs Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/28/proportion-home-owners-halves-millennials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/28/proportion-home-owners-halves-millennials","fields":{"headline":"Millennial housing crisis engulfs Britain","bodyText":"Home ownership among young families has plummeted across every corner of Britain over the past 35 years, according to a devastating inquiry into the housing crisis facing millennials. The proportion of families headed by a 25- to 34-year-old that own their own home has more than halved in some regions, showing that the crisis goes far beyond London. Analysis conducted as part of a two-year investigation into intergenerational fairness in Britain, chaired by a former Tory minister, found that millennials are being forced into increasingly cramped and expensive rented properties that leave them with a longer commute and little chance of saving for a home. It also finds an increasing proportion of the young living in overcrowded housing. The commission, which has been overseen by the Resolution Foundation thinktank and includes the former universities minister David Willetts, is expected to conclude that new taxes on property wealth may be the only way to restore fairness and prepare the country to pay the care and support costs of an ageing population. Ownership among 25- to 34-year-olds has plummeted in Greater Manchester from 53% in 1984 to 26% last year. It has fallen from 54% to 25% in south Yorkshire, from 45% to 20% in the West Midlands, from 50% to 28% in Wales and from 55% to 27% in the south-east. In outer London, the proportion has collapsed from 53% to just 16%. Out of 22 regions analysed by the commission, in only one – Strathclyde in Scotland – has home ownership among the young remained stable. It stood at 32% in 1984 and 33% last year, having peaked at 45% in 2002. Ownership in London has fallen consistently over the past 30 years, whereas rates in some other parts of the country declined more slowly before the early 2000s, but very rapidly thereafter. Even favourable economic conditions are likely to result in millennials catching up with the home ownership levels of the previous cohort only by the age of 45. Fast-growing inheritances will help some, but nearly half of young non-homeowners have parents who do not own either. Millennials, classed as those born between 1981 and 2000, are half as likely to own a home at the age of 30 as baby boomers because of higher prices, low earnings growth and tighter credit rules. In the 1980s it would have taken a typical household in their late 20s around three years to save for an average-sized deposit. It would now take 19 years, the analysis shows. Almost two-fifths of millennials rent privately at 30, double the rate for Generation X, born between 1966 and 1980, and four times the rate for baby boomers – born after the war until 1965 – at the same age. Millennials are now spending an average of nearly a quarter of their net income on housing, three times more than the pre-war generation, now aged 70 and over. Their living space is also declining. Each person living in the private rented sector now has on average eight square metres less space than they did in 1996. Meanwhile, those who own their own homes enjoy an extra four square metres each. Since younger households are more likely to be private renters than owners, they now have less space on average per household member. Just under one in 10 households headed by millennials in their late 20s now live in overcrowded conditions. They are facing longer commutes than older generations endured. If current differences continue, millennials will spend almost three full days more commuting in the year they turn 40 than the baby boomers did at the same age. The Resolution Foundation says that a combination of an ageing population and an increased demand for services which governments are committed to deliver means that welfare spending looks likely to increase very substantially in the coming decades. It says that one way of addressing some of the generational implications of tax rises would be to change the age profile that these additional revenues are drawn from. The tax treatment of property and pension wealth may also have to be considered. Under a pessimistic scenario of future home ownership, based on trends seen in 2002 to 2012, less than half of the oldest millennials would own a home by the age of 45, compared to more than 70% of baby boomers at that age. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “The need to renew our intergenerational contract is clear and urgent, but doing so is far from easy. It requires new thinking and tough trade-offs – from how we deal with the fiscal pressures of an ageing society in a way that is generationally fair, to how we deliver the housing young people need while respecting the communities everyone values. “We need our political leaders to rise to this challenge with an appeal to all generations. We can deliver the health and care older generations deserve without simply asking younger workers to bear all the costs. We can do more to promote education and skills, especially for those who are not on the university route. “We can provide more security for young people, from the jobs they do to the homes they rent. And we can show younger generations that owning a home is a reality, not a distant prospect in 21st-century Britain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/28/support-for-cross-party-plans-take-no-deal-brexit-off-table","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T21:02:24Z","webTitle":"Support grows for cross-party plans to prevent ‘no deal’ Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/28/support-for-cross-party-plans-take-no-deal-brexit-off-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/28/support-for-cross-party-plans-take-no-deal-brexit-off-table","fields":{"headline":"Support grows for cross-party plans to prevent ‘no deal’ Brexit","bodyText":"Theresa May is facing another major rebellion over Brexit amid a cross-party move to kill off any attempt to crash out of the EU without a deal. A group of MPs and peers has been carefully crafting new laws that will hand parliament guaranteed powers to soften any deal and send the government back to the negotiating table. Tory sources already think there is enough support in the Commons for the plan, which they believe would end the threat of a “no deal” outcome. The move is being described by senior figures as one of the most significant amendments of the Brexit process. Ministers have previously warned that should the deal negotiated with the EU be voted down by parliament, Britain could simply leave the bloc with no agreement. However, the cross-party group’s proposal ensures that if the agreement were voted down, parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is expected to win a three-figure majority in the Lords on Monday and Tory Remainers are confident it will not be overturned in the Commons next month. The government is already being urged simply to accept the measure. It could open the way for parliament to back staying in the EU’s customs union and single market –something currently ruled out by the prime minister. It comes with rebel Tory MPs beginning to believe that there could now be a Commons majority for staying in the customs union and its single market, through membership of the European Free Trade Association. One well-placed Tory said there were “a few in cabinet who now see it as a possible solution”. However, the cabinet’s Brexiters are preparing a big push this week against any suggestion Britain should remain inside the customs union, which would make it impossible for the UK to negotiate its own trade deals. While Brexit minister David Davis indicated last week that parliament would have a real “meaningful vote” over the Brexit deal on offer, both peers and Remain MPs want to enshrine the guarantees in law. Labour regards the proposal as extremely significant because it would allow its MPs and Tory rebels to vote against the agreement on offer without the fear of triggering a disastrous “no deal” outcome. Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, told the Observer: “This is one of the most important amendments of the entire Brexit process – and indeed of the parliament. We have always been clear that the vote must be truly meaningful. It cannot simply be a take-it-or-leave-it choice as the prime minister has suggested. “This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. It would remove the possibility of a No vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to parliament.” The measure is being presented in the Lords by a group of peers led by former Tory minister Lord Hailsham. However, the government describes the measure as a meaningless attempt to frustrate Brexit. Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister in the Lords, said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to parliament. It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment. “The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.” Senior Labour MPs, meanwhile, are directly appealing to their counterparts in the Lords to back attempts to keep Britain in the customs union and single market. Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, Alison McGovern and Chris Leslie have written to Labour peers urging for their help. “We are writing to ask for your support for an amendment which requires the government to make the UK’s continued participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) an objective in the Brexit negotiations,” they write. “The EEA provides a platform on which we can continue to be part of the EU single market if Brexit occurs, with the protection for workers, consumers and our environment that our party believes in.” Another Labour MP, meanwhile, is attempting to engineer the first Commons vote on whether or not the final Brexit deal should be put to a second referendum. Gareth Thomas, the former trade minister, will introduce a backbench bill next month, which will trigger a non-binding vote on the issue. “A people’s vote would give the British people the chance to take back control over Brexit from a small cabal of Leave ideologues and instead, on the biggest question facing our country, determine together our country’s economic, social and cultural future,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/30/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T14:00:14Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/30/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/30/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. It’s hard to praise Georges Simenon enough - although two readers had a very good go. First, safereturndoubtful reviewed The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, a roman dur from the 1930s: Explores psychology in the character of Kees Popinga, who is tormented by an inferiority complex, and craves notoriety through crime and playing games with the police, akin to his passion for chess. When he discovers that his boss is gone bankrupt and he is about to lose his own job and villa in the small Dutch town where he lives, Kees Poppingen, acting on impulse, boards a train for Paris leaving behind, with no explanation, his dull but comfortable life. Tremendous stuff. And beerbart enjoyed Maigret’s First Case: I’m not really a huge fan of police procedurals but these are wonderfully sparse, atmospheric reads of France and Belgium between the wars. (Or in this case, pre-World War One.) Simenon’s subtle observations of characters and locations really help create that authentic sense of place. Gail Honeyman’s Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine has pleased bluefairy: I really, really liked it - it was a wonderful book and I’m still thinking about it now. There were a lot of laugh out loud moments with some of Eleanor’s observations about people and life but at the same time there was heartbreaking sadness. The way Gail Honeyman explores loneliness and being an outsider is just masterful. I can’t believe it’s her debut novel. And here’s an endorsement for Hubert Selby Jr’s Last Exit to Brooklyn from captainlego: What a fantastic read! So raw, acerbic, angry, erotic, vicious. It’s a rip roaring read and I am excitedly getting through the last few pages. We’ve also had fantastic non-fiction recommendations. Prairie Fires by Caroline Fraser has been diverting greenmill: A biography of Laura Ingalls Wilder who is best known as the author of the Little House children’s books... Ingalls Wilder lived until 1957 having become famous and comfortably well off, but her early life, part of which was lived in a mud cave dug into a river bank, is an extraordinary tale of transition from extreme poverty and isolation to mid twentieth century affluence. And MildGloster has been enjoying The Songlines by Bruce Chatwin: It’s a travel book, I suppose, about Chatwin’s experiences in the Australian Outback learning of Aboriginal culture and their belief in ‘songlines’ or ‘dreaming tracks’, or “to the Aboriginals as ‘Footprints of the Ancestors’ or the ‘Way of the Law’”: Aboriginal Creation myths tell of the legendary totemic beings who wandered over the continent in the Dreamtime, singing out the name of everything that crossed their path — birds, animals, plants, rocks, waterholes — and so singing the world into existence. It’s fascinating reading in so many ways, about something I knew nothing about. The idea of the songlines, of people being able to understand the land they live on through song, and to be able to navigate across the large expanse of Australia in the remembrance of these songs, is a concept I frankly find bewitching and beautiful. Finally, Jembo Jembo alerts us to Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku: Explores the physics of the universe, giving introductions to string theory, M theory, branes and other recent ideas in language that is neither too technical or involved to determine the interested layman. First out about a dozen years ago some of the hopes for the future he was then expressing have already come to pass. We might all be living in a hologram or be the bits of a gigantic computer programme but don’t let that put you off having a look at this bit of pop science. Now that’s a thought... Interesting links about books and reading Female writers and the art of the quip. This article about buying first editions of Karl Marx is worth it for the headline alone.

The world sees a second-rate prime minister trapped in a context that she lacks the strength and agility to escape. That is the cunning disguise adopted by a maestro of manipulation with a remarkable talent for survival. Machiavelli has a sister and she lives at Number 10. She is ruthless at dispatching wounded ministers when it suits her and as ruthless at retaining damaged ministers (Amber Rudd being the topical example) when they can serve the prime minister as human shields. She threw away the Tories’ majority at an election she didn’t have to call and yet somehow endures in Downing Street by convincing her party that she is the only one among them who can keep this rackety government on a rocky road strewn with danger. Consider, most of all, Brexit. It is more than a year since Britain formally told the EU that it was leaving and there are now less than 12 months remaining before departure is due to become historical fact. Many have been the predictions that Mrs May could not possibly keep her brittle government and riven party together through this test. Yet those forecasts have so far been confounded. Her cabinet have fought like rabid ferrets, but not one of them has actually flounced out over Brexit. A guileful prime minister – so goes the theory I have heard from some Tory MPs – has slowly but surely stitched up the hard Brexiters. She made prisoners of David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson by giving them nominal charge of the negotiations while ensuring that she has called all the essential shots. She took their “red lines” and pretended to agree with them and then let the power of time and the brute facts of the parliamentary arithmetic and economic life do the work of softening Brexit. Those “red lines” have often times been smudged and in some cases erased altogether. The negotiating process with the EU has been punctuated by regular British retreats from the hard-line positions initially advocated by the Brexit fundamentalists. This has involved degrees of humiliation for Mrs May, but nothing that her armoured hide cannot absorb and nothing compared with what has been inflicted on the Brexiters. From fisheries to regulatory alignments, they’ve been forced to eat plates groaning with their previous promises. Where once many of their number declared that they would not countenance paying a red cent to the EU, Britain will be handing over a hefty divorce settlement. Where once they ringed the departure date as “liberation day”, they have conceded to a lengthy standstill transition, which means that EU law will prevail in Britain at least until the end of 2020. “Take back control”, the chest-beating slogan of their referendum campaign, has become feeble bleats about “implementation periods” and “managed divergence”. The longer the negotiations have gone on, the more and more evident has it become that there is no bargain with the EU that Britain can strike that is as advantageous as the deal it currently enjoys as a member, not at all the conclusion that the Brexiters wanted to become apparent. As the concessions to reality have piled up, they have huffed and puffed, but never made good on threats to blow the house down. Nigel Farage has been left in a lonely corner of the union jack bar to weep into his beer between moans of betrayal. And now they’ve had enough. The hard Brexiters declare there will be no more surrenders. Like the crazed newscaster in Network, they rage: “I’m mad as hell – and I’m not gonna take it anymore.” There is a red line, they pronounce, which they will not allow the government to cross. If it does, so they threaten, they will tear down the Tory temple. That red line is British membership of a customs union after Brexit. Boris Johnson selected that as the ditch he would die for when he said that remaining within a customs union “would leave the UK a colony of the EU”. In a speech a couple of months ago, Liam Fox termed it “a complete sell-out of Britain’s interests”. It is hard to see how either could stay in a cabinet that negotiated the very thing they have so passionately denounced. Their problem is that they don’t speak for parliament. A recent defeat for the government in the House of Lords, where a substantial majority of peers think Britain should protect its trade with the EU by remaining within a customs union, was an early warning of how much peril this issue poses for Mrs May. As I have remarked before, there is a natural majority in the Commons for remaining within some form of customs union, now that Labour has adopted that course. The great majority of trade unions and most businesses support the idea. The government’s own analysis, which was helpfully leaked, suggests that losses to commerce with our closest neighbours can never be compensated for by the putative gains to be had from negotiating unilateral trade deals with third countries from outside the customs union. Business would rather have the bird in the hand than hypothetical fledglings in theoretical bushes to be raised at some unspecified date in the distant future. Polling suggests that it would be fine with most voters as well. “The will of the people”, that much-loved trope of the hard Brexiters, would not be defied by parliament instructing the government to keep Britain in a customs union. Then there is the wicked issue of the Irish border, a conundrum that induces a migraine in everyone who examines it. Remaining within a customs union doesn’t entirely solve that problem, but it goes a long way to making it fixable. Quite a lot of the cabinet would not be terribly upset if parliament told the government to stay in a customs union. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, would be able to contain their distress if the government was defeated on the issue. Likewise the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington. Mrs May’s avowed intention is to leave the customs union and she has said so often and in such unequivocal language that it doesn’t leave her any apparent wriggle room. As recently as last week’s prime minister’s questions, she stuck with the hard Brexiters’ interpretation of the referendum result when she declared: “The British people voted to leave the European Union. In voting to leave the European Union, they voted to leave the single market and the customs union.” On the face of it, that would make it extremely difficult for her to negotiate a customs union. So why do hard Brexiters not trust her and why do some of her cabinet speculate that she could embrace the idea if parliament forced her to? Because Mrs May has a reputation for standing on her head while swearing that nothing has changed. You will recall that she said that she was not going to have an early election because it would be contrary to the national interest. This was a position that she maintained relentlessly, all the way up to the point when she suddenly declared that it was in the national interest to have an early election. The hard Brexiters are clearly fearful that there will be a similar volte-face over the EU negotiations and that Britain will end up in a customs union, or something very similar by a slightly different name. So they are trying to put a gun to her head by predicting that it will trigger cabinet resignations, which I am pretty sure it would, and a full-scale Tory civil war, which would blow away Mrs May’s premiership. They menace her with a confidence vote in her leadership. That wouldn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic, which is the fundamental weakness in their position. Nor would a confidence vote necessarily remove her as prime minister, but it is not a prospect she wants to face, which is why they make the threat. The prime minister has not found an answer to this crunch other than to try to delay it. The government has stalled a chunk of the withdrawal legislation to try to swerve the moment of truth, but it won’t be able to duck a binding vote forever. The great rupture of the Tory party over Brexit cannot be avoided indefinitely. What might look to some like cunning cleverness is, on closer inspection, really an exercise in trying to postpone the inevitable while desperately hoping that something will turn up. Not so much Machiavelli as Mr Micawber. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/28/crystal-palace-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T16:16:25Z","webTitle":"Wilfried Zaha stars in Crystal Palace’s five-goal thrashing of Leicester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/28/crystal-palace-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/28/crystal-palace-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wilfried Zaha stars in Crystal Palace’s five-goal thrashing of Leicester","bodyText":"The majority in this stadium broke away from celebrating their team’s flurry of late goals to serenade Roy Hodgson as full-time approached, the Crystal Palace manager responding with a wave from his dugout. The south London club may not be arithmetically assured of survival but this was surely the riotous victory which extended their stay in the Premier League into a sixth campaign. He deserved his moment. To have in effect guaranteed their status before the end of April is remarkable. Rewind to September and the side had languished pointless and goalless at the foot of the table after seven games, Frank de Boer’s tenure having already been curtailed with the dust still to settle on the summer transfer window. Hodgson had come in as a firefighter. He has since steered the side to 38 points with two games to go without a goalscoring centre-forward, a crippling injury list and with no significant additions in January. The smile of satisfaction which creased across the manager’s face on the final whistle said it all, relief giving way to unbridled delight as he clapped hands with his assistant, Ray Lewington, and the locals celebrated their most emphatic win in Premier League history. Hodgson has done what he does best: diligent coaching allied with logical team selection, with players revelling in the positions they know best. Common sense and industry have led the way, with Wilfried Zaha the free spirit in amid the industry. He is the player who can set this collective apart. Leicester were unable to deal with the Ivorian’s trickery and slippery running, particularly once they had been reduced to 10 men after Marc Albrighton had brought down the forward. It had been his first-time finish beyond Ben Hamer which set the tone, Palace having shifted the ball wonderfully in-field, from Ruben Loftus-Cheek to Yohan Cabaye to James McArthur’s back-heel, while City dithered. Zaha set up McArthur for a second, crisply dispatched into the far corner, before the interval. For all the mind-boggling exploits of Mohamed Salah or Kevin De Bruyne, surely no single player exerts as much positive influence on a team as Zaha does for Palace. “That was maybe one of his very best [performances] during my time at the club,” said Hodgson. “He balanced running with the ball, creating chances and tracking back. His all-round game was great. If he can continue like that there is no barrier for how high he can reach.” This was actually a triumph for the collective. Loftus-Cheek was excellent in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, capping his own display by collecting Mamadou Sakho’s pass to round Hamer and tap into a gaping net. Cabaye and McArthur were excellent, while Andros Townsend was irrepressible. James Tomkins saw a header scrambled from the goalline by Kelechi Iheanacho. Leicester were slack in midfield throughout, blunted further by a hamstring injury to Wilfred Ndidi and Albrighton’s dismissal. They have won only twice in 11 league games and Claude Puel is under pressure. “It’s not my concern at this moment,” said the Frenchman. “My first feeling is to stay near my players and get a good response in the next game.” He had mumbled his assessment of the game with three mentions of “catastrophe”, which neatly summed it up. Patrick van Aanholt belted in a fourth after Hamer had blocked from Jeffrey Schlupp, though Palace saved their most celebratory goal until last. Christian Benteke had not scored in this arena since last May. Yet Harry Maguire tripped the Belgian in stoppage time and Luka Milivojevic, having taken counsel from the bench, insisted the striker took the spot-kick. It was a role reversal from the late farce against Bournemouth in December, when Benteke had ripped the ball from the regular penalty taker but failed to convert. Here he slipped as he connected but the ball was struck truly enough. Once he had emerged from the joyous clutter of team-mates, Palace had risen to 11th. “Miracles do happen but basically we are safe,” added Hodgson. The din at the final whistle sounded survival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T23:01:27Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","bodyText":"Click here to access the print version Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

There was no goal for Mohamed Salah, who will now have only two more chances to set a Premier League scoring record, and no confidence boost from temporarily climbing above Manchester United to second in the table. Defeat at Chelsea next Sunday could likely leave a top-four finish hanging on the final day’s home game with Brighton. Liverpool wanted more than a point from this fixture but so too did Stoke, who need wins to get out of trouble. Paul Lambert’s side put in a solid performance to frustrate Liverpool but it is possibly too little and too late. Stoke have not won a league match at Anfield since 1959 and, though this draw preserves Lambert’s record of never losing here in six visits as a manager, he may have to wait a while for his next opportunity unless other results go his way. “We were outstanding. I couldn’t ask the players for anything more,” the Stoke manager said. “Liverpool have been scoring for fun and we stopped them. They didn’t create that many chances.” Klopp did not make a huge fuss about the Erik Pieters handball that could have earned Liverpool a late penalty or about the occasionally over-physical way in which the full-back stuck close to Salah. “Football is a physical game and Mo is probably the most attacked player in the Premier League but all the lads are used to that,” the Liverpool manager said, before confirming Sadio Mané would be back for Roma on Wednesday and that Salah and Jordan Henderson should overcome minor knocks. “We didn’t score, so it’s not the best day of my life but for sure I’ve had worse days.” The visitors must have had an inkling their luck was in when Salah passed up a glorious chance after five minutes and with it the possibility of settling home nerves and forcing the opposition to chase the game. Early plans to limit the space available for the Egyptian to run into evaporated as Salah broke from halfway into an empty half but, having carried the ball into the area and put himself in a one-on-one situation with Jack Butland, he chipped the goalkeeper and uncharacteristically missed the target. Thus reprieved, Stoke went on to create a few chances of their own in a first half which saw Liverpool do most of the attacking without quite making the final pass count. Mame Biram Diouf headed into the side-netting after a Joe Gomez slip gave Moritz Bauer the opportunity to cross and, when Xherdan Shaqiri rolled the ball across an unguarded Liverpool goalline a few minutes later, neither Peter Crouch nor Badou Ndiaye could stretch far enough to gain the necessary touch. Georginio Wijnaldum came closest to breaking the first-half deadlock when shooting narrowly wide from a Roberto Firmino lay-off, though Salah might have made something from an unforced Butland error had he not been unceremoniously barged over on the edge of the area by Pieters. He took the free-kick himself but was unable to trouble Butland again and, when Danny Ings put the ball in the net from a narrow angle on the stroke of half-time, he was correctly flagged offside. After watching 20 stodgy second-half minutes of Liverpool struggling to break down Stoke, Klopp sent on James Milner and Nathaniel Clyne to try to inject a little more urgency. Clyne was presented with a decent opening almost immediately, only to head tamely into Butland’s arms, before Milner set up Alberto Moreno for a shot that flew wide but still amounted to Liverpool’s best attempt since turning round. The afternoon did not get any better for those in red, though at least they were spared the ignominy of following the midweek Roma 5-2 spectacular with a home defeat when Ryan Shawcross was unable to turn the ball in at the far post after excellent work from Diouf. A minute before that Pieters had been extremely lucky not to concede a penalty when Wijnaldum’s cross struck an arm. He might have been trying to pull it away but there was definite contact. Liverpool protested in vain, though to an extent they would have been flattered had the game been won by such means. This was not the unstoppable attacking machine that blew away Roma and Manchester City. This was Liverpool on economy setting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/30/patrick-vieira-arsenal-manager-arsene-wenger-new-york-city-fc","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Patrick Vieira has been tipped to succeed Wenger – just how good is he?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/30/patrick-vieira-arsenal-manager-arsene-wenger-new-york-city-fc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/30/patrick-vieira-arsenal-manager-arsene-wenger-new-york-city-fc","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Vieira has been tipped to succeed Wenger – just how good is he?","bodyText":"Almost as soon as he’d sat down in front of the waiting press upon his appointment as New York City FC head coach in January 2016, Patrick Vieira was asked to name a manager he’d modelled his own coaching style after. It was a question set up to garner one answer: Arsène Wenger. Vieira spoke about José Mourinho’s insistence on meticulous preparation, Roberto Mancini’s determination and Manuel Pellegrini’s levelheadedness. Then he got to Wenger, highlighting the unwavering faith the Frenchman puts in his players. Even at that early stage, as Vieira took his first step into senior management, there was a sense that similar faith might one day be put in him to succeed his former manager. And two years later those pieces may be falling into place. Whether by his own will or not, Wenger will depart Arsenal at the end of the season and Vieira is in the frame to replace him. More proven, accomplished coaches have been put forward as candidates – Max Allegri, Carlo Ancelotti and Luis Enrique to name a few – but they do not have the emotional connection to the north London club that Vieira has. Is sentiment enough, though? Just how strong is the body of work Vieira has put together during his time at New York City FC? Could Arsenal really pick their next manager from Major League Soccer, given how the division is frequently derided for its perceived lack of quality? Those at Arsenal will be doing their research on Vieira, and there are reasons to justify the 41-year-old’s candidacy. At NYC FC, Vieira has shown himself to be an astute operator. His teams play attractive, modern, and most importantly winning, football, the kind that will go down well at the Emirates Stadium. They finished runners-up in the Eastern Conference in each of Vieira’s two two years at the club, with NYC FC setting an early pace in the early stages of the new season. If there’s one criticism to be levelled at Vieira it’s that such regular season form hasn’t yet translated into a sustained play-off run. That must be the target this year. Of course, with the backing of City Football Group, New York City FC have more resources than most others in MLS, but to claim they have bought success under Vieira would be to demonstrate a lack of a true grasp of the way the division works. Trades, drafts, allocation orders … while David Villa, Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard have all turned out at Yankee Stadium, it’s not just a case of opening the checkbook in MLS. His status as a World Cup and Premier League champion means he has authority in the dressing room, with Villa just one of the players thriving under his tutelage. Another was Jack Harrison, the England Under-21 winger who joined Manchester City in January. What’s more, Vieira has coped with the expectation heaped on his shoulders from the very day of his hiring at NYC FC. This is a franchise that fired Vieira’s predecessor Jason Kreis for missing out on the play-offs in their first ever season in the league. Of course, it’s all relative. The pressure Vieira has dealt with in the States is nothing compared with what he would experience at Arsenal in the post-Wenger age. The Emirates has become a cauldron of ill-feeling in recent years and it will take more than Wenger’s exit to remedy that. Whether Vieira is, as a character, the antidote is down to hunch. Vieira has been presented with the opportunity to use NYC FC as a stepping stone before. He held tentative talks with Ligue 1 side St Etienne last summer, but insisted that he “never asked to leave”. And before Vieira even arrived in New York, he was interviewed for the Newcastle United job in 2015. His name, coupled with the coaching education he was given at Manchester City, probably would have been enough to get Vieira a Premier League job. Instead, Vieira decided to cut his teeth at NYC FC, staying under the City Football Group umbrella for the time being. The idea, at the time, was that the Frenchman would earn his managerial stripes in MLS before eventually returning to the Etihad. Indeed, the Arsenal job may not even be the one Vieira wants most of all. He says returning to Man City to succeed Pep Guardiola is his “fairytale story,” also revealing his ambition to take charge of a Series A team one day. “I’d love to coach an Italian team because it’s a pleasure when you work in a country with passion, and in Italy there is a lot of passion for football,” he told Sky Sports Italia last year. Most recently, Vieira has insisted that he is “ready to coach any side in Europe.” While the Frenchman remains diplomatic, it’s clear he would answer Arsenal’s call. In fact, he would surely answer a call from most major European clubs. The Gunners were criticised for allowing a club legend to become part of a rivals’ coaching team in the first place, with Vieira a coach at Manchester City for five years before joining NYC FC. Dither on hiring him as a manager and they might miss out again. Others will come for Vieira. There’s no way of knowing for sure if Vieira is the right man to succeed Wenger, but the Frenchman has yet to take a misstep as a coach. At Man City, young players are now surfacing from the academy system he helped put in place. At NYC FC, he has forged one of the most dynamic sides in MLS. At the very least, the prospect of what Vieira might do at Arsenal is intriguing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/28/step-back-sandown-mark-bradstock-grand-national-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T20:13:12Z","webTitle":"Step Back puts Bradstocks on Gold Cup and Grand National trail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/28/step-back-sandown-mark-bradstock-grand-national-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/28/step-back-sandown-mark-bradstock-grand-national-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Step Back puts Bradstocks on Gold Cup and Grand National trail","bodyText":"The tiny Letcombe Bassett yard of Mark and Sara Bradstock, made famous by Coneygree’s Gold Cup success, is back in the big time thanks to Step Back, who galloped his rivals into the ground in the Bet365 Gold Cup here. The lightly raced chaser was surely unknown to all but the most ardent followers of racing until this contest, problems having combined to shroud his light, but he is now a serious Grand National prospect for next year. “We’ve got no bloody horses, that’s the trouble,” said Sara Bradstock, grinning a little ruefully in the winner’s enclosure. “We prove again and again that we can do it if you give us the horses.” Step Back was bought at an auction in Cheltenham two years ago for £45,000, about a tenth of what one can expect to pay for the very best chasing prospects. It looks like good business now but evidently there have since been times when the money seemed lost for good. “He’s had terrible problems with his muscle enzymes,” Bradstock said. “He’s taxed us and the vets and the farriers and everybody. But he’s a star. I knew he was in really, really good nick. He’s the most lovely horse and he just jumps and gallops forever.” Victory raised happy memories of Bradstock’s father, the much-missed John Oaksey who was for so long a source of gravitas for Channel 4 Racing and had previously been an amateur jockey of some skill. He won the second running of this race, 60 years ago, on Taxidermist, and sometimes referred to it as his favourite race of each year. Bradstock noted that his preference was for a strong finisher roaring up the famous hill to snatch victory on the line. But he would surely have been just as happy to see his daughter’s Step Back make all the running, pinging his fences and pounding remorselessly homeward as his 19 rivals gave up the unequal struggle. “It was a piece of cake,” said the winning jockey, Jamie Moore. Blaklion, sent off favourite two weeks after being brought down at the first in the National, was never sighted with a chance and was eventually pulled up. Rock The Kasbah and Present Man, the winner’s closest pursuers from an early stage, stuck on to be placed. Bradstock’s hope is that the handicapper does not over-react and will raise her horse by just enough to squeak into next year’s National field. With even greater optimism, she spoke of one more tilt at the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Coneygree, who is reportedly healthy again after a season when he was pulled up in both starts. “His engine is probably a little bit big for his chassis,” she said of Coneygree. Still, for a stable that has had five winners in the whole season, it is really something to have candidates for both of next season’s biggest races and we are all allowed to dream. On the final day of Ireland’s season, Nina Carberry followed her sister-in-law, Katie Walsh, out of the weighing room and into retirement after winning on Josie’s Orders at Punchestown. The pair of pioneering female jump jockeys count as a major loss to the sport but they have smoothed the way for others to follow and Carberry expressed the hope that female success over fences is going to become a theme in future years. “It’s not that I have anything against the boys or anything but the girls are well able to put it up to the lads,” she said, adding, in a reference that may one day prove significant: “My daughter Rosie was here today and she’s full of flight and its wonderful to have her.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/29/may-day-celebrations-morris-dancing-maypoles-sales-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Maypole sales are up as May Day celebrations come back into style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/29/may-day-celebrations-morris-dancing-maypoles-sales-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/29/may-day-celebrations-morris-dancing-maypoles-sales-increase","fields":{"headline":"Maypole sales are up as May Day celebrations come back into style","bodyText":"It is a date that was at the heart of British culture for centuries: May Day, the moment when spring enters full bloom and summer is a-coming in. Now, after a long decline in interest, traditional May Day activities are experiencing their own rebirth. Sales of maypoles are growing and the number of morris dancing teams is also on the rise, with crowds attending May Day festivals of a size not seen for decades. On Tuesday, morris teams will get up before daybreak to “dance in” the dawn in dozens of places including Bluebell Hill in Kent, the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset and at Felixstowe Ferry in Suffolk, and there will be parades later on in Padstow, Minehead, Glastonbury and Edinburgh. “A lot of morris teams will be dancing in the dawn,” said Melanie Barber, president of the Morris Federation, which represents about two-thirds of the 13,000 morris dancers in the UK, including “sides” (teams) like the White Rose Morris Men in Huddersfield and the Abingdon Traditional Morris Dancers in Oxford. “It’s probably a farming tradition, dancing as the sun rises then going off and having a good breakfast. We have more teams joining – a few stop, but on balance numbers are going up.” Maypole dancing is another activity which is seeing greater participation, fuelled by sales of collapsible maypoles which can be easily stored at schools according to Mike Ruff, who teaches maypole dancing. “I never thought that I’d make my living from maypole dancing,” said Ruff, who sells 200 maypole instruction packs a year. “But there’s definitely a good steady growth in interest.” People have danced around maypoles for centuries, but the formal dances involving 12 or 24 people braiding ribbons around the pole was the invention of Victorian art critic John Ruskin. “There are similar traditions around the world,” Ruff said. “You see it in Argentina, Brazil, some of the Caribbean islands.” He believes that the interest in maypoles is fuelled partly by curiosity about English culture and also by modern interpretations. “It’s now viewed as a creative artform rather than just doing the same old formula,” he said, citing modern interpretations by Street Dance the Maypole and the English National Ballet. Folk band Skinny Lister have performed a maypole dance with Land Rovers and there are plans to erect a modern maypole in the Strand, an echo of the 130ft-high pole that was put up in 1661 by Charles II to celebrate the restoration of the monarchy. In that period, May Day was “more like Christmas, Easter and Whitsun, one of the great turning points of the year,” according to Ronald Hutton, professor of history at Bristol University, and a leading authority on British folklore. “It was the English version of the feast which opened the summer season, across northern Europe: when the grass was growing again and so livestock could be put into the outfields or summer pastures, which often involved a lot of movement. In agrarian societies, the crops had all been sown and were sprouting, and a break could be taken before the weeding really began.” Witchcraft was another concern for farmers. Edward Lhwyd, the first keeper of the Ashmolean museum in Oxford, visited Linlithgow in 1699 to observe local customs, including the use of crystals to cure cattle. “Some on May Day put them into a tub of water and besprinkle all their cattle with that water, to prevent being elf-struck, bewitch’d,” he wrote. A lot of May Day traditions are much more recent, according to Steve Roud, the author of The English Year, a comprehensive guide to English customs. May Day started the night before with “bringing in the May”, where everyone in the village would gather bits of greenery and flowers from fields and forests. “They’d bring it back and decorate their homes and the maypole too,” Roud said. “May dew was another thing – it was meant to have magical properties so that if you washed in it, you’d keep your complexion.” Women would get up before dawn to gather May dew – perhaps an added incentive for the morris dancers to dance in the dawn. “The Victorians reinvented May Day and cleaned it up,” he said. “The old atmosphere was that the whole village would get taken over. It was raucous, with lots of drinking and dancing. It was one of the very few occasions when young men and young women could mix together. The Victorians didn’t like that at all.” The village fete, May queens, garlands and maypoles were the Victorian vision of May Day, Roud said, but he is not nostalgic for the lost traditions. “Customs always change and reflect the needs of society.” So is May Day still relevant to most people? “There’s a political or nationalist [atmosphere] around May Day now,” Roud said. “The Tories don’t like it because it’s associated with International Labour Day and they want St George’s Day or Trafalgar Day to commemorate something or other. It’s not much to do with old customs – it’s much more how people see it, as having a day off work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-town-everton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T16:08:04Z","webTitle":"Cenk Tosun rouses Everton to leave Huddersfield teetering above drop zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-town-everton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-town-everton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Cenk Tosun rouses Everton to leave Huddersfield teetering above drop zone","bodyText":"For virtually the entire campaign Huddersfield, overwhelming pre-season favourites for relegation, have fought valiantly to keep their heads above water. But the risk of them sinking has always been present and it increased with this result. David Wagner’s team are still clear of the bottom three but goals by Cenk Tosun and Idrissa Gueye, combined with results elsewhere, mean that Wagner believes his team will reach safety only if they scrounge points from a daunting final week of the season in which Huddersfield take on a trio of giants. “I think 35 points will not be enough to stay up,” said Wagner, whose side face trips to Manchester City and Chelsea before hosting Arsenal in a match that Huddersfield hope will not be their last in the Premier League, even if it will be Arsène Wenger’s. “Last year we worked our socks off to play these opponents and now we play them in the last week of the season and have to get points. For two and a half years we have worked on the impossible and now we face a week that is very difficult but success is possible. Other teams have shown it is possible to steal points off the top six and this is our task now.” Wagner had hoped to make that task unnecessary by beating Everton. “It absolutely feels like a missed opportunity,” he admitted. “I said to the players before: ‘Is it a final?’ Yes, because we are able to get over the line [by winning] but on the other hand, maybe it isn’t, because we will have three more opportunities afterwards, admittedly against top teams.” They began their maybe-a-final warily and never looked like producing enough sharpness to beat Everton. That has been a recurring problem during a league campaign in which they have failed to score in 19 of 35 matches. As for the visitors, many of their supporters still want to see the back of Sam Allardyce – sporadic chants from the 2,300 travelling fans made that much clear – but the manager maintains he is not going anywhere and hopes this victory, on top of positive recent results, will help fans warm to him. “I can’t produce more than I’m doing,” he said. “What can I say when we’ve got 14 points from the last seven games when the club was in a very difficult position when I arrived? I can only say it’s one of those things. If we keep winning, we might change it to love.” There was not much to love or fear about the visitors early on. Everton had a lot of the ball but advanced with the joy and pizzazz of a chain gang. One could understand why Evertonians complain that watching their team can feel like serving a sentence. Huddersfield were emboldened by Everton’s impotence. Steve Mounié landed the game’s first shot on target in the 17th minute but Jordan Pickford saved easily. Three minutes later Terence Kongolo tried his luck from 20 yards but his shot looked like affecting the scoreline only in that it nearly struck the giant scoreboard at the top of the stand. Rajiv van La Parra got a little closer on the half-hour when he drove the ball a couple of yards over the bar after a pull-back by Alex Pritchard. Everton were shrinking all over the pitch and perhaps their dwindling was what lulled Van La Parra into a costly lapse in the 39th minute. The winger sent an attempted crossfield pass straight to Theo Walcott, who released Tosun. Play seemed to unfold in slow motion as the Turk lumbered forward and directed a low cross-shot from the right-hand corner of the box into the bottom corner of the net. It was Tosun’s fifth goal since joining Everton in January and, for Huddersfield, a sickening strike against the run of play. Everton improved in the second half, pre-empting any Huddersfield fightback, and Jonas Lossl was forced to make good saves from Morgan Schneiderlin and Séamus Coleman. Gueye confirmed the visitor’s win in the 77th minute by sweeping a low shot into the net from 16 yards after a simple tee-up by Leighton Baines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/29/harlequins-gary-street-premiership-15s-final-saracens","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:59:37Z","webTitle":"Harlequins hoping to take final steps to glory under Gary Street","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/29/harlequins-gary-street-premiership-15s-final-saracens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/29/harlequins-gary-street-premiership-15s-final-saracens","fields":{"headline":"Harlequins hoping to take final steps to glory under Gary Street","bodyText":"There can be few better qualified to pass judgment on the current state of women’s rugby than Gary Street. England’s head coach for their World Cup triumph in 2014, Street’s abrupt departure from the Rugby Football Union was at the time mystifying but since then he has climbed back to the top of the club game. Harlequins’ toiling men’s side continue to be linked with Stuart Lancaster and in Street there is a perfect example of the benefits of employing a former England head coach. Alongside Karen Findlay, Street helped to lead Aylesford Bulls to the women’s title last season before partnering with Harlequins. Under the pair’s guidance in the inaugural Tyrrells Premier 15s season Harlequins have reached the final, where they lock horns with Saracens – the top two in the regular season table by a distance booking the expected showdown with semi-final wins over Wasps and Gloucester-Hartpury respectively. That tells only half the story of Harlequins’ success, however. On 10 March they attracted more than 4,500 to the Stoop for their victory against Richmond – a British record and a feat all the more impressive when you consider it took place on the same day as supporters of England Women travelled to France for an 18-17 Six Nations defeat that was watched by a crowd of more than 17,000. Anyone who has been to the Stoop recently can attest that the women’s team is given just as much exposure as the men’s on billboards and posters around the ground, while the financial investment from the club – reportedly £250,000 – is commendable. “The support from Harlequins has been staggering – from the owners to the general manager to the CEO – it has been incredible,” says Street. “I genuinely didn’t think that in my lifetime a men’s Premiership club would support a women’s team the way that Quins do. It has taken me aback to be honest. Hopefully, we can bring the trophy home.” The revamped Premier 15s has not been without its teething problems but a final between the best two teams in the division should make for a bumper crowd at Ealing Trailfinders, not least because both sides are locally based. The £2.4m investment from the RFU into the league is primarily used to improve the infrastructure of the 10 sides, but, despite the optimism, women’s rugby still feels in a state of flux. If the Premier 15s has brought a breath of fresh air it has not totally masked the bad smell that came as a result of the RFU’s decision to alter its funding policy. This past week the blazers convened to hammer out a way forward after a season when England – shorn of their sevens players – relinquished their Six Nations title, while those in the shortened form have hardly set the world alight on the sevens circuit. It remains to be seen if the two can coexist . “Friends of mine that, even when I was England coach, didn’t know there was a women’s Premier League now know there is one,” Street says. “It has been a huge acknowledgement of a league programme as well as the international stuff. The investment has been fantastic. “There’s still work to do, but it has made a huge difference in terms of infrastructure. I’m really hoping that will continue from external sponsors in what has definitely been a sea change in women’s sport over the last year or so – women’s rugby has been a big part of that. “It’s important to get the mix right for XVs and sevens. I don’t think sevens is going away, but XVs is growing all the time – there’s a massive audience for it, as we saw with the World Cup final last year. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to get it right.” While Saracens topped the regular-season table by three points from Harlequins, the sides claimed away victories over each other during the campaign. It means Sunday’s final is likely to be a close encounter, ultimately decided by fine margins. “It’s the ideal final, the two best teams who can beat each other on their day,” says Street. “I’ve worked hard for many years to get rid of the brackets – it’s going to be a good game of rugby, not open brackets, for ladies, just a good game of rugby full stop.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/apr/29/azed-crossword-2394","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T23:01:27Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,394","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/apr/29/azed-crossword-2394","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/apr/29/azed-crossword-2394","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,394","bodyText":"Click here for a printable version.

Officials from London, Washington and New York met Cambridge Analytica representatives in a series of meetings aimed at acquiring insights into the “political environment” that followed Trump’s shock win. Details of the meetings, revealed in response to a freedom of information request, show the government hoped it would help “build relationships with the Trump campaign and transition team”, and they took place as the Conservative party was desperately seeking contacts within the incoming US administration. The FoI response also shows the relationship between the Foreign Office (FCO) and the data firm extended to government contracts, with the FCO, under a Labour government, paying more than £400,000 to Strategic Communications Laboratories, the former name of SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, for a project to help tackle extremism. The contract, worth £402,501, was signed in 2008 to provide research and surveys into public opinion as part of an initiative to help Pakistan deal with extremism and radicalisation issues that could affect the UK. Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s leader in Westminster, said the extent of the relationship between the government, SCL and Cambridge Analytica needed to be made public. “The FCO’s dealings with Cambridge Analytica and the £400,000 given to SCL is an alarming revelation, and raises further questions about the government’s dealings with these companies. How many other departments have had such relations with SCL and CA?” Blackford also revealed that he had forwarded questions to Theresa May about links between the Conservative party and Cambridge Analytica, currently under investigation by the information commissioner over the huge leak of Facebook data, but had not received an answer. The company used personal information harvested from more than 50 million Facebook profiles to target US voters with personalised political advertisements. So far it has been established that SCL was granted provisional “List X” status by the Ministry of Defence until 2013, giving it access to secret documents. The MoD praised SCL for the training it provided to a psychological operations warfare group with an official stating it would “have no hesitation in inviting SCL to tender for further contracts of this nature”. The meetings between the Foreign Office and Cambridge Analytica appear to have been at a time May’s government was looking to foster relationships with Trump’s team, with the prime minister having been left embarrassed after Nigel Farage became the first British politician to meet the president following his victory in November 2016. The revelations also follow recent details of a previously undisclosedmeeting in December 2016 between Boris Johnson and Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s suspended chief executive. Reports documenting the meeting suggest Johnson was not hoping to gain details of the algorithm that helped Trump to victory but improve links with the president. Blackford has previously raised questions about links between the Tories and SCL’s chairman Julian Wheatland. In April 2015 Wheatland, also chairman of Oxford Conservative Association, tweeted a selfie with the then prime minister David Cameron."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/29/observer-view-on-government-punitive-benefit-system","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T04:59:34Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the government’s punitive and repugnant benefits policy | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/observer-view-on-government-punitive-benefit-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/observer-view-on-government-punitive-benefit-system","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the government’s punitive and repugnant benefits policy","bodyText":"It was almost two years ago that Theresa May promised, in her first speech as prime minister, to fight against the burning injustices people face as a result of poverty, race or living with a disability. But with every week that passes, it becomes clearer that her political strategy hinges on the exact antithesis of that pledge. Lacking a positive vision or plan, this is a government whose agenda is defined not by finding solutions, but scapegoats. From immigration to disability to support for low-income families, the government has sought to draw a stark distinction between the deserving and undeserving. It has adopted a classic formula for addressing public concerns about issues such as immigration and housing. Create a series of bogeymen: the person faking a disability in order to sit at home all day; the NHS tourist who comes here for the free healthcare and never leaves; the single mother who has several children purely for the extra cash she gets in benefits. Through nods, winks and dog whistles, it’s made clear that it is they – not the government’s lack of investment following the financial crisis – who are to blame for the benefits bill, the burdens on the NHS, the lack of school places and the housing crisis. The nation’s problems are the product of people sponging off the system. Once politicians have constructed this analysis, the answer is simple: design a punitive system to catch the wretched freeloaders out. The problem is that these scapegoats are imaginary, at least at the scale the government would have us believe. NHS “health tourism” costs just 0.3% of the NHS budget; the real reason the NHS is creaking is years of underinvestment. The housing affordability crisis is a result of decades of insufficient levels of housebuilding and undertaxation of property, not immigration. Benefit fraud amounts to a tiny fraction of the revenue the government loses through tax evasion each year. And by gearing a system around catching people out, the government hurts those “ordinary” families whom it has pledged to protect. The Windrush scandal is only the latest exposure of the human cost of scapegoating. As a result of the government’s “hostile environment”, aimed at driving undocumented migrants to leave Britain, people born in the Commonwealth who have lived, worked and paid taxes in Britain for decades have found themselves being denied healthcare, the right to work or to rent a home – and have even been detained and threatened with deportation. These injustices, many of which have been raised repeatedly and effectively by the Labour opposition, can be found right across the state. People with long-term disabilities, forced to undergo reassessments of their capacity to work, have found themselves denied benefits for weeks, even months, as a result of a shambolic assessment system in which people with Down’s syndrome have been asked how they “caught it”. A staggering two-thirds of appeals against these decisions are successful. People who have lost their jobs in the wake of their financial crisis have their benefits sanctioned, pushing them into debt spirals, for the cruellest of reasons, such as missing appointments in order to attend the birth of their stillborn child or their best friend’s funeral. Women with more than two children cannot claim tax credits unless they declare that their third child was born as a result of rape. The results are all-too predictable. As this government has loaded the burden of austerity on to low-income families and people with disabilities, while cutting taxes for the better-off, child poverty rates are predicted to rise to their highest level since records began in the next five years, while food bank use is soaring. Half of households in Britain are net beneficiaries of the state. When the government tries to crack down on the imaginary army of freeloaders, it hurts countless families and causes immeasurable human suffering. In 2002, as party chairwoman, Theresa May told the Conservatives that they were seen as the “nasty party”. Sixteen years later and under her premiership, that description has never felt more apt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/28/kosovo-serbia-ethnic-divide","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T19:59:23Z","webTitle":"Kosovo’s bitter enemies look to heal old wounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/28/kosovo-serbia-ethnic-divide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/28/kosovo-serbia-ethnic-divide","fields":{"headline":"Kosovo’s bitter enemies look to heal old wounds","bodyText":"In a picturesque village in northern Kosovo, Marko Đurić swigged from a bottle of Gazimestan beer and smiled for the cameras. On a visit to the area a few weeks previously, Đurić had been arrested by special forces, bundled into a police van, and unceremoniously deported. This time, Serbia’s point man for Kosovo issues was allowed to stay, albeit with a helicopter hovering noisily overhead to keep watch. Đurić was in Kosovo, which Serbia still officially regards as its province, to tour a microbrewery producing beer named in honour of a medieval battle which is key to Serbia’s emotional attachment to Kosovo. He also visited a spa resort, under construction to cater to Serbian pilgrims to the 14th-century Banjska monastery. “It is my duty to be here and to stand proudly with our people,” said Đurić to the gathered throng of television crews. “I invite all Serbian citizens to come here without prejudice, and experience their holy sites here in Kosovo and Metohija,” he said, using the Serbian name for the province. Nearly two decades after Serb forces withdrew from Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato air campaign against Slobodan Milošević, and a decade after Kosovo declared independence, the country’s most sensitive issue is the fate of its remaining Serb residents, and the political status of the areas where they live. Reprisals by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas after Milošević’s crackdown on the Albanian population in the 1990s, followed by independence, led to a steady outflow of Serbs, and they now make up around 5% of Kosovo’s 1.8 million population. Under an agreement signed in Brussels in 2013, the Kosovo government was supposed to set up a so-called Association of Serbian Municipalities, which would bring Serb-majority areas into its system but would also give them a collective voice. Belgrade and Pristina are still jostling over the final format, as they edge towards a comprehensive deal to normalise relations and potentially usher in an EU future for both. Avni Arifi, chief of staff to Kosovo’s prime minister, said cultural guarantees and political representation for Serbs were already enshrined in its constitution, and he accused Belgrade of wanting to create a Trojan horse, akin to Republika Srpska, the increasingly autonomous Serb entity inside Bosnia. “They’re asking for us to give something more, but forgiveness is all they can get because everything else is taken,” said Arifi. Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vučić last week claimed that Kosovo had done “zero potato” to implement any of its promises. Vučić has been working the diplomatic circuit, trying to drum up support for concessions to Serbia, the details of which still remain vague, as well as prepare public opinion at home for potentially painful compromises. One of Belgrade’s suggestions, increasingly mentioned in the media, is a partition along the Ibar river, with North Kosovo going to Serbia possibly as part of an exchange involving majority-Albanian districts of southern Serbia. “All Serbs would say that’s one of the solutions,” said Vučić, while declining to comment on whether it was a specific goal in negotiations. Kosovo’s president Hashim Thaçi has ruled this option out. “There will be no division of Kosovo. There will be no exchange of territory,” he has said. Western diplomats are also strongly opposed, at least in part because of the precedent it could set for other disputed borders in the Balkans. Additionally, many Serbs live in enclaves south of the river, such as Gračanica, just a few miles outside Pristina. A vast photograph of Vučić dominates the main square, where Serbian flags fly. Serbian dinars are accepted, as well as euros, the official currency. Gračanica’s Orthodox monastery, completed in 1321, is filled with frescos of biblical scenes, most notably a rendering of the Last Judgment complete with burning sinners. It is Kosovo’s medieval monasteries which create the emotional draw for many Serbs, who see it as the heart of their nation and religion. Here, the police force offers a rare glimmer of hope for those who would like to see an integrated, multi-ethnic Kosovo. Of the officers based at Gračanica’s station, 41 are Serbs and 12 are Albanian. Svetlana Kapetanović, a 43-year-old ethnic Serb policewoman who speaks fluent Albanian, said that in recent years ethnically motivated incidents have been extremely rare, with most of the force’s work hours dedicated to fighting petty crime. The officers all wear uniforms emblazoned with the Kosovo flag, at odds with the Serbian flags around the town. Kapetanović said she decided to learn Albanian after an incident at the beginning of her police career in 2003, when she was called with a group of Albanian officers to a domestic violence incident involving a young Albanian woman. “I was the only female officer there, and the girl was giving me looks, like she wanted to communicate something to me without saying it to the men. I could see she wanted help from me and I wanted to talk to her but I couldn’t speak Albanian and she couldn’t speak Serbian. I suspected there had been a rape, and reported it to my commander. Later, it turned out I had been right. It was then I realised that I needed to learn Albanian.” As a fluent Albanian speaker, Kapetanović is a rare Serb. While there is still a generation of Kosovo Albanians who remember Serbian, among the youth crossover it is rare. Children at Serbian-language schools, which still run on the Serbian state curriculum, learn no Albanian, and vice versa. “Unfortunately we still have a situation where Serbs and Albanians live separate lives,” said Dalibor Jevtić, the Serb deputy prime minister, who speaks Albanian. While dodging the issue of his own views on Kosovo’s status, Jevtić said all sides need to take a constructive approach to the language issue. Although his party, Serbian List, has strong links to Belgrade, he said it was not for Serbia to tell Kosovo Serbs how to live. “Ninety per cent of Serbs in central Serbia have never been to Kosovo. They don’t understand our lives and I don’t take it very seriously when they tell me how I should live my life with my neighbours,” he said. Although most Kosovo Serbs are still uneasy at the idea of independence, many now see unemployment and economic disenfranchisement as bigger threats than ethnic tensions. There are also divides within the community, starkly illustrated by the assassination in January of Oliver Ivanović, a Kosovo Serb politician who opposed Serbian List, which dominates the Serb political scene. Ivanović was shot dead in Mitrovica, split into Serbian and Albanian sides by the Ibar. Nobody has been arrested for the murder. “It’s not safe to speak freely in this town, but let’s just say it wasn’t Albanians who killed him,” said Marko Jakšić, a political associate of Ivanović, during an interview in North Mitrovica. Some Kosovo Serbs say Belgrade and Pristina are equally frustrating in using their predicament to score points. The high-profile Kosovo visits of Đuric and others often seem aimed at public opinion in Serbia rather than making material improvements for them. “For Belgrade, Kosovo is just a poker chip to be played on the path to Serbia’s EU integration,” said Jakšić. “Vučić is willing to play it, and Đuric is just meant to be the sedative that makes things easier for us.” Additional reporting by Una Hajdari"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/28/wembley-sale-fa-shadid-khan-fair-price","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T12:46:57Z","webTitle":"Is the FA getting a fair price for the sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan?| David Conn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/28/wembley-sale-fa-shadid-khan-fair-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/28/wembley-sale-fa-shadid-khan-fair-price","fields":{"headline":"Is the FA getting a fair price for the sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan?","bodyText":"Of all the questions prompted by the Football Association’s announcement that it is considering selling Wembley for about £600m to the car parts and NFL billionaire Shahid Khan, one, bluntly, was whether that is actually enough money. For people who believe this is a line too far in the steady sale of football’s soul, no amount of cash would be appropriate to transfer England’s historic home to a US entrepreneur. For those prepared to entertain the proposition that this will unlock a game‑changing amount of money for the regeneration of football’s real soul at the grassroots, the question is more specific: how the FA can justify selling the stadium for less than the £757m it cost to build. One answer is simply that a unique place such as Wembley is worth what somebody is prepared to pay for it. This offer from Khan, who wants to secure the stadium for his Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, is the first. The FA chairman, Greg Clarke, said in his letter to the FA council confirming the negotiations that a City advisor – understood to be Rothschild – has been retained, and is said to consider the mooted £600m a fair price. There is no exclusivity in the process with Khan, so if there are other potential operators interested in buying Wembley, they are free to make rival offers. A further informed view can be gleaned from exhuming the saga of Wembley’s reconstruction, which the FA took over when the British Olympic Association rejected the proposed solution of building a running track on removable concrete blocks. The FA originally took out a £426m loan package led by the WestLB bank, and ultimately paid £493m to the Australian company Multiplex, which had agreed to rebuild Wembley at a fixed price. Multiplex made a substantial loss on the escalation of the cost to £757m and the FA had borrowed much less than that to take possession of the ground in 2007. The following year the FA refinanced the £341.5m it still owed from the original loan, bringing annual interest payments down by £4m, from £31m to £27m during that year. Some FA veterans recall this struggle, after the governing body moved its offices to the new Wembley’s circular corridors, and the effort to whittle the debt down to the manageable £140m left now, and question the idea of selling. Yet those seriously considering the sale argue the accumulated costs of all the interest and capital repaid must be balanced by a recognition that the FA also earned heftily in that time, from the Club Wembley packages and ticket prices – criticised as excessive by fans since the first kick-off. The FA argues it will release huge money for its core purpose of improving the grassroots, while continuing to play England matches and FA Cup finals and semi-finals at Wembley and retaining its Club Wembley cash cow. As for the public playing facilities that Clarke absolutely pledged will be the beneficiaries of any sale, £500m is a serious prospect. When the Football Foundation was formed in 2000 to administer the promised investment from the Premier League of 5% of its TV revenues – its current contribution of £100m annually to facilities and projects does not equate to 5% – it commissioned a report on the ruination it was taking on. The audit found that the years of underinvestment, mostly under the 1979-1997 Conservative governments that cut funding to local authorities, had left a landscape of mudbaths and crumbling old changing rooms that would take £2bn to fix. The Foundation has given many millions in grants to clubs and worked in partnership with local authorities since then but the majority of young and amateur footballers bear weekly witness to the same old squalor. Unlocking £500m tied up in a north-west London venue would make a very major difference and, although Sport England and the government have their original grants tied up in Wembley, further public funding should be attracted if the FA really puts up so huge a sum. Clarke said in his letter that one in three grass pitches nationwide are considered inadequate. That is perhaps more a cause for shame than the idea of selling Wembley to improve them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/29/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-premiership-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T13:17:14Z","webTitle":"Celtic 5-0 Rangers: Scottish Premiership – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-premiership-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-premiership-live","fields":{"headline":"Celtic 5-0 Rangers: Scottish Premiership – as it happened","bodyText":"The Celtic players have gone back to the dressing-room, where Brendan Rodgers is embracing them one by one.

To play with that intensity and aggression, with all the emotional pressure of the day, was really pleasing. I thought we were outstanding; we could have had more goals. It’s a great day for the supporters. It’s very important that we keep winning trophies and we’ve done that.” Scott Brown is conducting the party The celebrations are relatively low key, a reflection of how familiar this has become. Celtic are so superior that they are probably going to end a slightly underwhelming season by doing the domestic treble. The Celtic players have all put on their celebratory Se7en T-shirts, sponsored by Dafabet, and are coming back on the field for a photoshoot. Se7en starring Scott Brown? Now that’s a remake I’d watch. This is how to celebrate winning the league Celtic were wonderful, and passed Rangers to death in an exhilarating first hour. The game became the background to a party after that. The feeling of winning the title is familiar to these players, but winning it in these circumstances is a helluva twist on an old story. Full time: Celtic 5-0 Rangers Sunday 29 April 2018 can go directly into Celtic folklore. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. But do collect yet another Scottish title, the seventh in a row! 90+1 min Morelos, already booked, leaves one on Craig Gordon. The referee decides not to send him off, which is probably fair enough. 90 min Two minutes. 89 min After a mistake by Ajer, Candeias slaps a bouncing ball just wide of the far post. 88 min Celtic are passing down the clock. This would be their biggest ever league win over Rangers. And on today of all days. 87 min This will sound ridiculous ... but Rangers have down fairly well since it went to 5-0. They could easily have thrown it in completely. 85 min Hendry is booked for a foul on Murphy. 84 min “Brendan was briefly a favourite for the Arsenal job,” says Gerry Scott. “I know he’s not going to get it and the Arsenal fans wouldn’t stand for it but is it so unrealistic that he could be considered for a top job in England in the future? Chelsea, maybe, given his past connections? Or are we now in a world where you only get one chance and if you don’t take it you are exiled to the outer darkness?” I think we’re close to that state, definitely, which is pathetic and sad. He should get another big job in England, but I don’t think he will. 83 min Tavernier’s big, deep cross is headed wide by the under pressure Morelos. 80 min Griffiths misses a great chance to make it 6-0. He ran onto Ajer’s excellent headed through pass, worked the ball onto his left foot - and then sliced it over the bar. 79 min The Celtic fans are going through their greatest hits. Griffiths’ deep corner is headed over at the far post by Hendry. That was a decent chance. 78 min Holt is booked for a late tackle on Tierney. 76 min Morelos has a gratuitous kick at Boyata, which prompts a bit of aggro from players on both sides. Morelos is booked. 75 min Odsonne Edouard’s work is done - he’s replaced by Leigh Griffiths. He scored twice, made another, and generally ran Rangers ragged. 74 min Celtic are still pushing for a sixth but there isn’t quite the same focus they had earlier in the game, particularly when they scored four in 12 minutes either side of half-time. 71 min Rangers make a change - Docherty on, Dorrans off. And so do Celtic: Lustig off, Hendry on. 69 min Once upon a time, Neville Southall was Man of the Match for Wales away to the Netherlands. They lost 7-1. Alnwick is in similar territory today - he has already made seven saves, many of them excellent. 68 min “Just to point out - Martin O’Neill had a good record when he arrived in Scotland,” says Chris Rumley. “The manager Celtic had appointed for the previous season was... a legendary Liverpool player with no managerial experience.” Yup, I know he had a good record - that was the point I was making. 67 min Celtic make a change, with Tom Rogic replaced by Scott Sinclair. 65 min Alnwick makes a brilliant double save from Rogic! The second, when he spread himself like Spider-Man, was outstanding. 64 min “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “There’s still 25 minutes to go. If Rangers can get one ... it might finish 8-1.” 64 min McCrorie is booked for a foul on Edouard. 63 min “I was once part of an under-15s team that lost a cup tie 21-0,” says Phil Reilly. “This game is bringing back dark memories for me.” At least they didn’t have social media when you were in the under-15s, eh. 62 min Rangers are still attacking with intent, despite everything. Morelos takes Tavernier’s pass nicely on his chest and moves through on goal. His first-time shot is blocked by a combination of Boyata and Gordon. 61 min Tierney’s precise ball from the left finds Forrest, whose first-time shot is excellently saved by Alnwick. Celtic have had so much joy with low balls in from the left today. I was going to call them crosses but most of them, particulartly from the superb Tierney, have been passes. 59 min Ntcham almost makes it 6-0 with a swooshing volley that is beaten away by the flying Alnwick. 58 min I suspect what will please Brendan Rodgers is not just the scoreline but the way it has been achieved. Celtic have played lovely football today, with such clean, progessive passing and excellent movement on and off the ball. 57 min “Love, love, LOVE Celtic,” says Christine Magee. “A true team - if only we had decent opposition.” Be very careful what you wish for. Rangers fans probably felt the same before Martin O’Neill arrived in Glasgow. 56 min Rangers almost get a non-consolation goal with a stinging shot from Windass that rattles off the outside of the post. It’s his last kick of the game - Alfredo Morelos has come to replace him. 55 min It would be wrong to call this a humiliation. It is much, much worse than that. 54 min This now equals the biggest league win in Old Firm history, and there are still 36 minutes left. This could be 10! Oh my goodness. Celtic are brutalising Rangers. Edouard beats Tavernier with contemptuous ease on the left of the box and cuts the ball into the six-yard box, where McGregor sweeps it into the net. 52 min A chance for Rangers. A short corner is played into the box and flicked on by Windass. Cummings pushes it towards goal and Gordon makes a comfortable save to his right. 50 min The biggest win in league matches was in 1894, when Rangers beat Celtic 5-0. This is an incredible chance for Celtic to seal the title with the biggest win in Old Firm history. 49 min Celtic’s biggest win over Rangers, since you asked, is 7-1 in the League Cup in 1957. But they have never beaten Rangers by five goals in the league. 48 min Oh, Rangers. That didn’t take long. McGregor’s shot is well saved by Alnwick, but he’s too slow to get back in his goal and Rogic scores easily from inside the D. 46 min Rangers kick off for the first time in this second half. Half-time pluggery Half-time entertainment Meanwhile... “Hello Rob,” says Phil West. “What with almost every league in Europe having a runaway leader/champion it should be great here in Turkey that our title race is going to the wire. Galatasaray 63 Fenerbahçe 63 Beşiktaş 62 Başakşehir 62 “Fener played yesterday so have played one more, but Başakşehir have an awkward match away this afternoon and GS play BJK tonight, so it could be 64 - 63 - 63 - 63 by midnight. Whether this is good for the fanatics is another question (the answer is - no, it is terrible) but at least the last three weeks will be eventful!” Celtic are going to seal their seventh consecutive title in legendary style. They slaughtered Rangers in that first half, and any scoreline is possible now. Forrest picked up a loose ball on the right and zipped away from Cummings. When he reached the edge of the area he zig-zagged thrillingly between Murphy and Halliday before driving a ferocious low shot into the far corner from a tight angle. The defending wasn’t great but Forrest’s footwork and finishing were wonderful. Oh my word. What a goal! 44 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “I think Rangers would probably be better off signing Gerrard/Lampard/Vieira/Maradona as players rather than managers?” What formation you using for those? Diamond midfield? Double pivote? 43 min Celtic Park has turned into a bouncy castle. What an atmosphere! Edouard gets his second! It was an emphatic solo goal at the end of a simple Celtic break. Forrest surged past the halfway line and shoved the ball forward to Edouard, who was one against one with Martin. He twisted one way and then the other before ramming a low shot into the far corner from 12 yards. Celtic are going to be champions - on today of all days. 38 min Another sniff of Eau de Goal for Rangers! Candeias plays a fine pass in behind the negligent Ajer for Windass, who gallops into the area from the right. Windass looks up, realises there’s little on and plays a generic cutback that is cleared by a Celtic defender. 37 min Celtic have taken control of the game again. Rangers are working like beasts, but they have really struggled to keep the ball bar that good five-minute period either side of Holt’s chance. 35 min McGregor’s free-kick is cleared via the noggin of Windass. 34 min Rogic nicks the ball off Murphy, who fouls him in frustration. Free-kick to Celtic on the right wing... 33 min Lustig’s mishit shot drifts across goal, fractionally in front of Edouard, who would have had an open goal. Then Ntcham’s shot is blocked. 32 min This is Rangers’ best spell, which is to say the match is pretty even. Murphy is playing nicely on the left wing. 31 min Lampard is an excellent pundit though. 30 min “Personally I’d prefer Lampard,” says Ryan Dunne of the Rangers job. “Perhaps we could have both, a la Evans/Houllier?” After watching England try to assemble a midfield throughout the 2000s, Gerrard/Lampard: The Management Years does not exactly fill me with happy thoughts. 27 min Fine save from Gordon! Rangers created that chance out of nothing. Murphy played a beautiful through pass to Holt, who stretched to steer a low shot towards the far corner. Gordon got down to his left to make a superb save, and Tierney completed the job by booting the ball away from an open goal. 26 min Rangers’ gameplan is simple: pray like never before keep it at 1-0 until at least the 60th minute, then play on any Celtic nerves. 25 min Rangers work the ball smartly from right to left for Murphy, whose shot from the edge of the box is blocked. It deflects back off the referee and out of play, which means a fortunate corner for Rangers. No need for outrage at the laws of football: Celtic clear the corner. 24 min Rogic plays a lovely pass out to McGregor, who scoots into the area and skims a low cross towards Edouard. McCrorie makes a crucial interception. 22 min If Celtic get a second soon, this could be a tennis score. It’s been a glorious performance so far. 21 min Halliday again gets a round of applause from the Celtic fans when he takes a throw-in. Great stuff. 20 min Jason Cummings is a candidate for a red card. He’s already been booked and looks like his noggin is about to go. 18 min McGregor curls a shot over the bar from 25 yards. Rangers are being battered just now. 17 min This has been a blistering start from Celtic. Another break ends with McGregor finding Forrest, whose shot is blocked. The goal was made superbly by Tierney, who beat Candeias with sleight of hip on the left and passed a lovely ball into the six-yard area. Edouard got in front of Dorrans and poked it into the net. Edouard took the right option that time! 13 min Edouard makes a mess of a promising Celtic break. He had a through ball on to Rogic but tried to go alone and hit a shot that was deflected over the bar. 12 min Halliday collects the ball for a throw-in and gets a round of applause from the Celtic fans. Arf. 11 min Cummings hasn’t seen the ball, so he settles for the next best thing with a crunching reducer on Tierney. He’s booked. 8 min McGregor’s near-post corner is flicked over the bar by Lustig. It wasn’t much of a chance. 8 min Rangers can’t get out of their quarter, never mind their half. Celtic are playing some slick, penetrative stuff and have already had four or five corners. 6 min It’s all Celtic so far. Rangers need to survive this period or it could get messy. McGregor’s shot is blocked and rebounds to Ntcham, who shapes a curler towards the far corner. Alnwick dives smartly to his left to push it behind. He’s made two important saves already. 3 min McGregor’s corner is flapped away unconvincingly by Alnwick and drops to Ntcham on the edge of the area. He roasts a half-volley towards goal, and Alnwick dives sharply to his right to redeem the original error with a smart save. 2 min The keeper Alnwick charges out of his area to head a long ball away from danger. Celtic have made a fast start. 1 min The home team kick off amid a party atmosphere at Celtic Park. Here’s the SPFL table before kick-off. Celtic are going to win their seventh title in a row. But there is a bit of a bright side for Rangers: just imagine the party when they win their next title, especially if it stops Celtic claiming nine or ten in a row. An email! “What do you think of the fact Gerrard is apparently about to become Rangers manager?” says Gerry Scott. “Maybe its wishful thinking given I’m a Celtic fan but I suspect it is going to go very, very wrong for all concerned.” There’s certainly the potential for the highest farce. I think it’s a worthwhiule gamble for Rangers, because with his personality and contacts he could do great things. It’s a big risk for Gerrard, though, especially in the current climate. Moussa Dembele has not recovered from injury, so Odsonne Edouard starts up front for Celtic. Andy Halliday, who has such a nightmare at Hampden Park a fortnight ago, starts for Rangers in place of the injured Declan John. Celtic (4-2-3-1) Gordon; Lustig, Boyata, Ajer, Tierney; Brown, Ntcham; Forrest, Rogic, McGregor; Edouard. Substitutes: Bain, Simunovic, Kouassi, Sinclair, Roberts, Griffiths. Rangers (4-2-3-1) Alnwick; Tavernier, McCrorie, Martin, Halliday; Holt, Dorrans; Candeias, Windass, Murphy; Cummings. Substitutes: Kelly, Hodson, Rossiter, Docherty, Goss, Morelos, O’Halloran. Referee Craig Thomson. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Celtic v Rangers from Celtic Park. In this week’s edition of Fresh Hell, Rangers go into the match knowing a defeat will confirm Celtic as champions. Even the fixture list, it seems, has got it in for poor old Rangers these days. It’s only a fortnight since Celtic butchered Rangers 4-0 in the Scottish Cup semi-final, and they are strong favourites today. Rangers do at least have the draw – they know that result would delay Celtic’s title party. And if they can beat their oldest rivals in the league for the first time since 2012, it’ll almost feel like a victory! Kick off is at midday. Rob will be here shortly.

Alongside 15 others, including Ed Miliband, Doreen Lawrence and those from the Grenfell community, I have joined the commission and will spend the next few months hearing from social tenants about their experiences, setting out necessary changes and scrutinising the role the sector could play in easing Britain’s housing crisis. I am the first to admit that I’m an unlikely social housing commissioner. I have never lived in social housing. Even during my childhood, my parents turned to our wider family to support us during tough times. Social housing, meanwhile, was for people who had hit rock bottom and had nowhere to turn for help. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to seize the opportunities provided by social mobility. I was lucky that, as a young lawyer in Yorkshire, I was able to buy my first home – for around twice my salary. Yes, interest rates were high 25 years ago and I still had to work hard, but it didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t be able to buy my own home. Now I meet young solicitors who, even with a promising career, know the prospect of owning their own home seems impossible. I used to assume that the market would always provide for people who worked hard, that any kinks in the housing market would iron themselves out in the end. Of course, a safety net would always be necessary for some, yet for the majority hard work would pay off and social housing would be as irrelevant as it had been to me. Housing would be a private matter, not a government concern. Now, this basic social contract is broken. Socially mobile young people find that working hard isn’t enough unless they have help from the bank of mum and dad. And that safety net for people at the bottom? It’s looking ever more stretched as more and more people need help. It’s clear that the housing market is fundamentally broken. Tweaks by successive governments have not rectified this and even the current Conservative government has published a white paper on the “broken housing market”. That’s because the effects are being felt widely, from the growing numbers of people being made homeless, to young people stuck in expensive and insecure private rents, despairing of ever finding a way out. Politicians cannot look young people in the eyes and honestly tell them that everything will be OK if they just work hard. Our broken housing market has become a major barrier to social mobility. This is an intolerable situation and demands politicians of all hues respond. Shelter’s commission will consider the role in which social housing, and government more generally, should provide an alternative. I start this process with a genuinely open mind. I admit that I have been innately sceptical of large-scale social housing. I’ve always seen it as a safety net, but a worsening housing crisis forces us to ask whether that safety net needs to be stretched far wider. Or, with the market no longer providing a housing ladder, does a wider group of people need to use social housing as a stepping stone? Shelter has embarked on a large consultation and fact-finding exercise, which will give me and my fellow commissioners the evidence we need to answer these questions. It’s a privilege to have the opportunity to debate this alongside 15 smart people from a range of backgrounds and political affiliations. We have met once and it’s impossible to guess what we will conclude, but what’s clear and exciting is a shared determination to set out a vision for social housing that everyone can support. • Sayeeda Warsi is a lawyer and a member of the House of Lords"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/29/budget-earmarks-500m-to-mitigate-great-barrier-reef-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T20:25:29Z","webTitle":"Budget earmarks $500m to mitigate Great Barrier Reef climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/29/budget-earmarks-500m-to-mitigate-great-barrier-reef-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/29/budget-earmarks-500m-to-mitigate-great-barrier-reef-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Budget earmarks $500m to mitigate Great Barrier Reef climate change","bodyText":"The Turnbull government will allocate $500m to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. The funding, to be unveiled on Sunday and confirmed in the May budget, follows a recent study finding that 30% of the reef’s corals died in a catastrophic nine-month marine heatwave in 2016. The government will partner with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in a $444m agreement to tackle crown-of-thorns starfish, reduce pollution and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The government will increase funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Department of the Environment and Energy by $56m to expand environmental management and compliance operations. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both of the major parties are currently focused on winning hearts and minds in Queensland, with the state’s marginal seats likely to determine the outcome of the next federal election. The Coalition has been criticised by environment groups for not acting fast enough to protect the reef, and the government’s support for the Adani coalmine has also been controversial both locally and nationally because of its potential impact on the reef. In January Guardian Australia revealed that millions of dollars of commonwealth money was being handed to tourism-linked groups for reef protection, despite official advice recommending against the projects, or repeatedly finding them to be failing. Earlier this year, the head of the United Nations environment program warned the battle to save the world’s coral reefs was at “make-or-break point”. Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture. In a statement issued in advance of Sunday’s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it. “Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,” Turnbull said. “A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our reef the best chance.” Turnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours. “As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,” the prime minister said. The funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health. The study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – published in April – examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death. It found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals. It said “initially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks”. “These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/29/spain-black-legend-inquisition-conquistadors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:59:35Z","webTitle":"Spain fights to dispel legend of Inquisition and imperial atrocities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/spain-black-legend-inquisition-conquistadors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/29/spain-black-legend-inquisition-conquistadors","fields":{"headline":"Spain fights to dispel legend of Inquisition and imperial atrocities","bodyText":"Beyond the cliched vistas of bullfights and beaches, and beneath the stereotypes of sunshine and sangría, fiestas and siestas there lurks a dark view of Spain that some of its people find bitterly and enduringly unfair. For more than 500 years, they say, the country’s past has been disfigured and distorted by the propaganda spread by its former opponents and rivals. The so-called leyenda negra – black legend – was spun by chroniclers in England and the Netherlands who supposedly sought to depict their Roman Catholic enemies as unusually cruel and bloodthirsty and to exaggerate the brutality of the Spanish empire and the Inquisition. Five centuries on, a newly established group, the Hispanic Civilisation Foundation, is hoping to lay the legend to rest by using feature films, TV programmes, books and mobile exhibitions to lighten Spain’s historical image. The foundation, made up of businessmen, diplomats, journalists, lawyers, academics and writers, aims to restore a lost sense of pride in the spread of Spanish culture. According to the foundation, Spaniards have spent far too long feeling guilty and ashamed of their past and worrying about how they are seen by the rest of the world. “We need to improve the self-esteem and cohesion of Spaniards when it comes to their shared history and what they have contributed to humanity,” says Borja Cardelús, a writer and vice-president of the foundation. “There are various reasons why self-esteem is so low but it’s fundamentally because neither Spain nor Hispanic countries have cultivated their images.” Cardelús said that, unlike Spain, the US, the UK and France had used culture and education to foster a favourable international image. “They’ve done this brilliantly well – but Spain hasn’t,” he says. “That has meant that others, outside Spain, have been the ones making Spain’s image, and that’s what’s called the leyenda negra.” Although he singles out figures such as the Dutchman Theodor de Bry – whose engravings of Spanish imperial atrocities helped cement the conquistadors’ reputation for cruelty – Cardelús lays much of the blame for the black legend at the door of a famous Spaniard. The 16th-century Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas has long been feted for his early and fierce defence of the indigenous people of the Americas, but some historians have criticised him for overstating the barbarism of the Spaniards and getting his figures badly wrong. “It’s true that, through his exaggerations and lies, Bartolomé de las Casas managed to get the Spanish crown and the country’s politicians to protect the Indians,” says Cardelús. “In that respect, his position was very laudable. But Bartolomé de las Casas also suggested that Indians could be saved by importing slaves from Africa.” Cardelús, who takes a markedly benign view of the conquest of the Americas, argues that Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro brought “a far more humanitarian system” to the Aztec and Inca empires they conquered. “Cortés and Pizarro went into territories that have been eulogised … but the Aztecs practised human sacrifice,” he says. “Cortés had no problem allying himself with those indigenous people who saw the Spanish as liberators from Aztec oppression. Things were even worse with the Incas, whose empire was very totalitarian.” What’s more, he says, the black legend has come to eclipse Spain’s role in the development of the concept of human rights through the School of Salamanca. Others have a more nuanced view of Spain’s imperial adventures and subsequent reputation. “I don’t deny the existence of the black legend – you can’t deny the evidence of that negative criticism,” says Ricardo García Cárcel, a historian and author of books on the black legend, the Golden Age and the inquisition. “But I do question the fatalistic, victim mentality that surrounds the issue: ‘Oh, poor Spain! What have we done to deserve this?’” If you look at the Spanish empire from a historical point of view, he says, it becomes clear that it had its bright patches as well as its ugly shadows. Take, for example, Spain’s Golden Age literature and the huge interest in the works of Cervantes which were translated and spread across the world. “There were evident virtues when you think of the cultural projection in both Europe and the Americas,” adds García Cárcel. “You can’t deny the existence of that extraordinary cultural empire. But you also have scenes of military violence like the sack of Antwerp.” He argues that Spain never had the necessary resources to come up with a counter-legend. “It lost the image war and the war of public opinion in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.” He also wonders whether this latest public show of anxiety over Spain’s international image has been prompted by recent events in Catalonia, and by the periodic national tendency to indulge in soul-searching. “We’re living through the old problem of national consciousness and the dismantling of the nation state called Spain, which is being called into question by the whole Catalan question,” he says. “Amid this national insecurity, we’re seeing the return of a phrase that we thought was dead and buried. Spain is once again obsessively – almost neurotically – fixed on what other people think.” Cardelús denies there is any political dimension to the foundation’s work and says the fact that its emergence has coincided with the political crisis in Catalonia is purely coincidental. But he adds: “It does seem an opportune moment because one of the things we’re trying to do is bring together all the people of Spain when it comes to what we’ve done and what we’ve contributed.” He also rejects suggestions that this is all an attempt to whitewash the country’s colonial past. “We’re not looking to swap the black legend for a rose-tinted legend,” he says. “We’re looking to swap the black legend for the truth.” Emilio Sáenz-Francés, a lecturer in history and international relations at Madrid’s Comillas Pontifical university is sceptical about the notion that the legend still fogs foreign eyes. Perhaps one reason for the survival of la leyenda negra, he suggests, is Spain’s lasting fascination with it. “Well-informed people around the world know pretty well what Spain’s history has been and though they may have a cliched image of Spain, it’s no worse than that of the UK when it comes to certain things or France in other things,” he says. “But I think there’s something a little bit self-punishing in the Spanish mentality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/28/riley-mcgree-wonder-goal-is-this-the-greatest-ever-a-league-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T05:37:49Z","webTitle":"Riley McGree wonder-goal: is this the greatest ever A-League strike?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/28/riley-mcgree-wonder-goal-is-this-the-greatest-ever-a-league-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/28/riley-mcgree-wonder-goal-is-this-the-greatest-ever-a-league-strike","fields":{"headline":"Riley McGree wonder-goal: is this the greatest ever A-League strike?","bodyText":"With a spot in the A-League grand final on the line and redemption for a club that has badly struggled for seven long years, there couldn’t have been a better time to score any goal, let alone this goal. The home fans couldn’t believe it. The Newcastle Jets bench couldn’t believe it. And neither could Riley McGree. After Bruno Fornaroli’s scrappy goal handed visitors Melbourne City an early lead, and after the Jets had spurned several good chances to draw level, in the 57th minute, from a seemingly innocuous passage of play; this. McDonald Jones Stadium erupted with delight at the 19-year-old’s goal, just the sixth of his career. It was as outrageous as it was unexpected, but McGree appeared to play down the attempt at full-time. “I did get a bit lucky but I had the momentum going forward and it happened to go in. I’m pretty happy,” he told Fox Sports. “Definitely a bit of fluke but you’ve got to try it to get it.” The goal sent the crowd into meltdown, and garnered the approval of two of the league’s greatest ever goalscorers as both Archie Thompson and Shane Smeltz took to social media to commend the effort. “That’s got to be the best goal I’ve seen in a-league history,” wrote Thompson. Smeltz, who plundered 92 goals in his prolific A-League career, suggested the A-League would be mad not to cash in on the moment. “Hahahaha I just can’t stop watching the McGree goal ... analysing it ... just Brilliant &amp; what a bit of marketing for the A-League,” he tweeted. As the Australian football community melted down over the goal, one man sat unmoved on the Jets bench. McGree wasn’t fazed by his coach’s reaction, joking when interviewed post-game. “He’s always like that. He doesn’t show emotion at all,” he said. The experienced Scot did however allow himself a wee celebration at the post-game press conference, where he arrived with a beer, and then told the gathered journalists that McGree’s effort was something worked on on the training ground. No wonder he was celebrating. A year ago the Jets had received the A-League’s wooden spoon, but with the arrival of the former Wellington Phoenix coach, Newcastle now have booked a second grand final, and their first since 2007-08.

On the eve of polling day, here are some of the howlers pushed through letterboxes in the areas of UK that will be voting. Pride of place must go to the Conservatives in Ilford, who managed to print out and deliver the template for their leaflet, without adding in any of their policies or achievements: The Tories have also run into spelling trouble in the borough of Redbridge, which Ilford belongs to, but this time the name of one of their own candidates. They have had to issue leaflets explaining that their candidate Mahboob Chaudhary will appear on ballot papers as Matthew Chaudhary “due to an administrative error”. Presumably the same administrative error meant they got his name wrong on their own website as well … website states that it is “Promoted by [Name of Election Agent] on behalf of [Name of Candidate] both at [Address of Election Agent]”. Conservatives in Trafford were unable even to spell the name of their party correctly. The mistake was pointed out by several social media users, including Stephane Savary, who is standing for Labour in Altrincham. A rather more serious issue occurred in Dudley, where the Conservative candidate Kamran Razzaq issued a leaflet which asked “What have Labour delivered to this ward?” and provided the answer “Hepatitis.” “Mr Razzaq’s leaflet was produced without being vetted,” said the Conservative leader of the council Patrick Harley. “The local association have suspended him pending an investigation.” The mention of hepatitis is believed to be related to a primary school in nearby Wednesbury that was closed for two days before Christmas following a case of Hepatitis A and an outbreak of Norovirus. In Swindon, it was Labour’s picture choice that caused a stir. An election leaflet featuring candidate Simon Firth showed him standing in front of a popular local attraction, Lower Shaw Farm. The owner of the farm, Matt Holland, is angry that the image was used without his permission, and appears to imply that the farm endorses Labour. A photo mishap of a different kind befell Conservatives in Enfield Southgate, where they were accused of sending a doctored photo to the local press. The picture appears to show the former MP for Enfield Southgate David Burrowes and his dog at a residents’ protest meeting that neither he nor his dog attended. The fact that the dog appeared to be floating in mid-air was a significant clue, and social media users quickly dubbed the affair #doggate. The Enfield Independent, who were sent the dodgy image, which they initially published, say they had still not received an explanation from the Conservatives. The local Tories have also been unable to stop the image of Burrowes and his dog propagating on social media. Anybody who has followed local politics for any length of time will know the running jokes about the Liberal Democrat graphs that aren’t especially statistically accurate, but this time it’s Labour’s turn to claim a production error caused them to fall into the same trap in Colchester. When it was pointed out that one of their leaflets contained a completely fictional graph, a local activist explained that the draft version of the graph had gone into print by mistake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/may/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-rees-mogg-claims-tory-brexiter-customs-partnership-warning-will-help-may-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T19:23:14Z","webTitle":"Government suffers 10th Lords defeat on EU withdrawal bill – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-rees-mogg-claims-tory-brexiter-customs-partnership-warning-will-help-may-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/may/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-rees-mogg-claims-tory-brexiter-customs-partnership-warning-will-help-may-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Government suffers 10th Lords defeat on EU withdrawal bill – as it happened","bodyText":"The government suffered a 10th defeat over its flagship EU withdrawal bill when the House of Lords voted for an amendment that would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, told peers that Brexiters in his party are “playing with fire” and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland “that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent”. (See 4.59am.) The Brexit war cabinet delayed a decision on the UK’s customs arrangements after failing to reach agreement in a crunch meeting. The prime minister asked officials to draw up “revised proposals” for minister to consider again. MPs voted down a Labour attempt to gain access to documents detailing the Windrush crisis after Theresa May promised the government would review the decisions leading to it. Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said it was “nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation”. Women’s lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. This live blog is now closing down. In the Lords vote (see: 7.02pm), an analysis of the division list showed 19 Tory rebels backed the amendment, voting against the government. They included the former deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, and the former ministers, David Willetts, Douglas Hogg and Ros Altmann. The division list for the Commons vote on the Windrush scandal (see: 7.20pm) showed 180 of Labour’s 258 MPs voting in favour, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the ayes. The remainder of those who voted in favour included 28 SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats, four Plaid Cymru, the Green Party’s MP Caroline Lucas, and the independent MPs Kelvin Hopkins, Ivan Lewis and Jared O’Mara. The list also showed 306 of the Conservative Party’s 316 MPs voted against the motion, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the noes. Nine DUP MPs and the independent, Charlie Elphicke, also opposed the motion. Reacting to the government’s defeat over the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), the Liberal Democrat leader in the upper house, Lord Newby, said: This vote has recognised what Theresa May hasn’t: that the issue of the Northern Ireland border is of paramount importance. We cannot risk Conservative incompetence and Brexit dogma creating a hard border, and we will not allow years of strong relations within these islands to be jeopardised by Brexit. The government has survived the motion – MPs have voted down Labour’s motion to force ministers to disclose eight years of internal documents and correspondence about the Windrush scandal. The government imposed a three-line whip on Tory MPs to vote against and won by 316 votes to 221 – a majority of 95. Responding to the defeat, Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: This was an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation. After losing her human shield with the resignation of Amber Rudd, the architect of this scandal, Theresa May, ordered her MPs to vote to cover up the truth of her involvement. This is nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation and others who have been affected by the government’s heartless ‘hostile environment’, and flies in the face of the new home secretary’s promise to make things right. Tory MPs will now have to explain to the people whose lives have been turned upside down why they think they don’t deserve the facts to be known and don’t deserve proper justice. In the Commons, MPs are voting on Labour’s opposition day motion demanding the government release documents related to the treatment of the Windrush generation, with a result expected in a few minutes. Ministers have imposed a three-line whip on Conservative MPs to try to defeat the measure, which represents a change from recent Tory policy of not taking part in votes on opposition day motions. Responding to the government’s defeat in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: This vote sends a clear signal to the government that they must urgently find a solution to the Northern Ireland border. Ill-conceived compromises and unrealistic technological solutions are simply not good enough. The government’s failure to act is holding back the Brexit negotiations and creating deep uncertainty for communities in Northern Ireland. Ministers should back this amendment and accept Labour’s call for a new comprehensive customs union with the EU. The House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, delivering a 10th defeat to the government on its flagship Brexit legislation. Voting was 309 to 242, a majority of 67, for a cross-party amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill also enshrining support for the Good Friday peace agreement and continued “North-South” cooperation. While peers vote, it has been announced that a decision on the UK’s customs arrangements after Brexit has been put off after a crunch meeting of senior ministers failed to reach agreement. The prime minister, Theresa May, asked officials to draw up “revised proposals” after the government was unable to unite behind one of the two options on the table – both of which have already been dismissed as “unworkable” by EU officials. Downing Street sources said ministers in May’s “Brexit war cabinet” recognised there were “challenges” with both of the proposed solutions, which were first put forward last summer. The Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and his team are expected to come forward with amended proposals swiftly so that ministers can arrive at a preferred option possibly as early as next week. The new cabinet members, Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson, both came out in the meeting against the “customs partnership” model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Their opposition came after eurosceptic Tory backbenchers signalled that they regarded the partnership plan – branded “cretinous” by Jacob Rees-Mogg – unacceptable because he believed it would deliver Brexit in name only. Chris Patten is now concluding the Lords debate. He says invites Lord Duncan, the minister, to join him later on in voting for the government’s policy (a joke about how his amendment, which the government is opposing, is nominally just a statement of government policy). Referring to Lord Bridges’s speech (see 5.46pm), he says he would not have signed an agreement in December that could lead to the creation of a border in the North Sea. As a former Hong Kong governor, he knows enough about one country, two systems. He calls for a vote. And now peers are voting on the amendment. At this point I’m handing over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been reading Laura Kuenssberg’s tweets. (See 6.28pm.) On the basis of what she’s read, Sturgeon says government Brexit policy is “an utter shambles”. Back in the Lords Duncan is coming to the end of his speech. He says the government is firmly committed to the Good Friday agreement. It is entrenched in nine pieces of primary legislation, he says. But he says the political language in the second half of the amendment is not acceptable to the government. That does not mean the government is not committed to the Good Friday agreement, he says. Turning away from the House of Lords debate for a moment, here is some more on the cabinet sub committee meeting on customs. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From ITV’s Robert Peston From the Sun’s Harry Cole Duncan admits that much of what is in the Patten amendment reflects government policy. But the language is political, he says, particularly towards the end of the amendment. He says it is not the language of legislation. It will be for the government to write legislation when the withdrawal agreement is finalised. The text of the amendment, amendment 88, is in this document (pdf). In the Lords Lord Duncan of Springbank, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office and the Scotland Office, is now winding up for the government. He says the government is clear; it will not allow a border to be put in place in the North Sea. He says Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said some red lines might have to be adjusted. But that is not the case in Ireland, he says. He says Barnier should listen to both communities in Northern Ireland. In the Lords debate Paul Murphy, the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary, is winding up for the opposition. He says all sides in Ireland want to avoid the return of a hard border. All the amendment is doing is providing for what everyone wants, he says. Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, has told the House of Lords that Brexiters in his party are “playing with fire” and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland “that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent”. (See 4.59am.) He was speaking at the start of a debate on an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill he has tabled that would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The government is expected to lose when the amendment gets put to a vote, probably within the next half an hour. We will be covering the result. The government will review the decisions leading to the Windrush crisis, Theresa May has said, in an announcement intended to head off a Labour attempt to seek access to documents detailing the process. MPs are still debating the Labour motion, which will be put to a vote at 7pm. We will be covering that result too. Women’s lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. In the Lords debate Lord Bridges, the remain voter who served as a Brexit minister until the general election, said he would be supporting the government and voting against the Patten amendment. He said parliament had to give the government space to negotiate, and to allow it to make compromises. But he did not sound positive about the Brexit talks process. He told peers: My fear is that, come the autumn, the agreement on the future arrangements will be fudge. But it cannot be fudge containing the poison pill of that backstop. People voted to leave the European Union. They did not vote to break up the union that underpins our nation. So the double think of the December agreement, in which paragraph 49 says one thing and paragraph 50 another, cannot be allowed to seep into the final agreement. Bridges said, if peers wanted to take a stand about the Brexit withdrawal agreement because of its provisions for Ireland, the time to do that would be at the end of the process. Back in the House of Commons the Labour MP David Lammy was applauded as he likened the Home Office’s “compliant environment” to slavery. Lammy, whose father came to Britain from Guyana in 1956 and who has been a leading campaigner on behalf of the Windrush migrants, compliance was “written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors”. Referring to the way the new home secretary Sajid Javid prefers the term “compliant” to “hostile” to describe that way the government wants to create an environment that discourages illegal immigration, he said: On behalf of the Windrush generation, keep in mind that spiritual, let freedom reign: it will only reign when this country turns back from the path it’s on, ends the compliant environment in which I know my place, and starts along a humane path that at its heart has human rights ... The Windrush generation are here because of slavery. The Windrush story is a story of British empire and the Windrush community and its ancestors know what hostile and compliance means. We know what compliance means: it’s written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors. Slaves having to nod and smile when they were being whipped in a cotton field or a sugarcane field were compliant. Watching your partner being tied to a tree, beaten or raped on a plantation, is compliance. Twelve million people being transported as slaves from Africa to the colonies is a compliant environment. Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative MP who defected to Labour after the 1997 election and who subsequently sat in the House of Lords as a Labour peers, has died, the BBC reports. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has backed Downing Street (see 4.08pm) in talking up the case for an inquiry into the bullying allegations against John Bercow (which he denies). In a statement she said: It is for Dame Laura Cox QC to consider whether the terms of reference of her independent inquiry need to be expanded, to allow for individual investigations to take place. I’m sure she will be looking very carefully at how best to respond to these latest developments. We must call out unacceptable behaviour and stand by the House staff who do so much for us. The independent complaints procedure that I am establishing for all who work in or visit parliament will, I believe, make parliament one of the best places in the world to work, and to be treated with dignity. I am determined to stamp out all forms of bullying and harassment in parliament, and separate to these allegations, I encourage any member of House staff who has experienced mistreatment to provide their confidential testimony to Dame Laura Cox. Everyone in Westminster has a responsibility to play their part in changing the culture in parliament. In the House of Lords peers are debating the EU withdrawal bill again. We are expecting another vote, and another government defeat, on an amendment tabled by Chris Patten, the Conservative former cabinet minister and former European commissioner (and head of an inquiry into policing in Northern Ireland in the 1990s). Patten’s amendment, amendment 88, would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Opening the debate, Patten said that what he was asking for was in line with stated government policy. But he explained why he thought his amendment needed to be written into law. There are a number of members of the Conservative party in another place [the Commons] who are very keen for the over the cliff, onto the rocks Brexit and I think are making life rather more difficult for the prime minister to square circles than should be the case. Most of his speeech was about the importance of the Good Friday agreement. Here are some extracts. As the government say in their position paper, the issue of identity goes to the heart of the Good Friday agreement. And anybody who doubts that that’s the case should look at curbstones, should consider flags. In 2012 the city council in Belfast decided it wanted to reduce the number of times during the year that the union flag was flown. Result: a year of demonstrations and civil disorder, 130 police officers injured, a political office firebombed. Ask yourself this question. Why is the Northern Ireland not working at the moment? Because of an article about identity, because of an argument about parity of esteem for different cultures and different loyalties. That is why it is not working. The genius of the Good Friday agreement was to extract from nationalists the commitment that they would only ask for change constitutionally in Northern Ireland if it was the process of democracy. And on the other hand they were told they didn’t have to sign up to being loyal to all the usual symbols of what they regarded as the unionist state. It hasn’t meant that everyone is loving one another to bits. But it has ended the violence. Violence which saw the deaths of a thousand police officers and soldiers during the Troubles, twice as many as died in Iraq or Afghanistan ... There was a suggestion in the debate on the customs union that this House, by talking about that, by talking about the border and so on, was playing with fire. [Patten is referring to a speech by his Tory colleague Michael Forsyth.] I’ll tell you what I think playing with fire is. I think playing with fire is blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent, with a can of petrol and a box of matches in the other hand. I think that’s playing with fire. I think that’s what we’re really in danger of doing ... I don’t want to go back to the old triumphs, the old humiliations, the old animosities, the old feuds. I think it would be shameful, shameful and dishonourable, if this House was do to anything that made this more likely. I think it would be a stain on our history. Shona Robison, the Scottish government’s health secretary, has issued this statement about the breast screening bungle in England. She said: I want to reassure members of the public that this issue does not affect the NHS in Scotland and patients should be reassured that there are no problems with our breast screening programme records or IT systems. As usual, all women should continue to be aware of changes to their breasts and if they have any concerns they should see their GP. Scottish government officials will be working with Public Health England to identify any women affected in England who have subsequently moved to Scotland. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, has tweeted a picture today of the most important whiteboard in Whitehall. It belongs to Sue Gray, who is leaving her post as director general of the propriety and ethics team at the Cabinet Office, and it is the one that reportedly gets wheeled out ever time there is a government reshuffle. Gray used to help decide who could go where, and this is the surface where the moves used to get mapped out. This is from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh. According to ITV’s Robert Peston, the cabinet’s Brexit sub committee has wrapped up without coming to a conclusion on the customs union - as expected. (See 9.54am.) In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee is speaking now. The Conservative MP Jeremy Quin asks her, as a former government minister, what she thinks of the Labour motion. (See 10.51am.) He says it is very, very broad. It could lead to the disclosure of cabinet minutes, or information about communications with foreign governments, he says. Cooper says, although the motion says the Windrush papers should go to her committee, her committee has not discussed the matter. If the motion does get passed and her committee gets the papers, they will handle them “in a very responsible way”, she says. She says Windrush migrants ended by being treated as illegal immigrants by mistake. It is reasonable for the government to have targets, she says. But if there are targets, there must be safeguards. She also singles out the net migration target for criticism, saying that has encouraged the Home Office to deport people whether they are here legally or illegally. This is what Theresa May said at PMQs earlier when she announced an inquiry into the Windrush scandal. She told MPs: We all share the ambition to make sure we do right by members of the Windrush generation, which is why [Sajid Javid] will be announcing a package of measures to bring transparency on the issue, to make sure that the House is informed, and to reassure members of this House but, more importantly, to reassure those people who have been directly affected. Speed is of the essence and [Javid] will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge, with the intention of reporting back to this House before we rise for the summer. The review will have full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has condemned this as inadequate. Satbir Singh, its chief executive, issued this response. Nothing that the government has announced today in parliament will address the root causes of the Windrush scandal – namely the “hostile environment” policy. Hostility is still very much in play, the government still plans to roll Right to Rent out further to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which independent evidence by JCWI has proven discriminates and harms. The hostile environment continues unabated denying people health care, stopping doctors and nurses and other workers we so desperately need, working in our beloved NHS. If the government was truly committed to learning any lessons it would stop this hostility in its tracks, treat people as people, not numbers and carry out a fully independent review of the Home Office’s policies and practices. Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice and home affair spokeswoman, is speaking in the debate now. She says it is “astonishing” that civil servants could be receiving bonuses for deporting illegal immigrants. That’s “disgusting”, she says. The Times’ Sam Coates says Tory whips seem to be nervous about the vote tonight. Javid says safeguards are being put in place to ensure that ongoing enforcement measures against illegal immigrants do not impact on Windrush migrants. He is winding up now. He says he is not alone in feeling that what happened to the Windrush generation made him angry. Something like this must never happen again, he says. Javid says he will be bringing forward legislation for the fee exemptions, fee reductions and changes to the citizenship process for the Windrush migrants. He will also be consulting on the compensation scheme that has been promised. Javid says complying with Labour’s motion would take up too much government time. He describes it as a “massive and open-ended fishing expedition” which would require 100 officials to fulfil. The Conservative MP Simon Hoare intervenes. He says, since his appointment, Javid has been called “a coconut” and an “uncle Tom”. Javid says, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the hard left has been more prominent. They are associated with the rise of antisemitism. He challenges Corbyn, who is on the Labour front bench, to condemn the racist insults directed at him. Corbyn does not intervene. But Diane Abbott does. She says she knows what it is like to suffer racist abuse. She says she has condemned the abuse directed at Javid. Everyone on the Labour side condemns it, she says. Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, is speaking now. He says there are men and women who have been let down. As he told MPs on Monday, he will do whatever is necessary to put that right. Labour’s Catherine West intervenes. Is it true that bonuses are paid for the removal of illegal immigrants? Javid says bonuses are paid in the civil service. They are not a matter for ministers. Javid refuses to deny civil servants paid bonuses relating to the removal of illegal immigrants. Labour’s Stephen Doughty intervenes. He points out that Javid refused to deny that bonuses were paid. He asks West’s question again. Javid repeats the point about how ministers are not involved in bonuses. He says he has not looked at this. Back in the Commons, Abbott is still speaking. She says Theresa May has not resiled from the “hostile environment” policy. In 2012 she told the Daily Telegraph she wanted to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, Abbott says. She says Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, will find he is not in charge of Home Office policy. May still wants to decide it, she says. Abbottt says May’s policies created the problems for the Windrush generation. This issue will not go away. Labour will not stop until they get justice for the Windrush generation, she says. With Theresa May confronting her Brexit inner cabinet this afternoon, there was an intriguing little nugget in the post-PMQs briefing by her official spokesman. Brexiters have been briefing that they hope to use the meeting to force May to dump her preferred option of a “customs partnership”; while she and others including Philip Hammond are deeply sceptical about the alternative of “max fac”, or maximum facilitation. Asked about the PM’s remarks in the House that there were “a number of options” for post-Brexit customs arrangements under consideration, May’s spokesman said: Work has been ongoing on two options; that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along; the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed. Pressed about whether there were still two options on the table - or more - he repeatedly insisted there were, “a number of ways of taking this forward”. That will spark speculation that Downing Street is preparing to propose a third option, as a way through what has become an increasingly ugly public standoff. Abbott says there are still Windrush migrants who are afraid of coming forward. She turns to the compensation issue. People are anxious. They want assurances that the compensation scheme will be adequate, she says. Abbott says MPs want to have the figures for how many people have been deported. The Conservative MP James Cartlidge rises to make a point of order. Is is it order to table a motion asking the Queen to break the Data Protection Act, he asks. He says what the motion proposes in relation to text messages would contravene the new GDPR (general data protection regulation) rules. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, says that is not a point of order. Abbott says she has met Windrush migrants in detention centres. Abbott asks if Tory MPs will understand how voting against this motion will be seen in the Commonwealth, and by the Windrush generation. And will they understand how the Tory laughter comes across. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, rises on a point of order. There has been no laughing from the Conservative benches, she says. Abbott says people will have heard laughter. She says the Conservatives are not taking this seriously. Abbott says this story has been front page news across the Commonwealth, and not just in the Caribbean. What has been revealed about UK policy has been extremely damaging. That is one reason to clear up this mess, she says. Abbott says Labour does not support illegal immigration. She says Labour would prevent illegal immigrants coming into the country. But the government is not doing this because it has cut the number of border guards, she says. Abbott says she wants to address the role of the prime minister in this. A Conservative MP intervenes, and asks if Abbott is in favour of stopping illegal immigration. It is the second time a Tory has asked this. (Simon Hoare made a similar intervention a few minutes ago.) Some Labour MPs shout: “Wrong debate.” Abbott says nobody on the Labour benches supports illegal immigration. But it is distressing for Windrush generation migrants to hear the Conservatives keep dragging this back to illegal immigration. (The Conservatives are going for Abbott on this issue because she repeatedly refused to say what Labour would do about illegal immigrants in a TV interview earlier this week.) Abbott says May was to blame for the worst aspects of the “hostile environment” policy. She says May introduced a deport first, appeal later policy. She set deportation targets. And, given she set targets, May should have know that what Amber Rudd told the home affairs committee last week about the Home Office not having targets for removals was wrong, Abbott says. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is now opening the debate on the Labour Windrush motion. (See 10.51am.) She says the Windrush arrived in Britain on 22 June 1948. They were a patriotic generation who contributed a great deal to this country. This debate is about them, she says. Labour’s Chuka Umunna intervenes. He says many of the Windrush arrivals settled in Brixton, in his constituency. That was because there was a deep air raid shelter which housed them when they arrived. But it was also because that was near the job centre, he says. They wanted to work. The Hunt statement is over. Maria Miller, the Conservative MP and chair of the women and equalities committee, raises a point of order and asks about the new allegations about bullying by John Bercow. Miller says a member of the Commons staff has signed a non-disclosure agreement. Does John Bercow agree that Commons staff should not sign agreements like this? And will Bercow make a statement. Bercow says current and former staff are not constrained by any agreements from speaking to the inquiry into the bullying of Commons staff. He says the clerk of the Commons has sent Miller a note about these agreements, known as compromise agreements. He says he is not involved in decisions about getting staff to sign these agreements. On the subject of the allegations against him, Bercow says he has nothing to add to the statement he has already put out. Julian Lewis, a Conservative MP and a friend of Bercow’s, also rises. He asks Bercow to confirm that most of Bercow’s staff have been happy working for him. Bercow confirms that. Theresa May believes that the latest bullying allegations against Commons Speaker John Bercow should be “properly investigated”, Downing Street has said. Asked about the latest allegations of bullying by Bercow, which he denies, the prime minister’s spokesman said: The prime minister has been very clear from the start that there is no place for bullying or harassment of any kind in the workplace, including parliament. It is a matter for parliament to decide how to proceed, but the latest allegations are concerning and should be properly investigated. It’s important to note that the speaker denies the claims which have been made against him. Here is the apology Hunt delivered in his opening statement. He said: Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is that for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough. Many families will be deeply disturbed by these revelations, not least because there will be some people who receive a letter having had a recent diagnosis of breast cancer. We must also recognise that there may be some who receive a letter having had a recent terminal diagnosis. For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence. So on behalf of the government, Public Health England and the NHS, I apologise wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the suffering caused. Hunt says all GPs will be briefed on what the appropriate response to this failure should be. Hunt says his understanding is that, for every 1,000 women in their 70s, 12 have a breast cancer and three of those are life threatening. In his response to Hunt, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the “thoughts of the whole House will be with those whose screening was missed and who sadly lost their lives from breast cancer or who have subsequently developed cancer”. Ashworth welcomed Hunt’s “candour” in questioning why the problem was not picked up. He went on: Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected. Did the department receive any warnings in that time, is there any record of how many women raised concerns that they had not received appropriate screening, were there any opportunities to change this mistake which were missed? Hunt said: The existence of a potential issue was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Care by Public Health England in January, although at that stage their advice was that the risk to patients was limited. An urgent clinical evaluation took place and the matter was “escalated to ministers” in March this year by PHE “with clear clinical advice that the matter should not be made public”. That was so a plan could be put in place first to ensure “any remedies did not overwhelm the existing screening programme”. This is from Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s health secretary. Labour’s Diana Johnson asks why letters are not going out today to all 309,000 women affected. Hunt says the letters are being sent out as quickly as possible. They cannot all be sent out today, he says. He accepts people will have to wait a few weeks to find out if they are getting a letter, and he says he appreciates that this will cause a lot of concern to those involved. Commenting on Hunt’s announcement, Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK’s director of policy and public affairs, said: It’s very concerning to learn that so many women have not received an invitation to screening over a prolonged period of time. We know this may leave many women with questions about breast screening. If you suspect you have been directly affected by this or if you are over 50 and haven’t had a mammogram in the last three years and would like one, the NHS Choices website provides further information and the option to contact your local unit to book an appointment. It’s worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast, see your GP straight away. Labour’s Lisa Nandy says this announcement is “utterly heart-breaking”. Unless further resources are put into the system, other people will go to the back of the queue. For too many women where they live determines whether they live or die, she says. Hunt says he recognises what Nandy is saying. He says additional resources will have to be found to ensure people are not disadvantaged. Hunt says anyone is free to call the helpline number. It will be published today. Letters should be sent out to women affected over the next four weeks. Women who do not get letters should be pretty confident they have not been affected, he says. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative and a doctor, asks what women who are worried about this news should do. Hunt says all women who should be scanned, or who might want to get a scan, will be offered on. He says this will happen before October. But in most cases people should get scans much earlier, he says. Here is an extract from Jeremy Hunt’s statement to MPs. Earlier this year PHE [Public Health England] analysis of trial data from the service found that there was a computer algorithm failure dating back to 2009. The latest estimates I have received from PHE is that as a result of this, between 2009 and the start of 2018, an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening. At this stage it is not clear whether any delay in diagnosis resulted in any avoidable harm or death and that is one of the reasons I am ordering an independent review to establish the clinical impact. Our current best estimate which comes with caveats as it’s based on statistical modelling rather than patient reviews, and because there is currently no clinical consensus about the benefits of screening for this age group, is that there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result. I am advised that it is unlikely to be more than this range and may be considerably less. However, tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if the failure had not happened. Labour Paul Williams, a GP, asks if the update of screening of 68 to 71-year-olds during this period was less than expected. And, if so, why was that not investigated? Hunt says he will look into this. He does not know if there was a lower uptake. Normally the screening uptake rate is 80%, he says. Philippa Whitford, the SN’s health spokeswoman and a breast surgeon, says she is concerned about Hunt’s suggestion that, with older women, early diagnosis does not matter so much. She says early diagnosis is always important. She asks what efforts have been made to track down women affected. Hunt says he does not think he did say that you do not need to diagnose early. What he was saying was that, in many cases, early diagnosis will not make a difference. But diagnosis is always important, he says. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, says the woman affected need consistent, evidence-based guidance as to what they should do next. Hunt says the government has to be clear with patients that there is no medical consensus about the efficacy of screening for patients in the 70s. But anyone who wants a scan will get a scan, he says. Hunt says there is no consensus about the efficacy of breast cancer screening for older women. That is because older women are more likely to develop cancers, but those cancers are less likely to be life threatening, he says. Hunt says he wasnts to inform MPs of “a serious failure that has come to light” in the breast cancer screening programme. Some 2m women get screened every year, he says. Earlier this year it was found that a computer algorithm problem meant that between 2009 and the start of 2018 some 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final screening. Some 450,000 women missed a breast cancer screening, Hunt says. He says at this stage it is unclear whether any delay in diagnosis will have resulted in any avoidable or delay or death. He says the best estimate, based on modelling, is that there will be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result of this. There are unlikely to be more fatalities than that, and the number could be less, he says. There are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this failure had not happened. Up to 270 women may have died because they missed a screening, Hunt says. He says ministers were told about this in March. Public Health England advised that the public should not be told then, to allow time for remedial measures to be put in He says 309,000 of the 450,000 women who missed out are still alive. People will get clinical advise as to whether more screening is helpful. In some cases screening will be counter-productive. But he says patients will get a choice. Hunt says this covers England. Patients in Scotland and Wales are not thought to be affected. He says the government will contact thte next of kin of those who missed a scan and died of breast cancer. The government will try to establish if the missed scan was a factor. He says if it was, compensation will be paid. Compensation to be paid to families of women who died from cancer after missing a screening, Hunt says. He accepts these findings will be very disturbing for people. Some people will get a letter saying they missed out knowing they now have a terminal illness. He says he apologise wholeheartedly to those people for the suffering caused. He says there will be an independent review of the breast screening programme. Hunt announces independent inquiry into breast screening programme. He says he wants to be transparent about what went wrong. Jeremy Hunt is now making his statement about breast cancer screening. (See 11.56am.) Labour’s Gloria de Piero says an 83-year-old woman who had a fall at home in her constituency had to wait three hours for an ambulance. Will May apologise to her? May says she is sorry to hear about that. She will look into it. Nicky Morgan, a Conservative, says the Treasury committee, which she chairs, will take evidence from TSB later about its IT failure. Does May agree that robust IT is vital for banking? May says banks should have robust and stable IT systems. Marcus Jones, a Conservative, says council tax rates doubled under Labour. Doesn’t this show the government was right to cap council tax increases? May agrees. She says Conservative councils have been freezing or cutting council tax. Conservative councils on average cost families £100 less in council tax, she says. The SNP’s Chris Stephens asks about the pay rise for civil servants. Doesn’t it amount to a real-terms pay cut? May says the 1% cap on public sector pay rises has been abandoned. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks about the 464 survivors of thalidomide. Will May ask the Foreign Office to intervene with Germany, which has gone back on a compensation promise. (The drug was developed in Germany.) May says the Foreign Office is pursuing this. Labour’s Paula Sherriff asks why the government has not appointed an equalities champion to ensure BAME people get access to better mental health provision. May says it was precisely to address issues like this that she launched the racial disparities audit. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says the European scrutiny committee that he chairs has repeatedly asked her chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, to appear. But he won’t. Will May ensure that he does give evidence? May says she will look into this. Labour’s Karen Buck asks why the government is still considering two EU customs options that are seen as unworkable. May says if Buck is so interested in this, she should asks the Labour front bench to decide its own policy on it. Labour’s Jo Stevens asks May if she agrees with Sajid Javid about the “hostile environment” not representing British values. May says she agrees with what Javid said about the importance of differentiating between legal immigration and illegal immigration. She says he was referring to a phrase. But it was a phrase first used by Labour. Amber Rudd, who resigned as home secretary on Sunday night, starts by congratulating Sajid Javid on his appointment. She says the UK threat level remains at severe. Last year five terrorist attacks got through. Will May share with her her admiration for the work of the security services? May says she is pleased to be able to pay tribute to Rudd for the work she did as home secretary. She says Rudd’s work with internet companies was ground breaking. And she says she agrees with what Rudd said about the work of the intelligence agencies and emergency services. (That exchange is a fairly clear sign that Rudd will not be joining the pro-European Tory rebels.) PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn’t really a PMQs at all; we just had two PPBs (party political broadcasts) blaring away in tandem, doing little to enlighten anyone. Corbyn’s PPB was better on passion, and it covered wider ground - in fact, there was little area of public policy where he failed to castigate the government - but May probably did better on specific, memorable detail (her Hazelbourne Road anecdote). The local elections take place tomorrow, and so perhaps this wasn’t surprising. Corbyn did start with a neat, sassy question about Windrush. But May’s announcement about an inquiry into what went wrong disarmed him, and also helped to explain why the Tory whips feel comfortable about ordering their MPs to vote against the Labour motion calling for all confidential government paperwork on Windrush to be disclosed later this afternoon. The government clearly feels that this will be enough to contain demands for the full disclosure of documents, although the inquiry she announced sounded very minimalist. She described it as a “full review of lessons learned” rather than a proper inquiry, and it does not sound as if it will be especially independent. (She talked about “independent oversight and external challenge”, which is not quite the same as having an independent person in charge.) It will also concluded before the end of July, which means it may be one of the shortest inquiries on record. Corbyn says the education secretary has been corrected by the UK Statistics Authority. It says budgets are being cut. Yet May is in denial. And police budgets are an issue too. Home Office civil servants says there is a link between budget cuts and increased crime. May says she has protected police budgets. That is not what Andy Burnham proposed when he was shadow home secretary. She says the shadow home affairs minister has said there is no relationship between police numbers and crime figures. Corbyn says the shadow police minister was pointing to a cut in police budgets. Some 21,000 police officers have lost their jobs since 2010. Violent crime is rising. Deaths from knife crime are going up, especially in London. The government is making a complete shambles of Brexit, damaging the NHS, damaging schools, and yet they claim to be strong and stable. With council tax rising by more than 5% all over the country, isn’t the truth that with the Tories you pay more and get less. May says there is more funding going into the NHS, schools and social care. If Corbyn wants to talk about council tax, he should go to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side houses in Labour Lambeth people pay very high council tax. On the other side, in Conservative Wandworth, people pay much less. That shows people pay less under the Conservatives. Corbyn offers facts about the inquiry. There are more people in debt, more people using food banks, more people in debt and more people in poverty. The NHS is suffering the longest funding squeeze in history. Will May apologise for this? May says there are more people in work, and fewer people in absolute poverty. She says the chancellor has announced £10bn extra for the NHS. She is conducting a review to find a long-term plan. That is the sensible approach to take. It is about funding and reform. Corbyn says March was the worst month on record for A&amp;E. It was also the worst month for cancelled operation. There are thousands of vacancies for NHS staff. But May intervened personally to stop the NHS hiring from abroad. He says the education secretary used to say there would be no cut in schools funding. Last week he refused to repeat that pledge. Will May admit schools budgets are being cut? May says there is more money for schools. It is not just a question of how much money you put in. She says 1.9m children are in outstanding schools under this government. Jeremy Corbyn also pays tribute to Michael Martin. They first met when they were both organisers for the NUPE union in the 1970s. Did the PM feel the slightest pang of guilt when Amber Rudd was forced to resign due to the actions of her predecessor? May says she will start by updating MPs on Windrush issues. Sajid Javid will address MPs on this later today. He will announce a package of measures to bring transparency on this issue. She says speed of of the essence. She says there will be a review of lessons learnt. It will report before the summer and will have full access to all papers. May announces review into what went wrong with Windrush scandal, to report before summer. May says the government needs to build more homes. The housing infrastructure fund helps. Theresa May starts by offering condolences to the family and friends of Michael Martin, the former speaker who has died. She pays tribute to his courtesy in particular. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP, asks about upskirting. It is not a specific offence. She has worked on a bill to make it a specific crime. Will May back changing the law on this. May says she agrees. She shares the outrage at this intrusive behaviour. The government wants to ensure victims’ complaints are taken seriously. The justice secretary will consider Hobhouse’s proposed law change. PMQs is about to start. This is from Chris Smyth, health editor at the Times. This is from the Telegraph’s Kate McCann. Jeremy Hunt is making a statement to MPs after PMQs. This is from the BBC’s diplomatic editor, James Landale. And here is a reply from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. The 30-page memo circulated by the European Research Group criticising the customs partnership proposal (see 9.33am) lists nine objects to the proposal. Here they are: 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates. 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates, because firms would be under a range of requirements to prove they are entitled to receive the relevant tariff rebates. 2 - Exporters to the UK would need their customers in the UK to pay EU tariffs, then try to claim them back by proving that the goods had gone to a UK end-consumer. 3 - Our trade partners would be deterred from agreeing mutual tariff reductions by their having to pay EU tariff rates up front. 4 - The UK would have less negotiating leverage over a potential trade partner’s trade barriers and behind the border regulatory barriers. 5 - EU quotas make the problem yet more complex. 6 - Only large corporates would be able to carry the significant administrative burdens of this system. 7 - Crucially, this option also frustrates UK regulatory independence. 8 - If the above factors mean that uptake of the rebate scheme is low, this would mean that the tariffs levied in practice on goods entering the UK market could be higher than the UK’s bound rate, which would be a violation of the GATT. 9 - The UK would continue to be a substantial tax collector for the EU, continuing to make a substantial net contribution to the EU budget. And here is an extract from the conclusion. The NCP proposed is undeliverable in operational terms and would require a degree of regulatory alignment that would make the execution of an independent trade policy a practical impossibility. This covers not only our external trade agenda but our own control over UK regulation and whether we can improve it. Economists have recently described a “new normal” of limited global growth, potentially secular global stagnation. This can be avoided by a group of countries committing to reduce the distortions found in anticompetitive regulation. For example, a 20% reduction in distortions in the TPP 11, plus the UK and US, over 15 years could yield approximately an added 0.5% into global GDP year-on-year (c.$2 trillion over the period), according to some estimates. Set against this, customs clearance costs are small. (It should be noted that the estimates of the impact of behind the border barrier reduction are conservative, ignoring distortion reductions elsewhere, for example in China, that this approach may yield, nor do they assume any interaction effects.) Any form of the customs arrangements above would mean continuing curtailment of UK capacity for independent trade and self-government, plus ECJ jurisdiction, applying harmonised rules and regulations across the domestic UK economy; they also mean external tariffs and abiding by future changes, but without a vote. Turning back to the customs partnership, these are from the BBC’s Norman Smith. The “hybrid model” is the customs partnership, the proposal that Tory Brexiters are opposing. See 9.54am. “Max fac” is the other one. Dominic Raab is the Brexiter housing minister. UPDATE: Here is the Raab quote. He was speaking to Radio 5 Live. I always keep an open mind on this, because I do think when it comes to Brexit, we’re going to be forging a distinct path for the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect, actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union, but also avoid the hard border, as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment, the way I read it, is that those in favour of ‘max fac’ are winning the argument. But I don’t want to prejudice the debate cabinet should have and must have in order to hammer this out. If you look at the roll-on, roll-off ports, the pre-arrival notification of goods and customs declarations, if you look at the option of having authorised economic operators, and all of the stuff that has already been tried and tested on the US/Canada border, or on the Australia/New Zealand border, I think it [maximum facilitation] is actually the one that’s been tried and tested the most. Labour has accused the government of a cover up and of shedding “crocodile tears” over Windrush in the light of its decision to whip its MPs to vote against the opposition day motion. A Labour spokesperson said: If the architect of this cruel farce, the prime minister, is ordering her MPs to vote to keep her role in this mess hidden from the public, it exposes the Tories’ crocodile tears on the Windrush scandal as a sham. We need answers, not further cover ups to save Theresa May from facing up to her involvement in the removal of rights, detentions and possible deportations of British citizens. After letting Rudd take the fall for her decisions, how can the public have any trust in the prime minister? We are likely to hear much more of this at PMQs in an hour’s time. Conservative MPs are being whipped to vote against the Labour opposition day motion saying the government should publish papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now, we’ve been told. That means there will be a vote at 7pm. Until now the government has tended not to vote against opposition day motions. Generally they are not binding on the government, and ministers found it easier to ignore motions they did not like than to run the risk of staging a vote and losing. That led to the Labour party using their opposition days to table “humble address” motions demanding the release of particular government papers to select committees. These motions, which used to be used very rarely, are binding on the government. Last year there were motions ordering the release of the government’s Brexit impact assessments and of universal credit project assessments. Both were passed without opposition because the government did not order its MPs to vote against. Today the whips are taking a different approach and are instructing their MPs to vote against the Labour motion. Why? Presumably because they are reasonably confident of winning. The Labour motion is very wide-ranging, because it requires all internal government documents, including emails and text messages, relating to Windrush-related policy decisions to be handed over to the Commons home affairs committee (which would then be free to publish the material). Many MPs might argue that that is unreasonable, because even under the Freedom of Information Act there is an acceptance that government decision making is protected by some degree of confidentiality. But the key point is that the motion seems to have been drafted with the express intent of uncovering material likely to embarrass Theresa May and establish her culpability in the Windrush affair. Many Tory MPs are embarrassed about Windrush, but at some point tribal loyalty kicks in and they would have to feel very strongly about this to vote for something so nakedly hostile to their party leader. So the Tories may well win. But it won’t look good, because it will look like a cover-up. For reference, here is the wording of the motion in full. That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be provided to the home affairs committee: all papers, correspondence and advice including emails and text messages, from 11 May 2010 up to and including 1 May 2018, to and between ministers, senior officials and special advisers relating to policy decisions including on the Immigration Acts 2014 and 2016 with regard the Windrush generation cases, including deportations, detentions and refusal of re-entry, the setting of deportation and removal targets and their effect on the Windrush generation, and action taken within government following the concerns raised by Caribbean governments with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office including the original decision by the prime minister not to meet Caribbean heads of government and officials, and all copies of minutes and papers relating to the cabinet’s immigration implementation taskforce. In his interview on the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, confirmed what the Guardian reported overnight - that today’s meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee is not expected to take a decision today as to whether the “customs partnership” or the alternative “highly streamlined customs arrangement” (which is now being referred to as “maximum facilitation”, or “max fac”, in Whitehall). He said the committee’s discussions would “start this afternoon and will probably continue in other meetings”. He went on: This will be the first time today for cabinet colleagues to sit down and have a constructive discussion about the way forward. I expect we will come to a decision on this, as well as on other important elements of our negotiating position, over the next few weeks. For reference, this is what the government’s future partnership paper (pdf) on customs published last summer said about the two options. The government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt to meet these objectives. These approaches represent different choices about the nature of our relationship with the EU and countries around the world, but in either option the UK would seek to pursue its independent trade policy objectives. A highly streamlined customs arrangement between the UK and the EU, streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible. This would aim to: continue some of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU; put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. This approach involves utilising the UK’s existing tried and trusted third country processes for UK-EU trade, building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible. A new customs partnership with the EU, aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU’s requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU. This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU. Theresa May has opened talks with Brussels on the UK’s future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But any negotiation with Michel Barnier can’t really match, in terms of the strength of passion engaged, or the risk it poses to her own premiership, the negotiation she is having to conduct simultaneously with her own backbenchers. And today that negotiation has hit a crisis point. The European Research Group (ERG), which is led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and represents around 50 Tory backbenchers committed to a harder form of Brexit, has sent her a long report arguing that the “customs partnership” proposals - one of the government’s two post-Brexit customs options for when the UK leaves the EU, and one that May is reluctant to drop - is unacceptable. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail are both leading with the story. One of the peculiarities of this is that, when the government first floated the customs partnership idea in a policy paper last summer (pdf), the Brexiters did not complain about it at all. But now, in leave circles, it is being vilified as being almost equivalent to remaining in the EU. Here is an extract from the Telegraph splash (paywall). One ERG source said: “We have swallowed everything so far – but this is it. If they don’t have confidence in Brexit we don’t have confidence in them. The prime minister will not have a majority if she does not kill off the NCP [New Customs Partnership].” Mr Rees-Mogg added: “The customs partnership is incompatible with the Conservative party manifesto.” A copy of the report, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, dismantles the argument for a customs partnership which Brexiteers fear will keep Britain effectively in a customs union with the European Union after the UK leaves in March next year. Rees-Mogg got the 8.10am slot on the Today programme to discuss this further (a sign of the influence he exerts on the government - David Lidington, who is supposedly May’s effective deputy prime minister, was relegated to the less prestigious 8.40 slot). And Rees-Mogg insisted that the the ERG were not threatening to bring down the prime minister over this. There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market. At this point he sounded not entirely unlike someone running a protection racket. “Very nice majority you’ve got here, prime minister. Great shame if anything were to happen to it.” Later he claimed that the ERG was actually doing May a favour. When it was put to him that his stance was damaging her negotiating position, he replied: I don’t think it does, actually, because there is no point in negotiating with something that the other side think is magical thinking. The sooner the government gets away from this customs partnership, the easier it will be to get onto a negotiating that might actually happen. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons education committee as chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. 11.50am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, gives a speech to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation industrial strategy conference. 10.45am: The Metropolitan Police and the National Crime Agency give evidence to the Lords EU home affairs sub committee on the proposed UK-EU security treaty. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion intended to force the government to publish all papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now. After 3.30pm: Peers resume their debate on the EU withdrawal bill. They are expected to vote on an amendment tabled by the Conservative peer Chris Patten that would stop the government agreeing a Brexit deal that created a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

But the French president was at pains to stress that France’s continued emphasis on its Pacific presence was not one antagonistic to China, saying he welcomed Beijing’s economic and geopolitical rise. Macron – the leader of one of the last European powers with territory in the Pacific – said his country was and wanted to remain a “Pacific power”. He will travel from Australia to New Caledonia to campaign for the territory to remain a French collectivity when it goes to an independence referendum later this year. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Macron said he wanted to create a “strong Indo-Pacific axis to build on our economic interests as well as our security interests”. “I would very much like France, given it is the last European member of the EU being present in the Pacific after the Brexit … to be at the heart of this project,” he said at a fraternal press conference with Malcolm Turnbull. “This region is crucial for the stability of the world.” The Australian prime minister described France as a “Pacific Ocean power”, one well-placed to work with Australia in pursuit of shared goals. “We share the vision of a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific and will work closely to realise it, whether it is closer cooperation on maritime activities, support for our friends in the Pacific through humanitarian and disaster relief, or support for infrastructure in the region,” Turnbull said. France and Australia signed several agreements on Wednesday, pledging to work together on combating cyberterrorism, on defence cooperation, on quantum computing, and on climate change adaptation and resilience. Already, the French company DCNS has been awarded the $50bn contract to build 12 state-of-the-art non-nuclear submarines for Australia. The growing influence of China across the Asia-Pacific – in particular its military manifestations of bases built on atolls in the South China Sea – is a growing concern for western powers. People’s Liberation Army Navy ships challenged three Australian warships sailing through the sea last month, in a significant escalation of Chinese assertiveness in the region. There have also been credible reports – though denied by both sides – of Chinese intentions to build a naval port in Vanuatu. But both Macron and Turnbull said their cooperation in the Pacific was not one made in reaction or opposition to China’s growing influence. “There is nothing against vis-a-vis China, and in reaction to the Chinese rise,” Macron said, speaking largely in English. “I think the Chinese rise is very good news for everybody because it’s good for China itself.” But both leaders stressed the need for all countries in the region to adhere to the “rules-based order” which had underpinned the dramatic economic growth countries such as China had enjoyed. “That economic rise, that growth, has been enabled and made possible by a rules-based order in our region,” Turnbull said. “The peace and relevant harmony in our region has been enabled by the adherence to the rule of law.” Riffing on a Chinese proverb often quoted by the former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Turnbull said the Indo-Pacific order must not be reduced to one where “the big fish eat the small fish and the small fish eat the shrimp”. The centrality of New Caledonia to Macron’s antipodean visit was further emphasised. “I am a big fan of shrimp,” Macron said. “Especially New Caledonian shrimp.” Earlier, he challenged Australia to do more to tackle climate change. During a speech at the Sydney Opera House Tuesday night, he called on Turnbull to show the “power of conviction” and display courage in confronting climate change, despite the ideological barriers he faces in his party room. “I am fully aware of the political and economic debate surrounding this issue in your country, and I respect this,” Macron said. “But I think that actual leaders are those that can respect those existing interests, but at the same time decide to participate to something broader, to something more strategic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/02/emmanuel-macron-unsure-if-donald-trump-will-stick-to-iran-deal-as-deadline-looms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T06:35:20Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron unsure if Donald Trump will stick to Iran deal as deadline looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/emmanuel-macron-unsure-if-donald-trump-will-stick-to-iran-deal-as-deadline-looms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/02/emmanuel-macron-unsure-if-donald-trump-will-stick-to-iran-deal-as-deadline-looms","fields":{"headline":"Emmanuel Macron unsure if Donald Trump will stick to Iran deal as deadline looms","bodyText":"France’s President Emmanuel Macron – the man trying to hold the Iran nuclear deal together in the face of US unpredictability and Israeli hostility – has said he does not know which way Donald Trump will jump on 12 May, when the next deadline for continuing the deal looms. Speaking in Australia, Macron said the current deal was “not sufficient” to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions but that it was the only deal on the table. “The [Iran nuclear deal] was a very important negotiation and is the best way to monitor the current nuclear activity of the … Iranian regime,” he said at a press conference in Sydney. “We negotiated it. We signed it. It’s good to respect it and that for me is a good beginning.” Having just left Washington and talks with the US president – where he described US policy inconsistencies as “insane” – Macron said he did not know which way Trump would go on the deal. “I don’t know what the US president will decide 12th May.” The Iran nuclear deal, formally the joint comprehensive plan of action, was signed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany and the EU, in 2015, and limits the development of Iran’s nuclear program. In exchange for reducing its capabilities and its stockpiles of uranium, Iran receives relief from international sanctions. Trump has threatened to stop issuing presidential waivers on the nuclear-related sanctions when the next tranche is due on 12 May, a move that would abrogate the agreement, even if it fell short of a formal withdrawal. Macron said the deal should be honoured but that, regardless of the US position, the world needed to prepare to renegotiate with Tehran over a more comprehensive, long-term nuclear agreement. “Whatever the decision will be, we will have to prepare such a broader negotiation ... because I think nobody wants a war in the region, and nobody wants an escalation in terms of tension in the region,” he said. Macron has been working furiously across the globe and timezones to keep the deal’s parties onside, speaking with British prime minister, Theresa May, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and presidents Trump, Hassan Rouhani and Vladimir Putin in an effort to hold it together. Macron said three new “pillars” were needed to any future renegotiated Iran deal: agreement over nuclear activity post-2025; better controls and monitoring of ballistic activity; and containment of Iranian influence across the region, in particular in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. “We will work actively in order to convince everybody to have – in the coming days, weeks and months – such negotiations, which is the only way to progress and stabilise the region.” On Tuesday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused Iran of continuing to hide and expand its nuclear weapons capabilities. He presented what he alleged was “new and conclusive proof” of violations, and said Iran had lied about its capabilities at the time of the agreement’s signing. But key documents relied on by Netanyahu had previously been seen by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, as early as 2005, and were made public by the agency in 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/02/duttons-facial-recognition-scheme-could-target-jaywalkers-lawyer-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T09:34:18Z","webTitle":"Dutton's facial recognition scheme could target jaywalkers, lawyer warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/duttons-facial-recognition-scheme-could-target-jaywalkers-lawyer-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/duttons-facial-recognition-scheme-could-target-jaywalkers-lawyer-warns","fields":{"headline":"Dutton's facial recognition scheme could target jaywalkers, lawyer warns","bodyText":"People who litter or jaywalk could be caught using facial recognition technology if the broad powers proposed by Peter Dutton’s home affairs department are not limited, the Law Council has warned. At a parliamentary inquiry hearing on Thursday the Law Council president, Morry Bailes, will warn that facial recognition could lead to a full “social credit” system of government surveillance and called for safeguards to prevent “illegitimate and disproportionate uses” of the technology. The warning comes after the Victorian government threatened to pull out of the proposed facial recognition system because the identity-matching services bill expands Dutton’s powers beyond what was agreed by state governments and allows access to information by the private sector and local governments. In October the Council of Australia Governments agreed to give federal and state police real-time access to passport, visa, citizenship and driver’s licence images for a wide range of criminal investigations through a system to be run by the home affairs department. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In his opening statement to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, seen by Guardian Australia, Bailes will warn that giving government agencies the ability to identify a face in a crowd could result in CCTV footage being used to prosecute “low-level unlawful conduct”. “Clearly, provision of such capability has been determined by government to be desirable to facilitate detection of would-be terrorists scoping a site for a potential terrorist attack,” he says. “But that very same identity-matching capability might also be used for a range of activities that Australian citizens regard as unacceptable.” The Law Council wants the bill to clearly limit the legitimate and proportionate uses of the face-matching database, for the line to be “consistently applied” and added accountability measures to check proper usage is “independently verifiable”. “If that line can creep towards broad social surveillance such as ... [the] use of the system to detect and fine jaywalkers or litterers, that line can also creep further to a full social credit style system of government surveillance of Australian citizens,” he says. Bailes says the government has overstated the extent to which it is necessary and reasonable to limit the right to privacy in order to achieve more efficient data-sharing practices. He argues that relying on the idea citizens have consented to identity-matching is problematic because government services “are required to participate fully in communities and [are] therefore essential in practice”. The Law Council stated that reasonable and proportionate uses of the technology would include law enforcement to protect Australia’s national security, community safety and road safety. The home affairs department submitted that the bill would allow it to help prevent identity crime, which affects 5% of Australians and is estimated to cost $2.2bn a year. “Identity crime is also a key enabler of serious and organised crime, including terrorism,” the submission said. But in addition to invoking the most serious offences, the department also acknowledged that the systems would be used for “the provision of more secure and accessible government and private-sector services” and “improving road safety through the detection and prosecution of traffic offences”. In its submission the Victorian government warned citizens may not be adequately informed that information they provide to get a driver’s licence, including biometric data, could be “reused for other law enforcement purposes”. The Victorian submission said the states had agreed that the private sector would not be given access to the facial verification and identity data-sharing services. But the bill did not “contain such a restriction, allowing non-government entities to use all identity-matching services” if they met certain conditions, it said. The Victorian government submission also complained that providing identity-matching services to local government authorities “goes beyond what was agreed to”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/02/australia-rejects-fears-trump-steel-tariff-exemption-subject-to-quotas","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T03:32:11Z","webTitle":"Australia rejects fears Trump steel tariff exemption subject to quotas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/australia-rejects-fears-trump-steel-tariff-exemption-subject-to-quotas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/australia-rejects-fears-trump-steel-tariff-exemption-subject-to-quotas","fields":{"headline":"Australia rejects fears Trump steel tariff exemption subject to quotas","bodyText":"Australia’s exemptions from US steel and aluminium tariffs are both permanent and unconditional, the government has said as it denied reports that the deal is subject to quotas. The White House confirmed this week it had reached an in-principle agreement to exempt Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the 25% levy on the imports. But the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that unnamed senior Trump administration officials said while the details have not been finalised, Australia, Argentina and Brazil have agreed to quotas. “In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent trans-shipment and protect the national security,” the White House was quoted as saying A Turnbull government official denied the report and told Guardian Australia there would be no quotas on the tariff exemptions. The government’s understanding was still that expressed by the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, in April that Australia had secured an unconditional and permanent exemption. Quotas are designed to prevent countries that have negotiated exemptions importing steel from China then on-selling it to the US. In two presidential proclamations on Monday, Donald Trump said the appropriate way to deal with Australia, Argentina and Brazil was “to extend the temporary exemption” from the proclaimed tariffs “in order to finalise the details” of the in-principle deals. Trump’s proclamations said those discussions would be “most productive” if the three countries remained exempt from the tariffs and because of the in-principle agreement “it is unnecessary to set an expiration date for the exemptions”. “Nevertheless, if the satisfactory alternative means are not finalised shortly, I will consider reimposing the tariff,” the proclamations said. On Tuesday Malcolm Turnbull issued a statement welcoming “confirmation from the president of the United States that Australia will be exempt from its steel and aluminium tariffs”. The US accounts for about 0.8% of Australia’s steel exports and about 1.5% of aluminium exports. Australian steel exports to the US are worth roughly $US210m a year while aluminium exports are worth about $US213m a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/04/how-the-a-league-grand-final-shapes-up-tactically-in-the-absence-of-arnieball","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T02:00:10Z","webTitle":"How the A-League grand final shapes up tactically in the absence of Arnieball | Ante Jukic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/04/how-the-a-league-grand-final-shapes-up-tactically-in-the-absence-of-arnieball","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/04/how-the-a-league-grand-final-shapes-up-tactically-in-the-absence-of-arnieball","fields":{"headline":"How the A-League grand final shapes up tactically in the absence of Arnieball","bodyText":"Despite the increased sense of tactical ambiguity that Sydney FC’s absence provides, it still seems fitting Newcastle and Melbourne Victory will face off in Saturday night’s climax to this A-League season. More than others in recent memory, this term has been characterised by a reliance on counter-attacking, rooted in overall rigidity in possession against embedded defences – to the point where the team that sit off in these finals are arguably the more threatening. If the first weekend of this post-season was reflective of how the campaign was played as a whole – with lesser teams like Brisbane and Adelaide still in with a chance to win their games due to static possessional play from the opposition – the second weekend only amplified it. Both winners in last weekend’s semi-finals had less than 45% of the ball in their respective matches – Newcastle with 44.1% on Friday, while Victory triumphed with only 39.5% a day later. The reactive has overwhelmingly been more effective than the active this year, and where Sydney faltered despite individual talent was in the fact they were prompted to penetrate inside Victory’s half, the very aspect where they have showed fallibility on both the domestic and continental stage. If Sydney had snatched a win over Victory, Saturday’s grand final would have had a more knowable complexion, for Newcastle would have likely implemented the same tactics as Victory. With two inherently reactive teams coming up against each other, it’s a more indistinct but nevertheless critical aspect. The disparity in performances between Victory’s games against Adelaide and Sydney to get to this point was stark, despite Terry Antonis’s match-winning individual role last Saturday and improvement in collective play. Since he replaced Mark Milligan in Victory’s midfield, Antonis has made more key passes than Carl Valeri in almost half the total minutes. His per90 rate of 1.2 key passes is closer to James Troisi’s rate of 1.5 than Valeri’s comparably meagre 0.5. The perfectly weighted pass to get Victory into a shooting position for Kosta Barbarouses’s goal on Saturday was a glimpse of how he can unlock a defence – and, in turn, a match. However, Antonis’s instinctive movement off the ball has been increasingly tempered by Muscat, and Victory’s win in Sydney reflected a shift to a more natural tactical state for them. Their three goals against Newcastle in the regular season all came in transitional scenarios, hitting the back of the net each time within three passes of regaining possession. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day It’s fair to say, like most games of football, it will be won and lost in midfield. In Steven Ugarković, Newcastle have had the best central midfielder in the A-League this season, and by some margin. While his assist for Joey Champness in Brisbane was the best example of what he can do for the Jets in attack – making three separate movements before finally receiving, turning to face forward and thread the ball through the Roar defence – his assist for Jason Hoffman against Victory in December is important in context of the upcoming grand final. Despite Andrew Nabbout’s sale, Newcastle still have collective pace in attack through the likes of Roy O’Donovan, Riley McGree and Dimitri Petratos. With this in mind, Ugarković’s ability to harness that by receiving the ball in positions where he can advance the team’s field position still provides a threat, and it will be something Victory must be mindful of if they are to control the game. Newcastle are most dangerous in space, though. Combination slows down significantly otherwise, and it’s something even more pronounced with Ugarković playing as the deepest midfielder in Ben Kantarovski’s absence. Consequently last Friday, it restricted the opportunities with which Ugarković could freely move between the lines and take greater positional risk in the Jets’ phases of possession, as opposed to playing as the second midfielder. Ultimately, and similarly to Victory, Newcastle’s goals against Melbourne City came quickly upon retrieving the ball and pressing the opponent in their own half. There will be drama in Saturday’s grand final – the A-League has been good at delivering that on a regular basis and last weekend illustrated the point quite clearly. However, in a somewhat indicting sense, the winner could simply be decided by which team allows the other to have the ball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/02/football-transfer-rumours-benjamin-henrichs-to-chelsea-for-31m","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T08:20:40Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Benjamin Henrichs to Chelsea for £31m?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/02/football-transfer-rumours-benjamin-henrichs-to-chelsea-for-31m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/02/football-transfer-rumours-benjamin-henrichs-to-chelsea-for-31m","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Benjamin Henrichs to Chelsea for £31m?","bodyText":"Chelsea have applied the seductive smokey eye and are are hitching their skirts in the direction of Bayer Leverkusen right-back Benjamin Henrichs, according to this morning’s loud burp of transfer tittle-tattle. One of several youngsters selected by Joachim Löw for the experimental German side that won the Confederations Cup last summer, the 21-year-old can play in a wide range of positions and has already attracted interest from both Manchester clubs. However, it is Chelsea who are reported to be preparing a £31m bid which would trigger the release clause in his contract with the Bundesliga side. Despite uncertainty over Antonio Conte’s future, Chelsea are also believed to be interested in taking Anthony Martial from Manchester United, but may have to go toe to toe with Juventus, Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur in the scramble to secure the French forward’s services. If, as seems likely, Chelsea fail to qualify for the Champions League, they’ll be forced into a clear-out in order to satisfy financial fair play rules. David Luiz is wanted by Napoli, while Manchester United are keen on Willian. Loanees Michy Batshuayi (Borussia Dortmund), Kurt Zouma (Stoke), Lucas Piazon (Fulham) and Kenedy (Newcastle) have all been deemed surplus to requirements, while Danny Drinkwater is also likely to be be sold after just one season on the fringes of the first team. Tammy Abrahams and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are expected to survive any summer cull, but the Stamford Bridge club may have to prepare for life without Eden Hazard if, as expected, Real Madrid make a big bid. Manchester United defenders Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind have been told they can seek alternative employment this summer, while Eric Bailly is understood to be concerned about his future at Old Trafford after being given the cold shoulder by José Mourinho. Reports in Spain suggest Lazio’s Serbian midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic may take one of the spare dressing room pegs freed up by any mini-exodus from Old Trafford, while United – along with Barcelona and Chelsea – are hoping to take Héctor Bellerín from Arsenal. Representatives of Rafael Benítez are in talks with Newcastle United managing director Lee Charnley regarding the Spaniard’s future at the club, with speculation mounting that he could be on the verge of a return to Napoli. Most reports suggest Rafa would quite like to stay on Tyneside, but wants assurances that he will be given transfer funds and more autonomy at a club whose short-term future remains up in the air. The 58-year-old made no secret of his annoyance at not being supported by the club hierarchy in the transfer market last summer and will have no shortage of offers if he decides to leave St James’ Park. And finally, Luis Enrique is on the verge of pricing himself out of the running to be on the shortlist of candidates to become the new Arsenal manager, with club overlords reported to be unimpressed with his demands of £15m a year after tax. Whoever replaces Arsène Wenger is likely to take home less than the £8.5m salary trousered annually by the outgoing manager and Jürgen Klopp’s assistant Zeljko Buvac has emerged as a surprise contender for the role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/02/they-are-our-people-queensland-town-beg-dutton-not-to-deport-asylum-seeker-family","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T08:33:29Z","webTitle":"‘They are our people’: Queensland town begs Dutton not to deport asylum seeker family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/they-are-our-people-queensland-town-beg-dutton-not-to-deport-asylum-seeker-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/they-are-our-people-queensland-town-beg-dutton-not-to-deport-asylum-seeker-family","fields":{"headline":"‘They are our people’: Queensland town begs Dutton not to deport asylum seeker family","bodyText":"Residents of a small Queensland town and their supporters have picketed the federal court in Melbourne asking for an asylum seeker family forcibly removed in a dawn raid to be allowed to return home. The family are facing deportation to Sri Lanka but on Wednesday the federal court judge delayed her decision on their appeal. The family of four had overstayed their bridging visa by one day when officers from the Australian Border Force, as well as police officers and Serco guards, arrived at their home at 5am in early March, taking them to immigration detention in Melbourne. Priya and Nadesalingam were give 10 minutes to pack for themselves and their two Australian-born daughters – nine-month-old Dharuniga and two-year-old Kopika. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Wednesday the judge adjourned to review the arguments before making her decision, and requested the federal home affairs department not to deport the family in the meantime, said a friend of the family, Angela Fredericks. Outside the court, residents from the central Queensland town of Biloela and supporters gathered on the lawn, holding signs, cut-out pictures of cockatoos and photographs of the family. “This family had integrated so well, they were our friends, they were our neighbours, they were part of our community,” said Fredericks. “Ever since they arrived Nade has put up his hand to work. He volunteered at St Vincent de Paul ... Their two children were both born in Biloela, they are our people.” She said the Border Force raid traumatised the family’s neighbours, who heard them screaming but were unable to help. Fredericks said regardless of the court outcome, Biloela wanted the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to use his powers to allow the family to go back. “Regardless of what happens in court, we are calling on Mr Dutton to exercise his discretionary powers to allow this family to return to their home in Biloela in time for Kopika’s third birthday on the 12 May,” she said. Fredericks said she was “gravely concerned” for the family, and that Dharuniga was showing signs of stress “known to affect detained infants”. “Little Kopika is too young to understand how far she is from home and asks constantly for her Biloela friends,” said Fredericks. Supporters have vowed to step in if the appeal fails. The Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam said they were extremely concerned the family’s appeal would fail and they’d be deported. “We are preparing to stop a potential deportation through other means,” he said. “All we know is the system is set to fail Tamil asylum seekers. We have seen a lot of Tamil cases fail.” The family have previously said they were made to sign documents under duress in which they agreed to voluntary deportation. Home affairs has previously been questioned on various allegations, but said the family’s asylum application had “been comprehensively assessed by the department, various tribunals and courts”. “They have consistently been found not to meet Australia’s protection obligations.” Nadesalingam and Priya arrived in Australia by boat, separately, in 2012 and 2013, after Sri Lanka’s violent and lengthy civil war. They married in 2014, and had two daughters. Nadesalingam had links to the former separatist army, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, former members of which continue to be persecuted, according to human rights organisations. The home affairs department has been contacted for comment.

Maybe it's about the jokes","bodyText":"The Menzies Research Centre, a Liberal-affiliated thinktank dedicated to “liberty, free speech, competitive enterprise, smaller government and democracy”, is not known for its sense of humour. It’s not known for anything, really, but it’s especially not known for that. Director Nick Cater’s idea of levity is how unpronounceable some people find race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane’s name, and its board of directors – a collection of former Coalition MPs, industry barons and investment bankers – doesn’t exactly scream “funny”. Nonetheless, the MRC has cobbled together a panel as part of its Provocateur series to ask why Australians just don’t have a sense of humour anymore. Beyond a Joke: Why Humour is a Core Australian Value promises an evening of drinks, canapes, and the phrase “political correctness” uttered ad nauseum. In Harbour 220, a corporate-chic bar on Macquarie Street, attendees sip bubbly and nibble on fish sliders brought around by waiters.

Not many people seem to have taken up the hotly discounted ticket price for Young Liberal members. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday It feels almost unfair to point out that there aren’t any comedians on the panel. Instead, the MRC has rounded up Liberal backbencher and climate sceptic extraordinaire Craig Kelly; News Corp columnist Tim Blair; and Gemma Tognini, a PR executive, columnist with The West Australian and a regular on Sky News. Even when taken together, the trio have a fairly thin comedic CV. Blair once wrote an unintentionally hilarious two-page saga for the Daily Telegraph about an afternoon he spent in Lakemba, or “Muslim Land”, before getting scared by a “crudely Islamified” shop mannequin and fleeing back to the CBD. Kelly most recently made headlines for the ill-fated Monash Forum, a pro-coal parliamentary group derided by Sir John Monash’s descendants, and for praising the “coherent, democratic process” of Azerbaijan’s recent presidential election, which the incumbent won with 86% of the vote. Tognini has a few well-worn bits: discrimination against men, free speech under attack at universities, the danger of the Greens. Tognini kicks things off, and turns out to have more to offer than her fellow panelists. She recounts growing up as the daughter of Italian immigrants in “a very whitebread part of Perth”, and how her family encouraged her never to buy into the myth of “migrants as victims”. On arriving in Australia by boat, the first thing her nonna did was crack a joke to her son: “Take me home”. Halfway through her story Kelly walks in. “Sorry I’m late! Down fighting the socialists at the ABC,” he says. It gets the biggest laugh of the night so far, but Tognini brings them back with her account of how migrants used to integrate into wider Australian life. “No one got triggered, no one went to the Human Rights Commission, none of that bullshit,” Tognini says to applause. “We’re almost apologetic about the country that we have. We’re not going to get better by pandering to false offence. Whole industries have sprung up and are making a buck on stuff that’s not there.” Then Kelly takes the mic, and regales the crowd with the schoolboy antics he and other backbenchers use to pass the time while other people write laws. Some are harmless, while others stray into deep weirdness. During the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, he would intentionally leave a scrap of paper with the betting odds on which prime minister would make it to the next election on his desk for Labor MPs to find when they crossed to the other side of the chamber. He and his mates also snuck an ad for a Canberra brothel under the door of an unnamed former union official apparently notorious for using sex workers. He abruptly switches gears, citing the recent controversy around the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. Kelly believes people taking offence to jokes based on race and ethnicity “is what divides us”. The Human Rights Commission, a “despicable, Orwellian organisation”, unfairly targeted deceased Australian cartoonist Bill Leak for “pointing out a problem in Aboriginal society”. Bill’s son Johannes, who has replaced his father as the Australian’s resident cartoonist, gets a round of applause. Tim Blair starts by telling a pretty good story about a practical joke his father-in-law played on him: telling the government he had a stash of assault rifles shortly after the 1996 gun buyback began. Citing the hilarity with which Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy was initially met, he makes a decent point about jokes being “a way of stress-testing ideas”. Then things go the way they were always going to go. “Any concept the left comes up with” that can’t stand up to the scrutiny of jokes, like the “upper house ballot of genders” apparently available to students at the University of Sydney, gets banned. Comic Michelle Wolf’s turn at the White House correspondents’ dinner “was just nasty, it was just vitriol”. How this squares with Blair’s description of Yassmin Abdel-Magied – “ivory’s a prohibited import, and there’s 20 kilos of it in her gob” – never becomes clear.

Asked about the Business Council of Australia’s push for a lower corporate tax rate worth $65bn, the Australian Institute of Company Directors chair, Elizabeth Proust, told ABC radio, “I think it is highly likely to be unsuccessful.” Instead, she said, company directors believed broader tax reform was the answer. “I think the lack of support is now obvious for that [the company tax cut]. But that hasn’t been the AICD position. The AICD position has been tax reform, which includes GST, personal income tax and company tax, and we think the focus on company tax reductions alone is misguided. We have been saying that for some time,” she told ABC radio. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “What we need is a debate about – especially in context with communities hurting through low or no wage growth and high expenses including energy prices – we think we need wholesale tax reform, not just a focus on one tax.” Proust’s line echoed the thoughts of Tim Storer, the independent crossbench senator who became the surprise sticking point for the government when he refused to give his support to the tax cuts, citing the need for broader tax reform. But despite the unpopularity of tax cuts with voters, particularly since the banking royal commission began, the government has refused to drop the policy. Mathias Cormann took the legislation off the Senate agenda after Storer’s objection, but has vowed to return it. In the meantime, the BCA went public with Centre Ground, it’s advocacy arm, aimed at pushing its members interests. The BCA’s For the Common Good campaign aims to promote “the positives and needs” of the business community, including company tax cuts. The ABC reported each of the BCA’s 130 members – who consist of Australia’s leading chief executives – were asked to contribute $200,000 to the effort, which GetUp labelled an attempt to build a $26 million “election war chest”. In the same interview, Proust also tackled claims the banking royal commission revelations, which led to the resignation of the AMP head, Catherine Brenner, were proof the push for gender equality on boards was leading to inexperienced women being given jobs they were not ready for. Brenner resigned after it was revealed AMP had lied to the regulator. Proust said the banking royal commission’s revelations and the recent regulator report into the culture at Australia’s largest financial institution, the Commonwealth Bank, were something all boards needed to take note of – but women were not to blame. “I think we’ve got a couple of examples where people are using the gender issue to say you shouldn’t have women on boards and some of the media, social media in particular, is appalling on the subject. It has allowed people to say ‘this is what happens when you put women on boards’,” she said. “My response is to say we need people who are women, we need people of different backgrounds on our boards, and that is a push we won’t resign from.” Proust said of the 2,000 or so directors who hold ASX200 board positions, 176 were women."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/26/us-liberal-islamophobia-rising-more-insidious","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T16:00:01Z","webTitle":"US liberal Islamophobia is rising – and more insidious than rightwing bigotry | Khaled A Beydoun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/us-liberal-islamophobia-rising-more-insidious","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/us-liberal-islamophobia-rising-more-insidious","fields":{"headline":"US liberal Islamophobia is rising – and more insidious than rightwing bigotry","bodyText":"“When will Muslims step up and reform Islam?” asked the self-identified “progressive and intersectional” college student, following a presentation of my book, American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, at New York University. The student wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and a colorful assortment of pins and patches on his camouflage backpack calling for “equality now” and claiming that “The future is female”. The young man, by way of verbal admission and the myriad of political statements he proudly wore, was a political progressive. And indeed, a representative of a swelling population of leftists who embrace progressive principles yet see Islam as inimical to liberal values and in conflict with American identity. The left is saturated with pundits and self-styled public intellectuals who disseminate discourses that Islam is monolithic; that Muslims must choose between liberal principles and their faith, and, echoing the college student I encountered at in March, a religion that is in need of “reform”. A diverse and eclectic litany of prominent Islamophobes occupies the left. These liberal Islamophobes, like Bill Maher and Sam Harris, weaponize atheism as an ideology that not only discredits the spiritual dimensions of Islam but also demonizes it in line with longstanding orientalist, political terms. For these new atheists, Islam is illegitimate because it is a religion, but unlike other religions, is distinctly threatening because it is inherently at odds with liberal values. Echoing Samuel P Huntington and the intellectual father of modern Islamophobia, Bernard Lewis, Harris writes: “While the other major world religions have been fertile sources of intolerance, it is clear that the doctrine of Islam poses unique problems for the emergence of a global civilization.” Harris, the spearhead of the new atheist movement, which has broad appeal on the left, is a mainstay on HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher. Furthermore, Harris’s influence on Maher, perhaps the most vivid and venomous liberal Islamophobe, is routinely on display on his weekly program – a program widely viewed by progressives and wildly popular with educated, cosmopolitan and middle-class liberals. “The Muslim world has too much in common with Isis [Islamic State],” Maher has stated, and also declared in front of a live audience that: “Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia, that will kill you if you say the wrong thing.” Opinions that, at once, conflate an immensely diverse religious population of 1.6 billion believers with a terrorist network, and liken a religion to a criminal enterprise. This opinion was not much different from the one Donald Trump made while on the campaign trail, warning that refugees fleeing war-torn Syria “could be Isis”, or more broadly, that “Islam hates us”. These statements flow from the fundamental Islamophobic baseline that Islam is more civilization than religion, and Muslims a homogeneous bloc whose free exercise of religion is a threat. The lone difference? Trump is peddling these views to a predominantly conservative base, while Maher is pushing it on to a progressive audience. If Trump is the popular mascot of Islamophobia rising from the right, then Maher is his symbolic counterpart on the left. Just like Trump, the loaded misrepresentations of Islam and condemnation of Muslims spewed by Harris and particularly Maher are reaching millions of leftists and progressives, and, as evidenced by raucous applause, television ratings or questions from college students, resonating. For these liberal Islamophobes, much like their counterparts on the right, “Muslims are the quintessentially illiberal subjects,” Long Beach state university scholar Yousef Baker said. In this view, the very existence of Muslims and their expressions of worship pose a threat to liberal values. Liberal Islamophobia is rising, in the United States and beyond, and rapidly metastasizing in the shadows while its tentacles on the right extend in the form of presidential rhetoric, state-sponsored travel bans and expanding surveillance. Yet, liberal Islamophobia may reveal itself to be more ominous than the bigotry trumpeted by Republican stalwarts and reactionary conservatives, particularly if we continue to ignore its uptick on television, college campuses, and liberal spaces beyond and in between.

Colombian-born Andres Lopez Elorez appeared in a US federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday after being extradited from Spain, where he was arrested in 2015. Lopez Elorez, 38, who also goes by the surname Lopez Elorza, fled in 2005 when authorities arrested about two dozen suspected traffickers in Colombia. His arrest was part of a 12-year Drug Enforcement Administration investigation. If convicted on conspiracy charges, he risks spending at least 10 years and potentially life behind bars. Authorities allege that between September 2004 and January 2005 Elorez was a member of a Colombian ring smuggling heroin into the US using various methods, including human and dog couriers. It is believed the dogs were sent on commercial flights to New York, where the drugs were cut out of them. Investigators believe the puppies would have died in the process, but it was unknown how many were involved. “As alleged in the indictment, Elorez is not only a drug trafficker, he also betrayed a veterinarian’s pledge to prevent animal suffering when he used his surgical skills in a cruel scheme to smuggle heroin in the abdomens of puppies,” US attorney Richard Donoghue said. “Dogs are man’s best friend and, as the defendant is about to learn, we are drug dealers’ worst enemy.” Ten puppies were found during a 2005 raid on a farm in Colombia, DEA officials said. Five ended up running away, three died from infection and two were adopted, including one that became a drug-sniffing dog for Colombian police, officials said. “Over time, drug organisations’ unquenchable thirst for profit leads them to do unthinkable crimes like using innocent puppies for drug concealment,” the head of the DEA’s New York division, James Hunt, said.

And yet the Australian Communications and Media Authority has ruled that a news report by the ABC’s political editor, Andrew Probyn, breached the ABC’s code for impartiality because he noted that Tony Abbott was “the most destructive politician of his generation”. Abbott being observed to be destructive, particularly in the context of Probyn’s report, which was about climate change and energy policy, is just a fact. It isn’t Probyn’s feelings, or some quaint article of faith, or a reflection of secret communism. It’s about as controversial as noting that the sky is blue on a sunny day. Let’s examine the record. Fact. Abbott, during a period of opposition, took the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull when he was inclined to do a deal with Labor on an emissions trading scheme. Abbott then scuttled bipartisan cooperation on an important policy issue for a decade. Fact. Labor managed to legislate a carbon price in a minority parliament. The policy had a couple of objectives: emissions reduction and and economic transformation. The policy was an attempt to drive an orderly transition in a carbon intensive economy. • Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday Fact. Abbott then launched a full frontal political campaign to dismantle it. The focal point of the 2013 election was axing Labor’s carbon tax (which wasn’t actually a tax but was widely reported as a tax without censure from the ACMA but let’s not sweat the small stuff, like f-a-c-t-s). After Abbott won the 2013 election, he repealed Labor’s scheme. Fact. The ensuing policy vacuum has led to rising energy prices and created damaging policy uncertainty. You don’t have to take my word for this. You can ask every major stakeholder in the country, from major business groups to the greenest of the green environmentalists, who are now begging the parliament to fix the mess Abbott created. It’s a real problem, with real-world impacts, not some artefact of a rarefied political debating society. Fact. Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg have attempted to fix the mess, shadowed again by Abbott, who campaigned publicly first against a proposal from the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, (a clean energy target) and then against the national energy guarantee because it doesn’t facilitate new coal investment. Probyn’s news report covered a speech Abbott made to a London-based climate sceptic group that was called Daring to Doubt. In the speech, Abbott suggested climate change was “probably doing good” and he likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. This speech was delivered at a time when Turnbull and Frydenberg were attempting to finalise their energy policy. None of this recitation of the record is speculative or tendentious or a feelpinion. Any light perusal of any news archive would bear this summary out. We could pretend that the mess that Australia is in on climate and energy policy is just some accident visited on the populace, that we all just woke up one day in deep dysfunction and that is just one of those random things that happen for reasons that aren’t entirely clear – but we would be lying to our audiences if we did that, and lying to our audiences is intolerable, unconscionable and unprofessional. Being impartial shouldn’t require a journalist to suspend judgment, and to pretend that all perspectives are inherently equal, it should require a reporter to apply professional judgment informed by a rigorous assessment of the facts, with the objective of informing readers and viewers. The ABC’s impartiality code requires “a balance that follows the weight of evidence”. It also requires fair treatment, open-mindedness, opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. Balance that follows the weight of the evidence leads me, like Probyn, to an inexorable conclusion: when it comes to climate change and energy (again, the focus of his report), I’ve not, in my reporting lifetime at least, seen a more destructive politician than Abbott. This is not an opinion, or a tantrum, or an abstraction, it’s a cool, rational, clinical assessment of the evidence, which is what I suspect audiences require of their national broadcaster. Australia doesn’t need a publicly funded false balance factory. If that’s what the ABC has to be to be judged “impartial”, then we would all be better off if taxpayer support was directed towards different ventures rather than a purportedly venerable institution occupying media space for the sake of it. Trust is the key to the survival of journalism in an era when just about everything is ranged against it. Without trust we have nothing. And trust requires truth-telling without fear or favour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/02/brittle-real-madrid-roma-liverpool-bayern-munich-european-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Brittle Real Madrid will have Liverpool and Roma licking their lips | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/02/brittle-real-madrid-roma-liverpool-bayern-munich-european-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/02/brittle-real-madrid-roma-liverpool-bayern-munich-european-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Brittle Real Madrid will have Liverpool and Roma licking their lips","bodyText":"Real Madrid tried so hard to lose this semi-final. Bayern Munich tried so hard to win it. That neither could achieve this apparently shared aim speaks in the first place to Real’s pure champion will and secondly to that nexus of game-management, calamitous Bayern defending and something close to a kind of white-shirted voodoo, the ability to win even while in the process of sputtering and panting like a stalled presidential motorcade. This was a fun, wild, oddly drunken game of football that ended 2-2 at the Bernabéu and 4-3 to Real on aggregate. At the end of which a couple of things seemed clear. Above all this was just a brilliant game. These late-stage encounters are supposed to unwind like a game of chess, a matter of grudging details. This was a more like a seasick game of quoits on the deck of a rum-sodden pirate ship, 95 minutes of half-chances, howlers and defending that seemed to have come undone at the seams like a soggy envelope. This leads on to point two, the ongoing, perhaps misguided conviction that somebody somewhere is finally going to connect in a decisive way with that elegantly presented champion’s glass jaw. Liverpool or Roma will travel to Kiev later this month with a chance to stop Real from making it three in a row. With this in mind Bayern might just have offered an anatomy of how to go about doing it, with a performance that will be picked apart and pored over with interest by either Jürgen Klopp or Eusebio Di Francesco over the next few weeks. For long periods in the second half Bayern were heroic. They thrashed Real 2-2, battered them to a score draw, steamrollered their own way right out of the competition. Albeit at times it was as though Real were actively trying to concede goals, with Thomas Müller left unmarked for pretty much the whole of the second half, constantly hollering for the ball in another traumatically wide open green space while Marcelo ambled back wearing a look of mild curiosity. With the final kick of the game, and with Bayern a kick from the final, Müller eventually got that cross from the left and launched himself, missing by a toenail. As the whistle blew there were spent, crumpled bodies across the turf. Bayern had 22 shots at goal to Real’s nine. They hogged the ball. They reduced Cristiano Ronaldo to 13 completed passes. But for a frankly bonkers error by Sven Ulreich, Jupp Heynckes would now be preparing for a swansong final. Instead Ulreich came up with something genuinely strange, seeming to stop and then simply lie down on the turf as the ball bobbled towards him, a man overcome with weariness, allowing Karim Benzema to score his second of the game. Whoever their opponents later this month Real’s weaknesses here seemed to tessellate intriguingly with the attacking strengths of both Liverpool and Roma. The most telling was the constant weakness Bayern found on the flanks. David Alaba’s willingness to attack the temporary right-back Lucas Vázquez had Real looking at times like a three-legged dog of a team, always listing to one side, exposing a lack of cover for the full-backs. The ball fell the wrong way three or four times. Alaba drove outside where Sadio Mané or Mo Salah can be expected to hare infield. And both Bayern goals came from surges out wide, the second after fine work from the excellent Niklas Süle and a cross that James Rodríguez put away before producing a laughably prim no-celebration-celebration right in front of the delirious away fans. Similarly Bayern only really struggled when they let their high press drop, when Real were able to build and maintain pressure, allowing that high-grade but far from youthful attack to find space. Real lack a little pace these days without Gareth Bale on the pitch. It is possible with a little luck to play a bold high line, to press with the throttle to the floor, as both Liverpool and Roma do at times. Real will be favourites whoever they face but there will still be hope in the familiar sense of brittleness on show here. Should they make it to Kiev Liverpool will surely look to play with a high-pressing sense of risk, to do as much as possible in their own full-throttle red zone against opponents who can look vulnerable and oddly invincible at the same time, and who were winners once again by some shakily enacted divine regal right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/forget-fairytales-a-league-success-is-borne-out-of-unity-of-purpose","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"Forget fairytales, A-League success is borne out of unity of purpose | Richard Parkin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/forget-fairytales-a-league-success-is-borne-out-of-unity-of-purpose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/forget-fairytales-a-league-success-is-borne-out-of-unity-of-purpose","fields":{"headline":"Forget fairytales, A-League success is borne out of unity of purpose","bodyText":"Football teams are usually defined by their stars. Diego Maradona’s Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Real Madrid. Even those clubs that profess a non-galácticos ethos like Barcelona have become synonymous with a Lionel Messi or Andrés Iniesta. But the key ingredients to really good teams, genuinely successful teams, are often the players who pundits don’t talk about – those names which aren’t normally embroidered on replica jerseys. And so, as impressive as the form of Newcastle Jets Andrew Nabbout and Dimi Petratos has been this season – form which earned the pair Socceroos call-ups – the performances of Steven Ugarkovic, Ben Kantarovski, Jason Hoffman and Johnny Koutroumbis have been of equal importance to the grand finalists. Just over a year ago, when the Jets travelled to Wellington to take on a Phoenix side missing six international players, five of the same players that dazzled Melbourne City in last week’s semi-final were named on the team sheet. They were duly thrashed 5-0 by the depleted Nix, as the Jet’s season spiralled rapidly towards ignominy, finishing on a six-game losing streak in which they shipped 19 goals. Ernie Merrick may have been overlooked for A-League coach of the year, but the job he has done with the players inherited from one the darkest chapters of this football club – one not short of awful memories over the last seven years – is truly remarkable. Hoffman, a player once listed as a striker, then a utility, then a defender has just matched the goal return of his entire 10-year A-League career – in one season. Kantarovski, a defensive midfielder not noted for his flair or attacking potency has just outscored Roy Krishna, Alex Brosque, James Troisi and Brendon Santalab. Gui Finkler, reflecting on the differences across a career played in Brazil, England, Belgium and Australasia, once explained how the squad-size limit and salary cap made the A-League a fundamentally different competition. “In Brazil, it’s totally different,” the former Melbourne Victory and Phoenix player said. “A new coach comes into training and bang, 14 players leave. Everyone is always moving, you don’t make friendships in the locker room, you don’t make lasting connections to people or places. In the A-League, you can’t do that, the squads are capped. You work with what you have. So to win the A-League it’s not about tactics, it’s about how you manage the players.” To turn a defensive midfielder told for years to just tackle and shuffle into a goalscorer again speaks to the remarkable way Merrick can instill belief. A player told all his career he was only good enough to be reactive, now playing proactively. And two of his goals were backheel flicks. Now that’s self-belief. Another player who worked closely with Merrick was Vince Lia, both in the early years at Victory and then later in Wellington. In addition to the Scot’s exemplary man management skills, Lia attributed his success to an ability to judge character. “He is one of those coaches that signs men,” said Lia, in an interview from 2016. “He likes to sign characters, and see how they can fit into the team.” In the context of sudden success, press panegyrics can often be prone to overstating the influence of an individual coach, but Newcastle Jets’ impressive off-season recruitment speaks to a wider team effort and if Merrick is the master of man-management, then Lawrie McKinna is the master of identity. At the A-League’s foundation, the last team in – the little club on the Central Coast that many expected to be there merely making up the numbers – quickly established itself as the league’s gold-standard not just in terms of community involvement but also in terms of identity. This was a club of the Coast, by the Coast, for the Coast – and they revered the man, McKinna, who was so synonymous with this that they made him mayor. Despite the seeming incongruity of it, now it’s the fans of the Mariners’ northern rivals in Newcastle that have taken McKinna to heart. Despite the gloom and doom surrounding crowd metrics A-League wide, the fans are flocking again to Jets games. As Newcastle CEO, McKinna brought back Jets legend Joel Griffiths – the Johnny Warren medalist and A-League golden boot winner with Newcastle in 2007-08, the year they last won the championship. Having people who “get” Newcastle, who share its history and love its foreshore is part and parcel of creating an identity, a football club that both inspires its region and reflects it. And while much of this has been well-documented in the lead up to the grand final, there’s one more figure in this fairytale that deserves tremendous credit – owner Martin Lee. In Con Constantine and Nathan Tinkler the Jets have enjoyed two of the more colourful owners in the competition’s short and chequered history. In contrast to characters who enjoyed being in the centre of their club’s spotlight, an owner who knows how not to is an understated quality. In a league where owners regularly lose vast sums of money, simply handing over the cheques without strings attached is a role too few have been prepared to play. But more than just refraining from interfering, Lee’s ownership demonstrates trust, and more importantly, a clear unity of purpose between the club’s key decision makers. A coach who understands the crucial necessity of man-management in the A-League, a CEO who grasps the importance of community and identity, and an owner who’s smart enough to trust and back his staff. Amid the Jets’ fairytale revival there’s a readymade template right there for A-League success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/03/graveyard-of-dreams-julian-burnside-on-the-heartbreaking-plight-of-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"'Graveyard of dreams': Julian Burnside on the heartbreaking plight of refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/03/graveyard-of-dreams-julian-burnside-on-the-heartbreaking-plight-of-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/03/graveyard-of-dreams-julian-burnside-on-the-heartbreaking-plight-of-refugees","fields":{"headline":"'Graveyard of dreams': Julian Burnside on the heartbreaking plight of refugees","bodyText":"In a scene from the Australian documentary Border Politics, presenter Julian Burnside AO QC visits a strange and surreal garbage dump on the Greek island of Lesbos, located off the coast of Turkey. Strewn across beautiful grassy hills, with aqua blue water visible in the background, is the unsettling sight of thousands upon thousands of life jackets. Many refugees go through Turkey to get across Europe, and Lesbos is a common jumping-off point. The jackets are stacked in huge mounds, among bits and pieces of other detritus including clothes and parts of boats. They are, perhaps, an accidental monument to the journey of the refugees, whose fates are uncertain. Many years ago Burnside, a veteran barrister who became a refugee rights advocate after working on the 2001 Tampa case in an action against the Australian government, acquired the steely and unflappable demeanour we associate with high-profile lawyers. And yet, as he sits in front of one of the mounds, contemplating how every life jacket “represents somebody’s dreams of safety, of a better life”, and reflects on this grim place as “a graveyard of a million dreams”, you can see he is struggling to keep it together. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “You sort of get hardened to a lot of stuff,” he tells Guardian Australia. “But there I was, with those life jackets, suddenly faced directly with unexpected evidence of really big, human problems of the sort I had never seen before. It had quite an effect.” Border Politics has its world premiere on Saturday at the Human Rights Arts and Film festival. In it, director Judy Rymer follows Burnside as he travels the globe, examining the harsh treatment of refugees at the hands of western democracies. The barrister says another profound moment occurred when he was in the now-demolished Calais refugee camp. He looked up at an enormous fence, designed to keep out asylum seekers, and “saw a fragment of cloth, someone’s clothing, caught in the razor wire 20 ft above the ground. Then I saw someone’s shoe. It was a very clear indication of how desperate some people are; what they will risk in order to get somewhere safe.” For Professor Gillian Triggs, former president of the Australian Human Rights Commission and an interviewee in the film, a moment that triggered a lasting impression occurred a few years ago in Jordan. One million displaced people had recently come across the border. Triggs was taken to refugee camps from the six-day war in 1967, which she vividly recalls learning about as a law student in Melbourne. “It was then I realised,” Triggs recalls, “that for pretty much all of my 50 years of professional life, the refugees from the six-day war are still in refugee camps. Still struggling to survive. For me, seeing those two camps separated by 50 years was a compelling reminder of how serious a problem this is.” The lawyer and human rights advocate is impressed, however, by measures undertaken by Jordan, including its refugee employment programs. The situation there is explored in Border Politics , with Burnside describing the country as a place that “puts us all to shame”. While visiting Jordan, Triggs says she found that “the concern of the officials and politicians was all about how they were going to ensure clean water and education for the children. They certainly weren’t talking about how they could build walls or stop them coming. It was a completely different mindset. You just found yourself thinking: how could this be, when Australia is so far away and so relatively rich? How we could turn our backs on this?” Both Burnside and Triggs are outspoken critics of Australian government policy on refugees and asylum seekers. Both draw a connection back to 2001, viewing the Tampa and “children overboard” affairs and the measures of John Howard’s government as a turning point in the country’s treatment of desperate people. According to Triggs, the policies Australian governments have adopted since 2001 “have been of the lowest kind, morally and legally.” “What has really worried me in recent times is that Peter Dutton is saying all sorts of stuff to persuade average Australians that what is going on is OK. The idea that politicians can gradually persuade the public to accept what is intolerable is very frightening,” Burnside says. He is troubled by where the current political conversation might lead. “If you gradually make it acceptable to behave monstrously to other human beings, then you are on a very dangerous path.” Contemplating the future, the barrister is torn between imagining an Australia where “what we are doing now to refugees may be recognised as monstrous behaviour” and an Australia where “what we are doing now will only get worse.” Triggs is more optimistic. “The current situation is very un-Australian, if I can use that phrase,” she says. “But you can’t be a human rights lawyer, or an international lawyer as I am, without having a huge level of optimism. I really believe we’ll get past this. I don’t believe this is sustainable. “Just as you have the speeches of Trump on the one hand, and viewing the lifejackets on an island in the other, there is scope between these positions to try to manage the mass movement of people globally. “We have the potential to do it, but it does require, in some cases, changes of government, and more visionary leadership. All that is possible.” • Border Politics is showing as part of the Human Rights Arts and Film festival in Melbourne on 12 and 16 May, and in select cinemas around Australia from 13 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/29/saracens-harlequins-afternoon-progress-womens-game","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T19:05:45Z","webTitle":"Saracens beat Harlequins on historic afternoon for rugby union | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/29/saracens-harlequins-afternoon-progress-womens-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/29/saracens-harlequins-afternoon-progress-womens-game","fields":{"headline":"Saracens beat Harlequins on historic afternoon for rugby union","bodyText":"English rugby has its share of thorny issues at present but there is one fast-emerging success story out there. If a distinctly chilly Sunday afternoon in west London exuded little obvious glamour, the inaugural Tyrrells Premier 15s final represented the latest major positive stride for the domestic women’s game, a potentially significant staging post along the long, winding road to oval‑shaped equality. It may be a while yet before rugby’s sisterhood are contesting a sold-out Twickenham final but then again few envisaged professional men’s club rugby back in the 1980s when Saracens were playing on a public park in Southgate. In years to come those in charge of championing the women’s club game may just recall this as the moment which propelled their heroines out of the shadows and into the light of public consciousness. Ultimately it was Saracens’ day on the field at Ealing, by a breathlessly narrow 24-20 margin against Harlequins in front of 2,000, but it was arguably an even greater triumph for everyone who has believed in 15-a-side women’s rugby as more than entertaining enough to be judged on its own merits. For sheer edge-of-the-seat tension the final moments were as taut as any neutral could possibly wish to experience. To watch players as compellingly good as Marlie Packer, Shaunagh Brown and Jess Breach is also to wonder how long it will be before they are properly rewarded like their male counterparts, as opposed to juggling full-time jobs and training three times a week for the love of it. Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union’s director of professional rugby, says he is “absolutely sure” the best women club players will be paid in future, while the Wasps coach, Giselle Mather, argues that current levels of personal sacrifice will be “unsustainable” sooner rather than later. Mather said on Sunday: “How do you become the best athlete you can be and hold down a full-time job? In 10 years’ time I would suggest we’re looking at the top tier being professional or semi-professional. It is possible we might be at that stage in five years.” According to Mather “a tipping point has been reached in women’s sport” and only the seriously blinkered would disagree with her analysis. “People are realising that women’s sport is really good to watch. We’re not trying to be the men’s game. If I was a young lass going into sport now, I’d be so excited. There are now five quality female team sports – hockey, netball, football, cricket and rugby – which are all roaringly successful. Team sport for females is cool now and we’re bloody good at it.” Initially Saracens’ mauling and offloading game had threatened to overrun Harlequins, a lovely pass from Hannah Botterman creating the game’s first try for her fellow prop, Sam Martinez Gion, and the captain, Lottie Clapp, slicing through for the second. When the winger Garnet Mackinder added a third to make it 17-3, a horribly one-sided contest loomed. Harlequins, though, displayed considerably more cohesion, resolve and stamina than their male counterparts have managed in recent weeks. Holly Myers gave them some hope just before half-time and second-half tries from Breach, on as a replacement, and the flanker Deborah McCormack dragged them right back into contention. Even after the no-nonsense Botterman had rampaged over for Saracens’ fourth try Quins kept coming and a stunning comeback might have been completed but for a rush‑of‑blood quick tap and subsequent knock-on in front of the posts which saved their relieved opponents. The RFU, which has invested £2.4m in women’s club rugby over three years, will also be hugging itself at how swiftly its newly minted tournament has captured hearts and minds. Let it not be forgotten women’s club rugby has been in this country for four decades – several of the leading pioneers were in Ealing on Sunday – but the scepticism which greeted its rebranding last year has proved mostly misplaced. “The quality of the games has been phenomenal,” Mather said. “It’s surprised even me. Women’s club rugby has been around for 40 years but never with financial support. The respect is now there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/29/deportivo-la-coruna-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T20:36:22Z","webTitle":"Deportivo La Coruña 2-4 Barcelona — as it happened!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/deportivo-la-coruna-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/29/deportivo-la-coruna-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Deportivo La Coruña 2-4 Barcelona — as it happened!","bodyText":"Read tonight’s match report... Thanks for joining me, now go get a lovely glass of wine or similar before the fact it is Monday tomorrow. Until we meet again. There are hugs on the pitch as both teams accept their fate, whether glorious or disastrous. It was a great game and not just because of Barcelona’s part in it. The result also means Barcelona are still unbeaten this season and with four games to go, one must assume they will carry on in that vein. Barcelona are the champions! Deportivo are relegated! Contrasting emotions at the Riazor as the Catalans complete the inevitable title win thanks to some Messi and Suarez magic but Depor played their part in the fixture and will be disappointed to end up losing by a two-goal margin, leaving their fans to wonder how their season has gone so badly wrong. 90 min: What are you doing Pique? The defender started a break from a failed corner and stayed up the other end in desperate search for a goal but when Luis Suarez sent the ball across the six-yard box to the unmarked defender he sent it straight at Ruben. Two minutes added on. 88 min: Depor do their best to pull one back as they break on Barcelona but Colak’s cross finds Schar, the defender, in the box but he can’t make good enough contact and the ball foes wide. Goal! Well that was a great move. The impressive Denis Suarez passed it into Luis Suarez, who spun superbly on the ball and laid it into the path of Messi who kept his nerve to seal his hat-trick and the title. Even better news: Iniesta is now coming on. Lovely stuff. 84 min: One really upset Depor-supporting child is doing some top quality crying in the stands. You’re watching Messi, mate. Who cares if you go down? Enjoy it. Goal! Barcelona were toying with Depor there as Denis Suarez sent the ball to Messi inside the area, but he chose not to shot and instead laid it to Luis Suarez, only for him to play it back to the Argentine to tap home off the post. Is that the title? 81 min: The title was there for Suarez to confirm as Messi sends a backheel through the defence for the Uruguayan. Despite getting beyond all the Depor players, he hits it straight at Ruben who does well to stop it. 79 min: Iniesta is wandering up and down the touchline but he has not been called for yet. On the pitch Messi has caught Schar as he tried to clear it. Didn’t seem much in it but the defender made the most of it. Depor take a terrible free-kick and Messi gets the ball 30 yards from goal, he runs through but his shot is blocked, he really should have done better. 77 min: There is a bit of play on the edge of the Depor box as most of the Barcelona team wait but they are crowded out after Denis Suarez dinked the ball over the defence but Ruben comes to claim. 75 min: Paulinho has arrived in place of Coutinho, which is nice. Barcelona need a few more defensively-minded players on the pitch at the moment. 73 min: Messi dribbles towards the edge of the box from deep inside his own half, he has a Suarez either side, sends it to the left to Luis but his shot from a narrow angle hits the side netting while under pressure. 71 min: This time the cross comes from the left and lands in the six-yard box where there is a mini-melee but no one in a blue and white shirt is capable of turning it home before Jordi Alba clears. 70 min: Another Depor corner is slung in to Schar at the back post but Ter Stegen gets down quickly to his right and holds the ball on his line. 68 min: The home team are having a lot of success down the flanks, especially Barcelona’s left at the moment. Their latest foray results in a corner which goes over everyone and out for a corner on the other side. Denis Suarez replaces Dembele - one must assume Coutinho will move further forward. 66 min: This is going to be a lively last 20 minutes or so, that’s for sure. It looks like Barcelona are bringing a central midfielder on, but it’s Denis Suarez rather than Iniesta. Goal! Deportivo successfully break down the right where Borja Valle sends it across the area with the ball ending up with Celso Borges on the left, who kept his head to lay it off to Colak to sweep home from 10 yards. A lovely break. 60 min: Messi slings in a free-kick but Schar is the man who gives the ball plenty of distance with his head. The Depor break does not come to much. Instead Barcelona get the ball back and Pique does some silky skills for no reasons whatsoever. 58 min: Luisinho is dragged down by Semedo, so a free-kick is given on the flank and the Barcelona man is booked. Set-piece skims off a head at the front post and it comes to nothing. 57 min: A little break from Depor resulted in Lucas Perez being able to fire a shot from 16 yards but it did not really trouble Ter Stegen. 55 min: Rakitic has just intercepted the ball by thwacking it 40 yards up in the air, which is something I have a lot of time for. All Barcelona now. 53 min: Barcelona calmly build up as Suarez sends the ball to Alba sprinting down the left but his pull-back is just inches away from Messi. 51 min: Ooooof! The front free of Dembele, Suarez and Messi combine. The Frenchman gains ground with his speed and then lays it to Suarez who holds it up until Messi makes a run beyond where he receives the pass but can only jab a shot straight at Ruben. 49 min: Dembele once again shows what he has and hasn’t in his locker when he dribbles towards the area once again but when he he has as simple pass to Suarez he puts too much on it, allowing the defence to clear. He really does need a little more focus in those situations. 47 min: A point tonight will be sufficient for Barcelona to win the league, so there is very little need to panic, even when Krohn-Dehli sends in a wicked cross but Pique is concentrating and clears. 46 min: Here we go again! Someone in the stands has a ‘Paulinho, please give me your shirt’ banner. They didn’t have those at White Hart Lane. Striker! Maybe will get Andone on to annoy the Barcelona defence as Deportivo chase the game. He sort of striker that really does give their all, evening if he rarely gets the reward in front of goal. We are going to see plenty of replays of the disallowed Deportivo goal but really it was fair enough from the officials seeing as Schar was in front of Ter Stegen. Some half-time reading... There have been some great moments from Barcelona, which resulted in the goals from Coutinho and Messi. Deportivo have held their own and could be level if things were a little different but they are certainly not out of this thanks to Perez’s goal. A decent record... 43 min: This has been one of the tougher tests Barcelona have faced in the league in recent months. Depor came back strongly from that Messi goal, rather than letting their heads drop after was a wonderful move from the league leaders. Goal! They had threatened before the second for Barcelona and now they have a goal. Borja Valle was played into space down the left from where he pulled the ball for Lucas Perez to slot a shot into the corner. Game on! Goal! Dembele spins on the halfway line and runs at the Depor defence before laying it to the right for Suarez to cross to the back post where Messi is running into space. The ball landed perfectly onto his left boot and he angled the volley perfectly to double the lead. That’s 30 goals for Messi this season, which isn’t bad. A stunning team goal. That’s a lot of times... 36 min: Deportivo are going down fighting, which is refreshing to see in the modern game. They will just be really annoyed they are not yet level and hopefully that frustration won’t boil over as it has threatened to do on a couple of occasions. 34 min: Krohn-Dehli swings one in but Semedo reads the danger and heads it behind for a corner. The resulting set-piece bounces onto what seemed to be the arm of Rakitic, not penalty was awarded but then Colak flung in another cross for Schar to get his head onto it six yards out, but he powerfully sent it well over. He really should have done better. 32 min: Almost an equaliser as Borja Valle runs in between two defenders to try and get on the end of an inswinging cross from the right but he can only get a toe on, which sends the ball just wide. 30 min: Ruben dives full stretch to his left to turn away Messi’s 25-yard free-kick. It looked set to go in the top corner but it was a superb save from the goalkeeper. 29 min: Messi is bundled over by Schar, who is already on a yellow, but he stays on the pitch. Maybe the punishment from Messi’s free-kick will be more severe... 27 min: All pretty calm, apart from the weather. Although Ter Stegen lives things up by sending the ball 30 yards straight to a Depor man and then Borja Valle smashes it well over, which is a shame. 25 min: Going from back to front in about 15 seconds without anyone having to sprint is a decent sign that you’re a good passing side. Sadly for Barcelona, it ends with the ball going out for a corner. 23 min: Barcelona move down the right with the ball as Dembele sends it to the byline for Semedo to pull back but the onrushing Suarez sends it wide when under pressure from Albentosa. Not bad for the Frenchman... 20 min: Suarez has just chucked in a lovely flick into Coutinho from out on the touchline but then Schar decided to stop the play by pulling back the Brazilian, resulting in a card for the defender. More of this, please... 17 min: No Goal! If you like your flags very very late then that is for you. The corner came in and Albentosa headed it towards the top corner but Ter Stegen palmed it away only for Arsenal legend Lucas Perez to tap in but it is ruled that there was an offside, so the goal was ruled out. 15 min: The hosts are having some possession now in the final third but no one seems to possess the required cunning to open up their visitors. Lots of rain in Galicia, which is no surprise. 13 min: Depor have an attack, which results in Colak picking up a loose ball on the edge of the area but the second he passed the white line of the box, he threw himself to the floor. Needless to say, the penalty was not awarded. Nice try, mate. 11 min: Barca are passing it around nicely and opening up gaps in the defence but not just getting a shot away on a couple occasions as Depor crowd out Messi following a dribble into the box. More Iniesta loveliness... 9 min: Could be a long night for Depor who are witnessing first hand why Barcelona are going to win the league. They are working very hard to contain the Catalans but it is really tough work. Goal! It looked like Dembele would get a shot away from 12 yards but he was superbly tackled by Luisinho, only for the Frenchman to regain possession, before laying it off to Coutinho who curled it straight into the top corner. Looks like Barca will be winning the title tonight. A lovely finish. 5 min: The cameras keep cutting to Seedorf as he patrols the touchline, waiting for something to happen in the game. Dembele tries to do a few tricks but it comes to nothing as he is tackled after confusing only himself. 3 min: Pique has tried a 40-yard pass across the pitch which was easily cut out but that is about it so far in Galicia. There is a little bit of atmosphere of flags to keep everyone amused. 1 min: Peep! Peep! Here we go. The Barcelona away does not get me going, if I am being honest. But the Deportivo fans like it so much that they are giving them a guard of honour. It’s quite nice of them but they haven’t won the league just yet and if they don’t win today, they will go down. I guess it is classy in some way but potentially shows too much respect. Keep your praise for Iniesta coming in. Or whatever Invincibles is in Spanish. No Iniesta, no party. Is Iniesta off to Manchester City? Guardiola was very Trumpian in his response. I’m not going to promote the fake news. He decides his own future and he has decided to go to China and play there and he’s going to finish there. Messi is five goals clear in the Pichichi race, so it will not anticipate being caught by Ronaldo who is his nearest rival and tonight is a great chance to add to his league total of 29. If he does take the award, it will be the fifth of his career. I cannot see the two sets of fans doing much of this tonight, but the away team only generally being about 47 people in Spain. Barcelona are really going for it tonight with Suarez, Messi and Dembele up top, not to mention Coutinho in midfield. Not something Depor will be looking forward to. I like Albentosa and Schar but I can’t seem them enjoying the evening in northern Spain. And, of course, you want a bit more Sid Lowe from this week. A title victory and relegation in one game would be enjoyable for all involved, apart from Depor. Can you remember any similar occasions? There are 12 points up for grabs for Depor, who are 11 points adrift of safety, so Raul Albentosa has to trot out a few lines about how survival is possible, even though it really is not. Barcelona are a big team that want to come and win the league, and we want to get out of this sticky situation whichever way possible. We still have options and we have to make the most of them until the end. Messi paid tribute in the way all modern footballers do, by Instagramming about his team-mate. Andres, thanks for all these years of football. It was a privilege to enjoy this sport by your side and spend so many unforgettable moments together. I wish you all the best in this new era for you, on a sporting level and in life. You are a phenomenon on and off the pitch. Without a doubt, we’re going to miss you. Probably worth reading our man, Sid Lowe, on Iniesta as it is frightfully good. Deportivo: Ruben, Juanfran, Albentosa, Schar, Luisinho, Celso Borges, Guilherme, Krohn-Dehli, Emre Colak, Borja Valle and Lucas Subs: Koval, Navarro, Mosquera, Fede Cartabia, Andone, Valverde, Muntari Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Semedo, Pique, Umtiti, Jordi Alba, Rakitic, Busquets, Coutinho, Dembele, Messi, Luis Suarez Subs: Cillessen, Denis Suárez, Iniesta, Paulinho, Paco Alcácer, Aleix Vidal, Vermaelen ¡Hola! This day has been coming for a while, as Barcelona have once again shown they are superior to all of those in Spain, even if they have let themselves down in the Champions League. Last week they taught Sevilla a lesson or five about how to play football and Deportivo are far from being comparable in quality to the Andalucians. A lot of the focus this week has been on Andres Iniesta and the beginning of his long goodbye from the Nou Camp as he heads further afield to finish his career in less glamorous but, more than likely, more lucrative surroundings. His standards have not slipped, although he rarely completes 90 mins but he wants to go out on a high and not with attributes fading in the twilight of his La Liga career. Sadly for Deportivo, this could be confirmation of what has been coming for a long while this season: relegation. It’s really been one to forget for them. Clarence Seedorf has done what he can to keep them in the league - and they are unbeaten in four - but really a miracle was required to keep them up and they have fallen well short."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/29/amber-rud-theresa-may-crisis-windrush","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T22:52:35Z","webTitle":"With Rudd now gone, Theresa May faces a new crisis | Isabel Hardman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/amber-rud-theresa-may-crisis-windrush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/amber-rud-theresa-may-crisis-windrush","fields":{"headline":"With Rudd now gone, Theresa May faces a new crisis","bodyText":"Amber Rudd’s resignation may have been inevitable from the day the Windrush row broke, but it was still a shock to everyone in the Conservative party, including the home secretary’s allies and Downing Street. Most Tories were settling down for a quiet night when the news broke late on Sunday. I had spent the day speaking to No 10 figures and Rudd’s friends and all had been confident that she would stay in the job. On their weekly ring-around of MPs, the Conservative whips ask their charges about various big political issues that might cause trouble in the days ahead. You might expect, given the way it has dominated the front pages for two weeks now, that Windrush might get a mention in the round of calls. It didn’t. No one was planning for this resignation. Colleagues spoke warmly of Rudd. They felt there were plenty of extenuating circumstances for the home secretary ending up in a crisis where she appeared not to know what was going on in her own department. One close ally of the prime minister did perhaps hint at strains between Theresa May and her minister when he described their relationship as “not so much warm, more sort of correct: Theresa gets on with Amber but then we are coming from a pretty low base given she’s also got Hammond and Boris as colleagues”. That Rudd has gone might allow May to draw a line under the issue. Or, it might move the focus back from the competence of the minister charged with implementing the policy and onto the prime minister who designed it. It will also highlight once again quite how weak this government is. It’s not just that Rudd’s departure is the fourth cabinet resignation in six months, but also that there are other senior ministers who May would much rather see the back of who won’t go. That Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson are impossible to move has been a well-known Westminster fact. Both would work to destabilise May. Hammond is enjoying a reasonably stable time as chancellor, but foreign secretary Johnson has had a much rougher ride, regularly slipping up on sensitive matters – from the imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran, to the details of the investigation into the Salisbury attack. “Boris could have seized the job and proved to people that he is a very substantial politician. Instead he has not made his mark, save occasional gaffes,” claimed one May ally, who adds, pointing to Britain’s upcoming EU negotiations: “She can’t move him, but I think deep down he knows that the past two years have not been good for him, and that a Cabinet row on the customs union could give him the ideal opportunity to resign with his head held high.” Johnson’s allies say he is “despondent” at the way the Brexit talks are progressing, and that his resignation remains a real possibility. But his departure is in his own gift, not the prime minister’s, which is an extraordinary sign of weakness for a leader. Similarly, Gavin Williamson is trying with little subtlety or grace to build up a power base in the Ministry of Defence, which makes him tricky to move anywhere save upwards, regardless of how effective he turns out to be. Rudd wasn’t an operator like her three male colleagues – when I asked her junior minister, Ben Wallace, what it was like to work with her, he said: “She’s genuinely one of the best bosses I’ve ever had.” “She isn’t insecure, she does not transmit her ambitions into her department and make it all about her, and she likes team work” – and her desire to follow her boss’s lead rather than develop a threatening power base was what did for her. Her resignation will delight Brexiteers who had been very outspoken on Windrush, but it will make precious little difference to the cabinet dynamics as those close to May are adamant that the remain-leave balance of the cabinet must be maintained and that the next home secretary would have to be a like-for-like replacement for Rudd. What a desperate position for a prime minister to be in: unable to move the operators, and afraid of being exposed by a row in her own former department. It translates into policy too: Tory MPs frequently complain to me that they are bored and barely required to vote on anything these days. “It’s like the last days of the coalition,” said one. “We now joke that we’re back to being able to say ‘goodbye and have a nice weekend’ straight after prime minister’s questions on a Wednesday, because there’s just nothing going on. We can go back to our constituencies early: but we are members of parliament, not members of a constituency.” The old worries about a lack of a domestic agenda are resurfacing, with MPs now fretting about the government’s lack of vision for Britain aside from Brexit. This is an even worse sign than having the great offices of state filled with people who can’t be moved: when Tory MPs are bored, they start making trouble. If May can’t change her top team, she needs to consider making them do something that keeps her party busy – and that shows there’s still a point to the Tories being in government rather than just surviving crises. • Isabel Hardman is a political journalist and assistant editor of the Spectator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/29/un-security-council-overwhelmed-by-suffering-at-rohingya-camps","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T17:17:09Z","webTitle":"UN security council overwhelmed by suffering at Rohingya camps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/un-security-council-overwhelmed-by-suffering-at-rohingya-camps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/29/un-security-council-overwhelmed-by-suffering-at-rohingya-camps","fields":{"headline":"UN security council overwhelmed by suffering at Rohingya camps","bodyText":"Members of the UN security council have expressed dismay at the “overwhelming” suffering they encountered in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fleeing Myanmar. The UN security council delegation arrived in Bangladesh on Friday as part of a trip to hear first-hand the experiences of 700,000 Rohingya refugees subjected to a campaign of violence, rape and arson at the hands of Myanmar’s military since August 2017. Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the UN, who was among the 15 members on the trip, was confronted by dozens of Rohingya refugees making emotional pleas for the UN to hear their stories and make sure justice was done. Women wept in her arms as they recounted their experiences. “It shows the scale of the challenge as we try as a security council to find some way through that enables these poor people to go home,” Pierce said. “The sad thing is there’s nothing we can do right today that will make their distress any less.” While UN reports have already condemned the violence as both ethnic cleansing and having “all the hallmarks of genocide”, this is the first visit by the security council and holds great significance. The council has the power to refer matters to the international criminal court (ICC) and to deploy peacekeepers. Myanmar has denied all allegations of genocide and said that the violence was a legitimate response to attacks on police and military by Rohingya insurgents. The refugees also presented to the security council a list of demands, which included rehabilitation of their own land and homes; stopping the construction of the IDP camps in Rakhine state which they believe will function simply as prisons for any returning Rohingya; for the Rohingya to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar; and action to be taken by the ICC. The deputy US ambassador to the UN, Kelley Eckels Currie, described the visit as “quite overwhelming”. “Obviously the scale of this camp is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It is going to be a disaster when the rains come,” she said. Lise Gregoire-van Haaren, deputy permanent representative of the Netherlands to the UN, added: “The number of heavily traumatised women, men and children is beyond comprehension. Myanmar must cooperate so Rohingya can return in a safe, dignified and sustainable way.” The security council will meet with Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, on Monday in Dhaka before flying to Myanmar’s administrative capital Naypyidaw to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior members of the Myanmar government and military. On Tuesday, the security council will visit the Rakhine state, where the violence against the Rohingya was carried out, with the main goal of inspecting whether the displaced Rohingya can return safely. The UN has been denied access to Rakhine until now and the relationship between the organisation and Myanmar has been fraught because of the former’s description of the violence as ethnic cleansing and genocide. However, in the buildup to the security council visit, aides to Aung San Suu Kyi have been keen to publicly emphasise that the Myanmar government wants a “new relationship” with the UN, which could see the organisation’s agencies being invited back in to oversee the repatriation process.

Liverpool take a commanding 5-2 lead into the Champions League semi-final second leg in Italy where Roma must repeat their 3-0 comeback against Barcelona in the previous round to deny the Anfield club an eighth European Cup final appearance. The tie also carries similarities with the quarter-final for Jürgen Klopp’s team, who held a three-goal advantage going into the second leg at City and emerged as 2-1 victors at the Etihad Stadium after a fraught first half. That experience, Alexander-Arnold believes, should be ideal preparation for the challenge that awaits in Rome. “We are looking to go there to win and get to the final,” said the 19‑year‑old right‑back, who was deployed in midfield for the Premier League draw with Stoke City on Saturday. “We know they are going to have to come and score goals. They need to score goals to get through, the same as City. We passed the City test and hopefully we pass the test on Wednesday. “There is pace in the side and when the opposition gamble we can play behind them. The front three especially will make the runs and we will look to find them. We are going there with a job to do, to go there and win. We know it is going to be an intimidating atmosphere and that is what they will look to do, just as our fans did to them. We have to be prepared mentally and physically.” Alexander-Arnold was one of three Liverpool players to sustain a slight injury in the Stoke stalemate but he insisted his dead leg would be “OK” by Wednesday. Jordan Henderson, the captain, and the defender Joe Gomez also required treatment for ankle injuries. The teenager will make his 11th Champions League appearance if selected for the semi-final, including qualifiers, and has been alerted to the importance of that statistic since the Anfield defeat of Eusebio Di Francesco’s side. “I have had loads of messages from my mates saying that I’ve now played more Champions League games than Everton,” the boyhood Liverpool fan said. “That was quite funny, I enjoyed seeing that. I’ve equalled it and hopefully I will play on Wednesday. I guess it will be a good one to say if I am picked. You train all your life – for years – for these types of games and these chances. Everything I have done so far is to prepare me for a game like Wednesday.” Meanwhile, Roberto Firmino has committed his future to Liverpool by signing a new five-year contract, the Premier League club said on Sunday. The Brazilian forward, who joined from Hoffenheim in 2015, has made 140 appearances in all competitions and scored 50 goals, becoming a key player for the Merseyside club alongside fellow attackers Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané. Liverpool did not provide details about the 26-year-old Firmino’s new contract. “The club have taken me in an incredible way and I’ve grown a lot here with my work with the support of the whole team. I am very happy here,” Firmino said. “Everything fits in the best possible way. My team-mates are fantastic and I am very grateful to be able to play with them at this club.” “I love to play for Liverpool. The fans are excellent and fantastic in how they support us all the way. They support us throughout the games and the work they do during the match is beautiful,” Firmino added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/30/isle-of-man-abortion-law-change-could-be-weeks-away","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Isle of Man abortion law change could be weeks away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/isle-of-man-abortion-law-change-could-be-weeks-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/30/isle-of-man-abortion-law-change-could-be-weeks-away","fields":{"headline":"Isle of Man abortion law change could be weeks away","bodyText":"Change to the Isle of Man’s restrictive abortion laws could be just weeks away, the politician spearheading the reform has said. A private member’s bill going through the Tynwald, the island’s parliament, which seeks to decriminalise the procedure and make it available “on request” to women in a range of circumstances, will receive its third reading on Tuesday. Dr Alex Allinson, a GP and member of the House of Keys, the equivalent of the UK’s House of Commons, said he hoped the reading would be “just a formality” and that it would pass quickly on to the Legislative Council, the equivalent of the House of Lords, before being given royal assent. The Isle of Man is a self-governing crown dependency with a population of 88,000. Although abortion is legal in some limited circumstances, in practice it is such a difficult and lengthy process to obtain one that women instead travel to the UK and pay for the procedure at a private clinic. The cost of the abortion, travel and accommodation can be as much as £2,000. Fewer than 10 abortions are carried out on the island each year, while about 100 women travel to the UK for private abortions annually. Allinson said he hoped the passage of the bill would “right a wrong done to Isle of Man women for over 50 years”, as the island never adopted the UK’s 1967 Abortion Act. He said he hoped there would be no more delay in passing the bill: “I’d hope we’re talking weeks, and maybe months, rather than anything more.” The legislation will allow abortion up to 14 weeks on request, up to 24 weeks in cases of foetal anomaly or serious social reasons, and after 24 weeks in rare circumstances where the life of the mother or baby is at risk. Counselling must be offered before and after the procedure, and a clause allows medical professionals to opt out of delivering treatment if it clashes with their personal views. The bill legislates for “access zones” where patients would be prevented from “pavement interference” or harassment outside abortion providers. The abortion reform bill’s third reading comes two years after the island’s Campaign for Abortion Law Modernisation (Calm) was first founded. Stephanie Kelsey, from the group, told the Press Association that she hoped the new bill would be “held up as an example of progressive, yet caring legislation that other countries could copy”. She said: “It will be a really proud moment for the Isle of Man and for me personally for a Manx woman, to be able to change something which has affected so many women negatively up until now, and which could really change women’s lives and also women’s perception of how the Isle of Man cares for them and feels about them.” In recent years, the island has sought to distance itself from its conservative reputation. Homosexuality was legalised only in 1992, but under the former chief minister, Allan Bell, who is gay, the Tynwald passed an equal marriage law in the summer of 2016 that went beyond the UK’s in allowing opposite-sex couples to get civil partnerships. “By passing progressive legislation, the Isle of Man can change its image,” said Allinson. “I think a lot of people still feel that the island is slightly backwards and unusual. We’ve been late in adopting quite a lot of social policies. But the [abortion reform] bill, if passed as it is, is far more progressive than the UK’s abortion legislation. “It can make people aware that this quite small island in the middle of the Irish Sea actually is somewhere where it would be really interesting to live and work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/30/partial-knee-replacements-osteoarthritis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/partial-knee-replacements-osteoarthritis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/30/partial-knee-replacements-osteoarthritis","fields":{"headline":"Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report","bodyText":"Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts. Partial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure. Partial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong. Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be. The main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial. “The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,” said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council. “This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.” Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer. “This is an important finding,” said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. “If surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money. In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.” Ed Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. “For patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,” he said. “If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/29/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-can-be-best-team-in-history","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T17:12:43Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola: Manchester City ‘can be the best team in history’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-can-be-best-team-in-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/29/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-can-be-best-team-in-history","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola: Manchester City ‘can be the best team in history’","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola has urged his Manchester City side to establish themselves as “the best team in history” after the champions moved to within two points of Chelsea’s record tally for a season in the top flight. City’s 4-1 thrashing of West Ham took them to 93 points with three games still to play, and to within one goal of the 103 Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea rattled up in 2010. Guardiola has invited his players to target the records as extra motivation over the campaign’s last few weeks and hopes to eclipse the points haul achieved by José Mourinho’s side in 2005 in next Sunday’s game against Huddersfield. “I’m happy we will receive the Premier League trophy and [have] the chance to be the best team in history in England, with the most points,” said Guardiola. “We are going to try to do it next Sunday and get the record of 96 points at home when we receive the trophy in front of our people. “It is incredible. The numbers are a consequence of what we have done. We will try and surpass the number of goals and points but the guys have to play well and fight a lot. “We have something special in terms of confidence and we needed some targets to set in front of us. But these players like to play football. They are professionals. “They want to play and the guys on the bench want to play. They enjoy training and playing, like amateurs. They want to play for something, too. So, once we won the Premier League, the target became the numbers. It’s good to see something to fight for, to achieve something.” Guardiola reiterated his desire to add “maybe one, maybe two, no more than that” to his squad over the summer before a title defence and reminded his players they can still improve as individuals and a collective. “Football is not a finished business: be more clinical,” he added. “The last five or 10 minutes of the first half here were not good. At 4-1 we weren’t hungry enough to score another one. There were individual mistakes, our full-backs not controlling the players inside, so there are many aspects we can improve. If it was perfect, I would not be here next season. I would be done. The level of consistency was high this season, yes, but we are still a young team. Our strikers have an average age of 22. “For 20 guys in our squad, this will be the first time they’ve won the Premier League. That’s why it’s good. Recent history shows Premier League teams have not been able to defend their title. That is our challenge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/local-elections-political-engagement-voter-turnout-polly-toynbee","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"These local elections matter: they could send a shockwave to Westminster | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/local-elections-political-engagement-voter-turnout-polly-toynbee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/30/local-elections-political-engagement-voter-turnout-polly-toynbee","fields":{"headline":"These local elections matter: they could send a shockwave to Westminster","bodyText":"The streets of London are not ablaze with posters or other signs there are local elections on this week, as in 150 councils around the country. Yet in a surprisingly optimistic report out today, Hansard says intention to vote is at an all-time high of 62%, with voter engagement with politics higher than ever. But that determination to vote may be stymied by an alarming fall in voter registration. According to Equifax analysis, 197 local authorities saw a drop in the last year: Newcastle down 7%, Mole Valley down 5%. The shift to individual voter registration risked knocking out the young, students no longer registered by universities, renters and ethnic minorities. The voter ID pilot this week will show whether yet another gerrymander in the voting system deters those – more likely to be Labour – arriving at polling stations without passports or driving licences. People may be more politically engaged, but Hansard doesn’t find them enthusiastic: satisfaction with the system of governing Britain is down seven points to 29%. So it might be rage not optimism that drives more people to vote, emotions stirred by the great Brexit rift and by austerity biting. Determination to vote against Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn may be what drives them to the polls: our monstrous election system confronts voters with a harsher binary choice than for many years – and both parties are split. People vote in locals on national politics, sadly less on the quality of their local council. The very best and worst councils are swept in and out by the state of politics at Westminster, a brutal fact for the undervalued aeons of time councillors give, taking more brickbats than bravos. The iron law says governments lose council seats mid-term, oppositions surge. This time, blame properly belongs to Westminster. No surprise that Labour is predicted to gain, with a 40% council funding cut by Tory chancellors demanding “more for less”, devolving the axe so councillors do the dirty work of austerity. As Prof Tony Travers points out, newly arrived Momentum councillors will confront the same miserable choices with little leeway: already cut to the bone, do they cut child protection or old people’s care? The wonder is that anyone stands as a councillor at all when political choice has been so drained by the savagery of the cuts. It’s only mildly comical that the Tory shires are first to collapse, Northamptonshire first with others hot on their heels. To Westminster, locals are just an indicator of the state of the parties. Is Theresa May doing badly or very badly? Is the Corbyn tide powerful enough to wash up to the steps of No 10? Nuffield College’s Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, local election gurus, predict Labour to win 200 seats, Tories to lose 75, Lib Dems to gain 30. We wait to see what damage Windrush does the Tories, with 75% of ethnic minority voters expected to vote Labour. Or what harm Labour’s inexplicable failure to combat antisemitism does. Anyone venturing a guess is a fool: wise commentators have thrown away their crystal balls. Party spinners are glumming down, energetically rubbishing their prospects to manage expectations. Prof Philip Cowley of Queen Mary College says, “Labour is set for its best results in 40 years.” But those expecting Labour to capture Tory flagships – Barnet, Wandsworth, Westminster – even Kensington and Chelsea, set the bar high. Outside London, Labour could take Tory Trafford, Swindon and Plymouth, but much depends on who captures Ukip’s 163 seats. The Tories pretend they’ll be happy just to cling on to Bexley. Labour’s humble pitch by shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne is, “Any gains on top of where we were in 2014 would be quite an achievement.” But he points to the open goals: cuts to NHS, police, schools, stagnant wages, dismal housebuilding. He adds a dishonest boast: “Residents living in Labour council areas pay considerably lower council tax bills compared to those living in Tory controlled councils.” But that’s only because Labour represents lower value property areas. And why, yet again, is Labour talking down tax when a future Labour government can repair national damage by persuading people taxes must rise – and not just for the top 5% and corporations. If not now, when dare they make the case for taxing the top half more and for radically reforming council tax? Labour could risk more boldness, because the Tory Brexit civil war is about to turn bloody. Theresa May delays the Commons vote on the customs union to its limit, but the crunch is coming. She keeps proclaiming a red line she cannot hold. Rees-Moggites make bloodcurdling threats that they will decapitate her if she takes one step towards compromise. Cabinet walkouts are predicted, Boris Johnson eager to challenge. A Brexit red mist threatens to overcome the party that traditionally put power ahead of all else. Brexit overlays and confuses these local elections too, all political life now refracted and fractured by that great divide. Many EU citizens denied a referendum ballot will be able to vote this time: will they use it to hit back? Will there be a new cohort of Windrush-energised ethnic-minority voters? If so, Labour should sweep the board. But they have most to lose if predicted gains fail. Despite the financial handcuffs, it matters who runs your council: Labour cities are better run than ever, with a higher calibre of leaders than I’ve ever known, from Newcastle and Liverpool to Manchester, Leeds and London boroughs. These elections matter for the sake of all who rely on good council services, above all the most vulnerable. A plummeting Tory vote would send a salutary shockwave up to Westminster: councils can take no more austerity. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/29/north-korea-denuclearization-john-bolton-mike-pompeo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T16:58:57Z","webTitle":"North Korea must take 'irreversible' steps to denuclearization, US warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/north-korea-denuclearization-john-bolton-mike-pompeo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/29/north-korea-denuclearization-john-bolton-mike-pompeo","fields":{"headline":"North Korea must take 'irreversible' steps to denuclearization, US warns","bodyText":"North Korea will have to show concrete and tangible evidence it has made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons before any move is made to ease pressure on the regime, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Sunday. With a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un potentially as close as three weeks away, Bolton warned that no progress would be made without verifiable evidence of Pyongyang’s commitment to complete and “irreversible” denuclearization. “What we want to see from them is evidence that it’s real and not just rhetoric,” he told CBS’ Face the Nation. The famously hawkish Bolton took a notably less hardline approach than was reflected in his many disparaging remarks towards North Korea before he was brought into the White House earlier this month. In one typical comment on Fox News he made what he called a joke: “How do you know the North Korean regime is lying – answer, their lips are moving.” Now Bolton is striking a more nuanced position. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, he stressed that the US had made no commitment to remove its military presence from the Korean peninsula and said: “There’s nobody in the Trump administration who’s starry-eyed about what’s happening here.” He went on to say that if North Korea were willing to allow full and complete disclosure of its nuclear weapons programme coupled with international verification, “things could move quickly”. Hopes of a breakthrough in dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons at a Trump-Kim summit have risen in the wake of fast-moving events. Details emerging from the office of South Korean president Moon Jae-in following his historic face-to-face encounter with Kim suggest the North Korean leader offered to allow foreign inspectors and journalists to witness nuclear decommissioning ahead of the Trump summit. “If we maintain frequent meetings and build trust with the United States and receive promises for an end to the war and a non-aggression treaty, then why would [we] need to live in difficulty by keeping our nuclear weapons?” Kim was reported to have said. The Trump administration is remaining noncommittal about such dramatic posturing from Kim, as the US tries to walk a hazardous path that both pursues a breakthrough and remains aware of broken promises made in the past. In his first interview as secretary of state, former CIA director Mike Pompeo characterized the current flurry of diplomatic activity as a “real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we could achieve it”. Pompeo spoke to ABC’s This Week from Saudi Arabia, giving generally stilted answers and bringing the interview to an abrupt close after facing questions on US strategy. He declined to reveal intelligence on North Korean nuclear capabilities and said repeatedly: “This administration has its eyes wide open.” He added: “We know the history, we know the risks. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we’re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.” Earlier this year, Pompeo had a secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, lasting more than an hour. He told ABC it had been a “good conversation. We talked about serious matters, on the hardest issues that face our two countries.” Those issues included the US desire for the release of the three Americans still detained in North Korea. “I talked about getting the release of the American detainees, then we talked about what a complete, irreversible mechanism [for nuclear denuclearization] might look like,” Pompeo said. Bolton went into further details about subjects that Trump will want to raise should the summit with Kim go ahead at a time and location still to be determined. North Korean ballistic missile programs, biological and chemical weapons programs, and the “abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years” would all be on the list, Bolton said. Despite the reticence on the part of both Pompeo and Bolton to go into details about the precise US gameplan, top administration figures were outspoken on one point: all praise for current extraordinary events should be bestowed on Trump. The most passionate proponent of that idea is Trump himself. At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night he told the crowd: “I had one of the fake news groups this morning saying: ‘What do you think President Trump had to do with it?’ I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?” In response, there were chants of “Nobel! Nobel!”, in reference to the Nobel peace prize. Bolton made the same point on Sunday to CBS, albeit in more measured terms: “I think it’s clear we’re here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea. Economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/29/eu-rule-could-leave-theatres-dark","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T16:58:31Z","webTitle":"EU rule could leave theatres dark | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/29/eu-rule-could-leave-theatres-dark","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/29/eu-rule-could-leave-theatres-dark","fields":{"headline":"EU rule could leave theatres dark","bodyText":"I am writing to you as the president of the Association of Lighting Designers, and as the Founder of Theatre Projects, an international theatre design company that for 60 years has been at the forefront of British theatre technology, responsible for the stage design of the National Theatre, and for over 1,500 theatre projects in 80 counties. I have been a lighting designer for over 60 years. British theatre now faces an extraordinary crisis. On Saturday 7 May consultation on an amazing EU draft regulation – the Energy Directorate’s Eco-design Working Plan 2016-19 – will close. If confirmed, in 2020 virtually all stage lighting equipment used throughout the British Theatre and entertainment industry will be rendered obsolete and the lamps within that create the light be unobtainable. British theatre and British lighting design leads the world. This month alone on Broadway, two productions, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, lit by Neil Austin, and Angels in America, lit by Paule Constable, have attracted universal critical acclaim. This draft regulation not only bans incandescent lamps, but virtually all the discharge and LED light sources that have been developed in recent years to reduce the theatre’s carbon footprint. This is a very real crisis. No existing entertainment lighting equipment presently meets the new theoretical power requirement. If, in 18 months, such equipment were to be invented – an aim apparently pushing beyond the boundaries of physics today – it would certainly cost as much as five to 10 times the equipment it replaces. This is, therefore, a potential financial disaster at best, and an artistic and practical catastrophe for every theatre in the land. The eco-design plan must exempt entertainment lighting from this mistaken regulation. The alternative may be dark and bankrupt theatres everywhere. Never again will the glories of our stages be seen in a proper light.

Bronze, a City player until last summer, scored the only goal in either leg of this semi-final with a delightful right-foot volley. With her pace, power and technique, she epitomised the qualities of her new team and the Berwick-upon-Tweed native looked very much at home in Europe’s dominant club side. For the English team, however, there was a sense of anticlimax. A disciplined performance in the first leg had meant this match began with the tie still goalless. City set out to contain their opponents once more here, the playmaker Isobel Christiansen assuming a false nine role. But while Nick Cushing’s players never lacked commitment, they failed to force a single save from Sarah Bouhaddi in 90 minutes. “I asked them to play the game of their lives and I’m really proud of the players,” said the City manager. “With the amount of talent and the unlimited resources Lyon have, the gap between us off the pitch is big. On the pitch in the two ties, we lost it in one moment. Apart from that I thought the tie was even. We defended well and I thought our build-up in both games was exceptional, the best of both teams. But when you have attackers like they do, you know you’re going to be under pressure and today I think they took their chance.” That chance came in the 17th minute and arrived at the end of a flowing piece of football. Lyon wrestled control in midfield and shuffled the ball to Camille Abily, who had the vision to spot Amel Majri’s run on the left. Abily lofted a pass over City’s right-back, Abbie McManus, and into the path of Majri, who crossed immediately to the far post and where Bronze was lurking. The England international drove at the ball with her right foot, bending the shot beyond Karen Bardsley and inside the far post. The home side did not cut City open many times but their dominance was real. Lyon should have had at least one more goal in the first half. Abily saw a 25-yard shot deflected on to a post by Jennifer Beattie and Majri had a fierce effort blocked by McManus. Steph Houghton was forced into a last-ditch sliding tackle to stop Bronze from running the length of the pitch with the ball. Finally, with a minute to go, City surrendered possession on the edge of their own box but Lyon’s top scorer, Ada Hegerberg, was unable to convert when one on one with Bardsley. Dominant physically and tactically, Lyon also had a distinct advantage in terms of pace, which limited City’s effectiveness on the counterattack. In the opening half this was particularly galling for the visitors, who were unable to move the ball far enough up the pitch for their creative players to operate in the areas they could be effective. Christiansen, an effective schemer, was left to chase down balls thrown over the top. City failed to create a chance of note in the first half, yet they went in at the interval knowing that an unanswered second-half goal would see them through to the final. For a brief passage around the hour mark, they looked like they might commit more bodies forward. In the 59th minute Jill Scott took aim from 25 yards but her effort drifted a yard over the bar. It was to be City’s only notable effort on goal. With 25 minutes remaining, Cushing abandoned his sense of caution and introduced Nadia Nadim to the field, the winger Claire Emslie following later. But it had no effect. Lyon continued to hold the game in the palm of their hand and Hegerberg sliced wide when presented with another showdown against Bardsley. Lyon, four-times Champions League winners, are the model for City to follow. The English side have now lost to their French counterparts in consecutive seasons but Cushing remained upbeat that next time the result might be different. “What we should take from today is belief and confidence‚“ he said. “This is a young team. It needs to improve and we’ll do the work to do that. We think we can go on and win this trophy, it’s just going to take a bit of time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/02/half-scot-half-iraqi-malmo-immigration-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"I’m half Scot, half Iraqi.

But in Malmö in Sweden, I felt I belonged","bodyText":"“Hajji”, the man bellows jovially to his colleague at a fruit and vegetable stall, using a name generally given to Muslims who have made the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The stall is one of many that line the market place in Möllevången, a diverse neighbourhood near the centre of Malmö, in southern Sweden. I had not heard of Möllevången before, but was fascinated by the area from the moment I stepped off the train from Denmark with my Scottish mother and Iraqi father, to meet with my dad’s cousin and family living there. After spending seven years in Abu Dhabi as a writer and editor, I thought that I had left the Middle East behind me when I moved to Copenhagen in September. But my first impression of Möllevången, especially its market square, was that it could well have been in the Middle East – aside from the grey skies and cold March weather, that is. On the streets near Triangeln train station and in the cafes dotted around the nearby square, most people speak Arabic. Shops and supermarkets carry signs in the language too. For any outsider, it is a surprising sight. But not for the people who have grown up here. Malmö is Sweden’s third largest city. About 43% of its 328,000 population has a foreign background, many from the Arab world, some having arrived in the area decades ago. There are streets lined with currency exchange shops called Babylon Exchange, Al Jazeera Exchange, or Denar Exchange. At the Bagdad supermarket, butchers chat with customers in Arabic as they chop and pack up meat that is all halal. Shoppers wind their way through busy stalls, passing fridges full of sujuc (a dry, spicy sausage) and flatbread, as well as shelves full of baklawa – bite-sized sweets made of filo pastry, nuts and honey or syrup – and other Middle Eastern desserts. In one corner, a small stand distributes free copies of an Arabic newspaper. The owner of the supermarket is a Kurdish man from Baghdad. I meet his 26-year-old son, Amir, who tells me the family, who moved to Sweden in 1991, feel firmly established in Malmö. He says it was “ hard in the beginning” for his father, “but now he’s used to the whole mentality”, by which he means the Swedish way of life. Now, Amir says, his father feels both Iraqi and Swedish “at the same time”. Between some of the older and more recent migrants, I hear differing views on how groups have managed to integrate with Swedish society. Perceptions seem to vary with successive waves of arrivals. One Iraqi man who arrived in 1989 with his wife tells me racism is “an open issue” which is made worse if the newly arrived don’t adapt to local customs. He suggests that recent refugees react differently from earlier ones because they have been shaped by crises in their homelands, countries racked by conflict or ruled by dictators. Another says it was easier to integrate into Swedish society decades ago, when there wasn’t such a large mixture of nationalities, and with migrants now concentrated in certain neighbourhoods. “Foreigners lived among Swedes more, so they acted more like them,” he says. Bashar, a 34-year-old coffee-shop owner who arrived from Baghdad as a teenager, says that he is unhappy with how overtly religious some newly arrived migrants can be. He explains that years of living in Sweden have changed him: “I keep my religion at home. I don’t want to show it to other people, I don’t want to speak about it.” It irks him when people ask: “What religion are you? Do you go to the mosque?” He believes that people moving to Europe from vastly different cultures must learn to adapt. I hear similar comments from 32-year-old Mohammad, who held a government job in Iraq from 2010 to 2015 before emigrating because of the war and now works at the Möllevången fruit and vegetable market. “I see things and I do things I couldn’t see or do in the Middle East. I’m a guy, I want to go out with a bunch of guys and girls, go to the pub to drink or smoke. In the Middle East that’s like a forbidden thing.” Mirna, a mother of four whose family moved from Lebanon in the 1980s to escape from the civil war, tells me she worries about insecurity. “I used to go out without watching my back. Now you have to look everywhere. It’s not the same.” Still, she says: “My blood is in Lebanon, but I love Sweden.” “The first thing to note about Möllevången is that it is different from other neighbourhoods. It’s not just a poor immigrant neighbourhood but also an inner city neighbourhood with plenty of nightclubs and bars, so it’s one of a kind in Malmö, in a way,” says Manne Gerell, a lecturer at Malmö University. “There is plenty of violence, most of it related to nightlife and entertainment districts. But some of the violence is possibly related to immigration, or at least youth gangs mostly made up of people with a background in other countries.” Sweden is the EU member state that took in the largest number of refugees per capita in 2015, at the peak of the refugee crisis. The country has been famously known for its welcoming attitude towards those fleeing war, persecution and poverty. Until recently it had the most generous immigration laws in Europe. But that has changed, with legislation introduced in 2016 to make family reunification more difficult for recent immigrants. In the runup to a general election in September the far-right Sweden Democrats party, in opposition, has been busy linking public concern about rising crime rates to the large increase in the number of immigrants. Möllevången is a microcosm of how people struggle to build a new life for themselves and also feel at home although they have been uprooted. It is a place where Europe’s growing diversity can be both critiqued and celebrated. I’ve never been to Iraq, but spending a few days in Möllevången offered an unexpected sense of belonging. I may only speak basic Arabic (and that with a Glasgow twang), but coming to a new place where strangers seemed genuinely happy when I told them that my father is from Baghdad, and being able to share stories with them, was only possible as a result of immigration. • Zaineb Al Hassani is a freelance writer based in Copenhagen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/29/greece-reinforces-land-border-with-turkey-to-stem-flow-of-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T15:16:21Z","webTitle":"Greece reinforces land border with Turkey to stem flow of migrants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/greece-reinforces-land-border-with-turkey-to-stem-flow-of-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/29/greece-reinforces-land-border-with-turkey-to-stem-flow-of-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Greece reinforces land border with Turkey to stem flow of migrants","bodyText":"Greece has rushed to reinforce its land border with Turkey as fears mount over a sharp rise in the number of refugees and migrants crossing the frontier. Police patrols were augmented as local authorities said the increase in arrivals had become reminiscent of the influx of migrants on the Aegean islands close to the Turkish coast. About 2,900 people crossed the land border in April, by far surpassing the number who arrived by sea, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said. The figure represents half of the total number of crossings during the whole of 2017. Speaking from the frontier town of Orestiada, the local mayor, Dimitris Mavrides, told the Guardian: “Our reception facilities are overwhelmed and things are on the verge of spinning out of control. Far more are coming than are actually being registered. “The government has just sent 120 extra police, but they are temporary and simply not enough. Frontex also has to intervene,” he added, referring to Europe’s border and coastguard agency. The area’s sole reception centre has capacity to process 240 people. In the absence of accommodation, authorities are placing newcomers, including children, in inappropriate police detention facilities where access to interpreters and other services are severely restricted. “Some of those in police detention have been held for more than three months,” UNHCR said in a statement. “Conditions are dismal … the hundreds of people kept include pregnant women, very young children and people in need of medical and psychosocial care.” It was imperative that mobile reception units be set up to expedite the process of identification, and that unaccompanied minors should be transferred to safe shelters, the agency said. Greece’s deputy minister for citizen protection, Nikos Toskas, said contingency plans were in place. “We are totally prepared. There is no need for panic,” the retired general said in a telephone interview. “Everything is under control.” Fears are growing, however, that the new wave could signal the start of a summer emergency. Most of those who have entered overland in recent months by traversing the Evros river are refugees described as mainly Kurds fleeing the Afrin region of northern Syria following Turkey’s military offensive against the enclave. “We don’t know exactly what has caused this change, but we’re worried that as the weather improves and water levels go down, more will brave the journey because the river will be easier to cross,” said Ruben Cano, who heads the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Greece. “We’re sending a mission to the area this week. We have relief stocks of blankets, sleeping mats and tents. The government has plans to reopen former camps and expand the capacity of those that exist but experience has told us it may not scale up fast enough.” The abrupt rise reflects a switch in tactics by people smugglers circumventing the controversial agreement the EU struck with Turkey in a bid to stem migration flows at the height of the crisis when more than a million people entered the bloc through Greece. Under the deal, signed in March 2016, migrants and refugees reaching eastern Aegean islands must remain in situ until asylum requests are processed through a system that is notoriously slow, or face deportation. The land border does not fall under the agreement and is said to be easier to traverse. “In a boat it can take as little as three minutes to cross and is far cheaper,” said Mavrides. “They are coming precisely because it is not part of the deal and because word has got out the situation on the islands is dramatic. If they get here and are processed, they are free to go anywhere on the mainland. We have four buses a day to Athens and Thessaloniki and they are full.” Officials in Greece’s leftist-led government say privately that they are dealing with a timebomb. The EU-Turkey accord has drastically reduced the number of arrivals since the record highs of 2015, but registrations have risen noticeably this year. The increase has heightened tensions on the islands, which are home to roughly 15,000 of the 60,000 migrants and refugees in Greece. Clashes erupted on Lesbos this month between Greek extremists and asylum seekers protesting against their inability to move to the mainland after the country’s highest administrative court said it was illegal to impose geographic restrictions on migrants. “Lesbos has 8,095 migrants and refugees when the corresponding number last year was 3,050,” said the north Aegean’s regional governor, Christiana Kalogirou, of the island that has borne the brunt of the influx. “The islands are like a cauldron ready to boil over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/29/leicester-city-claude-puel-admits-players-look-distracted","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Leicester players appear distracted, concedes embattled Claude Puel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/leicester-city-claude-puel-admits-players-look-distracted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/29/leicester-city-claude-puel-admits-players-look-distracted","fields":{"headline":"Leicester players appear distracted, concedes embattled Claude Puel","bodyText":"Claude Puel has conceded that Leicester City’s players have appeared distracted over recent weeks, with results tailing off alarmingly as the Frenchman seeks to convince the club hierarchy that he should oversee a summer overhaul of the squad. Leicester remain in the top half but the 5-0 thrashing at Crystal Palace on Saturday left Puel with only four wins in his past 18 league games amid growing unease at the club over the 56-year-old’s management style. The Guardian reported this month that players had been left increasingly bemused by his chopping and changing of the team, and frustrated at a perceived lack of intensity to training, with communication apparently an issue. Certainly an opportunity to build on Puel’s impressive initial impact after taking over in October has been passed up, with a top-seven finish and Europa League qualification now out of reach. “I took over this club in a difficult situation, 14th in the table,” Puel said. “I try to give more opportunities to players to give a good response. But, at the end of the season, of course we have some difficulties to finish with a good concentration, a good focus. “I know it’s difficult and perhaps the players have the World Cup in their heads or different things. My only concern is my team and my squad. We deserved the last result and it is important to correct this. There remains three important games for us: West Ham, Arsenal, Tottenham. Two great teams to finish and West Ham, also, at home. We need a strong reaction, to try together to give a good response.” Leicester are expected to invest heavily again this summer having recruited Adrien Silva, Vicente Iborra, Kelechi Iheanacho and Harry Maguire last year. There will be an overhaul of the playing staff, with Riyad Mahrez’s future in doubt and up to six others likely to move on. Maguire, who cost £17m from Hull City last summer, has suggested the fault for the recent dip in form lies more with the players. Asked if the team were still behind the manager, he replied: “Yes, definitely. He puts us out in shape. At the end of the day it’s 11 players that go on the pitch to perform, and the 11 who went out on Saturday didn’t perform.” Leicester will await news on the severity of the hamstring injury sustained by Wilfred Ndidi at Selhurst Park, with the 21-year-old’s participation for Nigeria at the World Cup finals this summer cast into doubt after he pulled up early in the second half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/29/dusan-tadic-southampton-mark-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Dusan Tadic urges Southampton to give manager Mark Hughes a longer deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/dusan-tadic-southampton-mark-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/29/dusan-tadic-southampton-mark-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Dusan Tadic urges Southampton to give manager Mark Hughes a longer deal","bodyText":"Dusan Tadic has urged the Southampton board to retain Mark Hughes as manager beyond the end of the season after the club improved their survival chances by beating Bournemouth. Tadic, who scored twice in Southampton’s first home win since November, has credited Hughes with galvanising the club since his appointment on a short-term contract in March. A mutual decision between the Welshman and the club hierarchy is expected to take place after the final game of the season, at home to Manchester City, one of Hughes’s former clubs, as to whether he will extend his stay. If he keeps Southampton in the top flight he is set to earn a survival bonus of almost £1m. Hughes has delivered a more hardline approach to the squad since replacing Mauricio Pellegrino and last week ordered Sofiane Boufal to train with the under-23s after an altercation during the league defeat by Chelsea. Meanwhile the £19.3m club-record signing, Guido Carrillo, who arrived from Monaco in January – before Pellegrino’s dismissal – was again absent from the 18-man match‑day squad that gained their sixth league win of the season on Saturday, which leaves Southampton a point behind 17th-placed Swansea. Tadic believes his team need to garner four more points from three matches – against Everton, Swansea and Manchester City – to retain their top-flight status. Asked if he would like Hughes to be handed the long-term job, the Serbia midfielder replied: “I think he needs to stay in Southampton because he is a great coach and he’s a coach for Southampton – everyone can see that. It would be great for Southampton if he stayed. The most important thing now is that we stay in the league but he’s great for Southampton. “When the new coach and his assistants came we did great in the training sessions, we touched the ball more, we felt immediately sharper. I feel sharper myself. For this we need to say thank you to them because they put a lot of great training on the pitch, every time; passing drills, possession, games . “Everything is short and sharp and you can see that the whole team is looking sharper and quicker. “He’s made a big difference. He’s a great coach and he was a great player. He’s a good guy and I think his assistants, Mark [Bowen] and Eddie [Niedzwiecki], they are great and they are helping us every day with advice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/30/reality-automation-terrifying","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Ten million British jobs could be gone in 15 years.

No one knows what happens next","bodyText":"Plenty of people may not have heard of the retail firm Shop Direct. Its roots go back to the distant heyday of catalogue shopping, and two giants of that era, Littlewoods and Great Universal Stores. Now it is the parent company behind the online fashion brand Very and the reinvented Littlewoods.com. All this may sound innocuous enough. But in two areas of Greater Manchester, Shop Direct is newly notorious. Until now, what the modern corporate vernacular calls “fulfilment” – in other words, packing up people’s orders and seeing to returns – has been dealt with at three Shop Direct sites, in Chadderton and Shaw, near Oldham, and in Little Hulton, three miles south of Bolton. But the company now has plans to transfer all such tasks to a “fully automated”, 500,000 sq ft “distribution and returns centre” located in a logistics park in the east Midlands. The compulsory consultation period begins tomorrow, and the shopworkers’ union Usdaw and local politicians are up in arms: if it happens in full, the move will entail the loss of 1,177 full-time posts, and 815 roles currently performed by agency workers; on the new site there will only be jobs for about 500 people. At a time when apparently low unemployment figures blind people to the fragility and insecurity of so much work, the story is a compelling straw in the wind: probably the starkest example I have yet seen of this era of automation, and the disruption and pain it threatens. Every time a self-service checkout trills and beeps and issues the deathly cry “unexpected item in the bagging area”, it points to the future. So does the increasing hollowing-out of British high streets. But much of the looming wave of automation in retail and so-called logistics is hidden in the increasingly vast distribution centres, and the research and development departments of online giants. Inevitably, no one employed by these companies is comfortable talking about an imminent decline in human employment across the sectors in which they operate, and the accelerated growth of individual firms – exemplified by Amazon, which now employs 500,000 people around the world, up from 20,000 a decade ago – gives them plenty of cover. But the evidence is plain: the buying, selling, and handling of goods is rapidly becoming less and less labour intensive. Carl Benedikt Frey, an automation specialist at the Oxford Martin School, says: “Retail is one industry in which employment is likely to vanish, as it has done in manufacturing, mining and agriculture.” In 2017 an exhaustive report he co-authored showed that 80% of jobs in “transportation, warehousing and logistics” are now susceptible to automation. In both these connected fields, the replacement of human labour by technology is driven by the e-commerce that shifts retailing from town and city centres to the vast spaces where machines can take over all the picking and packing – and in the UK, shopping habits have obviously moved hugely in that direction. The extent to which this makes jobs vulnerable is obvious: the share of total British employment in the wholesale and retail trade towers over all other sectors of the economy, accounting for 15% of UK workers, as against only 7.5% in manufacturing. Across the economy as a whole, a report last year by PricewaterhouseCoopers said that the jobs of more than 10 million workers will be at high risk from automation over the next 15 years. Technology once considered expensive and exotic is already here. Around the world, Amazon now uses about 100,000 “robot drives” to move goods around its distribution centres. The warehouse within the new John Lewis “campus” near Milton Keynes has been described as a “deserted hall of clacks and hums”. It employs 860 robots and keeps the human element of shifting stuff around to an absolute minimum. Last year Credit Suisse looked at the patents the online supermarket Ocado had recently filed and concluded that the company – which, among other things, is working on driverless delivery vehicles – was pushing into “an automated future” in which half of its staff could be gone within a decade (even now, it operates a much less labour-intensive service than its rivals). And so to the really terrifying part. Given that it will be disproportionately concentrated on low-wage, low-skill employment, this wave of automation inevitably threatens to worsen inequality. There are whole swathes of Britain where, as employment in heavy industry receded, up went retail parks and distribution centres. In such places as south Wales and South Yorkshire, the result has been an almost surreal, circular economy in which people work for big retail businesses to earn money to spend in other retail businesses. What, you can only wonder, will happen next? If we are to avoid the worst, radical plans will be necessary. The insecurity that automation brings will soon demand the comprehensive replacement of a benefits system that does almost nothing to encourage people to acquire new skills, and works on the expectation that it can shove anyone who’s jobless into exactly the kind of work that’s under threat. In many places, the disruption of the job market will make the issue of dependable and secure housing – if not questions of basic subsistence – even more urgent. In both schools and adult education, the system will somehow have to pull as many people as it can away from the most susceptible parts of the economy, and maximise the numbers skilled enough to work in its higher tiers – which, given the current awful state of technology and computing teaching, looks like a very big ask. On the political right, there is no serious interest in anything resembling this kind of agenda: one of the many tragedies of Tory austerity is that it blitzed the chances of any meaningful responses to automation just as its reality became clear; and Conservatives still seem either asleep, or chained to the kind of laissez-faire Thatcherism that offers nothing beyond the usual insistence that the market is not to be bucked. Some of them should read an overlooked report by the independent Future of Work commission convened last year by the Labour deputy leader Tom Watson – spun with the Panglossian claim that “robots can set us free”, though a lot of its analysis was spot on. It contained bracing predictions about the future of such “low-skill, low-pay sectors” as transport, storage and retail, and warned that “Britain’s former industrial heartlands in the Midlands and north are more vulnerable … because of a concentration of jobs in risk sectors. So, without policy intervention, the technological revolution is set to exacerbate regional inequalities.” There are signs that such things are now on the radar of senior Labour politicians – as with Jeremy Corbyn’s acknowledgment last year that automation “could make so much of contemporary work redundant”. But beyond rather dreamy talk of “putting the ownership and control of the robots in the hands of those who work with them” and commendable plans for a national education service, not nearly enough flesh has been put on these bones – perhaps because the conversation about automation is often still stuck in the utopian wilds of a work-free, “post-capitalist” future. What does the left have to say to all those Shop Direct workers in Shaw, Chadderton and Little Hulton? How will it allay the fears of the thousands of other people likely to be faced with the same experience? Put another way, if the future is already here, what now? • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/29/guardian-redesign-tabloid-readers-response-paul-chadwick","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T13:41:00Z","webTitle":"Three months on, the tabloid Guardian is still evolving | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/guardian-redesign-tabloid-readers-response-paul-chadwick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/guardian-redesign-tabloid-readers-response-paul-chadwick","fields":{"headline":"Three months on, the tabloid Guardian is still evolving","bodyText":"In the three months since the Guardian redesigned and reshaped to tabloid size, readers have sent about 2,400 pieces of feedback. Broadly, the response has been positive. Most readers accepted the change as partly a necessary cost-saving measure in the face of difficult market conditions for newspapers. Expressions of loyalty towards the Guardian were a tonic. “Don’t worry, dedicated supporters will keep your GREAT PAPER going,” wrote a devotee. At the beginning, 15 January, reflex responses – pro and con – had comparable intensity. But they soon gave way to a flow of thoughtful and detailed emails and letters. Some who welcomed the smaller size also focused on how the redesign had perhaps moved, or for space reasons dropped, aspects of the paper which they enjoyed. Specific puzzles or weather details or listings were missed, but the overall response to the layout and pacing of the paper was approving. Some early resisters warmed to the changes, others said they had adapted. I put the main themes of readers’ responses to the designers and to the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. She is open to considering changes, within constraints of space and cost. Wrote one reader: “The main body of your excellent newspaper in my hands has developed migratory tendencies.” Readers commented on how they disassemble the paper and share parts of it for simultaneous reading among members of their household, or take only one section with them on the bus or train. The habits of many are matched by the stapled G2 and the well-received Journal section that can be removed whole from the centre of the main paper. Some lament that sport is no longer separate. A frequent request was for the main paper to be stapled, but the production process and the deadlines of the operation do not permit it. I am told the initial boost that novelty and promotion gave to newsstand sales has eased back now, but subscriptions since the change have grown strongly. A highly visible innovation was the introduction of patches of yellow. Adverse response was significant, and usage is being cut back. Viner says the technique will be used judiciously and “the randomness will stop”. Although various readers perceived the body type as smaller, the ink less intense and the paper itself perhaps different, I am assured that the font size of the body type is fractionally larger and the ink and paper are the same. The change of masthead drew attention, partly because some readers thought it didn’t draw enough attention to itself on newsstands among its competitors. Watch though, it is evolving.

The US president staged the event in Washington Township, north of Detroit, on the same night comedian Michelle Wolf shocked the audience at the annual White House correspondents’ dinner in Washington with a brutal routine that roasted Trump and leading members of his administration. Trump skipped the dinner for a second year running, a fact he emphasised in fundraising emails and in his speech to the rally. “Is this better than that phony Washington White House correspondents thing?” he asked the crowd. ‘Is this more fun?’ I could be up there tonight smiling like I love when they’re hitting you, shot after shot.” “These people, they hate your guts,” he continued, referring to the press. “And you know, you got to smile. And if you don’t smile, they say, ‘He was terrible. He couldn’t take it.’ And if you do smile, they’ll say, ‘What was he smiling about?’ You know, there’s no win.” Wolf was particularly savage about Trump and press secretary Sarah Sanders. But on Sunday morning, the president’s duly tweeted criticism of the comedian and the dinner was relatively mild. “While Washington, Michigan, was a big success,” Trump wrote, “Washington DC, just didn’t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust … the so-called comedian really ‘bombed’. [Fox News host Greg Gutfeld] should host next year!” Ahead of his rally, Trump said in a fundraising pitch he did not want to be stuck in a room “with a bunch of fake news liberals who hate me”. He would rather spend the evening “with my favourite deplorables”, he said. During the 2016 campaign, Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton told supporters at a private fundraiser half of Trump supporters could be lumped into a “basket of deplorables … racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it”. Clinton liked the line and repeated it often, according to the New York Times reporter Amy Chozick in her new book Chasing Hillary. But it was gleefully co-opted by Trump and his supporters. Michigan was one of the northern “rust belt” states that helped give Trump his surprising victory, which he took in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3m ballots. Macomb County, the site of Saturday’s rally, is among the predominantly white counties known as a base for “Reagan Democrats” – blue-collar voters who abandoned the Democrats for Ronald Reagan but who can be movable. Barack Obama won the county twice, then Trump carried it by more than 11%. As the 2018 midterms approach, Trump has been urging voters to advance his agenda. In Washington Township on Saturday, he pointed to Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan as a Democrat who needed to be voted out. “Debbie Stabenow is one of the leaders for weak borders and letting people in. I don’t know how she gets away with it,” Trump said. “A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It’s very simple. It’s also a vote for much higher taxes.” Trump added: “And you people just keep putting her back again and again and again. It’s your fault.” Earlier, the president tweeted a call for the resignation of Tester, over the Montana senator’s role in the failed nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. At his rally, Trump railed against allegations that were aired by Tester against Jackson. “I know things about Tester that I could say, too,” he said. “And if I said ’em, he’d never be elected again.” Trump promoted key policies: appointing conservative judges, building a wall on the southern border, ending “sanctuary cities” for undocumented migrants and protecting tax cuts passed by Congress. He also took credit for warming relations between North and South Korea. Trump repeatedly weaved back into immigration and his support for a border wall, threatening: “If we don’t get border security, we’re going to have no choice, we’ll close down the country.” On Sunday morning, he tweeted a familiar unverified boast about the size of the crowd. “Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan. The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in, I cherish you … and will be back!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/new-beers-made-from-leftover-bread-marks-and-spencer-adnams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T15:56:44Z","webTitle":"Raise a toast!

New beers made from leftover bread help to cut food waste","bodyText":"Beer and sandwiches have gone together ever since Harold Wilson invited trade union leaders for talks at No 10. Now brewers have gone one better and created a beer made from leftover sandwich bread. It is a tasty solution to the shocking daily waste of bread, with more than 24m slices thrown away in Britain every day by consumers alone. Three new beers will soon be available at Marks &amp; Spencer made from surplus bread from its sandwich factory that would otherwise be discarded or turned into animal feed. Suffolk brewery Adnams is using the crusted “ends” of sliced sandwich loaves – frozen by M&amp;S supplier Greencore in Northampton and then sent to the brewery’s headquarters in Southwold – to create the new beers, which are already on sale in some M&amp;S stores and will soon be available to order online. Making beer out of bread isn’t new – its history stretches back 4,000 years to a time when brewers and bakers worked together. The difference is that the new beers use bread that would otherwise go to waste. Bread is made from grains such as barley, wheat and rye – exactly the same raw materials that are used to make beer. In this case, surplus crusts are mashed down into the mix and replace some of the malted barley traditionally used in brewing to create the Used Our Loaf range. Each batch of the new beer will use 700kg of surplus bread with three times the quantity of malted barley. And using bread has an added benefit of helping to reduce carbon emissions from the energy-intensive brewing process. The three Used Our Loaf beers are a triple English hop pale ale, a raspberry fruit beer and an Earl Grey pale ale. If the drinks prove popular with customers, the process will be rolled out across a wider range of beers. The ingredient switch is similar to that of the popular Toast Ale, launched two years ago by Tristram Stuart, founder of the food waste charity Feedback. Stuart was inspired to use leftover bread to make beer by a Belgian brewer who follows the same process. Toast Ale is now brewed in the US, South Africa, Iceland and Brazil. All distributable profits go to Feedback to help end food waste while its original online open-source recipe – which replaces a third of the malted barley with bread (equivalent to one slice a bottle) – has now been downloaded 30,000 times. Richard Applegate, an M&amp;S beer technologist, said: “Consumers who are fans of beer will be familiar with Toast Ale, and we wanted to find a way to use the surplus bread from our sandwiches in a more useful and environment-friendly way.” M&amp;S launched pre-packaged sandwiches in Britain in 1981 and now sells 92.7m a year, of which 72.4m are conventional sandwiches and the rest baguettes and wraps. According to official figures, about 10m tonnes of food is wasted annually in Britain, in homes and in the commercial sector. Bread is one of Britain’s most wasted foodstuffs, with an estimated 44% thrown away because people do not get around to using it in time and worry it is stale. Fergus Fitzgerald, head brewer at Adnams, said: “Making malted barley is an energy-intense process, therefore by using bread this reduces the carbon footprint; the saving from the three new beers is an estimated 1.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide.” Toast Ale notably works with Wold Top Brewery in North Yorkshire, one of the UK’s most sustainable breweries. And it recently became the first UK beer company to certify as a “B Corporation”, joining a global movement of people using business as a force for social good.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been testing food samples for residues of glyphosate, the active ingredient in hundreds of widely used herbicide products, for two years, but has not yet released any official results. But the internal documents obtained by the Guardian show the FDA has had trouble finding any food that does not carry traces of the pesticide. “I have brought wheat crackers, granola cereal and corn meal from home and there’s a fair amount in all of them,” FDA chemist Richard Thompson wrote to colleagues in an email last year regarding glyphosate. Thompson, who is based in an FDA regional laboratory in Arkansas, wrote that broccoli was the only food he had “on hand” that he found to be glyphosate-free. That internal FDA email, dated January 2017, is part of a string of FDA communications that detail agency efforts to ascertain how much of the popular weedkiller is showing up in American food. The tests mark the agency’s first-ever such examination. “People care about what contaminants are in their food. If there is scientific information about these residues in the food, the FDA should release it,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor in the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. “It helps people make informed decisions. Taxpayers paid for the government to do this work, they should get to see the information.” The FDA is charged with annually testing food samples for pesticide residues to monitor for illegally high residue levels. The fact that the agency only recently started testing for glyphosate, a chemical that has been used for over 40 years in food production, has led to criticism from consumer groups and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Calls for testing grew after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015. Glyphosate is best known as the main ingredient in Monsanto Co’s Roundup brand. More than 200m pounds are used annually by US farmers on their fields. The weedkiller is sprayed directly over some crops, including corn, soybeans, wheat and oats. Many farmers also use it on fields before the growing season, including spinach growers and almond producers. Thompson’s detection of glyphosate was made as he was validating his analytical methods, meaning those residues will probably not be included in any official report. Separately, FDA chemist Narong Chamkasem found “over-the-tolerance” levels of glyphosate in corn, detected at 6.5 parts per million, an FDA email states. The legal limit is 5.0 ppm. An illegal level would normally be reported to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but an FDA supervisor wrote to an EPA official that the corn was not considered an “official sample”. When asked about the emails and the agency’s testing, an FDA spokesman said only that the FDA had not found any illegal levels in corn, soy, milk or eggs, the four commodities it considers part of its glyphosate “special assignment”. He did not address the unofficial findings revealed in the emails. The FDA’s official findings should be released later this year or early in 2019 as part of its 2016 annual residue report. The reports typically are released two to two and a half years after the data is collected. Along with glyphosate, the agency has been trying to measure residues of the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba because of projected increased use of these weedkillers on new genetically engineered crops. The FDA spokesman said that the agency has “expanded capacity” for testing foods for those herbicides this year. Other findings detailed in the FDA documents show that in 2016 Chamkasem found glyphosate in numerous samples of honey. Chamkasem also found glyphosate in oatmeal products. The FDA temporarily suspended testing after those findings, and Chamkasem’s lab was “reassigned to other programs”, the FDA documents show. The FDA has said those tests were not part of its official glyphosate residue assignment. Pesticide exposure through diet is considered a potential health risk. Regulators, Monsanto and agrochemical industry interests say pesticide residues in food are not harmful if they are under legal limits. But many scientists dispute that, saying prolonged dietary exposure to combinations of pesticides can be harmful. Toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, who is director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), said that current regulatory analysis of pesticide dangers does not account for low levels of dietary exposures. “Even with low levels of pesticides, we’re exposed to so many and we don’t count the fact that we have cumulative exposures,” Birnbaum said. The US Department of Agriculture was to start its own testing of foods for glyphosate residues in 2017 but dropped the plan. The lack of government residue data comes as Monsanto attempts to bar evidence about glyphosate food residues from being introduced in court where the company is fighting off allegations its Roundup products cause cancer. In a case set for trial on 18 June, San Francisco superior court judge Curtis Karnow recently denied the company’s motion to keep the jury from hearing about residues in food. The judge said that although Monsanto worries the information “will inflame the jury against Monsanto based on their own fear that they may have been exposed”, such information “should not be excluded”.

Michael Gove’s new vision for British agriculture post-Brexit envisages farmers playing a critical role in improving public health. “There is a growing public interest in the impact of our current diet on our health,” he said. Non-communicable diseases such as heart and lung disease, cancer and diabetes accounted for 89% of deaths in the UK in 2014, according to the World Health Organization, he pointed out, and a major driver of that has been our diet: “the wrong fats, sugar, salt and other additives form too large a part of our national diet”. Improving our national diet is an important job for our farmers, he told the audience: “A balanced diet, rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, beans, pulses and cereals, fresh dairy produce and protein sources such as fresh fish, offal and properly sourced meat is critical to human health and flourishing.” Asked by the Guardian if, given the known environmental impacts of livestock farming, the government might consider suggesting that people reduce their meat consumption, Gove said: “For health reasons there’s an appropriate level of meat in anyone’s diet which doctors and nutritionists would advise us to consume.” “It’s not my job to micro-manage what goes into a shopping basket,” he added, “but while I respect the rights of people who might be vegan or vegetarian to make that choice, nevertheless I don’t think anyone should be shy or abashed in drawing attention to the fact that livestock farming contributes to the mixed farming methods that provide a specific set of farming benefits and that mixed farming and meat is part of a balanced diet.” But the discussion over whether humans need meat as a protein source is profoundly polarised. There is also much discussion over the health impacts of our current levels of meat consumption compared to predominantly plant-based diets. Gove plans to redesign the farming subsidy system so farmers are paid for environmental services such as improving soils and levels of biodiversity, viewing Brexit as a unique opportunity. He faces an anxious sector with concerns ranging from falling incomes due to cheap food prices and international competition, to environmental issues like declining soil health. The decline in numbers of small abattoirs was raised, and the challenges this presents to farmers around the country. Gove said there were discussions about how animals could be killed closer to where they were raised. He also spoke about plans to change labelling systems, saying: “I don’t want to take anything away from the work of Red Tractor and Leaf, but we can go further and develop a gold standard system of labelling.” Richard Young of the Sustainable Food Trust said: “We would argue that people should reduce their consumption of grain-fed meats. Two-thirds of British farmland is only suitable for grass.” Fully grass-fed cattle, the trust argues, can make a useful environmental contribution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/england-gary-cahill-world-cup-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"England need Gary Cahill’s experience at World Cup, says Antonio Conte","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/england-gary-cahill-world-cup-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/england-gary-cahill-world-cup-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"England need Gary Cahill’s experience at World Cup, says Antonio Conte","bodyText":"Antonio Conte believes Gary Cahill’s experience would be an asset for a youthful England side at the summer’s World Cup after the Chelsea captain regained his place in the first team at Stamford Bridge.

The 32-year-old has found opportunities limited at international level too of late and has not represented his country since the qualifying win over Slovenia in October, with England having conceded only once in the five games since. “At the moment, he deserves to play [for Chelsea] because he’s been doing well,” said Conte, whose lineup will be captained by Cahill at Swansea on Saturday. “He’s in good physical condition.

The victims were hit by a silver car as they stood outside Shah Jalal mosque in Aston. West Midlands police said in a statement that they “do not believe it is terror-related”. Detectives believe it was a targeted attack and efforts are ongoing to trace the vehicle, which failed to stop at the scene on Ettington Road at around 2.15pm on Friday. A 19-year-old man is in hospital with head and back injuries, which are not believed to be life-threatening. A 17-year-old is also in hospital with head and leg injuries, which are not serious. A worshipper who was attending Friday prayers and who declined to give his name told the Press Association: “It was shocking to see the guys afterwards. It was like something out of a movie and it was really, really shocking.” Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist, urged people not to speculate about the motive for the incident as rumours circulated that it may have been linked to a dispute between groups of youths. “It’s concerning what’s happened today. Two young men have been injured quite badly and it’s caused a lot of tension within the local community at present. Clearly there is a need for calm,” he said. “The police need to be allowed to conduct their investigations and personally I would urge anyone who knows anything about what has happened to contact the police.” DS Adam Williams from Force CID said: “We are still trying to establish the motive for the attack and we are looking at CCTV opportunities from the surrounding area.

Well, here's the catch","bodyText":"On Friday, the Australian Taxation Office, as it does every April, released the latest batch of annual taxation statistics. And as ever, the data was used in rather contorted ways to suggest the budget needed to reduce the level of taxation paid by the wealthiest and to make it seem like the richest were the ones doing it tough. The annual taxation statistics release is one of the biggest data dumps that occurs each year, and it is also one of the most poorly used. The Australian, for example, led on its front page with the news that the data was a hit to the Labor party’s plans to cut negative gearing because “almost two-thirds of all investors who negatively geared property were on taxable incomes of less than $80,000 a year”. Well, blow me down. That does sound like a lot of people. Of course, it is rather less of a shock when you realise that more than three-quarters of taxpayers were on a taxable income of less than $80,000. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The surprise would be if the 79% of individuals with a taxable income of less than $80,000 constituted a greater proportion of negative gearers. Rather than constituting damning evidence against the ALP’s policy, the fact that those earning less than $80,000 account for only “almost two-thirds” of negative gearers actually demonstrates that negative gearing is skewed towards higher-income earners. But that is common sense – something that is lacking when debate turns to negative gearing and the use of taxation data. The other old chestnut that got a run in the Australian is that more school teachers actually use negative gearing than company executives. Again, is it really a shock that “while 72,000 investors were listed as company executives, 99,000 people claiming rental losses on their tax returns were either teachers, nurses or midwives”? Given there are about 300,000 more people working as teachers, nurses or midwives than there are company executives, does anyone really think that because 27,000 more of them might use negative gearing is proof of anything? The crucial thing is not the total number, but the proportion of teachers and nurses (and any other profession) who use negative gearing. Those in wealthier occupations are much more likely to resort to the practice. Of the nearly 400,000 people who are chief executives, executives or general managers, 18% claimed a rental loss, compared with 13% of the just over 700,000 school teachers, midwives and nurses. Anaesthetists and surgeons – the two occupations with the highest median incomes, love to negative gear – 30% of anaesthetists, and 29% of surgeons do so. But of course negative gearing is all about reducing your taxable income, so talking about what percentage of people under a certain taxable income resort to negative gearing rather hides what is going on. Individuals with a total income of less than $80,000 account for 77% of all income-earning individuals, but just 58% of all negative gearers. Just 3.5% of all individuals earn more than $180,000, yet they account for 8.2% of all those who negative gear, and they take in 15% of all the negative gearing losses. Negative gearing is, of course, done by those on low incomes – but only a fool would suggest they are the most likely to be doing it or benefitting from it. And over the past four years, the big growth in negative gearing has been by those owning multiple properties. While about 70% of property investors own just one property, the number of those landlords has grown just 4% since 2012-13, while the number owning five or more has increased 13%. The taxation statistics also give some counter to the suggestion made by the treasurer, Scott Morrison, in a speech this week, that somehow the wealthiest were being asked to shoulder too high a burden. He suggested that “1% of taxpayers [are] paying 17% of the personal income tax collected!” I’m not sure why Morrison would think that worthy of an exclamation point given that the 17% (technically 16.9%) is actually lower than the average of 17.1% over the past 10 years. He noted as well that “the top 10% of taxpayers pay 45% of total personal income tax paid to the commonwealth.” Well yes they do, but the 44.9% (to be precise) of total net tax paid by the richest 10% in 2015-16 was actually slightly less than the 45.1% they paid in 2014-15. And again it was below the average over the past 10 years of 45.3%. Little wonder that the treasurer sought to compare the present with 20 years ago, when he suggested that, back then, “the top 10% paid 36%”. But things were rather different in 1998 – for a start we didn’t have a GST, and we had not had a mining boom, which helped push up the level of income towards the higher earners. Back then, the minimum wage was also worth about 52% of average weekly earnings – not 44% like it is now. If he wishes the share of tax paid by the highest to fall, maybe he should first ensure that the income earned by the lowest increases. And comparing tax paid by the top 10% is always a bit fraught. In the final year of the Howard government, the top 10% paid 46% of the total tax – the highest amount recorded. I somehow suspect Morrison would not argue that Howard and Costello were socialists asking too much of the wealthiest. The treasurer also suggested that Labor was “happy to hit” people “earning more than $87,000 per year”, suggesting that “these are Labor’s fat cats”. Fortunately the same taxation statistics that he referred to make it clear that if you areamong those individuals earning more than $87,000, you are also earning more than 77% of Australians. Now that might not make you a fat cat, but it certainly puts you on a higher income than the median Australian individual income of $55,540. Morrison suggested in his speech that “we must always resist the temptation to play class warfare in Australia.” The reality is there has always been a class warfare – it’s just that it is mostly practised by those with the power and money. And as we saw this week, the main weapon is the dodgy use of data.

Although the two leaders stressed the US and Germany’s close ties, their low-key meeting offered a stark contrast to the lavish state visit of French president Emmanuel Macron – and their body language was distinctly colder. At a joint press conference at the White House, Trump bemoaned America’s $151bn trade deficit with the European Union, whose exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs expires on Tuesday unless the US grants an extension. Merkel suggested little progress had been made on the issue. “The president will decide – that’s very clear,” she told reporters. “We had an exchange of views on the current state of affairs and the negotiations. The decision lies with the president.” Trump said: “We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don’t have. We’re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.” But he added that he did not blame Merkel, Germany or the EU for the imbalance. “I blame the people that preceded me for allowing this to happen,” he said. The US president also reiterated his criticism of Nato members that do not spend the mandatory 2% of GDP on defence; Merkel said Germany’s latest budget would take defence spending to 1.3% of GDP. He said: “Nato is wonderful but it helps Europe more than it helps us, and why are we paying a vast majority of the costs?” On her first visit to Washington since re-election, Merkel had been expected to back up Macron’s case for defending the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump is threatening to scrap. The chancellor acknowledged that the deal is “anything but perfect – it will not solve all the problems with Iran”, but she described it as a building block. She said Trump must decide whether the US would withdraw. He offered no fresh clues to his thinking but said: “They will not be doing nuclear weapons. That I can tell you. They’re not going to be doing nuclear weapons. You can bank on it.” Merkel looked on bemused as Trump gave rambling answers about his plans for a new embassy in Jerusalem and the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as nominee for veterans affairs (VA) secretary. Trump praised Jackson and said: “I explained Washington can be a very mean place; you don’t know about that, chancellor. A nasty place.” Listening via a translation device, Merkel frowned and grimaced. Moments later, Trump said about accountability reforms in the VA: “When someone treats our veterans badly, we can fire them so fast – almost as fast as they fire people in Germany.” Merkel raised her eyebrows and forced a smile. When Merkel last visited, Trump was criticised for not shaking her hand in the Oval Office. This time, he greeted Merkel outside the West Wing with a handshake and a kiss on each cheek. He insisted: “We have a really great relationship, and we actually have had a great relationship right from the beginning, but some people didn’t understand that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/27/josh-allen-offensive-tweets-buffalo-bills-nfl-draft","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T19:43:48Z","webTitle":"Josh Allen needs 'a good answer' for n-word tweets, says Bills captain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/27/josh-allen-offensive-tweets-buffalo-bills-nfl-draft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/27/josh-allen-offensive-tweets-buffalo-bills-nfl-draft","fields":{"headline":"Josh Allen needs 'a good answer' for n-word tweets, says Bills captain","bodyText":"The new Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen will need to build bridges in the locker room after offensive tweets he made in high school emerged. The tweets came to light hours before Buffalo selected Allen seventh overall on Thursday in the NFL draft. Some posts contained the n-word, while another said “If it ain’t white, it ain’t right!”. Allen said the “white” comment was a quote from the sitcom Modern Family, and that one of the uses of the n-word was from a Rick Ross song. He also expressed regret over the tweets: “I’m not the type of person I was at 14 and 15 that I tweeted so recklessly ... I don’t want that to be the impression of who I am, because that is not me. I apologize for what I did.” On Friday Bills team captain Lorenzo Alexander, who is African American, said he would give Allen the benefit of the doubt but that other members of the team may not feel the same way. The majority of players in the NFL are black. “What I’m gonna do is extend some grace and wait to get to know the kid and see how he develops,” Alexander told the Bills’ official radio program on Friday. “And that’s how you got to approach it. “Now everyone might not have that same approach. I would encourage every team-mate in our locker room to do that, but he’s gonna have to at some point, whether he does it in front of the whole team or one-off, somebody’s gonna ask him, ‘Why did you say that?’ Or ‘Why were you quoting those words?’ He’s gonna have to have a good answer.” Allen, who was a teenager when he wrote the tweets, grew up in a small town in California with very few black people. Alexander said the tweets may well have come from ignorance rather than prejudice. “I’m not gonna be ignorant enough to assume that he understands the [n-word] as I understand it and a lot of people understand it,” Alexander said. “Because growing up in a culture, especially around a guy like Eminem, there are certain aspects of our culture that think it’s OK to say it, whether you’re white or black. I’ve actually witnessed some black kids allow their [white] friends to use the word and not think twice about it. “Not a lot of people were in his town that he grew up in. Small time, I think it’s 1% blacks that live in that neighborhood. So you’re just not exposed to the same things.” The Bills said they had scouted Allen extensively before drafting him but were not aware of the offensive tweets until they came to light on Thursday. Allen is not the first player to have been burned on social media on draft day. In 2016, video emerged of top prospect Laremy Tunsil taking a bong hit through a gas mask under a confederate flag. He subsequently slipped down the draft – potentially losing millions of dollars – before being picked up by the Miami Dolphins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/27/dan-evans-cocaine-life-ruiner-tennis-ban-return","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"Dan Evans: ‘Cocaine is a shocking drug – it’s a life-ruiner’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/27/dan-evans-cocaine-life-ruiner-tennis-ban-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/27/dan-evans-cocaine-life-ruiner-tennis-ban-return","fields":{"headline":"Dan Evans: ‘Cocaine is a shocking drug – it’s a life-ruiner’","bodyText":"Dan Evans has taken a quiet look at the Barcelona Open on television this week, scene of his first Tour victory on clay nearly a year ago – after which his otherwise charmed life fell apart like an over-ripe orange. He was ranked 43 in the world and in the form of his life when drug testers found traces of cocaine in his washbag in the Spanish city, evidence that resulted in his banishment until this weekend, when he resumes his career on Saturday against Ed Corrie, in a Challenger held at a suburban leisure centre in Glasgow. The Birmingham player is as cheeky as ever, which is a good sign, and chastened, vowing never to take cocaine again, a drug he describes as “a life-ruiner”. In the bowels of a badminton and tennis complex in Scotstoun, Evans, who turns 28 next month, was nervous but hopeful and resisted all invitations to dwell on the circumstances of his transgression. “I’m not going to go into where it was and what happened,” he said. “It happened. It’s been and gone, in my eyes. It’s a shocking drug – and not just in sport; it’s terrible in life, it’s a life-ruiner. “Everyone knows you shouldn’t drink-drive but, if you drink-drive, you knew beforehand that you shouldn’t do it. I took it. I knew beforehand I shouldn’t have. It’s illegal for one, never mind being a sportsman. If you’re taking drugs you’re not in the clearest mindset.” Nor will he abandon friends who have been with him for most of his career. “I don’t like it when people say you hang around with a bad crowd. You choose who you hang around with and my friends have never made me do something and I have never made somebody do something. It is an easy excuse when people say that.” But wounds linger. Asked if it was a one-off experience, he paused and replied: “I’m not going to be answering those questions. I’ve never failed a drugs test before. I’ve failed one drugs test.” And, as he pointed out, he was not looking for a playing advantage. “I took it out of competition. It was an error of judgment. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever done. It’s a shocking thing to do. It’s let down many people. Not just that – it’s brought unwanted press to tennis. God knows what some of the greats of the game thought when that sort of thing came into the headlines.” The only tennis people he spoke to in the nine months away from the game were his coach, Mark Hilton, and his Great Britain Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith. His first conversation with Andy Murray – who has made his views on drug-abuse well known – may be a little frosty. But Evans sounds as if he has come through his experience stronger and more mature. He is not looking for favours. “I’ve always said there’s some different personalities in British tennis,” he said. “Not all of us are great friends but when it comes to Davis Cup, that’s probably the most time we spend with each other. Put it this way: I wasn’t expecting them to message me. I wasn’t upset they didn’t message me. This is the first time I’d thought about whether they had messaged me or not.” Evans found solace in friends and family, particularly his girlfriend, Aleah, with whom he stayed in Cheltenham for the duration of the ban. “Whoever cares for you, it’s a terrible conversation to have. Other things in life become more important. I didn’t keep in touch [with other players]. If it was on telly, I watched. Up until two months ago [when he was allowed to resume practising], I didn’t play at all. I probably won’t feel stress like I have in the last year. Winning tennis matches, or losing tennis matches, won’t be such a big deal.” Stripped of his routine, Evans discovered mundanity. “Well, you need food,” he answered with a grin when asked what got him out of bed in the morning. “The first part of the ban wasn’t so challenging. There’s a bit of a novelty in not playing tennis. You don’t need to work or do anything. It’s quite nice. “But then there’s a lot of dead time. You’ve done everything you can do that is new and it’s difficult to keep thinking ahead. There’s actually not much to do in the world – apart from work or playing tennis. I had a lot of free time to fill. “I was on my own [during the day] for much of the nine months [after learning of his ban, just before Queen’s] until 5.30pm, 6pm. It wasn’t easy. There were some terrible moments. I was saying to my girlfriend how long a working day actually is. I was probably the worst boyfriend there has ever been for nine months. Daytime TV is not good. “But I’m not going to stay in the house and I’m not going to say I didn’t enjoy myself when I was off. I went on holiday to Marbella but not as you guys would think. I still had good times but in the back of my mind I’m a professional tennis player, I’m missing a year of my life. And it’s probably not right to be out enjoying yourself when you’ve let so many people down.” As for the future, he says: “Nobody can sit there in that position and say: ‘I will be back.’ If they say that they’re lying to your face. I had doubts every day. Until I’m back where I should be there will still be doubts – doubts until there are two digits next to my name. “No one really likes the unknown and I’m in the unknown. There will be bad days, like any job, but hopefully there’s more good days than bad. A year’s a long time. Playing here people won’t fear me any more. I have to earn that respect again. But it feels exciting as well and, you never know, I might sit here in a year or two years and it might have been a blessing in disguise to sort all my stuff out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/iridescent-plants-for-lighting-up-shade-james-wong","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Iridescent plants for lighting up the gloom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/iridescent-plants-for-lighting-up-shade-james-wong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/06/iridescent-plants-for-lighting-up-shade-james-wong","fields":{"headline":"Iridescent plants for lighting up the gloom","bodyText":"The natural world is full of wondrous visual tricks, from the eerie glow of floating fireflies to the ever-changing camouflage of chameleons. But for me perhaps the most fascinating of all is iridescence – the shimmering, jewel-like colours of butterfly wings or peacock feathers that magically morph their multifaceted shades in front of your very eyes, depending on the angle of the light. But the miracle of iridescence is not something limited to the animal kingdom. It is displayed by a range of easy-to-grow plants that thrive in the deepest, darkest shade. These plants appear to glow fluorescent blue, turquoise or purple, literally bringing light to the darkness, making them perfect candidates for dingy plots or light-starved living rooms. Here are some of my top picks that anyone can have a go with, but first a quick science lesson… Why quite a large range of unrelated plants seem to have independently evolved the ability to flash light around in dark tropical forest floors has long been a puzzle for scientists. But recently joint research at the Universities of Bristol and Essex made an amazing discovery. It turns out that special structures called “iridoplasts” help plants make better use of the longer wavelengths of green light that filter down to the forest floor by bending it using layer after layer of translucent membranes, 1,000 times thinner than a human hair. The combined side-effects of absorbing green light (rather than reflecting it as most plants do) and these weird light-bending layers is a gorgeous metallic blue hue that baffles human observers. A number of these plants are available to home gardeners willing to do a bit of internet hunting through independent nurseries, especially those specialising in plants for vivaria (planted tanks for keepers of exotic pets). They tend not to be hardy, but in my experience make excellent bedding plants for the summer months and houseplants year-round. The cheapest and most common is peacock spikemoss (Selaginella uncinata) – a creeping, fern-like plant whose foliage shimmers turquoise to pink. It’s a rapid spreader, too, colonising the floor of terraria in a 5-10cm high carpet within weeks. Its much larger relative, Selaginella willdenowii, grows to about 30cm high and looks great pouring from troughs or hanging baskets if you can give it the humidity it needs. Much rarer, but worth all the effort, is the spectacular peacock begonia, Begonia pavonina. It is diminutive enough to fit into some of the smallest terraria, but hailing from the highlands of the tropics won’t demand lots of warmth. In fact, it develops the most intense hue and grows most happily at temperatures as low as 10C, so it’s a great option for a cool room or a bedding plant in cooler, shadier areas. Finally, if you are into aquascaping (gardening in aquariums) or sealed terraria, there is a beautifully iridescent tiny aroid called Bucephalandra ‘Deep Purple’ that makes gorgeous 10cm rosettes, like a sort of bonsai-sized calla lily (Zantedeschia), right down to tiny pink and white trumpet flowers. Magical.

The six coins depict the Australian coat of arms, a platypus, a lyrebird, an echidna, a frill-necked lizard and a feathertail glider – with the exception of the cent, they are still in circulation. A dollar featuring a spiral of kangaroos was launched in 1984. Subsequently, he designed the medals for Australia’s new honours system in 1975 and many of their defence force and civilian medals, as well as coins for more than 30 other countries. Stuart was born in Australia, in Geelong, Victoria, one of four sons of Richard, a painter and decorator, and Jessie (nee Manly), a housemaid, who encouraged hard work. With a particular aptitude for art, metalwork and geometry at Swanston Street state school, Stuart spent two years gaining experience as an ecclesiastical brass worker before training as a teacher. Between 1951 and 1955, he taught art in the small town of Wangaratta. He left to study goldsmithing and silversmithing at Royal Melbourne Technical College (now RMIT University), completing what was usually a three-year course in a year. Stuart achieved the highest marks ever awarded and gained a travel scholarship for the Royal College of Art in London (1958-60). He was subsequently awarded a Harkness fellowship to pursue silversmithing and sculpture at Columbia University, New York (1960-62). This ended with a one-man sculpture show at the Thibaut Gallery on Madison Avenue. Stuart returned to Australia in 1963 to complete his teaching contract with the state of Victoria and was appointed inspector of art schools, which he disliked intensely. He resigned after three months to lecture at Melbourne University, where he was commissioned to design and make the university’s ceremonial mace. Winning the competition to design Australia’s decimal coinage changed his life. He supervised the cutting of the dies at the Royal Mint in London; and broke with tradition by making his designs an integral part of the blank. In 1965, using his prize money, he bought a small house in Clerkenwell with a basement workshop where he started a goldsmithing and silversmithing business. This was the first of seven workshops where he employed and trained many highly skilled craftsmen. Stuart’s creativity opened up the world of silver. He liked to design “pieces that added delight, surprise, intrigue and even amusement to what had become austere and even sterile within the ‘modern’ idiom of design”. He devised techniques to produce textures and filigree forms of almost any kind, and used gilding to enrich his creations. The journalist Godfrey Winn described Stuart’s pieces as “the work of a magician”. He was appointed CMG in 1980, granted a royal warrant in 1982 and in 1996-97 served as prime warden of the Goldsmiths’ Company. He was also integral to the foundation of the Goldsmiths’ Centre, which opened in 2012, aimed at addressing shortcomings in the creative education and training of goldsmiths. Stuart enjoyed watching sport and taking part, as a keen squash player, windsurfer and swimmer. He is survived by his second wife, Carole (nee Hedley-Saunders), whom he married in 1986. His first marriage ended in divorce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/29/lord-dubs-tables-brexit-bill-amendment-to-give-young-refugees-sanctuary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T14:04:53Z","webTitle":"Lord Dubs tables Brexit bill amendment to give young refugees sanctuary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/lord-dubs-tables-brexit-bill-amendment-to-give-young-refugees-sanctuary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/29/lord-dubs-tables-brexit-bill-amendment-to-give-young-refugees-sanctuary","fields":{"headline":"Lord Dubs tables Brexit bill amendment to give young refugees sanctuary","bodyText":"Refugee campaigner Lord Dubs has tabled a Brexit bill amendment to force the government to continue to give refugee children sanctuary post-Brexit. Dubs has tabled an amendment to the European Union (withdrawal) bill that will include a specific provision for unaccompanied refugee minors stranded on the continent who have family in the UK already. He said he found the Windrush scandal “shameful” and the amendment was important to ensure the “cold indifference” of the government was not the determining factor when it came to children seeking refuge for war and conflict zones. “If the government is serious about righting its wrongs – and not just looking for an easy sticking plaster – it should accept my amendment so that families who have fled war can be together. No one, least of all young people and children, should be living in dangerous, dirty camps or on the streets when their family in Britain is waiting to house them,” he said. The UK is obliged to reunite children with family members under the Dublin III EU regulation. This falls away next March when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. “If the EU withdrawal bill is not amended, Britain will close off the main legal route through which young people stuck in camps in Europe can be reunited with their families in Britain,” said Dubs, who fled the Nazis on Kindertransport as a six-year-old. The Labour MP, David Lammy, who has led the political fight over Windrush, says he will fight for the amendment if it is passed in a vote in the House of Lords on Monday. “This amendment is the first test of the home secretary’s promise to take a more humane approach and change the culture of the Home Office,” he said. Dubs led the fight to secure sanctuary in the UK for lone refugee children with no family links in the UK, by forcing a change to the Immigration Act 2016. This became known as the Dubs amendment. Safe Passage, one of the key British charities involved in child refugee family reunion work, said if Dubs’ latest amendment gets through it will help children like Boy D, stranded in Calais. He is a 13-year-old Eritrean in Calais waiting for a transfer to London where his older brother, Tekle, already has refugee status. The charity says he fled his home a year ago and ended up in the French port trying to reach London to be with his brother but has been stuck there for months because of Home Office delays. The Home Office came under attack in November 2016 when it refused to give children caught up in the Calais camp demolition sanctuary in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/30/roma-mohamed-salah-angst-klopp-liverpool-fear-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T07:44:28Z","webTitle":"Roma’s Mohamed Salah angst leaves Klopp’s Liverpool with little to fear | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/30/roma-mohamed-salah-angst-klopp-liverpool-fear-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/30/roma-mohamed-salah-angst-klopp-liverpool-fear-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Roma’s Mohamed Salah angst leaves Klopp’s Liverpool with little to fear","bodyText":"Slightly fewer than four minutes separated Edin Dzeko’s goal for Roma at Anfield and the penalty awarded rather harshly against James Milner, and in that short space of time the Italians rose from a trance. At 5-0 they were out, they would have needed at least six goals in the second leg. At 5-2 Roma had more than a straw to clutch at, they had given themselves a glimmer of hope, suddenly required only half the number of goals, and had the recent memory of beating Barcelona 3-0 for inspiration. Jürgen Klopp will not be short of advice this week on how to approach Wednesday’s return in the Stadio Olimpico; there are any number of extrapolations permissible depending on which side scores the first goal and when. The matter is simpler than it looks, however, and the Liverpool manager knows it. It was Klopp himself who admitted without being prompted that he might have made a mistake in withdrawing Mohamed Salah too early. His explanation – that he needed to take the upcoming league game against Stoke into account – was reasonable and quite admirable. With Salah on the field it was completely understandable to assume that the match was won and Roma were looking forward only to the plane home. It was only when he came off that the extent to which he had been keeping the opposition nervously pinned back became clear. “You can blame me if you like,” Klopp said, accepting responsibility for a strategic error. Premier League points are still important to Liverpool, though with the benefit of hindsight it can clearly be seen that the best preparation for the remaining domestic fixtures would have been to ensure a place in the Champions League final when the opportunity presented itself. Klopp suggested Roma might have thrown caution to the wind in the last 10 minutes in any event, though to do so with Salah still on the pitch would have been to invite further damage to an already embarrassing scoreline. The hour or so of play in which Liverpool did as they pleased, scoring all their goals and prompting one Italian journalist to report it was like waking up in a Stephen King story, was reminiscent of a similar performance against Arsenal four years ago. The Gunners arrived as Anfield as league leaders, only to go 4-0 down in the first 20 minutes as Luis Suárez, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge ran amok, with Philippe Coutinho and Steven Gerrard pulling the strings in midfield. Klopp may have perfected the art of pressing and developed the knack of winning games in short bursts of overwhelming attack, though he did not invent either. At their best Liverpool were just as unstoppable under Brendan Rodgers and the result in February 2014 was that Arsenal retreated into their own half into a football equivalent of the foetal position, too scared to come out and leave any space to be plundered. That is exactly the dimension Salah and Roberto Firmino give the present side, and as long as both are on the team sheet on Wednesday most of the worrying can be left to Roma supporters. The Brazilian’s contribution to Salah’s excellent season cannot be overestimated; even with the Egyptian’s prodigious haul of 43 goals from 48 games , no one has come remotely close to suggesting Liverpool are a one-man team. They are not, and in fact in most seasons Firmino would be a strong contender for player of the year. On that subject, the voting for the Football Writers’ Association award closes on Monday, and those agonising over a choice between Salah and Kevin De Bruyne will be glad they waited until after the first leg of the Champions League semi‑final before reaching a decision. The Manchester City player has had an outstanding season, no question, and it may be that winning the Premier League in such style is an achievement that outweighs whatever Liverpool go on to manage in Europe. Yet Liverpool beat City three times this season and Salah was prominent on each occasion. In addition to constant, relentless scoring, Salah has performed well in the big matches too, the important games against the very best opponents, the semi-final against Roma being a case in point. That should be the clincher, really. If the story of the game was that Roma did not realise how big a talent they had let go, the footnote was that even Liverpool failed to realise how much they were going to miss him, even for just 15 minutes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/08/sharp-women-art-opinion-michelle-dean-review-biography","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion by Michelle Dean – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/08/sharp-women-art-opinion-michelle-dean-review-biography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/08/sharp-women-art-opinion-michelle-dean-review-biography","fields":{"headline":"Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion by Michelle Dean – review","bodyText":"In recent years, the group biography has become a spirited mainstay of the publishing landscape: a means both of revisiting and reinterpreting already familiar times, people and places, and of bringing together between hard covers lives that might not be deserving of an individual doorstop. In Sharp, though, Michelle Dean has assembled not so much a group as a small crowd: her book, with its title that brings to mind suddenly puckered lips, has the feeling of a cocktail party at which several people drink too much, nearly everyone talks too loudly, and no one really likes anyone else. Through this gathering, she wanders, ashtray in one hand, dishcloth in the other. Dean relishes her guests’ bad behaviour – you might call her a little starstruck – but only to a degree. As the evening goes on, she will sometimes find herself apologising for them, these women who are so clever and talented, and yet so madly competitive, so stubbornly reluctant to attach the word “feminist” to their neon-bright names. But we’re running ahead of ourselves; no need to reach for the dustpan and brush just yet. Who are these brilliant, pugnacious visitors? All are writers, the majority American. Most began as journalists, making an art, as Dean’s subtitle has it, of “having an opinion”; some then went on to write acclaimed novels, and other kinds of books. Most of their names are well known: Hannah Arendt, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Mary McCarthy, Dorothy Parker, Susan Sontag, Rebecca West. Others, at least for British readers, may be less familiar: Janet Malcolm, whose singular, often controversial interviews appeared in the New Yorker; Pauline Kael, once the same magazine’s acerbic film critic; Renata Adler, the reporter whose home was also there until she put the literary equivalent of a bomb under her career. Dean gives each one about the same amount of attention, although it’s clear that she enjoys the company of some more than others. The playwright Lillian Hellman and the novelist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston, however, she collides with so fleetingly, they appear before the reader like gatecrashers or, more likely, additions to the guest list so embarrassingly last minute she can hardly bear to do much more than pour them their first sidecar. What unites them, besides their trade and their talent? Dean talks, in her preface, of their remarkable achievements in a world that “was not eager to hear women’s opinions about anything”; of the way they roundly defied expectations. But there’s also the adjective of her title: sharp. People did not always respond favourably to the “sting” of their words. What would have seemed daring and deeply smart coming from a man appeared only haughty, inappropriate and unkind when served up by a woman. Such taking of offence is, of course, somewhat odd when you think about it, because their other problem of perception had to do with gravity. How, after all, was anyone (for which read: any man) supposed to take them seriously? Some (Ephron, Parker) were in the business of jokes; others wrote about sex and marriage (Ephron again, McCarthy). Malcolm was into (how very dubious) psychoanalysis. Didion, in her tiny dresses, her wrists like clay pipes, was just so much surface and “swank”. Dean, a journalist herself, sympathises with all this; her book – though these are my words, not hers – is for any woman who has ever silenced a dinner table by being just a little too quick, too knowing, too mocking. Am I allowed to say that I have more than once done just that? Maybe I am. Another thing her subjects have in common is that they tend not to go in for false modesty or, indeed, modesty of any kind. “I hear you’re the new me,” McCarthy is supposed to have said to Sontag at a party in the late 60s. For all of these women, “me” really was a thing worth being. It’s only possible here to give you the merest glimpse of these creatures: their valour, their victories. I can never get enough of Rebecca West, who saw, early on, her fellow critics for exactly what they were (“There is now no criticism in England. There is merely a chorus of weak cheers, a piping note of appreciation… a mild kindliness that neither heats to enthusiasm nor reverses to anger”). Her struggle to hide her emotional anxieties behind her intellectual confidence always moves me. McCarthy strikes me again and again as someone whose supposedly difficult nature is just another part of her great appeal. Her impertinence, if that’s the word, on the page – “There are but two qualities [these books] share, and the first is a splendid, sickening mediocrity” – makes me feel slightly giddy, even now. And her long, collaborative friendship with the far more serious Arendt speaks volumes. Ephron, author of what is surely one of the most splendid books about the end of a marriage ever written, is as cheering as new shoes, although she’ll be with you far longer. From Malcolm, we learn once more that if you keep quiet and let a certain kind of man talk on long enough, he’ll quietly hand you the rope, and likely tie the knot to boot. “Writers are always selling somebody out,” said Didion famously, a line I would like to have printed on a T-shirt. Dean’s book is far from perfect. She skims where she should dive; her tone is unvarying, with the somewhat dispiriting result that her essays are considerably less distinctive than the women they portray. (If you really want to read about Sontag over a short distance, I would refer you instead to Terry Castle’s brilliant essay about her, collected in The Professor and Other Writings.) Above all, I’m resistant to the way she struggles with what she clearly regards as her subjects’ disappointing attitude to feminism. It’s not only, as she notes herself, a question of historical context. Like so many others right now, she seems to have forgotten that, even five years ago, you would have been hard pressed to get many, if not most, women in the public eye to call themselves feminists. Nevertheless, this is a great and worthy project: a primer for those for whom these names are new; a sustaining reminder for those already familiar with them. You put it down feeling steadier, more determined. Sharp women everywhere, I tell you: be pointy and proud. • Sharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion by Michelle Dean is published by Fleet (£20).

Hughes, the former Wales, Blackburn, Manchester City and Stoke manager hired to replace Mauricio Pellegrino in March, has taken one point from his four league games in charge. “Given where we find ourselves, arguably it is one of the biggest games of my career,” he said. “It’s a huge game for the club. The consequences of going out of the Premier League are huge. Everybody knows that. It doesn’t matter if a club has been here a short time or for a longer period, as Southampton have, it still has an impact: on the fans, the surrounding area, businesses, everything. “A lot of work and finance are generated by having a Premier League club within the town. We know the consequences of going down. It’s going to impact on a lot of people. So we need to do something about it. That’s what we’re trying to do.” Hughes added: “It’s black and white.

He doesn’t just nip into the studio with a notepad: he has a gift for sustaining conversations that unfold across decades. His friendship with David Hockney has inspired remarkable collaborations, and when he sat for a portrait by Lucian Freud he made in return his own version of Man with a Blue Scarf, a written portrait of the painter painting. In Modernists &amp; Mavericks he draws on a huge archive of interviews to piece together a history of postwar painting in London, from the Camberwell students of the 1940s, working in the ruins of a bombed city, to the pop artists who collaged images of shining new-made lives in the 1960s. Gayford starts with people, moments and meetings, standing firm in the belief that “pictures are affected not only by social and intellectual changes but also by individual sensibility and character”. Three cheers for that faith in individuals. Other studies have debated the effects of state art funding and cold war cultural politics; this one brings us the expression of Leon Kossoff as he moves through heaven and hell with each brushstroke, Bridget Riley introducing the whisker of white that makes a black painting live, Gillian Ayres and Howard Hodgkin talking hour after hour in the car down to Bath School of Art. Many of the painters here were sceptical of interpreters pinning them down with words. But with each other they could be unstoppably voluble. Francis Bacon went around conducting “a mobile seminar”. Frank Auerbach (the most grippingly eloquent of the book’s voices) says that he and Bacon “talked, slightly drunkenly and wildly, for about 15 years”. As for Auerbach and Freud, the conversation went on for half a century. The book’s span allows Gayford to plot several generations in relation to each other, and it’s striking how many of the most potent encounters involve forms of teaching. Simply walking down the street one day, Bacon pointed out to the young John Wonnacott how a shadow seemed to eat into a figure “like a disease”. “I rethought shadow,” says Wonnacott; it stayed with him all his life. There are dismal fallings-out at art school: Allen Jones, amazed that his tutors had omitted to mention the existence of Jackson Pollock, suggested suing Hornsey College for fraud. But David Bomberg emerges as a deeply valued teacher at Borough polytechnic, whose students inherited his convictions about the uncompromising effort that painting requires. Effort and seriousness united the London artists. The Colony Room Club bar in Soho filled up after many a dinner at Wheeler’s, that’s true, as well it might after what Cyril Connolly called the “chopless chop-houses and beerless pubs” of the 40s. But the talk was never far from painting, and the next morning there was work. Gayford attends particularly to the relationship between long concentration and sudden achievement. For Kossoff, tirelessly painting a swimming pool in Willesden, north-west London, there would come a point when “conscious intention breaks up”. It was then that “the picture happened”. Kossoff and Auerbach stayed close to Camden; Freud thought it mad to travel when there were parts of London he had not visited. The particular environment of the city is perhaps most clearly felt in the account of what happened when Bacon ventured to St Ives, though the episode is also a welcome reminder of the vitality of British painting elsewhere. But the biggest news was coming from the US and everyone was forming some kind of relationship with the ideas coming from the new centre of the art world. Peter Blake posed in his Levi 501s, with American badges pinned to his jacket and Elvis magazine in hand, portraying himself as a gawkily dedicated fan. The picture has the wistful air of Watteau’s Pierrot, Gayford observes; there’s Gainsborough here, too, and Rousseau. It’s a beautifully complex self portrait of a young Englishman dressed for America. New York and Los Angeles were the places to be; Hockney, Jones, Frank Bowling and Richard Smith all eventually went. But powerful work could come of not being there. The giant force of abstract expressionism intensified debates about whether external subjects had any role in the life of a painting. Was the “hard-edged abstraction” pursued by Robin Denny and William Turnbull a leap into the future or a dead end? If a Sandra Blow painting “put you in mind of landscape” was it then a figurative work? The conversations of Ayres and Hodgkin were charged by the fact of their work falling just (but decisively) to either side of the “invisible frontier” between abstraction and representation. Ayres is a vivid presence and Gayford gives a fine account of her vast, tumbling, ever metamorphosing Hampstead Mural. He records her laughter as baffled onlookers wondered what she was doing.

A North Korean leader crossed into the South for the first time since the Korean war, which halted 65 years ago with an armistice but no peace treaty. At the demilitarised zone, a strikingly confident, buoyant Kim Jong-un received not just a handshake but a hug from his counterpart, Moon Jae-in; and took his hand to draw him into the North briefly. “The two leaders solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun,” the joint declaration said. It vowed to pursue talks to declare a formal end to the war, turning the armistice into a peace treaty and establishing a permanent and solid peace regime. All this is welcome, especially given that Donald Trump is due to meet Mr Kim next month. But it looked good in part because things have been so bad. Only a few months ago, North Korean missile tests and Mr Trump’s threats of “fire and fury” caused alarm across the region. In fact, the images of the smiling North and South Korean leaders holding their joined hands aloft were almost identical to those of Mr Kim’s father and Mr Moon’s predecessors at summits in 2000 and 2007. Mr Kim nodded to that: “Rather than create results we won’t be able to carry out like in the past, we should make good results by talking frankly about current issues,” he said. And just read the small print. The path ahead has plenty of obstacles. As the communique states, a peace treaty to formally end the war will require trilateral or quadrilateral talks, drawing in the United States and probably China. Other players are watching closely: Japan is increasingly edgy, fearing that the US is neglecting its interests. Though the statement confirmed the two sides’ common goal of denuclearising the peninsula, Mr Kim did not mention it in his remarks. And for North Korea, that goal includes the removal of the US nuclear umbrella. One important question is who believes they are driving the agenda. Mr Trump, of course, believes his bellicosity has achieved this. But Mr Kim might well think that the progress in his weapons programme has been key. The second key question is whether Washington and Pyongyang can trust each other. Previous deals have ended in failure. The US, understandably, has deep suspicion about whether North Korea’s engagement drive is merely tactical: is it just buying time while continuing on its course? It is far from clear whether even a freeze of the nuclear programme would be fully verifiable. But even if offered some kind of security guarantee, North Korea has every reason to distrust the US, with its history of pursuing regime change – and never more so than now. An erratic, volatile president is surrounded by hawks such as Mike Pompeo and John Bolton. The administration repeatedly threatens to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Why should a signature on a Korea pact be more permanent? The turnaround in recent months has been astonishing. But it should serve as a reminder that things could deteriorate with equal speed. The meeting’s success owes much to Seoul’s groundwork. Though Mr Trump applauded it, we do not know his intentions for the approaching summit, and on previous form it is likely that he doesn’t either. His administration has started late and lacks expertise: swanning in and quoting The Art of the Deal won’t cut it. Elevating talks to leadership level so quickly means that if things go wrong, there are few paths ahead. Steps forward can quickly be followed by backwards slides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/10/divinity-war-how-religious-sects-seized-madagascar-cinema-district-antananarivo","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T06:15:05Z","webTitle":"Screen grabs: how religious sects seized Madagascar's cinema district","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/10/divinity-war-how-religious-sects-seized-madagascar-cinema-district-antananarivo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/10/divinity-war-how-religious-sects-seized-madagascar-cinema-district-antananarivo","fields":{"headline":"Screen grabs: how religious sects seized Madagascar's cinema district","bodyText":"It’s Sunday afternoon on Rue Dussac, a dusty cobbled street in downtown Antananarivo, and a relaxed crowd of young, elegantly dressed Malagasy women has gathered in the shade outside the Rex cinema. Among them is Kantou, 20, who has come with her mother to see today’s “show”: a service of the Evangelical Messenger of Awakening (MRE) church. “I first started coming when I was 14. I was going through some serious emotional problems back then,” says Kantou. Her mother had stopped believing in God after her divorce. They heard about the MRE church through a friend and have been coming every Sunday since. Inside, the giant dusty screen and rows of folding seats are remnants of a bygone era of cinema-going. On a raised stage, a woman in her 40s energetically leads a band equipped with electric guitars and what looks like pricey sound equipment. She implores the arriving attendees to sing. The Rex was one of many classically named cinemas built in the 1920s and 30s, when Madagascar was a French colony. Cinema-going peaked in the 1960s and 70s, and now the ageing picturehouses are rented out year-round to the booming “sister churches”, evangelical sects whose desire to entertain has earned them a keen following, particularly among the young. Modelled after the success of Nigeria’s superstar preachers, churches such as MRE and Shine were launched in the early 2000s. Self-proclaimed prophets such as Jocelyn Ranjarison and Patrick Andrianarivo have created lucrative personal brands, asking their devotees for hefty financial contributions in exchange for the promise of great miracles. Madagascar is the only country in the world whose population has been getting poorer for the past 60 years despite not being at war. So it’s not hard to understand why Malagasies might be swayed by churches that promise better lives on top of entertaining afternoons. Added to that is the decline of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (FJKM), one of the largest Protestant churches in the country with five million followers, and whose leaders have close ties to powerful politicians on the island. Decades of corruption scandals have tested the faith of its followers. “In these new churches, you won’t hear a sermon in favour of this or that political leader,” says Lova Rabary, historian and former editor-in-chief of the local daily newspaper L’Express. “They promise things – healing, personal gain – in a language that is more accessible and less austere than traditional churches.” Nancy is also attending the service at the Rex with her mother, and is in her early 20s. Before she discovered the MRE, Nancy attended FJKM services. “I like it here, it’s more open to young people, more fun,” she says, amid the swaying and singing. Across the street from the Rex, in the old Ritz cinema the Shine church promises “to release people from the oppression of ignorance and to raise them into a glorious life”. Inside, the room is packed with well-dressed couples who wave to the pastor on their way in. Roland Ramaro is a middle-aged man with a warm smile and a slightly frenzied look. “The special miracle session is about to start,” he announces. “Before Shine, I was neither Protestant nor Muslim. I was hard-headed. Today, I wake up every day at 4am and pray for two hours.” Ramaro is a good illustration of another reason why churchgoers don’t mind the heavy focus on collecting money. He had been working in Antananarivo as a tuk-tuk driver but after crossing paths with a Shine bishop, the church helped secure him a full-time office job with a carrier company. “Church has always been a major driver of social climbing, and that’s what many of the attendees are looking for,” says Rabary. For some, though, the new use for these old palaces of film is a depressing reminder of the decline of cinema in Madagascar. “I pass through this street every day and of course, it’s frustrating to see this,” says Laza, a Malagasy film-maker and founder of the Madagascar short film festival, whose father was once the projectionist at the Ritz. During Madagascar’s golden age for cinema-going, in the 1960s and 70s, screenings of films starring Bruce Lee and Jean-Paul Belmondo would run daily from Tuesday to Sunday in more than 100 locations on the island. Cinema was seen as a useful tool for educating the largely rural population. But in the late 1990s, president Didier Ratsiraka decided to cut all government funding for the industry, eventually leading to the closure of the Rue Dussac cinemas. “Four years ago, we managed to rent one of the downtown cinemas for the Human Rights film festival,” recalls Laza. “I decided to screen a feature from the Democratic Republic of Congo about evangelical sects – Traders of Miracles (Marchands de miracles) by Gilles Remiche. The usual followers attended but their only question was: why weren’t we making a movie about them?” For his part, Ramaro shares some reservations about holding services in former cinema buildings. “We had to divert evil spirits away from the room with holy water,” he explains.

That was quite the game. Juve won it, then threw it away, and then won it all over again in the last five minutes, having shown no sign of being capable in the 20 minutes prior. As the old saying goes, that’s why they’re champions. Napoli now have to take on Fiorentina, having been through the ringer tonight. There will surely still be twists and turns but Juve have wrestled the advantage back in dramatic fashion. Thanks for joining me, and arrivederci. What it all means is that Juve are four points clear of Napoli, who have a game in hand. Here are both teams’ remaining fixtures: Juventus: Bologna (H), Roma (A), Verona (H). Napoli: Fiorentina (A), Torino (H), Sampdoria (A), Crotone (H). So, to recap: Half-time: Inter 0-1 Juventus; Inter down to 10 men 65 mins: Inter 2-1 Juventus 87 mins: Inter 2-2 Juventus 89 mins: Inter 2-3 Juventus Calcio, bloody hell, and so on. Juve have held on, and extend their lead to four points, after a frankly unbelievable second half. 94 mins: Another chance for Inter! Perisic is unmarked from a deep cross, but skews his header well wide. On the bench, Mauro Icardi looks beside himself. 93 mins: Eek, a nervous moment for Buffon as he fumbles Brozovic’s shot. Miranda, stationed upfield, mis-hits the follow up from a tight angle. Two more minutes for Juve to hold on. 91 mins: The air has been well and truly sucked out of the San Siro, and Higuain should probably have a penalty as Skriniar clatters him in the penalty area. Yann Karamoh is coming on for Inter. Good grief! Brozovic gave away a free kick 25 yards out, which Dybala curled brilliantly into the danger area. Higuain – who else – got away from Santon, and nods Juventus ahead! How on earth have they done this? Juve are back in front! ...But it’s not over yet! Cuadrado bursts past Santon and his cross deflects off Skriniar and inside the far post! 85 mins: Costa hauls down D’Ambrosio and Inter can clear their lines. Juventus running out of time... 84 mins: Change for Inter, with Davide Santon, once of Newcastle United, replacing Icardi. 83 mins: Cuadrado prods the ball into the path of Higuain, who rushes his shot from 18 yards out. 82 mins: Still nothing doing for Juve going forward, with Inter now camped around their own area. 79 mins: A final change for Juve, with Rodrigo Bentacur replacing Pjanic, who should have been sent off. Inter make a change too – Borja Valero replaces Rafinha in midfield. 77 mins: Alex Sandro is booked for hauling down Rafinha, who has been a big factor in Inter turning this game around. 76 mins: Juve win a series of corners, before Bernadeschi’s cross is cleared away. Inter break away and Candreva pulls the ball back across goal – but Icardi can’t get a toe on it! 74 mins: What a save! Dybala bends a terrific effort towards the far corner but Handanovic springs to his right to turn it over the bar! 73 mins: Brozovic barges Cuadrado over on the edge of the area, and is booked. Promising free kick for Juve... 71 mins: Giorgio Chiellini is on the bench, and has taken it upon himself to cajole his team-mates from the touchline. 70 mins: Costa forces Handanovic to turn the ball behind with a shot from a tight angle. The corner is wasted. 69 mins: Just over 20 minutes for Juve to turn this around – they still have a man advantage, but can’t get anything going in attack. 67 mins: Bernardeschi is on in place of Mandzukic. I don’t know what Max Allegri said at half-time, but it hasn’t panned out as hoped. Perisic turned Cuadrado inside out down the left flank, then drilled in a low cross that cannoned in off Barzagli’s shins. Are you watching, Napoli? Juventus are falling apart here! No translation necessary... 63 mins: What a miss! Higuain is set free by a brilliant Sandro through ball, and goes round Handanovic – but fires his shot into the side netting! Oh Gonzalo! 62 mins: Dybala comes on for Sami Khedira, with Max Allegri going all guns blazing. 60 mins: Juventus have got themselves in a right mess here. 59 mins: Rafinha curls a shot from the edge of the area, but Buffon is right behind it. 57 mins: Pjanic brings Rafinha down with a very clumsy, very high tackle. He’s been booked – and the referee has his card out... but books D’Ambrosio for dissent. Pjanic is a lucky, lucky boy. 55 mins: Sandro brings down Cancelo, who has rallied from his role in the opening Juventus goal. Paulo Dybala is going to be coming on shortly. That goal was greeted with an almighty roar around the ground (and, I’ll wager, in Naples). A point isn’t great for Inter’s top-four ambitions but they would love it, love it if they could dent Juve’s title hopes. Hold on a minute! The free kick is floated in beautifully by Joao Cancelo and Mauro Icardi nods into the bottom corner! 51 mins: Another booking for Juventus, with Mandzukic bringing Skriniar down midway inside the Inter half. 49 mins: Errors all over the place from Juventus: Sandro mis-hits a cross, then Cuadrado misplaces a pass in midfield. 47 mins: Higuain holds the ball up and it’s worked back to Matuidi, whose loose touch allows Skriniar to intercept. He’s a big, bustling centre-back, is Skriniar – he’ll surely be of interest to Premier League sides. We’re back under way. Sign up! Douglas Costa’s early goal and Matías Vecino’s red card for Inter immediately afterwards have put Juventus firmly in the driving seat. More soon. Goal disallowed for Juventus! The visitors break and a mis-hit cross bobbles beyond Khedira and Higuain, but lands at the feet of Blaise Matuidi, who turns it in. He looks a mile offside though, and the VAR chalks it off. 49 mins: Candreva adds to the first-half montage of dreadful shots from 25 yards out. 48 mins: There are still hints of vulnerability in this Juventus back line – Rugani the latest to suffer a lapse of concentration – but Inter haven’t been able to test them yet. 46 mins: Brozovic takes the free kick, clipping it off the wall without any venom. Inter win a corner, but it comes to nothing. 45 mins: There will be 6 (SIX) minutes of added time. 44 mins: Icardi leaves Barzagli horribly exposed, nicking the ball away from the centre-back some 25 yards from goal. He’s hacked down, and Barzagli joins Pjanic and Cuadrado in the book. 42 mins: The visitors are pinging the ball around the Inter half, before Cuadrado fires an ambitious effort miles over the bar. 40 mins: Juve win a corner and work it short, Costa whipping the ball across goal with his left foot – but Matuidi can only head over. 38 mins: This is less a game of football and more a series of scraps. First, Perisic goes over easily in the hope of getting Cuadrado a second yellow. Then Candreva trips Mandzukic, provoking an angry reaction from the Croat. The mutual emnity is keeping this game interesting. 36 mins: Gonzalo Higuain is off the pitch, changing his boots. 34 mins: Cancelo is obstructed by Alex Sandro as he moves to swing the ball into the area, but nothing’s given. Inter players and fans are livid, and the full-back stays down. 31 mins: Another low-tempo Juve attack comes to nothing as Higuain’s through ball has too much zip for the cantering Mandzukic. 29 mins: Woof! From nowhere, we almost had one of the goals of the season here. Candreva, more than 30 yards out, took a swing for the top corner – it swerved and dipped, forcing Buffon to tip the ball awkwardly around the post. 28 mins: Higuain is picked out in the area by Alex Sandro, but uses his hand to bring the ball down. 27 mins: Rafinha, dropping into a deeper midfield role, is fouled by Pjanic – prompting howls from the home crowd. No second yellow for the Juve midfielder, and rightly so. 25 mins: Icardi threads a pass out wide to Perisic, who can take on Cuadrado. He carves out space, but then opts for a wild effort on goal that’s greeted with whistles from the home crowd. 23 mins: Inter are having to sit deep to contain Juventus, who are keen to build on their favourable circumstances. Costa cuts in from the right, but thwacks his shot a couple of feet wide. 20 mins: Pjanic, who curled the free-kick wide, goes into the book himself. It’s been a lively first 20 minutes. 19 mins: Vecino and his team-mates reacted with predictable fury but it was a bad challenge with more than a hint of malice, the midfielder bringing his studs down on Mandzukic’s shin as they clashed. After another look at the pitchside monitor, referee Daniele Orsato sends Vecino off! That decision goes down as well as you might expect at the San Siro. 16 mins: Vecino lunges in on Mandzukic straight from kick-off. and is promptly booked. The referee is going to have another look though – will the yellow turn red? 15 mins: The goal was checked with the VAR after Inter protested an offside – or perhaps a handball. Looked fine to me. The corner is half-cleared, but only as far as Cuadrado, who stands up a cross that floats over the back four and lands at the feet of Douglas Costa. He takes a touch and fires brilliantly across goal. Juve lead! 12 mins: Chance for Juve, as Mandzukic nods a cross from deep back across goal, and only a last-ditch intervention from Skriniar denied Higuain a tap-in. Corner... 9 mins: Perisic squanders a decent angle from which to whip the ball in towards Icardi. The real action is in the stands, with Inter fans unveiling a dazzling array of insulting banners – this one chronicles Juve’s losses in European Cup finals: 7 mins: Tony Dorigo is on co-comms. Not much else to report. 5 mins: Perisic threatens to scoot away on the break, and makeshift right-back Juan Cuadrado clatters him to the floor. He’s booked. 4 mins: Candreva concedes a corner with an outrageously slack back-pass. It’s worked short before Cuadrado whips in a cross that’s flicked clear of danger by an Inter head. 2 mins: Milan Skriniar puts in a sturdy challenge on Blaise Matuidi, who had threatened to break into the area from the left. The visiting back four, which is completely different from the one that lost to Napoli, stroke the ball around. The teams are out in front of a raucous crowd at the San Siro, with tifos and trumpets galore. While you’re here, why not sign up for our free football email, the Fiver? As it happens, there’s drama wherever you look in Serie A. The stakes are plenty high for Inter tonight, too – with Italy getting four Champions League places again from next season, they’re in a battle with Roma and Lazio to finish in the top four. Roma are up to third after a 4-1 win over Chievo earlier today – a result that would, of course, also do quite nicely for them this Wednesday. Defeat for Chievo leaves them very much in the relegation mix with Spal and Crotone – and Gazzetta era favourites Cagliari and Udinese could still get sucked in. Internazionale (4-2-3-1): Handanovic; João Cancelo, Skriniar, Miranda, D’Ambrosio; Vecino, Brozovic; Candreva, Rafinha, Perisic; Icardi. Subs: Padelli Berni, Lisandro, Ranocchia, Karamoh, Borja Valero, Santon, Éder, Dalbert, Pinamonti. Juventus (4-3-3): Buffon; Cuadrado, Barzagli, Rugani, Alex Sandro; Khedira, Pjanic, Matuidi; Douglas Costa, Higuaín, Mandzukic. Subs: Pinsoglio, Szczesny, Chiellini, Benatia, Howedes, Lichtsteiner, Asamoah, Bentancur, Marchisio, Bernardeschi, Dybala. If you’re looking for a proper title race among the big leagues, Italy is the only place to be. It was only nine days ago that the scudetto battle looked set to end with a whimper, with Juventus on course to open up a nine-point lead over Napoli. Then, a shock Crotone equaliser and a stirring comeback in Naples shifted the momentum ahead of a crunch meeting in Turin. Juve aimed to grind out a goalless draw and preserve their four-point lead, but Kalidou Koulibaly had other ideas, powering home a late header fierce enough to crack open any title race. Which brings us to tonight. Juve are still a point ahead, and four wins from their last four games will seal a seventh straight title and deny Napoli their first in 28 years. The trouble is, two of those games are away to sides battling for a Champions League spot – tonight at Inter, and at Roma in two weeks’ time. Inter have struggled for wins in 2018, but a doughty 0-0 draw won’t do for the visitors tonight. What’s the Italian for squeaky bum time? Kick-off is at 7.45pm BST, 8.45pm local."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/28/a-league-semi-final-sydney-fc-v-melbourne-victory-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T13:01:29Z","webTitle":"A-League semi-final: Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/28/a-league-semi-final-sydney-fc-v-melbourne-victory-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/28/a-league-semi-final-sydney-fc-v-melbourne-victory-live","fields":{"headline":"A-League semi-final: Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory - as it happened","bodyText":"Well, where do you start with that. Five goals, seven yellow cards, two red cards - for staff, entering the field of play to attack a player - which somehow all feels only a subplot to the absolute rollercoaster experienced by the Melbourne Victory players, and one in particular, former Sydney FC midfielder Terry Antonis. Sydney FC weren’t perhaps at their best, big name and big game players like Ninkovic, Bobo or Brosque didn’t seem to rise to grab the occasion by the scruff of the neck. Victory for their part came out of the traps looking well-drilled and hungry. They pressed with intent, but also intelligence. They looked to hit in transition and with pace, and through Barbarouses and George in particular enjoyed success out wide. Nigro’s own-goal came against the early flow. But Barbarouses got just desserts for his side, albeit via a wicked deflection. Sydney FC seemed to press self-destruct minutes into the second half with an uncharacteristic error at the back, which James Troisi duly punished. The hosts then increasingly tried to lift the pressure, but outside a 90 +5 minute horror own goal, perhaps never quite looked like they thoroughly deserved it. But with penalties looming, that man Antonis made amends through seeming pure desperation. A remarkable end to Graham Arnold’s reign at Sydney FC. The Socceroos coach-in-waiting bowing out with grace and humility post match, as his back-to-back premiers crumpled at the death. Melbourne march on, and we head to Newcastle next week, as the Jets take on the Victory to determine our 2017/18 champions! Terry Antonis cries again. The travelling Victory fans cry with relief. Alex Brosque rolls out a thousand-yard stare for the post-match interview. He’s asked if this is his last game for Sydney, the captain admits he’s not sure. Rhys Williams hobbles touchline on his crutches. It seems a lifetime since he went down cruelly in the warm up. Lawrence Thomas receives the adulation of the travelling fans. Graham Arnold waves a sombre hand goodbye to Allianz stadium and the Sydney FC fans. What a game, what drama, what human emotion. And this white whale of a football game, this remarkable, indefinable, indescribably game of soccer is over!! Melbourne Victory have won, Besart smiles again. Muscat sprints onto the field to congratulate his players. And the rain falls on Graham Arnold. Goodness gracious. What is it about A-League semi-finals?? 120 + 7 min: We’ve got an extended delay as Theoharous receives treatment. You’d imagine genuinely, the veteran really collected him to be fair. Kevin Muscat rages at the fourth official. Almost mandatory, really. 120 + 4 min: And the rain comes back. Call it pathetic fallacy (look it up). Graham Arnold looks forlorn once again. Wilkshire goes through Theoharous. Have they lost their discipline? Probably. To be fair though, one of their teammates just got choked by an opposite member of the coaching staff, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯? 120 min: And we have another five added minutes! We’ve played about two. Theoharous limps after that scything challenge from Zullo. Okay, let’s do football again. Athiu steps in, he pinches off the toes of Ninkovic, and is fouled in the process. The Victory players celebrate. There’s about 90 seconds left in this. This is ridiculous. What is going on. Somewhere in the aftermath of that Antonis goal, Victory assistant coach JP DeMarigny has run onto the pitch and appeared to have thrown a punch at Sydney FC’s David Carney!! We stop for a VAR review; and the assistant coach is shown a red card. We stop again, and Victory’s goalkeeping coach has been sent to the stands as well; replays suggest he too has run on to choke Carney!! Apparently Matt Simon and Mattias Sanchez have also been booked. What is going on. Like actually. And now Zullo’s been booked. For footballing reasons though. 117 min: You cannot script this! I mean, if you did script it, you’d script this - because, wow. Terry Antonis was crying at full-time; now he’s crying again! Ninkovic gets caught in possession on half-way, Antonis picks his pocket, and somehow slips past both the Serbian and the defender Warland. He’s runs directly at goal. There’s 30m still to eat up, but he’s got no other plan but to go straight at goal. He shapes, fires across Redmayne, and it’s there! The net bulges!! 114 min: Freekick Sydney as Carney tangles with Barbarouses. Wowee. Deng with a leaping tackle on Simon, inside the box! Call that brave or absolutely gobsmackingly fool-hardy, but he’s pulled it off, the Victory centre half. 114 minutes gone, and the 21-year-old backs his aching legs. Remarkable. 111 min: Simon continues his battle with Deng. Both literal, and metaphorical that is. Sydney FC fire in a corner, but Adrian can’t find a teammate. Are they the side more likely to go for it here, Sydney? The visitors don’t appear to have really recovered from seeing their heroic regulation-time win snatched from their gaping maws. 108 min: Freekick to Sydney as Donachie is adjudged to have fouled Bobo. Adrian (ADRIAN!) fires it in. Simon goes to ground, screaming for a penalty. On second glance, there’s half a shout for that. But VAR thankfully keeps stumm. It would perhaps be a travesty if this game was decided by the men with the joysticks upstairs. Brosque and Arnold remonstrate bitterly with the fourth official, but to no avail. 105 min: And we go again! Who’d be a football coach? And what a study in human psychology we have ahead of us. Carney and Sanchez tangle, the Victory player comes out of it worse, actually sans pantaloons! A moment of levity among the high drama of which even Shakespeare would have been proud. Amazing stuff. He’s literally dacked him. 105 min: Not too much in the first extra fifteen to rake over. Victory understandably a bit flat, and Sydney fashioning at best half-chances. Both sets of players perhaps now starting to turn their minds to deathstrikes penalties. Who will be putting their hands up for that? Might be immaterial; we’ve still got fifteen minutes to play. 104 min: Sydney FC with another set-piece, and again it’s the physical presence of Matt Simon that earns the foul. Adrian whips in but Thomas comes well to punch clear. He’s been busy tonight, the Victory custodian, but in fairness he’s hardly put a foot wrong. 101 min: It’s a contrast of emotions on the touchline. Graham Arnold might have been mentally saying his goodbyes with 90 +5 minutes on the clock; now he’s a man having been spared execution and it’s an utterly deflated JP DeMarigny on the Victory bench. The assistant allowed to take in the disappointment, but Muscat channels his frustrations elsewhere; towards to fourth official. 98 min: Victory now with a corner, it’s Antonis over it. His former fans aren’t backwards in giving him the razz. The Cove even give him an ironic chant of his name. The poor lad. He puts it right into the arms of Redmayne and the cheers continue. 95 min: Sydney FC look to play it round the back, both sides taking a slight respite, and in fairness, who can really blame them after that late drama. Meanwhile, Ray from Malmsbury raises a good point: Victory put four away – trouble is, two of them were in their own net. Moral “victory”! Yep. True, Ray. But you can’t bank silverware with moral victories. 93 min: Shot! Sydney look to strike early against a presumably demoralised Victory. Simon is putting himself about with gusto, and the loose ball falls to Adrian. He rolls out to Bobo who drills a fierce shot, but from an acute angle Thomas covers well. We go again! And who would have picked this. The team with arguably one of the most fearsome front fours ever assembled in A-League history, survives to fight again courtesy of not one, but two, own goals! And deep into added time! Anyway, we’ve got bonus football happening. I can’t even keep up. Can you believe this?! Sydney FC have absolutely jagged one here. Melbourne Victory - for such long periods of this game, in reasonable control, but from nothing - they’ve thrown it away. Wowee, wowee, wow. How to pick up from here. Two minutes ago Besart Berisha was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. Now the Victory bench looks like it’s come from a funeral. 90 + 5 min: Would you believe it!! This is shattering for the away fans. Fifteen seconds to play, and Terry Antonis wants the ground to open up and swallow him! Sydney besiege the away box. Adrian loops in and Simon wins the header. It nods down to Carney, he flicks to Ninkovic, Thomas rebuffs the shot, it comes back in from the other side, and with seemingly nothing at play, the former FC player scoops a tired clearance back into his net!! He’s sliced it, and the whistle for end-of-regulation-time sounds! Antonis is in tears. The poor kid has to pick himself up and play 30 more. We’re headed to extra time!! 90 + 4 min: And they’ve got another chance here Sydney - they feed back in again, and it’s a free header!! Warland! Free in the box! He rises and flicks - and it drifts inches wide! 90 + 2 min: .. and it rattles the crossbar!! You wouldn’t believe it - of all people, it’s the young centre back from Adelaide with a sumptuous volley from the edge of the box, it beats Thomas, but it can’t beat the frame of the goal! 90 min: There are five added minutes, and here comes the Theoharous sub. It’s George to make way. We’re one minute down, and Sydney resort to lumping it long for the dual towers of Simon and Bobo. Ninkovic looks to weave some magic. O’Neill fires one back into the mix, they’re throwing everything at it now, and it’s a volley from Warland .. 87 min: Chance! Victory go route one and it’s Barbarouses who wins the header (wot?) - he flicks on to George who tries to flash one from an acute angle, but Redmayne has his angles covered. George stays down, to the anger of the Sydney ‘keeper. They’re adept in the arts of ‘game management’ are Melbourne Victory, who are looking to introduce Theoharous for another 30-second sapping contribution. 85 min: Antonis heads to the sideline to receive attention for a head-knock. Home fan ire rises commensurately. It’s really starting to look like it’s not going to happen for the reigning champions and premiers. What can they muster. 83 min: Broxham and Athiu look to combine as Muscat urges his chargers on with some animation from the sideline. Some glum looking faces in the FC active support area, The Cove. Victory earn a corner, and they take their sweet time going about it, as is their prerogative I guess. 81 min: Broxham clatters Wilkshire late, and now Kenny Athiu is ushered into the action to replace Berisha. The Kosovan takes his time to depart. He’ll claim he didn’t see the board, but for about half-a-minute then it looked like Victory’s marksman just point blank didn’t fancy getting subbed! 79 min: Victory have to be careful here, they can’t afford to drop too deep and just set out their stall to defend. Sydney enjoy back-to-back corners. Are they building some late pressure? 76 min: Chance! Wowee, these Arnold changes are getting straight into it. Less than sixty seconds on, and it’s Carney almost with the equaliser! A terrific looping header from Bobo, which Thomas does well to claw out; but the spilled ball falls to Carney and again the Victory custodian is there to deny FC! It was drilled straight at him in fairness, but fine reactions nevertheless. 75 min: Well how about this. Fifteen minutes to go, and the all-conquering premiers, Sydney FC, could be staring at the end of the road. David Carney looks to be limbering up - is this the third and final change for Arnold? Ooh. An attacking shift - the defensive mid Brillante is sacrificed and the ginger assassin enters the fray. 72 min: O’Neill lines up the freekick - but it floats just over. It was one of those classic ones where it’s almost TOO close to the goal, not allowing the taker to really get under it and generate some oomph. And Muscat responds with his first change - it’s Mattias Sanchez who comes on for the goalscorer, Troisi. 70 min: And remarkably after 70 minutes without a single yellow card, we’ve had two in a minute! Troisi goes into the book for a late clatter on Adrian, and then it’s Antonis penalised as Simon goes down just outside the box. And we’ve got a mini-melee! Ladies and Gentlemen - the Matt Simon effect! 68 min: It’s the skipper Brosque who makes way. He’s not had the influence on this encounter that he’d perhaps have wanted, Sydney’s all-time top goalscorer. And the people get what they came for: Simon. 66 min: Thomas goes down after a late challenge from Warland whilst coming to claim a cross. A bit naughty that from the young defender, an old hip and shoulder to tickle the ribs. And Graham Arnold has seen enough: Matt Simon warning - the human wrecking ball could be about the enter the fray. I repeat, Matt Simon. Incoming. 64 min: Melbourne working very hard to press Sydney and not allow their flair players too much space. We’ve hardly seen Bobo involved at all, which conversely means there hasn’t been too many opportunities for Ninkovic or Adrian to feed the 27-goal striker. 62 min: Chance! Thumping strike from Brillante, it arrows for the bottom corner, but Thomas gets down well to tip it around the post! A weak clearance from Nigro starts the opportunity - Brillante does ever so well, but is denied. 60 min: But George strikes the wall. Danger averted, and Sydney look to try and break quickly. The crowd try to lift their side once more. A few nerves floating round Allianz stadium at the moment you sense. 58 min: The home fans look to get a ‘Viking clap’ going to lift their side. This is looking, well, you don’t want to say comfortable, for Victory, but it’s certainly not the performance most would be expecting from the premiers. And Broxham is brought down just outside the box - huge set piece chance for Leroy George; what can he fashion? 55 min: Oh no the Buijs. There was talk the Dutchman had been struggling all week with a back tweak, but as he went to twist and pass then the centre defender has crumbled to the turf. A sad way to end the season if his teammates can’t give him one more game to aim for. On comes Ben Warland - the first substitution of the game. 52 min: Sydney now looking to build from the back. Victory aren’t exactly sitting back, but they’re making it apparent to their hosts that if they’re going to get back into this, they’ll have to show a bit more ambition and industry. Ninkovic looking to get more involved and he combines with Adrian but the Victory defence does enough to snuff out the attack. 49 min: Deary me. First close up of Graham Arnold rocking his ‘grumpy cat’ look. And fair play to him, that’s not the kind of error we’ve come to expect from his side over the past two seasons. Full credit to Victory, they’ve been clinical and hungry, pouncing on any scraps they’ve been handed. 46 min: Gee whiz! How’s this for a start. Graham Arnold and staff were probably only making their way back out when that went in - what a horror start for the Sky Blues! It all stems from a FC freekick, as Buijs (no the Buijs!) fails to find Brillante to produce the turnover. Berisha looks to take on the backline, then picks a terrific pass past three in sky blue to find Troisi far post for little more than a tap-in. Game on! 45 min: And we’re back underway. What does this second stanza have in store? Victory get us rolling. And we’ve got our first Riley McGree imitator. That didn’t take long: Meanwhile, the former Mayor of Gosford, now Lord of Newcastle is in the house: Cheeky. So, your thoughts on that 45? Stats-wise FC have dominated possession (56-44%) and technically boast six shots to five; but were they the more dangerous? How’d you see that unfold - fire me your musings and predictions. And remember, there’s no such thing as a bad prediction. Even if somebody then posts it on the internet, it goes half-way round the world, and then stays in the metadata of a Facebook app-partner forever, and ever. 45 min: Sydney look to whip in one last testing cross, and Nigro cops a nasty elbow to the noggin as he makes to clear. For half a second it almost looked another looping own-goal. But Kurt Ams’ whistle brings us to a close. What a fascinating first stanza! 43 min: A bit of zip going out of this, possibly for the first time in the opening stanza as both XIs start to ponder half-time perhaps. Ninkovic works hard in defence to shut down Nigro, showing that flair and graft can sometimes coexist. 40 min: Fine work from Wilkshire at the back after Antonis dinks a ball through for Barbarouses. The right back recovers and shuts down the space with Redmayne also quick to respond. Kevin Muscat appears to have done his homework tonight, Victory are really finding opportunities out wide and in transition. 38 min: Save! Brosque with some fine work to put through Adrian (ADRIAN!) - he’s one on one with Thomas, but the Victory custodian does well to stand tall. The Pole looks to dink past him, but it strikes the face-region of the man in fluoro green. Important save! This already feels far from the cagey encounter many predicted. 35 min: Sydney FC try to reassert some midfield dominance, as Brillante and O’Neill look to string passes. It falls to the former-Fiorentina man who lines one up from distance but that’s no trouble for Thomas. 33 min: And Victory with another decent eighteen-yard-box intrusion here, Berisha does well to pick out Troisi, but the Melbourne playmaker dallies and the opportunity is lost! They’re not exactly under the hammer, Sydney FC, but it’s looking far from a controlled first third of the game from the premiers. 30 min: And just like that we’re all square! Victory break down the left, their wingers have changed sides, and with Wilkinson to run at, the former-Phoenix flyer jinks and cuts and curls an effort past the centreback - it strikes Buijs centrally and takes a wicked deflection - Redmayne powerless to stop that; oh no the Buijs!! 28 min: It’s not been a niggly or nasty game so far, but we have seen plenty of set piece opportunities. Adrian looks to fire another one for the home side but he’s overhit it and Buijs (yeah the Buijs) is unable to keep it in. 25 min: A corner now for Victory as they look to make immediate amends. George is over it, he fires to the far post but Redmayne comes and claims. Some grumbling in the crowd as Valeri appears to handball, Maradona-esque, in the attacking move that earns the corner. Crime doesn’t prosper, kids. 22 min: Oh dear. And how costly has that Rhys Williams injury already proven - his replacement has had a huge influence on this game! Adrian fires in a well-whipped freekick, there’s a throng of players looking to get on the end of it, but with no Sky Blue players contesting the header it’s ricocheted of the shoulder of the unfortunate Nigro and beaten his ‘keeper Thomas at his far post. Horrible luck for the Victory, but Sydney will take it! 20 min: They’re not exactly rattled here, Sydney, but Graham Arnold and FC fans might be concerned about the freedom with which Victory seem to be fashioning some of these counterattacks. Meanwhile, on transition it’s Valeri who’s fortunate to avoid the book as he scythes down Ninkovic. What can they fashion from this? 18 min: And our first key moment - as Barbarouses clatters the post! He was well found by his flying opposite winger, George, he connected sweetly with his effort, struck it with venom towards Redmayne’s near post, but it’s thundered back off the upright! 15 min: George tries one from a very acute angle.. flashes the side netting! Both sides finding joy down the flanks. No surprises given the quality out wide. And bad news out of Western Sydney (their A-League season aside), as Michelle emails in: Hey Richard, no power here in North Parra. So no tv. Relying on The Guardian to keep us up to date on the game. On the game itself, part of me wants to see Victory put esfc to the sword, another wants to see Newcastle do it in the GF. Hoping its an epic battle either way. Right, back to your updates Cheers Michelle - and hoping the power comes back on in time for deathstrikes penalties. Then you can really taste the salty tears of [insert nemesis]. 13 min: And suddenly it’s Sydney attacking. Wilkshire scampers down the right and looks to whip one in. Adrian (ADRIAN!) stoops to head inside the box but it’s snapped off his gleaming pate by the boot of Donachie. Nosferatu The Polish winger shows his disappointment. 11 min: The rain has really ramped up a bit here at Allianz stadium. Squalling and whirling. Almost Cake-Tin-esque. Victory break down the left, and George almost picks out Berisha. Buijs to the rescue. Yeah the Buijs. 9 min: Broxham is now deemed to have handballed - Adrian (insert Rocky scream) is over it.. but he drives it hard into the wall, and the danger is averted. 7 min: Barbarouses released with a terrific raking crossfield ball from Broxham. He’s one on one, but the assistant referee signals for offside! On second glance he seems hard done by there, the Kiwi, but either way the attack is abruptly halted. 5 min: An early coming together between George and Wilkshire. Hints of a forearm press across the upper chest/throat region on replay from the Sydney FC defender but it goes unpunished. Kurt Ams our man in the middle tonight. 3 min: Sydney enjoying some early possession with their metronomic duo of Brillante and O’Neill caressing it around the middle. They break down the left and look to unleash Zullo, but the flying fullback is unable to fashion a dangerous cross. 1 min: And we’re underway! Sydney FC get us going amid gentle drizzle in Sydney, and immediately launch a long ball looking for one of their dangerous wide men. Overhit, and into touch. Nevertheless, good to see young Josh Hope coming onto the Victory bench. They’ve bloodied some fine young talents this season, Victory, and alongside Christian Theoharous, Hope’s been about the pick of them. Can he be a late game-changer? Our players have made their way out of the tunnel, so we’re not too far away from kick-off now. Handshakes exchanged, so we should be about three minutes away from the first yellow card-worthy moment. And scarcely have we got our buildup underway, there’s a big early talking point. Huge blow, this for the Victory. The 14-cap Socceroo is so important to their defensive line-up, and while Stefan Nigro has played a fair bit in recent months and will slot in capably at fullback, you never want to lose one of your key on-field leaders. Thomas Deng presumably moves back to centre back, as he and James Donachie look to shackle the imposing aerial presence of Sydney FC’s Bobo. Sydney FC It’s as expected from the home side who once again due to their preternatural strength and conditioning witchcraft enjoy a full squad to choose from: Redmayne (GK); Wilkshire, Buijs, Wilkinson, Zullo; O’Neill, Brillante, Brosque (c), Adrian, Ninkovic; Bobo Melbourne Victory And it’s an unchanged lineup from the XI that took on Adelaide United last weekend for the visitors: Thomas (GK); Broxham, Williams, Donachie, Deng; Antonis, Valeri (c), Troisi, George, Barbarouses; Berisha Terry Antonis facing his old club being one of the more intriguing battles, as will the match up between shy and retiring Jordy Buijs and said Berisha. I wonder if he’s been on the phone to fellow Dutchman Pascal Bosschaart for tips during the week. Victory will be also keen to see which of their wingers show up this week - the “I can score at will from 30m” model Kosta Barbarouses, or the “put me in yellow and black and send me out to face Melbourne City every week” version. Hi all! What a game we presumably have in store tonight. Richard Parkin in the chair to take you through all the highs and lows of this one. I don’t know about you, but I’m certainly still reeling from that remarkable Riley McGree goal from last night’s first semi-final. And here was I thinking Bes’ overhead goal to snatch it at the death against Adelaide United in the preliminary final was high drama. As always this “rolling report” is a train that picks up all passengers. If you have quips, tips or observations that will illuminate and enrich all our lives please get in touch. Fire an email to richard.parkin.casual@theguardian.com or find me on twitter @rrjparkin to join the coverage. You could get your name in lights - like this plucky newcomer to A-League football! Ah yes. Can Victory “do the impossible” indeed. In a two-team game of football. Bless those plucky underdogs from the wrong side of the tracks. It’s another Big Blue - Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory - the two most successful clubs in the competition’s young history, with six premierships and six championships between them. They were last season’s grand finalists and while Sydney FC might appear to have the edge on their southern rivals, courtesy their three triumphs during the regular season this campaign, the fact remains: Sydney FC have never beaten Victory in a finals match without recourse to deathstrikes penalties. Both coaches (and playing groups) have already lit the dubious torch of pre-game mindgames. After Sydney FC’s skipper Alex Brosque suggested his side had a mental edge, Kevin Muscat fired back with a salvo about “expectations” that almost conjured the ghost of Tim Flowers and “bottle”. And if that seemed possibly ill-conceived, Graham Arnold went one better - by decided Besart Berisha was the guy he’d try and wind up pre-game. Because the Albanian is notoriously someone who needs motivating. Talk aside, tonight’s game will be a massive challenge for Sydney FC, who have all but cakewalked the race for the premiership, and would be smarting after a disappointing capitulation in the Asian Champions League. Expert it to be tight, to be tense, to be nasty. So, basically a classic Big Blue. Richard Parkin will be here shortly to take you through all tonight’s action. In the interim, if you’ve been living under a rock and haven’t seen it yet - check out Riley McGree’s wonderstrike from semi-final one and join the debate; is this the greatest goal the A-League’s ever seen?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/29/first-ever-pill-testing-trial-at-australian-music-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T00:02:26Z","webTitle":"First ever pill-testing trial at Australian music festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/first-ever-pill-testing-trial-at-australian-music-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/29/first-ever-pill-testing-trial-at-australian-music-festival","fields":{"headline":"First ever pill-testing trial at Australian music festival","bodyText":"Pill testing will be trialled for the first time at an Australian music festival, in a move that advocates say will reduce drug-related harm. Revellers at Canberra’s Groovin the Moo festival will be able to have their illegal drugs tested for harmful chemicals by STA-SAFE, an independent consortium of health groups, without the threat of legal prosecution. The multi-day festival, which began on Friday in Wayville in South Australia, will arrive in Canberra on Sunday, where the pill testing will be made available for one day. The proposal has been previously been approved by the University of Canberra, on whose grounds the festival will be held, the territory’s health minister and police. Participants will provide a scraping or small sample of their pill or powder to volunteers, who then analyse it in a mobile laboratory. Staff provide attendees with the results of the test, as well as the risks and side effects of consuming the substance. Festivalgoers will be able to throw their drugs into an amnesty bin, which uses bleach to “completely destroy any drugs deposited in them to the extent that they could not be recovered or used”, according to ACT Health. Geoff Munro, the policy manager at the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, said pill testing would reduce the overall rate of drug taking at the festival, and prevent overdoses. “When people are buying pills and powders on the street they can never be sure what is in them,” he said. “Very often people are playing Russian roulette. It may be a highly dangerous chemical, or it may be a much stronger drug that they believe it is. “It will reduce overdoses, it will reduce some dangerous drug taking and it will save lives,” he said. The ACT’s health minister, Meegan Fitzharris, welcomed the move. “The trial does not condone illicit drug use, however it will provide an opportunity to encourage people who are considering using illicit drugs to modify their behaviour in ways that reduce risks of harm to their health,” she said. The pill testing facility at Sunday’s festival will be located near first aid services, and users will be provided with medical cubicles to ensure their privacy. However the ACT opposition’s shadow attorney general, Jeremy Hanson, attacked the move on Friday, saying it would encourage “pill popping”. “I’m very concerned about the young people who are now going to be taking drugs under the misapprehension that these drugs are safe,” he said. “This is sending a very bad message about drug use in the ACT. It’s essentially saying we’re the pill popping centre of Australia.” The ACT Health website states that pill testing staff do not tell attendees that drug use is safe. “Even with laboratory level testing, service staff never advise users that the drug they are taking is ‘safe’. Illicit drugs such as amphetamines and MDMA are inherently unsafe and pill testing cannot certify that a person will not suffer an adverse reaction as a result of taking them.” Munro said that pill testing was likely to reduce drug taking, rather than increase it. “There is no evidence that pill testing encourages drug taking and that has been the evidence from Britain and Europe where they have been drug checking for several years now. “The only real effect that pill testing can have is to reduce drug taking, because some people will discover that their drug isn’t what they think it is.” He added that pill testing would provide police and ambulance services with a better idea of what kinds of contaminants and chemicals were present in illegal drugs. “We need to have more than one trial,” he said. “It may take people some time to gain the confidence of the system. I think we have a lot to discover about administering this kind of service.” The ACT’s chief minister, Andrew Barr, said he “didn’t have a view” about the program. “It’s not an issue I’m particularly passionate about one way or the other, but I’m happy for this process to proceed,” he said in response to questions from ABC Radio Canberra’s Jamie Travers. Groovin the Moo takes place over six days in different locations across the country. Only the Canberra date will have pill testing. On Friday, a 20-year-old woman was taken to hospital after a suspected drug overdose at Groovin the Moo’s Wayville show. She remains in a stable condition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/27/fashion-meets-catholicism-offensive-or-brilliant-pr","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T22:07:45Z","webTitle":"Fashion meets Catholicism: offensive or brilliant PR?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/27/fashion-meets-catholicism-offensive-or-brilliant-pr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/27/fashion-meets-catholicism-offensive-or-brilliant-pr","fields":{"headline":"Fashion meets Catholicism: offensive or brilliant PR?","bodyText":"Next month sees the opening of the Met’s highly anticipated exhibition, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. The exhibition is the Met’s largest show to date but also, given the theme, could prove controversial. Famously preceded by a celebrity-studded, red carpet gala of the same theme and hosted by US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, it is a highlight of New York’s social calendar. But precisely how it will explore the relationship between fashion and religion has become a hot topic. “It has the potential to offend some Catholics, and there is likely a worry that it might seem frivolous to combine fashion with Catholicism” says Luke Coppen, editor of the Catholic Herald. “But it is worth taking the risk by giving a window into its past and showing how culturally prominent it can be.” The exhibition will feature 50 or so papal robes and accessories borrowed from the Vatican alongside key pieces from designers such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. A dialogue with the Vatican over how the exhibition would look began in 2015, with curators consulting representatives from several Catholic groups. Pope Francis has neither endorsed the show nor officially approved of the theme, although Cardinal Ravasi, president of the Pontifical Council for Culture and a cardinal for the Catholic church, has. Ravasi declined to be interviewed, but in a statement to the Guardian said: “Liturgical vestments are a veritable mirror of the historical phases of the Catholic church,” suggesting the show will demonstrate just how much the church has progressed under Pope Francis. The exhibition is being viewed as a rather brilliant piece of PR for a faith which, historically, has demonstrated its power through opulent vestments. Under Francis, the Vatican has sought to put a more humble face forward. The timing is fundamental, agrees Anne Higonnet, professor of art history at Barnard College of Columbia University, who is hosting a series of talks at the Met titled Art, Clothing, and the Catholic Imagination. “Pope Francis has made opulent liturgical vestments history,” she says. “His sartorial humility now means this is the moment to do it. “When you look at the fabulously ornate ecclesiastical garments, one is confronted with the financial power of the Catholic church and the intentionally visible wealth worn by Catholic prelates. “At the very spiritual end of the Catholic spectrum there has now been a renunciation of wealth.” Higonnet thinks the connection is clear: “The impulse to clothe the body in a spectacular way that continues to conceal the human body is a very powerful part of the Catholic imagination,” she says. It is an impulse that is at the very heart of high fashion. Many of the designers featured in the exhibition were raised Catholic, including Elsa Schiaparelli, Riccardo Tisci and Jeanne Lanvin. “Religion was always going to aesthetically inform their work,” says Coppen. Spanish designer Cristobel Balenciaga was raised Catholic, and designed the cassock worn by the priest who delivered Christian Dior’s eulogy. The exhibition also features a Chanel wedding gown inspired by a communion dress, and a Dolce &amp; Gabbana mosaic piece from the AW13 collection. To counter any potential fray, garments provided by the Vatican will be shown separately to the rest of the clothes. The last time this many Vatican pieces were shown in the US was 35 years ago. When you consider the relationship between the carnal and the spiritual, the mortal body and the garments around it, “you think of Balenciaga”, says Higonnet. “He understood how you express the human body and how you produce a surrounding for it. The body is mortal. But what surrounds it is not.” In many ways, she says, the Spanish fashion house is the three-dimensional embodiment of the Catholic aesthetic. As to how this will manifest itself on the red carpet is up for debate – and the gala provides a slightly different context. Often dubbed “the Oscars of the east coast”, it is sponsored by Versace, a label which has long integrated Catholic iconography into its work. The opening night party for the Costume Institute’s exhibition will see the famous and powerful interpret this theme at the Beaux Arts palace. Rihanna is co-chairing the event with Amal Clooney and Anna Wintour. “There has always been an extreme polarisation between the awesome vestments and the monastic sublime”, says Higonnet. The tension then will be between this extravagance and humility. She thinks celebrities will look to the three corners of the Catholic imagination for inspiration, “so I’m thinking a lot of opulent encrusted magnificence, a lot of austere bold shapes, and a lot of angel gear”. Other designers likely to appear on the red carpet include Japanese designers, Rei Kawakubo (whose work was the theme of last year’s exhibition), and Yohji Yamamoto, famous for his collaboration with David Bowie, whose approach to silhouette also adheres to the theme. Historically, male guests at the gala tend towards regulation black tie. Pope Francis curiously won Esquire’s best dressed man in 2013 – for “black shoes and unadorned, simplistic regalia”. Both Higonnet and Coppen think they may well look to Jude Law’s character in HBO’s The Young Pope, a glorious celebration of papal finery, but which paved the way for putting “Pope Francis back into the pop cultural world – and laid the ground for exhibitions” says Coppen. Higonnet adds: “I anticipate some marvellous use of cassock-like forms and some very beautiful silks.” Higonnet thinks the marriage between celebrities and fashion houses is crucial to the exhibition’s success at “creating a hinge between costume institute and contemporary fashion”. Still, the red carpet interpretation remains anyone’s guess. “The outfits for the gala will probably be as tied to the latest fashion trends as they are to anything within the Catholic imagination”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/28/lynching-memorial-backlash-montgomery-alabama","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Lynching memorial leaves some quietly seething: 'Let sleeping dogs lie'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/28/lynching-memorial-backlash-montgomery-alabama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/28/lynching-memorial-backlash-montgomery-alabama","fields":{"headline":"Lynching memorial leaves some quietly seething: 'Let sleeping dogs lie'","bodyText":"Black men were lynched for “standing around”, for “annoying white girls”, for failing to call a policeman “mister”. Those are just a few of the horrific stories on display at a new national memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, Alabama. One mile away, another historical monument tells a very different tale about the American south: the First White House of the Confederacy celebrates the life of “renowned American patriot” Jefferson Davis, who served as the president of the Confederate states, while making virtually no mention of the hundreds of black people he and his family enslaved. The contradictions of Montgomery’s historical narratives were on full display this week as thousands of tourists and progressive activists flocked to the city to mark the opening of the country’s first memorial to lynching victims – while some locals quietly seethed, saying they resented the new museum for dredging up the past and feared it would incite anger and backlash within black communities. “It’s going to cause an uproar and open old wounds,” said Mikki Keenan, a 58-year-old longtime Montgomery resident, who was eating lunch at a southern country-style restaurant a mile from the memorial. Local residents, she said, feel “it’s a waste of money, a waste of space and it’s bringing up bullshit”. “It keeps putting the emphasis on discrimination and cruelty,” chimed in her friend, who asked not to be named for fear that her child would disapprove of her remarks. The memorial, she added, could spark violence. The angry and in some cases blatantly racist reactions to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and accompanying Legacy Museum provided a window into some white Americans’ deep resistance to confronting the nation’s brutal history of racial violence, from slavery to mass incarceration. While celebrities and civil rights icons lauded the memorial as a powerful symbol of America’s shame and a turning point toward healing, some conservatives in Alabama rolled their eyes at the project, saying they were more concerned with saving Confederate monuments, now under threat from leftwing activists. Alabama’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, wasn’t present at the memorial launch, but did release a video promoting her efforts to preserve Confederate monuments a week prior. Seated at the front porch of the First White House on a sunny morning, curator Bob Wieland said he supported the Legacy Museum, but felt strongly that Confederate landmarks be preserved, especially as the city is changing and the “sleepy old cotton south falls away”. That means, he said, “keeping this museum [the First White House] just to have a positive taste, an old south taste, as the new comes up”. Asked about criticisms that the state-funded First White House “whitewashes” the evils of slavery, Wieland said, “We could certainly tone down the celebration [of Davis], but … it is part of civil war history.” Discussing the lack of references to slavery, he said the museum was “more of a political military history” than a “social history”. While some of the most vocal Alabama defenders of Confederate monuments said they broadly backed the concept of a lynching memorial, they also expressed anxiety about its impact, some reverting to racist stereotypes of African American rioters. “Bring that stuff to light, and let it be there, but don’t dwell on it,” said Tommy Rhodes, a member of the Alabama Sons of Confederate Veterans. “We have moved past it … You don’t want to entice them and feed any fuel to the fire.” Randall Hughey, another member who also owns a local radio station, emphasized his support of the museum – but also repeatedly questioned the veracity of its facts. “They have every right to have the memorial, if it’s accurate,” he said, adding that he was perplexed by reports of more than 4,000 lynchings. “That seems pretty incredible to me that there would be that many documented lynchings … That was not the norm.” Equal Justice Initiative, the group behind the memorial and lynching data, did six years of research and made extensive visits to southern sites. Mary Massey, a 58-year-old nurse on her way to lunch in Montgomery, expressed disdain at the project: “We didn’t have nothing to do with that. I think they just need to leave it alone. It’s just stirring up something.” Her husband, Jim, said he supported the memorial as a way to recognize a “horrible” piece of black history, but added: “It’s gone and won’t happen again.” He also said he suspected that for many in Montgomery, the reaction was: “Let sleeping dogs lay.” Keenan, who is Native American, said she would never visit the memorial and was worried it would exacerbate “racism” in Montgomery: “It ain’t gonna change that. It’s going to get it started more.” At the opening day of the memorial – which features hanging steel monuments dangling like bodies above the visitors – some black Alabamians said they felt optimistic. “For so long, society has put a shadow over these things,” said Brittany Willie, a 19-year-old from Huntsville, Alabama, who found an engraving of the name of one of her ancestors. “People are going to see this and realize these people were innocent. They were killed for who they are.” “This is something our children need to know, so they can understand the struggle,” added Victoria Dunn, a 40-year-old Montgomery resident, who came with her husband. “This is going to be something embraced by everybody.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/29/fsg-grand-plan-liverpool-anfield-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"FSG’s grand plan for Liverpool bears fruit on pitch and the streets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/fsg-grand-plan-liverpool-anfield-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/29/fsg-grand-plan-liverpool-anfield-poverty","fields":{"headline":"FSG’s grand plan for Liverpool bears fruit on pitch and the streets","bodyText":"Throughout Tuesday’s exhilarating Champions League night at Anfield, when Roma were overpowered by Jürgen Klopp’s resurgent Liverpool, there was an irresistible sense of a whole club, not just a team, coming to fruition. Eight years after the Boston Red Sox owners, Fenway Sports Group, bought Liverpool and cleared the £200m debt from the dismal 2007 acquisition by Tom Hicks and George Gillett, the club have been greatly renewed. Their old ground, in which supporters’ songs recall European adventures under Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, has been transformed by the booming new £114m main stand and the strolling and shopping space outside that was claimed around it. It may seem an odd fate for the few people who were left in Lothair Road and one side of Alroy Road after 20 years of shocking blight, to be moved and the three rows knocked down to make way for that space, but Liverpool have done it up tastefully. It is not all about the new corporate areas and megastore and the Hilton hotel shortly expected to be announced; the memorial to the 96 people killed at Hillsborough 29 years ago is a centerpiece outside the stand. Step outside these environs into the Anfield neighbourhood, where the club played a shameful part in the dereliction, buying up houses and leaving them empty for years, and much of the blight has finally been addressed. The terraced rows previously “tinned up” have mostly been refurbished by landlords including the YHG housing association which owns 92 houses. The private developer Keepmoat has built 400 new homes with more planned. Liverpool city council was able to lever in £25m from its capital programme and the Homes and Communities Agency contributed £10m. The Homebaked bakery, a community cooperative, does a thriving trade in Shankly pies and other treats and has plans to develop the empty houses on its row. A new parade of shops and food outlets is planned to replace the tired buildings on Walton Breck Road, where the Hillsborough Justice Campaign shop is based. The club have heeded calls for better relations by setting up the “red neighbours” scheme, providing community activities including a breakfast club for disadvantaged children, school visits and space in the Kenny Dalglish stand to host events. Ann O’Byrne, Liverpool’s deputy mayor and cabinet member for regeneration, recalls the anger she found among residents when her local Labour party won a majority on the council in 2010 and pledged to reverse the area’s decline: “We talk about neighbours, and Liverpool Football Club needs to be a good neighbour as well,” she says. “People are still annoyed with the club after what they suffered but the club has stepped up. They have built a relationship; tensions are still there but not that pathological hatred of the club.” Yet the contrasts in Anfield and neighbouring Everton are alarming, between the city’s Premier League institutions and the poverty around them. Liverpool made £364m in revenues last year and a £40m profit, boosted by the first season of main stand corporate subscribers, while Everton at the cramped Goodison Park still made £222m, including a £52m profit on trading players. The numbers for the areas around them are dispiriting: 11 of the neighbourhoods are among the most deprived 1% in the whole country. In Anfield 43% of children live in poverty, according to the latest assessment cited by the council; in Everton 49% of children were in poverty. Life expectancy is six and a half years lower than the national average of 81 and 32% of children growing up neighbouring the club were overweight, 10% higher than the national average. Jim Lawless, 70, and his daughter Jayne, 43, have lived through the traumas. A civil engineer, Jim bought his family home in Everton in 1974 but as houses fell empty around them, his wife, Liz, became depressed and they moved, to Tancred Road, a few streets from Anfield’s main stand. “We jumped from one hell hole to the club’s mess, from one fight to another,” he grimaces. “It was pretty catastrophic.” Jim acknowledges there has been “radical improvement” to the area, greatly reducing the blight, since FSG opted to scrap the club’s previous plan to build a new stadium on Stanley Park, got on with the main stand project and the housing regeneration began. Jayne says the wounds remain from so many years of misery, including the £30,000 charge now on the new family home after they were forced to move from Everton. Another sore, which pains them and others, is the loss of the Vernon Sangster sports centre, which was demolished to prepare Stanley Park for Hicks’ and Gillett’s stadium. A high-quality sports facility was promised for the new ground but, as the plans were scrapped, nothing materialised. Jayne recalls “the Verny” as a hub for youngsters when she grew up, remembering roller‑discos, trampolining and summer clubs alongside regular sport. “This is our biggest issue now,” Jim Lawless says. “We’ve got no facilities for the kids. You’ve got billionaires looking over Stanley Park. The club took one facility away. They should build a replacement.” The club and council point to the investment in facilities along the road at the Anfield Sports and Community Centre, formerly a youth club to which the Vernon Sangster operation was relocated. Marie Rooney, the centre’s manager, puts the development at £5.5m, from the council, Sport England, Football Foundation and Liverpool, whose foundation is based there, as is the Hillsborough Family Support Group office. A 2011 council feasibility study concluded that another sports facility in Anfield would not have enough use to be sustainable. But Ian Byrne, a local resident, committee member of the Spirit of Shankly supporters’ trust and co-founder of Fans Supporting Foodbanks, argues there is an urgent need for more community facilities. “It is low expectations to think kids here can’t have more amenities,” he says. “A tiny percentage of the club’s revenues could build something very valuable for the community.” In the absence of a commitment from Liverpool, Byrne and others are exploring the possibilities for a facility on one of the area’s cleared sites, on Priory Road. The council is supportive but does not have the money to build anything itself. Before Tuesday’s European Champions League semi-final Byrne and his fellow volunteers stationed their foodbank van, by agreement with the club, opposite the Anfield Road stand for donations. He is grateful for the club’s support but alarmed at the demand: in Anfield and Everton 1,888 people needed the free food last year, including 755 children. Like many still recovering from a 20-year nightmare, Byrne is grateful for what the club do now and believes they could contribute more. Whatever Liverpool do in this period of their reawakening under a charismatic manager and competent US owners, their stadium will remain unsettling outside, an epitome of Britain’s inequality. Owned by billionaires, fielding multimillionaire players, Anfield is a magnet for corporate customers while, in the car park opposite, fans are asked to donate food for the many people in the locality without enough to eat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/night-nanny-tully-wealthy-mothers-helper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T23:05:27Z","webTitle":"Night nannies are wealthy mothers’ latest must-have","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/night-nanny-tully-wealthy-mothers-helper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/night-nanny-tully-wealthy-mothers-helper","fields":{"headline":"Night nannies are wealthy mothers’ latest must-have","bodyText":"Charlize Theron’s latest movie, Tully, is billed as a comedy, but new parents will probably see it as something closer to a fly-on-the-wall horror film. Tully lays out the grisly anatomy of motherhood: from exhaustion and non-stop breast milk pumping to the overwhelming demands of a neglectful partner and the tantrums of the newborn’s siblings. Salvation for Theron’s character, Marlo, eventually arrives in the form of Tully, a night nanny. Cinemagoers without children will probably not have heard of these Mary Poppins-like figures, who are the subject of urgent discussions by many new mothers. Night nannies, or maternity nurses, will come to your house in the evening to spend all night looking after the baby – feeding and winding, changing nappies and soothing them to sleep – allowing frazzled parents some respite. Many promise to get the baby into a sleep routine and to train families in ways to make it happen. The number of night nannies has been increasing steadily, with several agencies providing maternity nurses. Anastasia Baker, a former BBC journalist, claims to have been the first when she set up Night Nannies in 1999 after her second baby. “I approached 17 agencies and no one was doing it,” Baker said. “Now we have about 200 nannies working in London and the south of England.” The agency has helped more than 10,000 families in that time, and demand is growing. Typically a night nanny will arrive at 9pm and stay until 7am at a cost of £155. If that only solves half the problem, it is possible to hire a maternity nurse who will be available 24 hours a day at a cost of £220 per day, plus a £100 agency fee. The opportunities for comedy are not obvious, but Julia Lannaman, who has been a night nanny since 2005, says there have been plenty of funny moments during her career. “One client had just had her first baby and she didn’t know anyone at all with a baby,” she said. “She gave me an empty Pepsi bottle and asked ‘can we use that to do the feed?’ ” Another client asked Lannaman to travel with her on a family holiday to a Spanish resort – but things went badly wrong when they embarked on the return flight. The mother refused to remove her baby from a car seat and hold it in her lap, as instructed by the cabin crew. “She had a proper meltdown,” Lannaman said. “The pilot became involved and we were escorted off the plane. We couldn’t get another flight, so they hired a private jet at a cost of €25,000. The cabin was so small I had to be sedated because I’m claustrophobic.” Most of her clients are much more easygoing. “I have worked for some lovely people,” Lannaman said. “Trust is crucial. When the client turns over a baby to you, they have to know that you will take care of it. You have to build a bond with the baby, and there are some beautiful moments.” There is a serious side to night nannying, because it is a way of taking the pressure off new mothers – if only for a few hours. Sarah – not her real name – was told about night nannies by a midwife after giving birth at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. “I began going through a divorce in my eighth month of pregnancy. We ended up in court in my ninth month. I also have a toddler. When my baby came two weeks early, possibly because of the stress, I knew I needed help.” She can only afford a night nanny for a couple of days a week. “But just having an extra pair of hands is so important. I need to look after both the children, so I need to have a sufficient amount of sleep.” Susie Whytock, one of the first night nannies to work with Baker’s agency, typically does a number of 24-hour shifts over a 14-day period to help cement the baby’s sleep pattern. “I met one client in Selfridges – she was a real high flyer,” Whytock said. “She said, ‘I’m having a meeting with my colleagues on Thursday to hand over, I’m booked in for a C-section on Friday, so I’ll see you on Saturday ... let’s see how this first week goes’.” By the end of the week, the second-time mother had gone through the hormone crash that affects many women and needed all the help that Whytock could give her. “At the end of the two weeks, she broke down. I could see she was in a dangerous place. I said ‘I’ll take you to my home for five days and you can stay with me.’ It helped head off post-natal depression, and now she’s like an adopted daughter to me.” She knows that her services are beyond the reach of most women but feels that early interventions could save the NHS a lot of money. “When I spot post-natal depression coming on I know I have to be quick to step in,” Whytock said. “Certainly, there are some dangerous situations that can develop that midwives and health visitors just won’t get a chance to see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/28/barrow-in-furness-drug-deaths-heroin-coastal-towns-blackpool","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Death by the sea: how drug abuse is scarring Britain’s coastal towns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/28/barrow-in-furness-drug-deaths-heroin-coastal-towns-blackpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/28/barrow-in-furness-drug-deaths-heroin-coastal-towns-blackpool","fields":{"headline":"Death by the sea: how drug abuse is scarring Britain’s coastal towns","bodyText":"In Barrow, Thirsty Thursday wasn’t as billed. Traditionally it’s the night when the thousands of employees working in the town’s cavernous warehouses where the next generation of Britain’s nuclear submarines are being built, hit the pubs. But last Thursday the Cumbrian coastal town seemed preternaturally quiet. By 6pm there were more seagulls than people in the town centre. A couple of restaurants were doing a lively trade, thanks to special happy-hour offers, but most were empty. Scores of boarded-up shops and “to let” signs suggested Barrow had seen better times. Geography plays a big part in this story. Clinging to the bottom of a peninsula overlooking the Irish Sea, Barrow, or Barrow-in-Furness to give it its proper name, is a place that few outside the defence, wind power or extractive gas industries are likely to visit. If anyone knows anything about Barrow it’s that it was the birthplace of footballer Emlyn Hughes and in 2014 was judged by the Office for National Statistics to be the most miserable place in Britain. Unlike Blackpool down the coast, there is no end-of-the-pier feel about Barrow. It’s a working town of terraced houses and tenements built when Barrow’s shipyards were thriving. But with only one road in and one road out, even those who live in the town accept that it can seem an isolated place. “They call it the longest cul-de-sac in Britain,” jokes Kimber-Lee Moore, 27, a bar worker who moved to the town from Carlisle four years ago. They are calling it something else, too, now. After 12 drug-related deaths since December, Barrow is now Britain’s most infamous “brown town”. A place that was once dubbed England’s Chicago because its economy was growing so fast is now synonymous with heroin. Cumbria’s heroin problem is not new. Scores of towns on the periphery of the Lake District have had their problems down the years. Penrith, 70 miles inland from Barrow, shed its reputation as a brown town years ago. But the scale of what is happening in Barrow has shocked even those with first-hand experience of the problem. “There have been drugs deaths elsewhere in the county, but not to the degree we’ve seen in Barrow. It’s totally disproportionate,” said DCI Nick Coughlan of Cumbria police. “The town’s population is only 67,000, so this is a lot.” To put this in perspective: fewer than two people per 100,000 of the population died from heroin or morphine misuse in England and Wales in 2016, the latest figures available. In Blackpool, the town that has the highest heroin death rate, the figure rises to 14 in 100,000. Barrow, tragically, is in danger of breaking all records before 2018 is even halfway through. “The deaths in Barrow are not all directly attributable to heroin, but the drugs they are using are ones we associate with heroin users,” Coughlan said. “Often they have taken cocktails of different drugs. Sometimes they involve heroin, sometimes methadone, sometimes other drugs.” Barrow’s unwelcome place on the growing list of coastal towns hit by the effects of drug addiction (six of the 10 heroin misuse hotspots in England and Wales last year were by the sea) has made it the subject of national attention. In recent weeks newspapers, websites and the BBC have descended on the town to cover the story, much to the dismay of Barrow’s supporters. “It’s stereotyping every hardworking person in the town,” said Craig O’Callaghan, a contractor from Middlesbrough who spends weeks at a time in Barrow when he’s working on the gas rigs. “It has pockets of problems, but it’s not the Bronx,” Moore agreed. But Coughlan, who was once a sergeant in Barrow and calls its residents “salt of the earth people”, said the police had intelligence suggesting there has been an increase in the amount of drugs entering the town in recent months. Whether this reflects wider national trends is hard to say. Evidence is conflicting. The number of heroin seizures has been decreasing in the past three years. But purity levels have shot up to near 50%, a vast recovery from the “heroin drought” of 2011 when levels dropped to as low as 18%, something that suggests the drug is becoming more available. What has changed, without doubt, is the nature of the supply network. Whereas it was once gangs from Liverpool and Manchester bringing the drugs in, criminal enterprises from as far away as Scotland, Birmingham and London are now coercing teenagers to move the drugs, sometimes forcing them to swallow the wraps of heroin to avoid detection. “People are travelling from much further afield, and the reason is that there’s a market,” said Coughlan, who spoke to the Observer last Thursday shortly after Cumbria police arrested two members of a drugs gang from Tower Hamlets in London targeting Barrow. “When people are prepared to travel a 600-mile round trip, you can see there is a thriving market here.” According to Coughlan, the battle to carve out a share of the Barrow heroin market has been mirrored with an increase in violence as gangs use baseball bats and knives to establish their territory. Beatings of addicts who cannot pay their drug debts are also on the rise. So, too, is the practice of “cuckooing” – when a gang takes over an addict’s house and uses it as a base for dealing. Neil Woods, a former undercover police officer who infiltrated drugs gangs and wrote a book about the experience, Good Cop Bad War, said the “county lines” phenomenon –when gangs operate far outside their base – was dramatically changing the shape of the UK drugs market. “In the past three years it’s become absolutely enormous,” he said. “Large criminal gangs have got monopolies and so people who want to make money are taking over the smaller towns.” Dr Robert Ralphs, reader in criminology at Manchester Metropolitan University, said technology had transformed the market. “Twenty years ago, when I started research on heroin and drug-dealing gangs or networks, most drug purchases took place around public phone boxes and in open areas such as shopping centres and high streets. Mobile phone technology makes it much easier for deals to take place in closed markets. Setting up a young person in a different city or town is also much easier due to mobile phones.” Teenagers, often lured into working for the gangs through the offer of free cannabis, also make good drug couriers. Less likely to have a police record, they don’t invite attention. Woods, who left the force five years ago and is now UK chairman of Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a body that campaigns against the current drug laws, saw the “county lines” phenomenon at first hand when he helped target Birmingham’s notorious Burger Bar Boys gang as it expanded into Northampton. “It was a huge success: 96 people were arrested and the Burger Bar Boys got something like 10 years apiece. Afterwards I spoke to the drug intelligence officer on the case. He said we’d managed to interrupt the drug flow into Northampton for two hours. The police never change the size of the market – they only change the shape of the market.” But as police forces struggle with budget cuts, their ability to gather intelligence and infiltrate gangs is diminished. “There’s less of us now than there was a few years ago, so it’s more challenging,” Coughlan said. “We can’t do as much as we did before.” Perhaps partly for this reason, police and crime commissioners are stressing the need for other agencies to do some of the heavy lifting. “Of course the number of deaths from drug use in Barrow is extremely worrying – and tragic to see lives wasted needlessly,” said Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner Peter McCall. “It is important that we recognise that enforcement is not the only answer to this problem. We must as a society recognise that we need to address the causes of drug abuse. This is not just a police issue – our partners in the local council and other agencies all have a part to play.” Other commissioners would go much further. Some advocate the use of drug consumption rooms in town centres – something that is supported by health experts alarmed by the country’s rising number of drug deaths: 3,744 people died of drug poisoning in England and Wales in 2016, the highest number since records began in 1993. In the past 25 years there has been an eightfold increase in the number of death certificates in which heroin is cited as a factor in the person’s death. In Barrow heroin misuse has become associated with one particular district – Barrow Island down by the warehouses where defence giant BAE builds the submarines – and, in particular, Egerton Court, a rundown tenement block, home to four of the 12 people who have died. Here, rubbish litters the stairwells and there’s broken furniture on the pavements. The communal playground in the court’s centre has been ripped out and some of the windows are boarded up. Conspicuously pinned to a lamppost is a domestic violence protection order issued by Barrow magistrates court banning one Christopher Poore from entering Egerton Court until 16 May – a sign, locals say, of how the police are trying to make the area safer. Kay Turner, 30, a care worker who used to rent a flat in the court and now lives nearby, pays tribute to the spirit of residents. “Best thing about living in Barrow? The community. But you’re always going to get problems. There’s not a lot to do.” Egerton Court stands out because it is one of three tenement blocks that has not been renovated. Others adjoining it have been given facelifts and attractive modern interiors. Their communal gardens could grace the Chelsea flower show. Turned into serviced apartments, they are rented out to BAE contractors who return to their families at weekends, taking their pay packets with them. Mark Roberts, 47, runs the local newsagent. He was born in Egerton Court but moved out with his parents when he was four as their flat didn’t have a bathroom. In the early 1990s, Roberts witnessed families moving out to buy houses elsewhere that had monthly mortgages costing less than they were paying in rent. The BAE contract workers who have now moved in, Roberts notes, don’t spend their money in the town. So where do they, then? “Lancaster, Preston, Manchester, Amazon.” And there’s fewer of them now. When Roberts took over the shop in 1989, BAE employed 16,000 people in Barrow. Over the following years, the company shed 10,000 jobs. Today things have improved, but BAE still only employs less than half the number it did 30 years ago. Roberts is gloomy about the town’s future. “We need to regenerate, but nobody’s going to put investment in if they don’t know it’s going to work.” Some days he toys with leaving. “I love Barrow, but at the moment my emotional attachment to it is getting less and less.” But then he checks himself. “We’re just half an hour from the Lakes. You can’t beat that.” If anything good can be said to have come from Barrow’s problems it’s that they have dragged a national public health emergency out of the shadows so that it can no longer be ignored. “It always catches the eye when we get these particular spikes in particular locations, but it’s part of the overall picture of increasing drug deaths over the years now,” said Ed Morrow, drugs policy lead at the Royal Society for Public Health. “It really goes to illustrate the issues that we’ve been highlighting for a number of years – that we’re not doing enough in harm reduction, not investing enough in treatment services and not ensuring that those treatment services are geared to the right outcomes.” For Cumbria, with a budget for promoting public health of just £37 per head, compared with the national average of £57, or £179 for the City of London, finding more money for harm reduction programmes is near impossible. The government’s new drug strategy, introduced last year, may also be helping to compound the problem. A national focus on promoting abstinence and refusing heroin substitutes such as methadone to those who fail to stay clean, is concerning health experts. Last October Colin Cox, Cumbria’s director of public health, presented a report to the council that warned: “It is possible that taking a strict approach to recovery models, such as ending treatment if clients relapse, might mean that people who are not ready to become drug-free are left without access to support and are put at higher risk as a result.” Danny Kushlick, of the group Transform, which campaigns for an end to prohibition, is scathing about the strategy and the effects it is having on struggling towns across the country. “The government has prioritised an ideologically driven abstinence-based recovery agenda over proven harm reduction measures and undermined life-saving and life-enhancing initiatives,” he said. Aware of the criticism, Unity, the organisation that provides drug rehabilitation services in Cumbria, told the Observer that it was now working with a number of partners to help addicts remain in treatment. Significantly, after expressing alarm about the rising national tide of drug deaths and cuts to treatment budgets, the Royal College of Physicians took the unprecedented decision last week to declare that the problem must now be treated as a health, rather than a criminal justice, issue. But the shifting zeitgeist is unlikely to offer much succour to Barrow or any other of Britain’s brown towns. Their socio-economic problems are too deep-rooted – the result of a collective failure by successive governments to help prop up Britain’s declining industrial heartlands.

There were presidents Trump and Macron, the former brushing imaginary dandruff off the latter’s shoulder, in such a painfully desperate attempt to appear dominant that one can only imagine that Stormy Daniels felt horribly triggered. Elsewhere, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in decided to ditch all the nuclear unpleasantness for the Korean answer to male bonding, which presumably ended with a night in, with just Netflix, popcorn, 750 bodyguards and, in Moon’s case, a cyanide pellet in a back molar to crunch down on, should there be a disagreement over which Will Ferrell film was funniest. Some people might view such macho bonding displays as body language Armageddon, but phooey to such cynicism. Arguably, somewhere within all those waist-stroking, ear-nuzzling moments, world peace was definitely achieved?* (*maybe). So what if Trump’s handshakes were so furiously hard-yanking that Macron could have been forgiven for keeping a chiropractor on speed-dial. Likewise, does it matter if Kim and Moon strolling hand in hand made it seem as though the world’s nuclear fate rested on North Korea’s Tweedledum remaining pals with South Korea’s Tweedledee? Or that, like me, some people’s immediate thought was: “The Teletubbies look even weirder with their costumes off.” One message from this politically “handsy” week came through loud and clear – when male politicians bond, as when Tony Blair sported his jeans during his own unforgettable 2001 big-boy sleepover with George W Bush at Camp David, subtlety is never the goal. Nearer home, comparisons could be drawn with the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, who somehow announced her pregnancy without once lewdly grabbing her crotch or even that of her partner, Jen Wilson – both women exhibiting nothing but natural, easy happiness.

The myths of Jayne Mansfield","bodyText":"Some of the best known lurid “facts” about Jayne Mansfield, the American film star of the 50s and 60s, are based on rumour. So the directors of a new documentary about her short and scandalous life faced a difficult task. Was Mansfield, one of the first actresses to be marketed as a “blonde bombshell”, also a violin-playing intellectual with superb comic timing who spoke five languages? Or was the star who came to be known as the “working man’s Marilyn Monroe” actually a devil worshipper who was decapitated in a car crash as the result of a curse? For the makers of Mansfield 66/67, these questions were only part of the story. Instead, the American film-makers P David Ebersole and Todd Hughes have created an unorthodox account of the world of Hollywood gossip and illusion. Top-billed contributors to the documentary, out in cinemas last month, include Tippi Hedren, Alfred Hitchcock’s muse, Kenneth Anger, the author of the bible of tacky ephemera Hollywood Babylon, and the film director John Waters, a master of offbeat kitsch. The release of Mansfield 66/67 in Britain marks the 50th anniversary of the star’s death at 34. Focused on the last two years of her life, the film was made after Ebersole and Hughes failed to find producers for their fictionalised screenplay The Devil Made Her Do It, about Mansfield’s reputed dalliance with the San Francisco-based satanic guru Anton LaVey. Unconventional elements of their finished documentary include interpretive dance sequences and a series of animated recreations of some key Mansfield myths. There are also clips of the star in the hit films The Girl Can’t Help It and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? as proof of her sure sense of comic timing. Born Vera Jayne Palmer in Pennsylvania in 1933, she was initially hired by Warner Brothers in 1955 and then by 20th Century Fox, where she was seen as a potential successor to the troublesome Monroe. In her short life she also made a string of centrefold appearances as “playmate of the month” in Playboy magazine and had three husbands and five children. Her youngest child from her second marriage to the 1955 Mr Universe winner, Mickey Hargitay, is the actress Mariska Hargitay, a regular on the television show Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. One fact about Mansfield never in doubt was her trademark proclivity for revealing her ample bosom. Those not familiar with her acting may know her name simply because of a notorious photograph of her taken in 1957 at a party Paramount Studios gave for the rising Italian star Sophia Loren. Although Loren was officially belle of that ball, it was her bemused reaction to Mansfield’s low-cut gown that became Hollywood folklore. Mansfield’s film career hit the buffers in the mid-1960s and she was forced to resort to working in nightclubs. She continued to make promotional special appearances, however, and travelled out to cheer the troops in Vietnam. It was at this stage, while also dating a married lawyer, Sam Brody, that she began to see LaVey, the self-styled head of the Church of Satan who had painted his home black and wore a dark cape. When a jealous Brody challenged LaVey over Mansfield’s affections, the legend says a fatal curse was brought down upon his head. During 1966 and 1967, Mansfield and Brody survived seven car crashes before an eighth eventually killed them both. The actress had been travelling from Biloxi, Mississippi, to New Orleans to appear on television when her car hit a trailer head-on. The accident gave birth to a persistent rumour that Mansfield’s head, or at least her blond wig, had been flung from the car. If it was not LaVey’s curse that killed her, it may have been the fault of a truck that had sprayed a thick fog of insect repellent across the road. • On 30 April 2018 LaVey’s first name was corrected. It was Anton not Anthony."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/28/parole-board-reform-unveiled-after-john-worboys-controversy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T23:01:01Z","webTitle":"Parole Board reform unveiled after John Worboys controversy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/28/parole-board-reform-unveiled-after-john-worboys-controversy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/28/parole-board-reform-unveiled-after-john-worboys-controversy","fields":{"headline":"Parole Board reform unveiled after John Worboys controversy","bodyText":"Victims of crime will be able to challenge Parole Board decisions for the first time under measures being introduced following the case of John Worboys, the black-cab rapist whose release from prison was overturned by the high court. Among the proposals being unveiled on Saturday are a judge-led process that could in some instances be open to the public to force the board to reconsider a decision without victims having to resort to a judicial review. The move will be subject to the results of a consultation also launching on Saturday. Initial legislation has been introduced to remove the blanket ban on transparency and allow the Parole Board to explain decisions to victims, media and the public, alongside expanding the victim contact scheme (VCS). The justice secretary, David Gauke, announced that a rule had been amended to comply with the ruling of the judicial review of the Worboys case, in order to remove the ban that prevents the board from disclosing information about its decision-making. It will also require board members to provide an overview of: The arguments it heard in a case The recommendations of expert witnesses The offender’s progress and risk factors The evidence provided by the offender The reasons for the panel’s decision. Gauke ordered the urgent review of Parole Board processes in January in an attempt to restore public confidence following the controversial decision to release serial sex attacker Worboys. In March, the high court blocked the release of the former black-cab driver and ruled that the Parole Board “should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending” before taking the decision. It led to the resignation of the board’s chair, Nick Hardwick, after Gauke told him his position was untenable. Gauke said: “I am announcing a package of measures to reform the Parole Board and introduce transparency of its decisions. But we are going further and consulting on a new way to challenge Parole Board decisions that would be judge-led and could, in some circumstances, be open to the public. And we’re not stopping there. The justice secretary said he was also unveiling “the terms of reference for our comprehensive review of the entire Parole Board, including whether we should in some circumstances name panel members, whether we should define the panel composition, and what kinds of further scrutiny measures should be introduced”. He added: “We will also improve the process for victims, who in this case were clearly let down. It is my ambition that the outcome of this process will mean victims have more confidence in the system. “We have moved at pace to address the shortcomings of the parole system, which the Worboys case has brought to light. But we must take a balanced approach. I am determined to lead a thorough reform process.” The Ministry of Justice will also consider publishing summaries of the Parole Board’s decision making online and whether information about panel members and other details should be made public. As part of the changes, the VCS will be extended to victims of more types of offences and in cases where a serious charge lies on file but has not resulted in a conviction. Other measures will include new training for victim liaison officers, improved cooperation with other agencies, and an easier route for victims to opt in to the scheme at later stages in the offender’s sentence. The department will also explore the potential for victims being asked at the beginning to opt out if they do not want to be informed of updates in the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/30/france-transport-strikes-cancel-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"What are our rights if our trains are cancelled due to French strikes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/30/france-transport-strikes-cancel-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/30/france-transport-strikes-cancel-rights","fields":{"headline":"What are our rights if our trains are cancelled due to French strikes?","bodyText":"My partner and I will be travelling from London to Montpellier, by both Eurostar and SNCF, on 16 June and returning on 25 June.

He denied wrecking a car. He had also been criticised as lacking experience for the job of VA secretary. His confirmation hearing at the Senate veterans affairs committee was delayed this week. The White House had insisted on Wednesday that Jackson “had received more vetting than most nominees” before the release of the document by Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate committee. In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, Trump defended Jackson’s character and experience, saying: “These are false accusations. These are false. They’re trying to destroy a man.” Trump also insisted: “You could take the head of the biggest hospital corporation in the world and it is peanuts compared to the VA so nobody has experience” to lead the government agency. Earlier in the week, Trump had given Jackson some space to withdraw his name. Speaking at a press conference next to President Emmanuel Macron of France, he said: “I don’t want to put a man through a process that is too ugly like this and it’s disgusting. I’ll stand behind him. He’s a fine man but it’s his choice.” Jackson first received national attention when he told reporters in January that Trump had “incredibly good genes” after giving him a physical. “I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old,” he said at the time. Despite his withdrawal from consideration for the cabinet, Jackson returned to his normal duties as White House physician. In a statement, the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said: “Admiral Jackson is a doctor in the United States navy assigned to the White House and is here at work today.” He is the second Trump cabinet nominee to withdraw before a confirmation vote in the Senate. Andy Puzder, Trump’s first choice to be secretary of labor, pulled out in February 2017. Betsy DeVos, Trump’s nominee to be secretary of education, was only confirmed after Vice-President Mike Pence cast a tiebreaking vote in 2017. DeVos, who faced concerns about her qualifications for the post, was the first cabinet member in American history to require a vice-presidential tiebreaker to be confirmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T13:29:05Z","webTitle":"Is it weird to eat the same sandwich for lunch every day?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/26/is-it-weird-to-eat-the-same-sandwich-for-lunch-every-day","fields":{"headline":"Is it weird to eat the same sandwich for lunch every day?","bodyText":"Did you eat the same thing for today’s lunch at work that you ate yesterday? We ask because a detail about sandwiches was one of the odder elements of a story about a Westminster security alert. A woman accused of meeting men via a “sugar daddy” website while working for parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, has exactly the same thing for lunch every day: a Pret a Manger chicken caesar and bacon baguette, with a pot of fruit and the same smoothie. But is this really that unusual? The statistics we have on how people choose to eat lunch at work are usually gathered by surveys, which can be unreliable, but all the indicators are that a significant proportion of the UK workforce eat the same thing for lunch every day. In 2017, a poll of 2,000 people by the New Covent Garden Soup Company produced the headline statistic that one in six people had eaten the same lunch every day for at least two years. That poll also yielded the figure that 77% of workers had been eating the same lunch every day for nine months. Presumably, the company then suggested that maybe some lovely soup would be a welcome change. Whole Foods Market carried out a similar exercise four years earlier. It found that a third of Britons ate the same lunch daily, and half said they had been doing so for six years. Cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches are apparently the favourites of a nation stuck in a lunchtime rut. There are upsides to repetitive eating. There’s a theory that because you become subconsciously bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. It can also help with budgeting: those purchasing the same thing each day can anticipate exactly how much they are going to spend on lunches. Another reason to stick to what you know might be to do with allergies – repeatedly ordering the same thing avoids the risk of unexpected ingredients. This may not be the case with Raab’s sandwich, however, since it contains seven items listed by Pret as possible allergens: gluten, sesame seeds, dairy, egg, celery, mustard and fish. The downside, of course, is the lack of excitement and variability. Another 2013 survey, this time carried out by a company called Wonderful Pistachios, claimed that 50% of workers thought their lunches were dull, despite not making much of an effort to liven them up. Still, regardless of what you have for lunch at work, your habits will never be as eyebrow-raising as the man who claims he eats Christmas dinner every single day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2020/jun/18/dame-vera-lynn-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T10:11:28Z","webTitle":"Dame Vera Lynn obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/18/dame-vera-lynn-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2020/jun/18/dame-vera-lynn-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Dame Vera Lynn obituary","bodyText":"At the start of the second world war, Vera Lynn, who has died aged 103, was an up-and-coming dance band singer. By 1945, this working-class young woman had become a symbol of the British wartime spirit, with a status comparable to that of the patrician prime minister, Winston Churchill. After the war, her friend Harry Secombe liked to joke that “Churchill didn’t beat the Nazis. Vera sang them to death.” Lynn’s iconic status as the “Forces’ Sweetheart” was due to the success of her radio series, Sincerely Yours, which linked the soldiers at the front with their loved ones at home. In 1944, she visited the troops in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, which kindled her lifelong commitment to the welfare of veterans, especially those of the Burma campaign. Above all, her celebrity was due to her hit songs. Such numbers as We’ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover caught and moulded a national mood, despite the harsh criticism her crooning style provoked from some politicians and BBC managers. After VE Day, Lynn resumed her career as a variety artist and recording star, but her association with wartime Britain remained central to her identity and reputation throughout her long life. Until very recently, Lynn was a prominent presence at commemorations of the war. Her place at the heart of national life was officially recognised when she was made OBE in 1969, a dame in 1975 and a Companion of Honour in 2016; her 100th birthday, in March 2017, was marked by the release of a new album and a concert in her honour at the London Palladium. Equally, she became part of popular culture as cockney rhyming slang made her synonymous with gin, chin and skin (as in cigarette papers), she was hymned by pop singers of later generations including Pink Floyd and Ian Dury, and she was the subject of numerous comic impersonations, something she tried unsuccessfully to control through court action in the 1950s. She was an unlikely candidate for the role of national heroine. Born in the penultimate year of the first world war, she was the second child of a working-class family who lived in a small apartment in East Ham, east London. Her father, Bertram Welch, had various jobs, including working as a plumber and docker. Her mother, Annie, was a dressmaker. Vera’s vocal talent was evident from a very early age. After singing at family parties, she made her public debut at a local working men’s club aged seven, billed as a “descriptive child vocalist”. Adopting her grandmother’s maiden name, Vera Lynn soon joined a juvenile concert party, the Kracker Kabaret Kids. In 1932, still only 15, she was signed up by Howard Baker, a bandleader and agent, who supplied dance bands for functions throughout the East End of London. A brief period with Billy Cotton’s band followed, culminating in a week’s engagement in Manchester, from which Cotton sent Vera home. He later described this as “the worst day’s work I ever did”. Cotton’s loss was the pianist Charlie Kunz’s gain. Vera sang with his band on BBC broadcasts. Unusually for the time, Kunz gave Lynn free rein to choose the songs. She visited music publishers in Denmark Street, London’s Tin Pan Alley. There Vera met Walter Ridley, of the Peter Maurice company, who not only found songs for her but undertook to transpose them to a suitable key for Lynn’s unusually deep voice, which was variously described in the press as a “rich contralto” and “a freak mezzo-soprano with an irresistible sob”. From 1937 to 1940, Lynn worked with another top bandleader, Bert Ambrose, who was impressed by her enunciation of lyrics. She toured variety theatres with the Ambrose Octet and took part in broadcasts for the BBC and for Radio Luxembourg, in a show sponsored by Lifebuoy soap. There was also a debut television broadcast from Alexandra Palace in 1938. The following year, she recorded We’ll Meet Again for the first time, shortly before a newspaper columnist claimed she was selling more records than either Bing Crosby or the Mills Brothers. Her growing success was reflected in the growth of her fan mail and in her increasing salary. In 1938, she was able to move her family to a new house in Barking and to buy a fur coat and her first car, an Austin 10. In 1939, a new saxophonist joined the Ambrose orchestra. Harry Lewis soon showed his admiration for Vera and in 1941 they were married. Very soon afterwards, the band felt the full impact of the war as Lewis and others volunteered for military service. As members of the RAF they set up the Squadronaires, a dance and jazz group that continued after the cessation of hostilities. Lewis was to give up his career in the late 1940s to become Lynn’s personal manager. He became well known for answering the phone with “What do you want her for?” By 1941 Lynn was a star in her own right and she left Ambrose to begin a solo career. She soon found work on the variety theatre circuit, beginning at Coventry Hippodrome, often topping the bill working with only a piano accompanist. At this time, BBC producers were seeking new ideas for the Forces Programme, which had been established to broadcast to the British expeditionary force. Howard Thomas, later a pioneer of commercial television, proposed a format that would be “a letter to the men of the forces in words and music”. Lynn had previously been voted “No 1 forces sweetheart” by Forces Programme listeners and was an ideal choice to read and sing such a letter. To quote the music historian Paul du Noyer, “she was not a glamorous sex-bomb pandering to the lonesome soldiers’ lower instincts. Instead she aroused a wistful yearning for the idealised fiancee.” It was an immediate success. Up to 2,000 messages were received each week from domestic listeners from which Lynn read out a small sample. She also sent out signed photographs and brief letters to servicemen at the front. This occasionally led to misunderstandings, as when she was accosted by a wife who had found a letter to her absent husband and accused Lynn of stealing him. Above all, Sincerely Yours was about Lynn’s voice and her songs. Three songs came to embody the wartime spirit and became indelibly associated with her. Yours (recorded in 1941) was a straightforward song of love and fidelity; We’ll Meet Again (1939) expressed a mood of fervent optimism and was described by Lynn as a “greetings card song: a very basic human message of the sort people want to say to each other but find embarrassing actually to put into words”; and The White Cliffs of Dover (1942) was intensely patriotic – despite having been composed by Americans. While Sincerely Yours had exceptional audience numbers, behind the scenes at the BBC controversy raged. A committee minute noted that the assembled members deplored Sincerely Yours but “noted its popularity”. The opposition to the show was part of a wider dislike of crooners, whose vocal style was held to be over-sentimental and tinged with Americanisms. Male crooners were especially denigrated but Lynn was in the eye of the storm because her show attracted such a large listenership. It was attacked in parliament as liable to undermine the morale of British fighting men. One MP went further in criticising Lynn’s speaking voice as “refaned cockney”. She was stung into responding that “millions of cockneys are fighting in this war”. So great was her public profile that she starred in three films between 1942 and 1944. They traded on Lynn’s persona, to the extent that We’ll Meet Again and Rhythm Serenade borrowed titles of her songs. All had wartime themes as a backdrop to lightweight romantic stories, which did not fulfil the promise of the title of the third, One Exciting Night. While they served their morale-boosting purpose, Lynn did not pursue a career in cinema after the war. The most affecting phase of her wartime career came in 1944 when she volunteered to travel abroad for Ensa, the organisation set up to provide entertainment for the forces. The five-month trip took in concerts and hospital visits in the Middle East, India and finally Burma. The weeks she spent with troops in this relatively forgotten theatre of war remained with her for the rest of her life and she became the most ardent advocate for the remembrance and care of veterans of the 14th Army who fought in Burma. In the changing conditions of peacetime, Lynn faced competition from new and sometimes younger rivals, such as Anne Shelton, Dorothy Squires, Eve Boswell and Petula Clark, all of whom made rival recordings of new songs in the 50s. She remained in demand for variety theatre tours and starred in the long-running London Laughs with the comedians Jimmy Edwards and Tony Hancock in 1952-54. But she was not offered work by BBC radio for several years because in 1949 the head of variety, Michael Standing, told her that “sob stuff” was outmoded. A few years later he was quoted as “still looking for the new Vera Lynn”. In the meantime, Lynn made broadcasts for Radio Luxembourg. Several of these shows were recorded with an audience of RAF servicemen, who occasionally joined in the chorus of a song. That combination was repeated on bestselling Decca recordings, billed as “Vera Lynn with Soldiers and Airmen of HM Forces”. Among these were Auf Wiederseh’n Sweetheart, The Homing Waltz and The Windsor Waltz. The first of these inspired the title of the 80s sitcom Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. The disc was listed in the first published British hit parade in the New Musical Express in 1952 and topped the American charts, selling over a million copies there. Her biggest hit in Britain was My Son, My Son, co-written by the trumpeter Eddie Calvert, which reached No 1 in 1954. With the arrival of commercial broadcasting in 1955, Lynn was given her first television series and in the following year the BBC invited her back with a two-year exclusive contract to include both television and radio appearances. Unlike some of her contemporaries’ careers, Lynn’s continued to prosper despite the arrival of rock’n’roll and, later, the Beatles. During the 60s and 70s, she made frequent concert performances, recordings and television appearances. For many of these, including two nostalgic LPs of “Hits of the Blitz”, she reprised her wartime and 50s favourites, but she was briefly persuaded to record contemporary songs such as Lennon and McCartney’s Fool on the Hill and Jimmy Webb’s By the Time I Get to Phoenix, and to make an album in Nashville. Several CD reissues of her recordings have been made, including the No 1 album We’ll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn (2009) and Unforgettable (2010), which included three previously unreleased tracks from the 40s. A prominent feature of Lynn’s career was her commitment to charities, including several that support ex-service personnel and others concerned with polio, breast cancer, blindness and cerebral palsy. A trust for children with cerebral palsy was set up in her name and continues to support a school near Lynn’s home in West Sussex. In 1995, Lynn made her final official public performance at a VE Day anniversary event at Hyde Park. Even afterwards, she attended second world war commemorations, sometimes giving a speech, as at the 2005 VE Day event at which Katherine Jenkins, Lynn’s preferred successor as the forces’ sweetheart, performed We’ll Meet Again. Jenkins later recorded the song to add to Lynn’s original. Their virtual duet was included on the 2014 CD release, Vera Lynn – National Treasure. Three days before her 100th birthday, she released Vera Lynn 100, featuring new orchestrations of her best-known songs alongside her original vocals. She was joined on the album by the British singers Aled Jones, Alexander Armstrong and Alfie Boe. Her birthday was also marked with a projection of her face on to the white cliffs of Dover. The album went to No 3, making her the first centenarian to enter the UK charts, and charted again in May this year following the 75th anniversary celebrations of VE Day, which were also marked by a duet between Jenkins and a hologram of Lynn at the Royal Albert Hall, and the re-release of We’ll Meet Again.

It is not just terrorists and paedophiles who will use encrypted communications to work obvious evil. Anonymity releases all kinds of small-minded malice and cruelty even in normal people. This has been claimed by philosophers for centuries – Adam Smith wrote that it is the fear of becoming “the proper object of the contempt and indignation of mankind” that enforces our moral codes. Take that away, he argued, and there is little to prevent us acting for reasons of pure self-gratification. Thirty years’ experience of social networks on the internet has proved that the Scottish philosopher was right. The Twitter mob, the skulking trolls and other hate figures of our time are evidence enough of that. So there is a moral case for removing some degree of privacy on the internet. It will not do simply to assume that freedom for users is an unmixed good. Yet, mixed though it is, it is still a good. Human political authorities are not God and are not perfectly good and disinterested. They cannot be trusted with omniscience, or even with too much knowledge and power. Since one of the motives for our good behaviour is the fear of “the contempt and indignation of mankind” if our dark acts and urges were discovered, enormous power belongs to anyone who learns our secrets. That power will certainly be abused. The instinctive suspicion and fear of anyone who knows too much about us is the root of hostility to Facebook, Google and the other targeted-advertising businesses. Every web browser now has a “privacy mode” to allow people to do things – however legal – that they wouldn’t want others to find in their browsing history. To have secrets to keep is part of being an autonomous individual. A balance needs to be struck. The widespread availability of reliably encrypted and so completely private methods of communication, such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, actually strengthens democracy. Arguing otherwise is the kind of illiterate technological determinism which too often derails discussions of freedom and privacy on the internet. The enemies of democracy and of honesty in public life depend far more on anonymity than on privacy. What is concealed by privacy-enhancing technologies is not the content of the messages but their purpose and origin. This encryption depends on mathematical principles that are accessible to anyone. The technology itself is, in this limited sense, democratic. That is why governments have been unable to limit its use to areas where they might approve of it, such as the banking system. That would still be undesirable even if it were possible, but since it isn’t possible, the only route for authoritarian governments is to ban the use of certain applications altogether. This is what first Russia and now – apparently – Iran have done with Telegram, a popular instant messaging app which is widely (not universally) considered entirely secure. China has been much more assiduous and effective in blocking, banning and monitoring private channels of communication. Analysts assume that everything can be eavesdropped on and watched by the state. The Chinese model is one that tempts governments everywhere, and it can’t be resisted entirely by high-minded appeals to principle. As often happens, things that are confused and muddy in principle are perfectly simple in practice. It is the simple, almost apolitical recognition that privacy is one of the things that we need to be fully human that is the strongest defence of private, encrypted communications online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/26/eu-third-party-trader-amazon-google-ebay","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T17:42:42Z","webTitle":"Online streaming services face '30% made in Europe' law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/26/eu-third-party-trader-amazon-google-ebay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/26/eu-third-party-trader-amazon-google-ebay","fields":{"headline":"Online streaming services face '30% made in Europe' law","bodyText":"Netflix, Amazon and other online streaming services will have to dedicate 30% of their output to TV shows and films made in Europe, which they must subsidise, under the terms of a new EU law agreed in Brussels on Thursday. As well as the “Netflix quota”, the streaming services will have to fund European TV series and films, either by directly commissioning the content or contributing to national film funds, under the terms of an outline deal on EU broadcasting rules reached by legislators. MEPs and the council of ministers, who are responsible for agreeing the law, struck a deal on a final version of the EU’s audio-visual services directive – a breakthrough in the legislative process. The law falls into a longstanding tradition of EU lawmakers protecting European film and drama against the encroachments of Hollywood and US TV and online shows. Industry groups have criticised cultural quotas as “outdated” and “counterproductive”, but lost the argument to European politicians who see them as vital to protect local languages and culture. The European commission’s original proposal was for a 20% “Netflix quota” but MEPs said that was not enough. The European parliament says the law means companies such as Netflix will face the same rules as traditional TV channels, not only on European content but also limits on advertising and product placement. Video-sharing websites, such as Google and Facebook, will also have to intensify work to clamp down on content “inciting violence, hatred and terrorism”. Under the law, platforms need to create a “transparent, easy-to-use and effective mechanism” to allow users to report hateful content. The EU is also banning product placement from children’s programmes, although member states can decide whether they want to outlaw corporate sponsorship of under-18’s TV shows. Advertisers will only be allowed 20% of screen time during the prime-time hours of 6pm to midnight. “We have now made European media regulation fit for the digital era by applying similar rules to similar services, whether online or offline,” said Sabine Verheyen, a German centre-right MEP who was one of the parliament’s lead negotiators. The rules on product placement and sponsorship were “a great achievement for the protection of consumers, especially children and minors”, she added. The law has to jump over several procedural hurdles before it is passed, a process not expected to be completed until September. Also on Thursday a draft EU regulation was published that would force Amazon, Google, eBay and other tech firms to be more transparent in their dealings with third-party businesses that sell goods on their sites. Thousands of companies use the platforms to sell goods online, allowing a sole trader working from home to reach millions of potential customers. But many complain that the big firms are opaque about their rankings, which mean some get top billing, while others struggle to be seen. App designers report similar problems when listing on Google’s and Apple’s stores. Under the draft regulation, large platforms would have to rewrite their terms and conditions to ensure third-party sellers knew how to influence their online ranking, for example, if payment is required for a top spot. Platforms would also have to explain any decision to suspend a third-party business from their site, and set up a system to handle complaints. Legislators hope for agreement between European ministers and MEPs on the law by early next year, which would see the law come into effect from autumn 2019. The draft regulation follows a pan-European survey by the commission, which found that 46% of businesses using online platforms encounter problems, rising to 75% for those that generated more than half of their turnover via the platform. One-third of heavy users complained about lack of transparency, while 22% thought terms and conditions were unfair. The most frequently cited problems were technical ones and lack of support from the platform. “You see things like user conditions being changed from day to day,” said Mariya Gabriel, the European commissioner for digital economy and society. “We are saying to the platforms you need to have transparency with regard to your conditions for use, data access and so on, to provide businesses with the opportunity to know what their criteria are and to create an environment based on rules that everyone is familiar with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/27/last-chance-to-study-and-name-australias-vanishing-species-scientists-warn-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T21:51:28Z","webTitle":"Last chance to study and name Australia’s vanishing species, scientists warn MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/last-chance-to-study-and-name-australias-vanishing-species-scientists-warn-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/27/last-chance-to-study-and-name-australias-vanishing-species-scientists-warn-mps","fields":{"headline":"Last chance to study and name Australia’s vanishing species, scientists warn MPs","bodyText":"With an estimated 70% of Australian organisms still undocumented and funding for species discovery declining, the national science academy will head to parliament on Friday to argue that a rapid reversal is needed to avoid extinctions and reveal unimagined health and biosecurity solutions. The Australian Academy of Science and its New Zealand counterpart, the Royal Society Te Apārangi, are launching a 10-year plan to study and name unknown species, warning that a sound understanding of biodiversity is critical in the face of a global extinction crisis. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It comes as an unrelated study suggests 10 Australian bird and seven mammal species are likely to go extinct in the next 20 years unless management practices change. Peer-reviewed studies estimate that Australia is home to more than 600,000 species, only about 30% of which have been identified. The island continent is rated one of 17 “megadiverse” countries that together are home to more than two-thirds of terrestrial biodiversity on less than 10% of the Earth’s land. Australia is the sole developed country on the list. The plant taxonomist Dr Kevin Thiele, head of the academy’s expert working group on taxonomy and biosystematics, said at the current pace of discovery it would take about 400 years to document every Australian species. Many would go extinct in that time. Thiele said a doubling of the existing $43m in annual state and federal funding would allow scientists to take advantage of a technological revolution under way in genomics, machine learning and 3D imaging. “With careful planning and adequate capacity building … we could completely document our biodiversity in a generation,” he said. “The ramifications if we don’t are that many species will go extinct without ever being known. “There will be many cases in the future where biodiversity risks and hazards will emerge and we’ll be behind the eight-ball if we don’t understand them. There’s no doubt we will also miss out on enormous benefits if we don’t act.” The academy gives two examples where rapid discovery would have clear benefits: marine sponges and mosquitoes. Sponges are often rich in compounds that form the basis for new antibiotics but it is estimated there are 3,000 known but not documented and more not yet discovered. Mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other animal, yet Australia is estimated to have 200 species that have not been named or studied to identify diseases they may carry. “It’s really important to be able to manage these risks,” Thiele said. “Without a taxonomic framework we simply can’t do that.” Meanwhile, a study by Threatened Species Recovery Hub – a partnership of 10 universities and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy – published in the journal Pacific Conservation Biology found that 10 Australian birds had no better than a 50-50 chance of surviving the next two decades. They included the orange-bellied parrot, the western ground parrot, the plains-wanderer, the regent honeyeater and the herald petrel. The most at-risk bird was the tiny King Island brown thornbill, which was rated as having little more than a 5% chance of survival under its current level of care. Mammals at risk included the central rock rat, the northern hopping mouse, the Carpentarian rock rat, the Christmas Island flying fox and the black-footed tree rat. The research coordinator Hayley Geyle, from Charles Darwin University, said avoiding extinctions would require targeted action for each species, with governments, non-government organisations and the private sector working together. “Most at-risk birds are on islands or in the more intensely developed parts of southern Australia,” Geyle said. “The mammals at risk are spread widely but many occur in northern Australia, an area currently witnessing a rapid and severe decline in mammals generally.” Australia has already lost 50 animal and 60 plants in the past two centuries. The Australian Academy of Science push is endorsed by the naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. In a foreword to the plan, he says investment in taxonomy and biosystematics – the disciplines that provide the framework for the understanding of life – is falling across the globe. “At the very time that many species are under greatest threat, funding and other resources allocated to the task of discovering, naming and documenting nature are declining,” he writes. “Our taxonomic capacity is not adequate for the magnitude of the task. This has serious consequences for the future of life on Earth.” Thiele said vertebrate animals and flowering plants were reasonably well understood but documentation of many other groups – including insects, bacteria, roundworms and many types of marine organisms – was poor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/26/absolute-hell-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T10:49:10Z","webTitle":"Absolute Hell review – postwar Soho gets a Weimar makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/26/absolute-hell-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/26/absolute-hell-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Absolute Hell review – postwar Soho gets a Weimar makeover","bodyText":"At the curtain call for this revival of Rodney Ackland’s 1952 play, a total of 28 actors line up across the Lyttelton stage. While the luxury of a big ensemble is welcome in this penny-pinching age, it’s a reminder that the play, however intriguing as a social document, cannot quite sustain the symbolic weight that Ackland – and Joe Hill-Gibbins’s production – place upon it. The piece has had a rum history. It bombed badly at its premiere, under the title The Pink Room, but a revised version enjoyed big success at the Orange Tree in 1988 and at the National in 1995, and it continues to fascinate. Ackland sets the action in a louche Soho drinking club in the summer months of 1945, between VE Day and Labour’s landslide electoral victory. But the outside world barely impinges on these dedicated boozers, who maintain a glassy-eyed indifference even when shown photos of the concentration camps. Led by the club’s gregariously lonely owner, Christine, they live for the moment. Their self-absorption is epitomised by Hugh Marriner, a once-promising novelist desperate to hang on to his male lover and clinch an unlikely movie contract. Like Patrick Hamilton in Hangover Square, Ackland describes with pinpoint accuracy a metropolitan sub-world: the camp movie director, the Austrian black marketeer and his faithless doxy, and the GI seeking to get laid all seem drawn from life. But Ackland also wants us to see the club, which falls apart as Labour triumphs, as a metaphor for a reality-evading England, and he even invokes Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard in the final moments. The difference is that Chekhov’s feckless dreamers not only represent their class but stand for something permanent in the human condition; Ackland’s myopic drunkards simply embody the raffish bohemia of postwar Soho. In an attempt to boost the play’s significance, Hill-Gibbins gives it the full expressionist works. Lizzie Clachan’s set is a multi-level cavern whose thick gloom is offset by pink lampshades. Time and again I was reminded of Otto Dix’s paintings evoking the hedonistic frenzy of the Weimar Republic. At one point the club’s members do a snake-like conga through a smoke-filled room, at another they appear in grotesque animal masks, and, throughout, a pointed contrast is drawn between the cliquey drinkers and the clacking typewriters of the Labour offices nearby. But, while the staging is superbly orchestrated, it has an epic quality Ackland’s play doesn’t wholly justify. For all the visual bravura, individual performers stand out and none more so than Charles Edwards, who makes the failed novelist the centre of the production. Everything about him is right, from the ill-knotted tie to the rumpled cardigan, but Edwards also captures perfectly the desperate neediness of an overgrown mother’s boy looking for emotional security. Kate Fleetwood lends the hostess the right air of public solitude and there is strong support from Jonathan Slinger as the brutal movie-maker, Danny Webb as the anxious Austrian and Sinéad Matthews as his partner, who professes leftwing leanings but is too befuddled to vote. I suspect the play has been revived now to warn us that we too are dodging the dangers of reality, but Ackland’s play emerges more as an enjoyable slice of social history than as a timeless myth. At the Lyttelton, London, until 16 June.

But it was the manner in which Stirling Moss, who has died aged 90, effectively handed the trophy to one of his greatest rivals that established his name as a byword for sporting chivalry, as well as for speed and courage. It was after the Portuguese Grand Prix on the street circuit at Oporto, the eighth round of the 1958 series, that Moss voluntarily appeared before the stewards to plead the case of Mike Hawthorn, threatened with disqualification from second place for apparently pushing his stalled Ferrari against the direction of the track after spinning on his final lap. Moss, who had won the race in his Vanwall, testified that his compatriot had, in fact, pushed the car on the pavement, and had thus not been on the circuit itself. Hawthorn was reinstated, along with his six championship points. Three months later, when the season ended in Casablanca, he won the title by the margin of a single point from Moss, who was never heard to express regret over his gesture. Such sportsmanship had become part of his appeal, along with the devil-may-care charisma formerly associated with Battle of Britain fighter pilots. His public image was enhanced by his willingness to invite feature writers and TV cameras into his town house in Shepherd Market, the district of Mayfair in central London where he lived, even when married, in a kind of bachelor-pad splendour amid a panoply of hi-tech gadgets. The aura continued to surround him long after an accident on the track truncated his career at the age of 32, when he was still in his prime. The sight of Moss, in his later decades, entering the paddock at a race meeting, accompanied by his third wife, the effervescent and indispensable Susie, never failed to draw shoals of fans, photographers and journalists keen to hear his opinion on the latest controversy. He loved to fight against the odds, and the greatest of his Formula One victories, at the wheel of an obsolete, underpowered Lotus-Climax, came in 1961 at Monaco and the Nürburgring, two circuits that placed the highest demands on skill and nerve. Those wins could be set alongside the epic victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and the historic triumph in the 1957 British Grand Prix at Aintree, when he and Tony Brooks became the first British drivers to win a round of the world championship series in a British car, prefacing a long period of British domination. Before his retirement as a professional driver in 1962 he had competed in 529 races, not counting rallies, hill climbs and record attempts. He won 212 of them, an extraordinary 40% success rate. Of the 66 world championship grands prix he entered between 1951 and 1961, he won 16, a ratio unfavourably distorted by early years spent in uncompetitive British cars and by a pronounced share of mechanical misfortune. He was born to parents who had met at Brooklands, in Surrey, the great cathedral of prewar British motor racing. His father, Alfred, was a descendant of a family of Ashkenazi Jews known, until the end of the 19th century, as Moses. A successful dentist, Alfred Moss also possessed a passion for motor sport, and competed at Brooklands in the 1920s; while studying in the US, he entered the Indianapolis 500, finishing 16th. His wife, Aileen (nee Craufurd), was the great-great-niece of “Black Bob” Craufurd, a hero of the Peninsular war in the early 19th century; an equestrian, she also entered races and rallies in her own three-wheeled Morgan. When their son was born they were living in Thames Ditton. Two years later, after the birth of a daughter, Pat, they moved to a large house in Bray, Berkshire, called Long White Cloud. Both children rode horses competitively from an early age (Pat was to become a champion horsewoman and rally driver). Stirling, educated at Clewer Manor prep school and Haileybury, Hertfordshire, neither enjoyed nor excelled at academic work. It was at Haileybury that he was subjected to antisemitic bullying for the first time. He was nine when his father bought him an old Austin Seven, which he drove in the fields surrounding Long White Cloud. At 15 he obtained his first driving licence and, with £50 from his equestrian winnings plus the proceeds from the sale of the Austin, bought his own Morgan. It was followed by an MG (in which he was discovered by Aileen Moss while attempting, aged 17, to surrender his virginity to one of his father’s dental receptionists) and then, in the winter of 1947-48, by a prewar BMW 328. This was the car with which he entered his first competition, organised by the Harrow Car Club, winning his class. Resistant to the lure of dentistry, he worked briefly as a trainee waiter at various London establishments. But motor racing was where his heart lay, and for his 18th birthday his father bought him a Cooper-JAP, powered by a 500cc motorcycle engine, with which to compete in the new Formula Three series. After a couple of good performances in hill climbs, he entered and won his first single-seater race on the Brough aerodrome circuit in east Yorkshire on 7 April 1948. Ruled out of national service by bouts of illness, including nephritis, Moss was soon a regular winner against fierce competition and before long he was making occasional trips to races in Italy and France. In May 1950, when a race was held in support of the Monaco Grand Prix, he set the best practice time, won his heat and then won the final. As his reputation grew, he was approached in 1951 by Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a car for a Formula Two race at Bari, as the prelude to a full contract for the following season. Moss and his father made the long journey down to Puglia, only to discover that the only Ferrari was reserved for another driver, the veteran Piero Taruffi. No explanation was offered and Moss’s fury at such treatment led to a lasting rift and a special sense of satisfaction whenever he managed to beat the Italian team, particularly in a British car. A victory in the 1954 Sebring 12-hours, sharing the wheel of an OSCA sports car with the American driver Bill Lloyd, opened the season in which he made his international breakthrough. Deciding to take the plunge into Formula One, he and his manager, Ken Gregory, first offered his services to Mercedes-Benz, then on the brink of a return to grand prix racing. When the German team politely indicated that they thought he needed more experience, Gregory and his father negotiated the purchase of a Maserati 250F, the new model from Ferrari’s local rivals. No racing driver can have invested £5,500 more wisely. Moss and the 250F bonded instantly, and he was soon winning the Aintree 200, his maiden Formula One victory. By the time he entered the car for the German Grand Prix, he was being supported by the official Maserati team, which had recognised his world-beating potential. At Monza that September he was leading the Italian Grand Prix and looking a certainty for his first win in a round of the world championship when an oil pipe broke with 10 laps to go. Mercedes had taken note, however, and signed him up for 1955, as No 2 to the world champion, Juan Manuel Fangio. Although neither spoke the other’s language, a warm respect grew between them. At Aintree, having won three of the season’s first four races and assured himself of a third world title, Fangio took his turn to sit in the slipstream as Moss became the first Briton to win his home grand prix. In 1955, too, Moss won the Mille Miglia, the gruelling time trial around 1,000 miles of Italian public roads, in a Mercedes 300SLR sports car. During two reconnaissance runs his co-driver, the journalist Denis Jenkinson, prepared a set of pace notes that were inscribed on a roll of paper, held on a spindle inside a small aluminium box. As they charged from Brescia to Rome and back, Jenkinson scrolled through the notes and shouted instructions to the driver. They completed the course in 10 hours and seven minutes, at an average speed of 97.95mph – a record that stands in perpetuity, since the race was abandoned after several spectators were killed two years later. When Mercedes bowed out of Formula One at the end of 1955, Moss returned to Maserati while Fangio went to Ferrari. Moss won at Monaco and Monza, finishing runner-up to Fangio in the championship for the second time in a row. However he had always hoped to win grands prix in a British car, and for 1957 he was happy to accept an invitation to drive a Vanwall, a Formula One car built by the industrialist Tony Vandervell at his factory in Acton, west London. At Aintree, after a patchy start to the season, he fell out of the lead with a misfiring engine. Taking over the car of his team-mate Brooks, who was still suffering from the effects of a crash at Le Mans, he resumed in ninth place and eventually took the lead with 20 laps to go after the clutch of Jean Behra’s Maserati disintegrated and a puncture delayed Hawthorn’s Ferrari. More conclusive were the subsequent victories at Pescara and Monza, when the British car and its driver beat the Italian teams on their home ground. After Fangio’s retirement in 1958, Moss became his undisputed heir. When Vanwall did not attend the first race of the year, in Buenos Aires, he was allowed to drive a little two-litre Cooper-Climax entered by his friend Rob Walker and, through a clever bluff involving pit stops, managed to beat the Ferraris. Back in the Vanwall, he won the Dutch, Portuguese and Moroccan grands prix, but was again condemned to second place in the final standings, this time behind Hawthorn. Vandervell was so distressed by the death of Stuart Lewis-Evans, the team’s third driver, in Morocco at the end of the season that he withdrew his cars during the winter, leaving Moss without a drive for 1959. The solution was to form an alliance with Walker, the heir to a whisky fortune, whose Cooper-Climax would be looked after by Moss’s faithful mechanic, Alf Francis, a wartime refugee from Poland. The dark blue car suffered from unreliability until late summer, when Moss took it to victories in Portugal and Italy. Moss and Walker remained in partnership for 1960, but a fine victory in Monaco with a new Lotus-Climax was followed at Spa by a bad crash during a practice session, the car losing a wheel at around 140mph and hitting a bank with such force that the driver suffered two broken legs, three crushed vertebrae and a broken nose. To general astonishment he was back at the wheel inside two months, winning his comeback race in a Lotus sports car. In 1961 his virtuosity overcame the limitations of Walker’s ageing Lotus and its four-cylinder engine. Twice he outran the V6 Ferraris of Wolfgang von Trips, Phil Hill and Richie Ginther, first in a mad chase at Monaco and then, on a wet track, at the 14-mile Nürburgring. He was at the height of his powers and the only problem was to find cars good enough to match his brilliance. Before the start of the 1962 season Enzo Ferrari offered to supply his latest car, to be run in Walker’s colours. Old resentments were cast aside and Moss accepted this rare invitation. But an accident at Goodwood, at the wheel of a Lotus, meant that it was never put to the test. No conclusive evidence has ever emerged to explain why, on that Easter Monday, his car went straight on at St Mary’s, a fast righthander, and hit an earth bank. It took 40 minutes to cut his unconscious body out of the crumpled wreckage. The outward signs of physical damage – severe facial wounds, a crushed left cheekbone, a displaced eye socket, a broken arm, a double fracture of the leg at knee and ankle, and many bad cuts – were less significant than the deep bruising to the right side of his brain, which put him in a coma for a month and left him paralysed in the left side for six months, with his survival a matter of national concern. After lengthy treatment, convalescence and corrective surgery, he started driving on the road again. And in May 1963, a year and a week after the accident, he returned to Goodwood, lapping in a Lotus sports car for half an hour on a damp track. When he returned to the pits, it was with bad news. The old reflexes, he believed, had been dulled, and without that sharpness he could only be an ex-racing driver. In the fullness of time, he came to regret the decision. Had he postponed it a further two or three years, he felt, his recovery would have been complete and, at 35, he might have had several seasons at the top ahead of him. Instead he occupied himself with his property company. There was also the well remunerated business of being Stirling Moss, constantly in demand for commercial and ceremonial events. He participated in races for historic cars, taking advantage of a special dispensation that allowed him, and him alone of all the world’s racing drivers, to ignore modern safety regulations by competing in his old helmet and overalls and doing without seat-belts. He celebrated his 81st birthday by racing at the Goodwood Revival; a few months earlier he had fallen 30ft down the lift shaft at his Mayfair home, breaking both his ankles. Towards the end of 2016, however, he fell ill during a trip to the far east. After several weeks in hospital in Singapore he was flown home to London and his withdrawal from public life was announced. Always enthusiastic in his pursuit of what, refusing to abandon the vernacular of racing drivers of the 50s, he referred to as “crumpet”, he was married three times. The first marriage, in 1957, was to Katie Molson, the heir to a Canadian brewing fortune; they separated three years later. In 1964 he married Elaine Barbarino, an American public relations executive, with whom he had a daughter, Allison, in 1967, and from whom he was divorced the following year.

I had been asked to be the external examiner for a PhD by a university I had better not name. The supervisor was a former colleague and friend. The thesis was excellent and on an important topic. It all seemed very straightforward. But then I got a request from the HR department to send a photocopy of my passport, something I had never been asked for before. I was uneasy but complied. A few weeks later I met the vice-chancellor and casually mentioned what I had dismissed as typically over-fussy behaviour by HR. I was taken aback when instead of agreeing or sympathising, she robustly defended the request, saying the university was legally obliged to check anyone it paid was not in the UK illegally. I pointed out that it was difficult to imagine illegal immigrants making a living from the token fees paid to external examiners, and dropped the subject. The revelations about the damage inflicted by the government on people of the Windrush generation have been shocking. But there is another sinister symptom of the “hostile environment” that has far-reaching consequences and has yet to be remedied. The only thing the government has apologised for, under the duress of bad publicity, is that the wrong people – UK citizens or those with permanent residence rights – had been caught up in the net of its relentlessly hostile policy to immigrants. This same policy has turned hospitals, local councils, housing associations, employers, and, of course, colleges and universities, into state enforcers. Now universities are expected to check that anyone they make a payment to, however trivial, has a legal right to be in the UK. This covers not only external examiners but also speakers who receive any kind of fee as well as employees, casual and permanent. This vetting of external speakers is a far greater affront to academic freedom than the stray examples of no-platforming that so appal ministers and the Office for Students. It doesn’t end there. For a long time, some students who have lived in the UK and been educated here have been categorised as international students, and so have to pay high fees, because of question marks about their status. Then there is the government’s anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent, which involves more vetting. External speakers now have to prove not only that they are not “illegals”, but occasionally give an indication of what they are going to say to make sure they are not promoting (ill-defined) extremism. This is not the place to get into a detailed argument about the rights and wrongs of Prevent, although it is worth noting that it would be unconstitutional in the US and that restricting free speech, however extreme, has to be fully justified in a liberal democracy and open society. The real issue is whether it is right to place legal-administrative responsibilities on universities that, in effect, make them state agents. As the Windrush scandal reminds us, organisations err on the side of caution. If in doubt, don’t. So the vettings and restrictions inexorably spread. Maybe we should ponder the fate of the Central European University in Budapest, its very existence endangered by the triumphantly re-elected Orbán government – on a platform with chilling reminders of the anti-immigration agenda pursued less aggressively but just as surely by the UK government with its Brexit “mandate”. The economist Friedrich Hayek, certainly a favourite among ministers and their supporting cast of ideologues, wrote a book entitled The Road to Serfdom. Universities are advancing down that road, lulled by the supposed limits set by English pragmatism and sense of “fair play”. Under the pretence of protecting the “customer”, they are burdened with ever more state regulation and control, as well as being turned into agents of the state on immigration, anti-radicalisation and the rest. Two final thoughts. How reassured will EU citizens working in our colleges and universities be by the treatment of the Windrush generation? As for me, next time I am asked to send a copy of my passport I will politely decline. To agree would be a betrayal of my rights as a free-born citizen of a country for ever associated with liberty.

The research follows previous work by the team from University of Sussex which compiled a directory of horse facial expressions, and revealed that Black Beauty can read your emotions – a phenomenon also seen in dogs. “We knew that horses could register emotional expressions, so we wanted to know if they could remember them, so that they can actually use those memories to guide their future interactions with specific individuals,” said Karen McComb, co-author of the study and professor of animal behaviour and cognition at the University of Sussex. McComb and colleagues analysed data from 11 horses who had been shown a photograph of a human pulling an angry face and 10 horses shown a picture of a human smiling. Each horse was shown a large photograph of one of two participants for two minutes; three to six hours later they were brought face-to-face with the person they had seen in the photograph who was sporting a neutral expression. To avoid the possibility of giving tell-tale cues, the person was unaware whether it was a happy or angry photo of that had been previously shown to the horse. The small study, published in the journal Current Biology, reveal that horses who had been earlier been shown an angry photo of the participant spent longer viewing them with their left eye than those who had seen a happy photo. That, said McComb is important because information from the left eye is sent to the right hemisphere of the brain, where potential threats and dangers are processed. By contrast, those who had seen the happy photo spent longer looking at the person with their right eye than those who had seen an angry image. “The left hemisphere of the brain connects to the right gaze and is more specialised for prosocial, positive-type reactions,” said McComb. The team also found that horses which had earlier been shown an angry photograph appeared to find the face-to-face meeting more stressful, more frequently displaying “coping behaviours” like licking and chewing, scratching, and sniffing at the floor. To see whether the results were a response to a particular person, the team showed 24 different horses a happy or angry photo of one of two participants and, later that day, brought them face-to-face with the other participant. “They treated the person the same irrespective of whether it was the negative [photograph] they had seen in the morning or the positive one,” said McComb, although she noted that in both cases the horses spent longer looking with their left eye, possibly indicating they weren’t keen on the experimental setup. The upshot, say the team, is that horses appear to be able to remember facial expressions of specific humans, even when only seen for a few moments – and from a photograph. “It is quite an amazing result really,” said McComb. “It is really interesting that animals are picking up on the subtle emotional expressions that humans are revealing on a moment to moment basis” she added. “Crucially in taking it in they don’t just forget it, they use that information – they have a memory for the emotional states that they have seen in humans and they use that information.” The team note that it is not clear whether horses can also read the expressions of other species, too, or if they are particularly tuned into humans – possibly as a result of domestication – either through an innate or learned ability. Paul McGreevy, professor of animal behaviour and animal welfare science at the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study said the research highlights the importance of social bonding in horses. “These exciting findings explain how horses have evolved a remarkable ability to see objects and other beings in great detail to help avoid conflicts within their social group and remain safe from threats in their environment,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/cult-of-gdp-economists-production-indicators","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Down with the cult of GDP.

For us economists, it’s yesterday’s yardstick","bodyText":"This morning at 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will release its latest estimate of UK economic output – gross domestic product, or GDP for short. The figures, which will be revised when better data becomes available, will be endlessly discussed and analysed, and will form the basis for economic commentary and policy in the months ahead. At their best, economic indicators such as GDP can be a viewfinder through which we see the economy. After all, we need statistics to shed light on economic imbalances and unfairness, and help citizens and policymakers understand what needs to be done to put them right. But as an economist, I’m always aware that reducing the unimaginable complexity and diversity of the economy to a single number – or even a series of numbers – can dehumanise or even misrepresent what is really happening in people’s lives. Getting that full, accurate picture of the economy has always been difficult. But the pace at which disruptive technologies are changing our economy is shifting the nature of the challenge from one year to the next. There’s now a real risk that the favoured selection of go-to economic indicators doesn’t capture the impact of those new technologies on economic behaviour and trends. For instance, digitalisation – the increasing prevalence of information and communication technologies, and of the internet in work and social life – is having a rapid and profound impact on the economy. One challenge it poses for economists is that it is moving whole swaths of activity beyond what we call the “production boundary”, which is captured by GDP. We need to find new ways of measuring these if we are to obtain an accurate picture of what’s actually happening in the economy. Profit-shifting by companies to minimise their UK tax liabilities is a well-known phenomenon, and it’s likely to be increasing our current account deficit, as it means companies sending income to lower-tax countries. We need to understand the effect of this better, and find ways to measure and account for it. We also fail to properly understand how new forms of “intangible assets” – such as software, databases and knowledge acquired through research – are affecting the economy, while the way in which technology adds value to goods and services is also changing. Public policy to steer the economy will succeed in its aims only if it is informed by both accurate economic indicators to provide the macroeconomic context, and credible evidence of its impact via robust evaluation, so we need to keep investing in our public data if it is to remain relevant. But it’s not just a case of improving the statistics we currently focus on. Our reliance on a small number of production indicators narrows economic debate and perpetuates the myth that economic growth encompasses all other economic goals. Simply tracking GDP and a small number of production statistics is not enough; and it may even undermine progress towards a more just economy, as it distracts attention from the issues that really matter. If we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver – broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth; poverty rates among children and adults; levels of wellbeing among individuals at different income levels; the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest; and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation. Together, these indicators reveal how broadly the economy distributes its rewards, whether it is succeeding at reducing poverty, whether people feel satisfied with their lives, and our progress at moving to an environmentally sustainable model of growth. Our suggested indicators are not the only ways of measuring these goals, but between them, we believe they would capture the current performance of the economy in achieving the outcomes that matter most. If the economy doesn’t show improvement by the metrics we have chosen, it isn’t working. • Catherine Colebrook is chief economist at IPPR and author of Measuring What Matters: Improving the Indicators of Economic Performance"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/grenfell-tower-public-inquiry-timetable-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T13:50:26Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower public inquiry timetable unveiled","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/grenfell-tower-public-inquiry-timetable-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/grenfell-tower-public-inquiry-timetable-fire","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower public inquiry timetable unveiled","bodyText":"The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has unveiled a timetable for the hearing of evidence that lawyers believe could see it continue well into 2020. The first six months of the inquiry, which will start on 21 May with two weeks of testimony from friends and relatives of the 72 killed, will focus solely on what happened on the night of the fire in west London. That will be followed by months of further evidence examining why the fire happened. A timetable for that larger part of the inquiry has yet to be set. The Millennium Gloucester hotel, 3 miles from the burnt-out hulk of Grenfell Tower, will host the testimonies, in which families are being invited to speak about the bereaved, read poems, sing or provide pre-recorded video messages. The inquiry will then move east to the Holborn Bars building, close to the inns of court. No evidence will be heard during the week of the first anniversary of the disaster on 14 June, out of respect and to allow participants to engage in memorial events. Firefighters and commanders are scheduled to give evidence for an estimated six weeks, starting on 21 June, and the bereaved, survivors and local residents will give their accounts of the night of the fire throughout September. Expert witnesses will provide accounts of the cause and spread of the fire, how the cladding and insulation contributed to the spread of the flames, and why passive and active fire protection measures failed. The first phase of the inquiry is scheduled to run until early November but will not consider decisions made about the refurbishment of the tower, Kensington and Chelsea council’s interaction with residents, or the governance and management of the block. Most of these issues are expected to be tackled in a second phase, which one lawyer for the bereaved said was likely to take the inquiry well into 2020, once possible delays were taken into account. In all, the inquiry will tackle 13 separate issues, nine of which have been slated for the second phase. In March the inquiry chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said the inquiry had received more than 330,000 documents, with many more expected. The inquiry has 547 core participants – 519 individuals and 28 organisations – and a small army of lawyers has been assembled to represent them. Grenfell United, a survivors group, welcomed the announcement of the date for the start of the inquiry. “This has been a long journey for us already, and our fight for truth and justice is just starting,” it said. “But we also want to remind the prime minister of our petition for a panel of decision-making experts to sit beside and support Sir Martin Moore-Bick. Without a panel, we risk a loss of confidence in the inquiry.” In December, Theresa May rejected calls for a diverse decision-making panel to sit alongside Moore-Bick. The decision to divide the inquiry in two is partly driven by a desire to determine whether there are safety lessons that need to be applied to some of the 304 high-rise buildings in England that are clad in similar combustible panels and have failed government fire tests. Of the 158 social housing buildings judged to have failed large-scale system tests, only seven had finished remediation work, the government said on Friday. Remedial work had started on 104 others. The housing charity Shelter described the figures as a disgrace. Its chief executive, Polly Neate, said: “It has left tenants uncertain of when their buildings will be made safe, and private tenants are fearful of what this could cost. This vital safety work is mired in delays and confusion, and for the sake of the people living in these tower blocks, this chaotic approach cannot continue.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “This work must be done properly and will take time. However, interim fire safety measures are in place to keep people protected in their homes. Over 65% of social housing buildings with unsafe cladding are currently going through the complex process of remediating their buildings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-11-all-in","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Homeland recap: season 7, episode 11 – All In","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-11-all-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/29/homeland-recap-season-7-episode-11-all-in","fields":{"headline":"Homeland recap: season 7, episode 11 – All In","bodyText":"‘The world is watching. The Kremlin has lost control. You are the problem’ Carrie flanks Saul at the table as he gets to work telling the Russians how miffed he is at their rotten subterfuge. When he can finally be bothered to swing by, Yevgeny answers the numerous accusations levelled against him with flat denials and some world-class whataboutery chronicling the US’s history of less-than-stellar foreign interventions. Saul can field this garbage all day, particularly as the whole meeting is a decoy so that Anson and his boys can snatch up Simone at the dacha. Calamity strikes on the exfiltration op, though, when they are ambushed by Russian agents who seemingly knew about their plans. With one man down and the element of surprise gone, it is clear to everyone that they need to flee back home or face a trip to the gulag. Everyone except Carrie, that is. She didn’t lose her mind and her kid to walk away when she’s this close to the prize. She persuades Saul to put the squeeze on Yakushin by emptying his sizeable US bank accounts. All he needs to do to get his cash back is give up Simone. It works like a charm, with the general sending a battalion of his balaclava’d SVR goons to storm the GRU headquarters where Simone is now holed up. Chaos reigns. It’s awesome. Carrie and her team slip into the building during the melee. A quick Harold Lloyd tribute on the balcony and she’s into Simone’s suite, where her welcome is a gun trained on her head. With the clock ticking and her life on the line, she reminds Simone what happens to Yevgeny’s allies when they become a problem: Krupin, Clayton, Dante – not a pulse between them. Simone can’t deny the cold logic of it. With a quick switcheroo, the pair are out of there. Carrie may well have started the next Russian Revolution, but she went all-in and got Simone all-out. Maggie wasn’t kidding. She was born to do this. ‘Worst part is, she told me. She told me not only that it was Russians, but that they were using me to get to her’ Demonstrating the survival instincts of a rat in a tight corner on a pressing schedule, Paley visits Dar Adal – a prisoner of conscience, legally detained for a crime he did commit. The prospect of freedom loosens Dar’s tongue and he advises Paley to go after whatever Russian experts are coordinating Saul’s covert op. His chief of staff, Janet, is straight on the case. She leans on Saul’s IT whiz Clint who, in a triumph of trope over nuance, lives in his mammy’s basement. One mention of the attorney general and he folds like a cheap suit, giving up the operation’s location, the mission intent and lets slip the fact that Simone is still alive. Saul really could stand to vet his nerds more thoroughly. Janet passes on the intel to Paley and virtually frogmarches him to the Russian ambassador so he can join that betraying-your-country craze everyone’s into this year. When he stalls – paralysed by the enormity of the act – she speaks to the ambassador herself. That’s the great thing about Russians – they are always ready to listen to treason. ‘They’re not gonna stop, these people lined up against me’ The supreme court back the invoking of the 25th amendment and Elizabeth is finally moved out of the Oval Office by vice-president Warner. President Keane is not quite done yet, though. Warner needs a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to ratify his presidency or Elizabeth is back in power and, as usurpers go, he’s terribly underwhelming. When the footage of the Russian carnage goes viral, Paley demands that he disown Saul, and Warner looks lost. It’s lonely at the top, old boy. Notes and observations Was Yevgeny really coming to kill Simone? I say no. The love story is real and to kill her before she flipped is too cold-blooded even for him. David’s worry from Like Bad at Things that Elizabeth would be the first president since Harrison not to make it to 100 days seems prescient, but I think she’s going to come through this crisis like all the others. She always finds a way. Some commenters have proposed Janet as a Russian mole and that increasingly sounds like a good shout. She has the clout, the smarts and a ruthless streak that would make Allison Carr blush. “She’s not an idiot.” I liked Yevgeny’s show of respect for Carrie. Mortal enemies they may be, but game recognises game. Is Yevgeny now gunning for Simone? Can Keane survive? What will happen to the major players in the finale?

The late 1960s saw the fag-end of the second majority Labour government, one that had disillusioned the left with its lack of economic radicalism and its support for the US-led Vietnam war. Today’s left has two distinct advantages to promote its mission. First, the leadership of the Labour Party and a 40,000-strong leftist movement in the shape of Momentum. Second, the rise of social media to challenge the otherwise profoundly politically hostile mainstream press with viral content such as videos, dissenting articles and memes. An earlier left had neither, which is why posters proved such a critical means to spread their message. The Poster Workshop – a printing workshop in Camden Town that existed 1968-71 – used this age-old populist form of political agitation to spread radical messages on everything from opposing Iran’s despotic shah to fighting racism. Emerging in 1968 – the year France was convulsed by a near-revolutionary surge of workers’ and students’ revolts – Poster Workshop rejected hierarchical structures and had an open-door policy for leftist agitators. It proved a synthesis of counterculture and political radicalism; some were involved in the anti-authoritarian Marxist Situationist International, for example, which harked back to the art movements of the early 20th century. Striking workers, anti-apartheid activists, tenants protesting rent hikes, Trotskyists, young Communists and Irish solidarity groups were among those who used Poster Workshop to mobilise support. Mostly skint activists without funds, they used screen-printing, which required inexpensive equipment and could easily be transported. The pioneers gave a flavour of the times and included Sam Lord, an ex-art school student politicised by Vietnam who lived in a west London slum, and Jean Loup Msika, a French-Tunisian driven from his country by his involvement in the May events. These were simple posters, often coloured in the red and black colours of socialism and anarchism. Anti-Vietnam posters declared the UK the “51st state of US” and advertised protests in cities around the country while others stuck two fingers up at the political elite: “Vote for Guy Fawkes the Only Man Ever to Enter Parliament With Honest Intentions.” As today, migrants were in the firing line: when hard-right Tory MP Tom Iremonger declared that “the British people are fed up with being trampled underfoot by foreign scum”, they responded with a poster emblazoned with “We Are All Foreign Scum”. Others advertised strike meetings and called for workers’ solidarity. While the causes are often unnervingly similar, and the posters often imaginative and striking, today’s radical can be comforted at the far greater ease with which they can popularise their message.

On wider reflection this isn’t just a bad idea. It’s more out-there than that, the kind of idea you might expect a precocious toddler to come up with, or some other species altogether: an ambitious sports-marketing chicken with a below average IQ, or a squirrel promoted by a series of unlikely events to a key management role in the national summer sport. Perhaps the only real purpose it has at this stage is to demonstrate that nobody really understands cricket any more. Not the people who watch and play it, and certainly not those overseeing its aggressive dissolution into various constituent parts. And yet there is always clarity. New forms, new shapes and above all pure, non-negotiable talent. At which point, enter Jofra Archer, surely the post-modern sporting personage to stroll across the fault lines in English cricket’s immediate future. Yes he still sounds like the Queen’s third cousin trying to pronounce the name of the author of Kane and Abel but Archer’s progress from here is likely to speak to how and where cricket will exist at this level in the future. Right now he has the world pretty much curled up in his lap. From a tough upbringing in Barbados, through back injuries and remodelling at Sussex, the last two years have been a period of extreme fast-forward for a 23-year-old fast bowling all-rounder of prodigious, insouciant athleticism. This week Archer got his first shot in the Indian Premier League. It was predictably spectacular, containing towards the end of his bowling spell one of those moments that carves out its own little pocket of calm in the middle of all that groin-thrusting pizzazz. Hardik Pandya had just pinged the third ball of Archer’s fourth over back past him with real whip-crack power. Archer shrugged and walked back. There was no obvious change in his straight, gliding run but the next ball was an express yorker that thunked Pandya’s pad and splayed his stumps. The one after that was up at 93mph and just too much for Mitch McClenaghan, who offered his bat only vaguely, like a man suggesting talks about talks. Archer smiled and eventually did a funny little dance, all goofy, incredulous charm. But he must be getting used to these moments because everybody wants a piece of Jofra, from the IPL to the Big Bash to West Indies, for whom he no longer qualifies because of an absence from domestic cricket. Everyone, it seems, except the ECB. While the world outside gorges on his peak years, and with Archer committed to playing Tests for England, English cricket continues to tap its foot, to count those 210 residency days a year, to insist we all wait until Archer is 27 years old before deeming him English enough to play. Rules are rules. There are good reasons why cricket is protective of its borders, why football’s parents-and-grandparents qualification rule would be destructive and confusing. International sport makes sense only as a clash of system, a gauge of culture and resources. All the more so in cricket where the whole process is bound up in nurture and knowledge passed down, whether in a spiffy indoor school or playing with a tape ball. And yet there is still a weirdness to Archer’s seven years. He has a British passport. He was born with the right to live and work in the UK. He has been hugely improved, even defined in a cricket sense by his experiences at Sussex. And yet the ECB still maintains he is not quite of the system, that he must do his time in the ennobling purgatory of county cricket, thereby becoming eligible, like every other England player, to ignore it completely after that. The rules on this were tightened in 2012, with four years increased to seven, cracking down on incomers and creating incentives for the domestic production line. This was the hostile environment the ECB sought to create. The world has changed since then. Brexit will close the Kolpak hole. Meanwhile international cricket is fading, out-swanked by the franchises. Is there really a need to set up such high fences, to fight them off with quite such a large stick? There are a few things that could happen. The ECB could decide to give Archer a discretionary four years instead. Or the rules could change. What harm would there be in adding a favourable loophole? How about two years for passport holders from Commonwealth countries. Or even – gasp – no years at all. Until then Archer will remain a citizen of the fractured global game, eligible to play for no one and also everyone, a cricketing version of those people who end up living in airport arrivals, strolling the sealed environment, living off tiny shower gel capsules and casual dining meal deals. At a time when the ECB is willing to rewrite the basic rules of cricket in search of the Confused Mum Pound, it seems a little absurd to maintain such a hard line.

It was an invasion that forced 250,000 Belgian refugees to get in boats and seek safety in Britain. They came. They were welcomed. They were cared for. This should be remembered, perhaps, as a lesson in kindness for us today. In the evening, I stood in the bitter cold under the Menin Gate as the Ypres fire brigade bugles played the Last Post, as they have done every evening since 1928, except during the German occupation of Belgium in the second world war. As the echoes faded, I thought of my uncle Pieter Cammaerts, who died in the second world war – in the RAF, aged 21, in 1941. Uncle Pieter is buried in the church at Radlett, his name is on the war memorial in the Hertfordshire town, but almost no one alive today knew him. He died two years before I was born and I know him only from photographs, from family stories. But so much of the reason I was standing under the gate, so much of why I had written my most recent book, In the Mouth of the Wolf, and War Horse and Private Peaceful, was because of my uncle Pieter, and my uncle Francis. My uncles have fascinated and inspired me since I was a child. In my family, their lives are legendary. All my writing life I had wanted to tell their story. Writing it was my way of trying to remember them, of acknowledging my debt to them, and all the millions of “mouthless dead” of two wars. They had fought for peace. I had enjoyed that peace in a Europe that, for the most part, had decided enough was enough, that war was not the way. I lived in a European Union. We members argued often, but no longer fought. Togetherness seemed to be working. Peace had become too precious. My uncles were among those who had enabled that reconciliation to happen. The two brothers, though very different – Francis, tall, confident and charismatic, Pieter, smaller, tentative and fragile – were close. They came from a Christian socialist family, their father, Emile, was a Belgian poet and free thinker, later art critic, philosopher and professor of Belgian studies at London University. Their mother, Tita, was an actor, a devoted Christian, a formidable and highly principled woman. There were four equally formidable sisters, my mother among them. It was a house of music, theatre and books, of heated discussion and strong opinions. Holidays were often spent walking in the Ardennes, which the family loved. Francis, a socialist and pacifist, went to Cambridge and became a teacher. Pieter went to Rada in London and was starting out on a promising career as an actor when war broke out in September 1939. He joined up almost at once. Francis, following his convictions, became a conscientious objector, and was sent to work as a shepherd on a Lincolnshire farm. The Germans were soon invading Belgium, through the family’s beloved Ardennes, and marching into France, towards the Channel. Invasion was threatening. In 1941, Pieter, now a sergeant observer in the RAF, was killed when his plane crashed in St Eval in Cornwall. The family were devastated. Francis, still shepherding but now a husband and father, decided he could no longer stand by while others were fighting for his family’s survival, and for the beliefs and freedoms that were so precious to him. He confided his dilemma to Harry Rée, his great friend, fellow teacher and pacifist, who, unbeknown to Francis, had already joined the Special Operations Executive, SOE. Francis spoke fluent French. Harry said that could be useful, and that he would put him in touch with someone in London. Francis walked into an interview in an upstairs room in Baker Street a shepherd, and came out an officer in the SOE. After months of gruelling training, during which he could say nothing to his wife, Nan, or his friends and family, Francis found himself in German occupied France. In Paris, he realised at once that fellow agents there were compromised. Within days more than 60 were rounded up and shot. Francis by this time had made his way south, where he found himself organising and supplying resistance fighters, the Maquis, across a swath of southern France, an army that in the end numbered more than 10,000 men and women, comprising communists, socialists and Gaullists, from all walks of life, all determined to rid their country of the invader. So this pacifist uncle was now a secret agent, fighting the enemy, living in constant danger of capture and death. But he proved to be an agent who had all the right instincts. Trust, he knew, was everything. He had seen others’ mistakes. He picked his few friends with great care. He was courageous, and scrupulous about security, never sleeping more than two nights in one place. He inspired and gave great loyalty. The Germans put a huge price on his head, but he was never betrayed. He managed to outwit both the Gestapo and their counterparts in the dreaded French Milice, and survived these perilous years through his skill and bravery, but also through the love and courage of his comrades. He returned after the liberation of France to his family, and to his life as a headteacher, and a principal of teacher-training colleges in England and in Botswana. When Francis was an old man, I visited him in Le Pouget, the village in south-east France where he came to live in his latter years, to be closer to his family and his old friends from the resistance. Only if pressed would he speak of his war years. Two weeks before he died, the villagers gave him a 90th birthday party. The children sang, the mayor made a speech. He was a legend there, too, not only in his family. More and more I wanted to tell his story. It was important to the family and to me, especially now Britain had decided to leave the European Union. The Mouth of the Wolf begins with an old Englishman being given a 90th birthday party by the people of his French village. Tired, he goes to bed and remembers those people who could not be there with him that day. He talks to them, remembers with them the joys and the sorrows. But it was difficult, I found, to settle to my writing in the midst of the post-referendum furore. It came to me as I was trying to weave the story of my two uncles, that in all the bitter bickering about Europe, few if any were talking about why the EU was there, how it came to be. My uncles had done what they had done to defeat tyranny, to bring peace and reconciliation. They knew, we all know, that for hundreds of years, thousands even, European states had fought one another. Trade wars, religious wars, power grabs, land grabs, disputes between kings and emperors – our continent has been almost constantly at war over the centuries. In the last century, the inclination of the great European powers towards belligerence and self-destruction led us into the two most destructive wars the world has ever known. Then, out of the rubble, out of all the grieving and misery, France and Germany, the two great nations at the heart of these titanic struggles, decided that the only way to ensure peace was through trade; that if they created close, mutually beneficial links, there would never be any need or wish to fight, that prosperity, security and peace would be interlocked. Soon, six nations gathered together to create this trading bloc. Europe’s peoples could see the sense of this. More wanted to join. So the new Europe, changing its name and much else besides, grew in numbers, grew closer, and did help to bring lasting peace. But it became bureaucratic, less democratic, put ever more stars on its flag, and created a new currency. The mutual benefits of prosperity and stability were evident, but were not shared equitably. We were a member of a club in which we felt we were losing control over our destiny, where the rules were being changed, which alarmed many. We argued, all the countries argued. But it was still jaw-jaw, not war-war. In this febrile atmosphere came the referendum. I was sure the people would vote to stay in because I thought British people valued peace above all else, and the prosperity most had enjoyed for so long. Yes, there was plenty we did not like about Europe, but we would stay and put that right. I was wrong. But I am sure, too, that the country was wrong, deluded by lies and statistics, by absurd promises. I feel we are now travelling down a path that takes us away from our friends and neighbours. We have told them we don’t like them, that we wish to divorce them. They are hurt, upset, angry. Why wouldn’t they be? My uncles’ lives taught me that peace must come first, before prosperity. They helped make Europe a place of peace at last, of free peoples. That’s the Europe, with all its faults, I believe we belong to. That Channel of ours has saved us in the past, often. Now it threatens to separate us. Holding hands across the sea is the only way. It always was. My uncles knew that. • In the Mouth of the Wolf is published by Egmont.

Ingredients such as vitamin C (used for brightening) are frequently packaged in glass dropper bottles, where they’ll oxidise and become useless a week after unscrewing. It’s a bugbear of mine, and I wish airless opaque pumps weren’t so often the preserve of cult, expensive brands. Individual capsules, twisted open for a fresh, daily application, solve the same problem, and have the added benefit of taking up about as much space in your suitcase as an aspirin. I rarely go anywhere overnight without an Elizabeth Arden Advanced Ceramide Capsule (£39 for 30). These were the first of their kind but, thanks to reformulation last year, remain the best. The contents – a blend of fatty acids, cholesterol and retinol to moisturise, protect and tackle wrinkles – is too rich for some (even I can skip night cream afterwards), though they do thin out as the serum melts on contact. Skin feels wonderfully soft in the morning and, because they’re fragrance-free, never irritated. I’m a huge fan. Oily skins fare better with Elemis’ luxurious Cellular Recovery Skin Bliss Capsules (£66 for 60), colour-coded for morning and night, and used daily as an intensive course, to soften and smooth; or with the wildly popular (and vegan-friendly) M&amp;S Absolute Time Capsules (£25 for 28). If your concern is uneven tone, you’ll need a vitamin C formula, and I have just the thing: Beauty Pie’s Superactive Pure Double Capsules (£9.81 for 60 to members). While they’re less potent than some, at 10% concentration of vitamin C, they do instantly enliven dullness and should get cracking on dark spots. The inclusion of vitamin E makes them good for acne scarring, too. There’s an excellent hydrating version of the same product for £9.27 that, I can attest, is just the thing for a hangover after you’ve finished your Lucozade and fried egg bap. Before you rightly ponder the wastefulness and environmental impact of capsules, know that all of the above are made from algae and can simply be tossed into your compost to biodegrade fully over time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/bonhomie-korean-peninsula-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:51:41Z","webTitle":"Bonhomie on Korean peninsula puts pressure on bellicose Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/bonhomie-korean-peninsula-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/bonhomie-korean-peninsula-trump","fields":{"headline":"Bonhomie on Korean peninsula puts pressure on bellicose Trump","bodyText":"The joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, the fruit of Friday’s unexpectedly warm, fraternal summit, represents a big political and diplomatic triumph for both Korean leaders. It will gratify China’s government too, and relieve people around the world worried about nuclear war. But it could be a big problem for Donald Trump. The measures announced at the end of a day of talks will be enthusiastically welcomed by Koreans on both sides of the border. They included denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, a possible peace treaty, military confidence-building measures, regular bilateral summits and increased people-to-people contacts. For Koreans and their Japanese neighbours, who spent much of 2017 fearing nuclear Armageddon, Kim’s pledge on paper to permanently halt North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and missiles, desist from further provocations and halt hostile propaganda – and in effect move towards normalised relations – is a great boon. But the vagueness of Kim’s reported commitment to denuclearise will do nothing to assuage American suspicions that, as in the past, North Korea is playing a double game – promising to engage in a long-term, essentially meaningless disarmament process while exploiting its newfound status as a nuclear weapons state to extract concessions. Nothing happened at the summit to suggest Kim is prepared to reduce, let alone dismantle, his nuclear arsenal in the foreseeable future. And that is a big worry for the Americans. The US wants unconditional, irreversible, verifiable North Korean disarmament, which is still a long way off. An immediate difficulty for Trump as he plans his own summit with Kim in the next few weeks is that his South Korean allies have, in effect, pulled the carpet from under him. Moon and Kim’s evident mutual goodwill, the raft of new measures intended to build detente and co-prosperity, and their dangling of the tantalising prospect of eventual Korean unification contrast sharply with Trump’s aggressive and occasionally bellicose stance. If Trump tries to play hardball with Kim, he risks looking like a warmonger and a bully whose policies are inimical to Korean interests, north and south. Intentionally of otherwise, Moon, a lifelong advocate of detente with personal connections to North Korea, has spiked Trump’s guns. This sudden outbreak of bonhomie may now place Trump under growing pressure from US allies to tone down his rhetoric, pull back his military forces in the region and make concessions of his own. Many have tried and failed to make Trump act nice. Kim may have found a way. What Moon called Kim’s courage in making a break with the past may stem in part from the influence and support of the North Korean leader’s smart-as-tacks sister, Kim Yo-jong. She played a key role in breaking the ice at the Winter Olympics this year and has become one of North Korea’s very few international celebrities. She was at Kim’s side again on Friday. The summit outcome will please Beijing, which Kim visited in preparation for the summit. China’s cooperation in enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea, especially its cuts in fuel oil exports and coal imports, have had a big impact. But China does not want any excuse for further US encroachment in its backyard. When Kim met Xi Jinping, China’s president, he was reportedly strongly advised to de-escalate military tensions and concentrate instead on restoring North Korea’s ailing economy. The Panmunjom agreements appears to reflect what is being termed Kim’s “new strategic line”. As much as anything, the summit was a personal triumph for Kim. Derided by Trump as “little rocket man” and almost universally condemned as the cruel dictator of the world’s most backward country, heappeared on Friday as a half-reasonable, even likeable sort of chap. Treading South Korean soil for the first time, Kim may have reflected on having dreamed of this moment all his life. Confidently offering his hand to Moon, he stepped out of the dark shadow cast by his dad, Kim Jong-il, and his grandad, his country’s grim founding eminence, Kim Il-sung. Chummy Kim ended a 65-year-old jinx. He broke the spell and changed the mood. He has conjured new hopes of peace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T16:00:27Z","webTitle":"This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review","fields":{"headline":"This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay – review","bodyText":"In 2010, after six years of training and six more on the wards, Adam Kay hung up his stethoscope.

News of the appeal came shortly before the Spanish government announced that it would re-examine the country’s sexual offences legislation to establish whether such crimes were adequately defined and categorised. The verdict, which was announced on Thursday at the end of five months of deliberation by judges in the northern region of Navarre, prompted a furious public reaction and protests across Spain. The trial had been seen as a cross-examination of the 18-year-old woman, rather than the men who attacked her. One of the three judges had argued that the defendants should have been acquitted of all charges except the theft of the victim’s phone. On Friday morning, the Navarre regional government said its lawyers were working to appeal against the verdict, in which each defendant was jailed for nine years and ordered to pay the victim €10,000 (£8,800). A spokeswoman said the regional government was looking into “possible contradictions” in the sentence, particularly the fact that while the judges had accepted key parts of the victim’s testimony, they had failed to find the evidence of violence and intimidation needed to secure a rape conviction. The lawyers are expected to lodge their appeal with Navarre’s supreme court within the next 10 working days. Ana Ollo, the region’s minister for citizen and institutional relations, said: “The government stands with the majority of its citizens, who yesterday expressed their unhappiness with, and rejection of, the sentence in dozens of places across Navarre.” Olli said society “cannot understand how there is no violence or intimidation in a case like this”, adding that the continued focus on “women’s reactions instead of the behaviour of violent men” was at the heart of the problem. “We just cannot understand how the collective assault of women can be seen by some sexist men as a leisure activity that goes unpunished and has become normalised,” she said. Carlos Bacaicoa, a lawyer for the victim, said he was waiting to find out whether his client also wished to appeal against the verdict. “We need to talk to her to see if she wants to appeal,” he told Efe news agency. “We feel that it needs to be appealed.” The five men, who nicknamed themselves “the wolfpack” and included a soldier and a Guardia Civil police officer, were found guilty of the “continuous sexual abuse” of the woman in the lobby of a building in Pamplona in the early hours of 7 July 2016. But they were not found guilty of rape. Under Spanish law, the lesser offence of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. However, the judges recognised that the victim had been “stunned and unable to react” to what five older and stronger men were doing. They also noted that she had adopted “an attitude of submission and subjugation” during the attack and “she did not freely give her consent; rather, it was coerced or forced given the situation”. Speaking on Thursday, Spain’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, said that while the sentences ought to be respected, authorities needed to analyse what had happened “to avoid such behaviour happening again in this country”. The following day, the government announced the review of existing legislation. Its spokesman, Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, described the Pamplona attack as “despicable”. He said that while the government respected the independence of the courts, it “has always been, is, and will always be on the side of the victims”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/prince-louis-14-things-we-learned-royal-baby-name","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T16:51:40Z","webTitle":"Prince Louis: 14 things we learned after the royal baby was named","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/prince-louis-14-things-we-learned-royal-baby-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/prince-louis-14-things-we-learned-royal-baby-name","fields":{"headline":"Prince Louis: 14 things we've learned about the royal baby's name","bodyText":"1 It isn’t a hugely popular boys’ name in England and Wales According to the ONS data, over recent years Louis has been hovering between being the 70th and 80th most popular boys names for new babies. The Cambridges’ previous name choices have been much more popular in the country at large – George was in the top 10 most popular names. Whether the new baby’s name sparks a rise in popularity for Louis remains to be seen: Charlotte has fallen slightly in popularity since their second child was named. 2 It was a surprise choice Most pundits and bookmakers had made Arthur or Albert the firm favourite to be picked – with Louis an outside bet. 3 Not least because Louis has borrowed it from his brother The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge already had used the name when they named their first child. Prince George, third in line to the throne, has the full given name of George Alexander Louis. 4 It has – predictably – divided the Mumsnet community The name has not been universally well received on Mumsnet. Founder and CEO Justine Roberts said: “Kate and William have form for picking traditional names and Louis fits the bill. On the Mumsnet talk boards there is a clear split between those who love traditional names and those who prefer something more unusual. The royals have followed one strong rule: don’t announce the name before the baby is born. It’s much harder to dislike a name if a cute baby is attached to it.” 5 Blackpool zoo saw an opportunity Blackpool zoo had a baby camel calf born on the same day as the new prince, and wasted no time giving it the same name. The animal is cute, so we can just about forgive them. 6 It’s a very French name We anticipate at least one tabloid headline exclaiming “Sacre bleu!” on Saturday at the idea that the British royal family have adopted such a French name. 7 The French had 18 kings named Louis The French monarchy were historically very keen on the name Louis, and ended up with 18 monarchs bearing that name. In fact, for 186 years between 1610 and 1798, every king was called Louis. 8 And there was almost nearly a Louis XIX too The 19th King Louis of France ruled for about 20 minutes before abdicating in 1830. His father, Charles X, had given up the throne that day during the Second French Revolution, and Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, clearly saw which way the political wind was blowing. 9 But what does it mean in French? The Frankish roots of the name are said to derive from the words for fame and warrior, and its original form was Hlōdowik. The English derivatives have become Louis and Lewis, with the name becoming Ludwig in the Germanic tongue. 10 The English did (sort of) have a King Louis for a while He doesn’t feature in the Horrible Histories Kings and Queens song – but Louis VIII of France spent some time in England cavorting around as king, even having a proclamation of it at St Paul’s Cathedral. He was being preferred as ruler by the barons who despised King John. However, having landed at Thanet in 1216, Louis was removed from the throne when King John died, and the barons decided it was easier to deal with making his nine-year-old son King Henry III than carry on working with the Frenchman. In 1217 the treaty of Lambeth was signed, and Louis was paid 10,000 marks on the condition that he accepted he had never been the legitimate King of England. This was one of the few times when “let us never speak of this thing again” became a clause in an international agreement. 11 It has a family tie for Prince William There’s a closer personal link for the present-day royal family. The last prominent British royal names Louis was Louis Mountbatten, the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and uncle to Prince Philip. Lord Mountbatten, one of his twin grandsons, and a local boy were killed when a bomb planted by the IRA exploded on their leisure boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland on 27 August 1979. Another passenger, Lady Brabourne, died the day after the attack. 12 Louis is an ‘of-the-moment, London bubble, remainer name’ Bringing us right up to date, several commentators have spotted a Brexit angle on the name. Piers Morgan said it was “two fingers up” at Brexit from the royal couple, and ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, used Twitter to deliver his instant verdict on the Cambridge’s selection: 13 People aren’t sure how they want it pronounced 14 Others have called for a new national anthem if Prince Louis ascends to the throne Prince Louis is fifth in line to the throne, and would be pushed down the line of succession were his elder siblings, George and Charlotte, to have kids of their own. But that hasn’t stopped people thinking that the prospect of a King Louis might be an opportunity to ditch God Save the King in favour of something with a little more jungle swing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/06/home-listening-llyr-williams-beethoven-wigmore-hall-marc-andre-hamelin-schubert","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Home listening: Llŷr Williams’s Beethoven at Wigmore Hall; Marc-André Hamelin does Schubert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/06/home-listening-llyr-williams-beethoven-wigmore-hall-marc-andre-hamelin-schubert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/06/home-listening-llyr-williams-beethoven-wigmore-hall-marc-andre-hamelin-schubert","fields":{"headline":"Home listening: Llŷr Williams’s Beethoven at Wigmore Hall; Marc-André Hamelin does Schubert","bodyText":"• Britain’s music lovers have many reasons to be thankful for London’s Wigmore Hall, not least for the Monday broadcasts of lunchtime concerts on Radio 3 (1pm, repeated on Sundays and available on iPlayer). These offer a glimpse of the many imaginative recital series programmed by the hall’s director, John Gilhooly, one of which is now available in a 12-CD box set, entitled Beethoven Unbound (Signum Classics). Gilhooly asked Welsh virtuoso Llŷr Williams for a Beethoven piano sonata cycle spread over nine concerts, which would allow time for other keyboard works to be interleaved. The result is not a chronological sonata series, but a succession of live mini-recitals. So, for instance, the mighty Hammerklavier sonata (No 29 in B-flat major, Op 106) is followed by Six Bagatelles, Op 126, and the Eroica Variations precede the Funeral March sonata No 12 and Les adieux, Op 81a. Williams plays with profound intelligence and a wittily knowing ear for the quirky surprises Beethoven lays in the path of the pianist; witness his handling of the Fantasia in G minor, Op 77, a piece he happily describes as “totally bonkers”. • Schubert is next for the box-set treatment from Williams but, in the meantime, Canadian pianist Marc-André Hamelin has a new Schubert release on Hyperion that demands attention. His sensitive interpretations of the Sonata in B-flat major D960 and the Four Impromptus D935 will be hard to better, particular the songlike quality he brings to Impromptu No 2 in A-flat major, the right-hand melody one long line of sinuous beauty. • Inside Music is shaping up to be an enjoyable addition to Saturday listening on Radio 3. Each week, a musician takes the listener inside several pieces, revealing why they are significant to them and how composers achieve those moments that stop you in your tracks.

Born in Chicago, she lives in New York and has worked as an associate editor for Newsweek, and a book and theatre critic for the New York Times, where she won a Pulitzer prize for criticism. Aged 70, she now teaches at Columbia University School of Arts. Her book On Michael Jackson will be published on 3 May (Granta, £9.99). This book is about the life and work of Michael Jackson, from his early years as a child star to the “freak show” aspects of his image later on. Why write about an already well-documented life? Because I’ve always loved Michael Jackson – first in a “pure fan” way, and then as I got older it became a critic’s fascination. He was the best performer at his peak – an all-encompassing dancing, singing artist in the theatrical tradition of Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr, Jackie Wilson, James Brown, with an acute sense of the mise en scène. He craved omniscient superstar status – a need to top himself with more record sales, bigger audiences, than the last time. By the time I was writing this book, he had become emblematic of complicated dilemmas, cultural obsessions, racial, gender and body metamorphoses. This book was first published in the US in 2006, three years before Jackson died. It’s now out in the UK with an updated introduction. Has your outlook on his life, and his trial for child molestation, changed since then? Yes and no. I can now feel my own struggles in this book. I was asking questions that weren’t being asked then except through underground gossip routes – on his vitiligo, on the alleged sex with little boys – to which I could get no firm answers. The final chapter, on his trial, I’d want to think through more carefully now, especially in the context of #MeToo and the Time’s Up movement, and to grapple with the asymmetries of the alleged sex abuse. You write that Michael Jackson, since his death, has been rehabilitated into the music canon – that “he got it all back with his art” after his death. Do you think we can separate his music, wonderful as it was, from the allegations that dogged him? No, we can’t. But his death allowed the canon simultaneously to reacknowledge the greatness of his art and to look at him as a damaged, harmed, and harming person. I have to live with, and keep analysing, this contradiction. In deciding I love Michael Jackson I take it all in – his music, the crimes he may have committed, his inner turmoil. I need the pleasure and the complications he gives me. As F Scott Fitzgerald said: “The test of a truly first-rate intelligence is to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” Jackson the child star was thrown into an adult world and abused by his father but you also call him a pioneer. Can he be both victim and pioneer? I’ve long been interested in child stars. It’s a fascination that goes back to watching Shirley Temple, but in his case, a gifted child star becomes an equally gifted adult, and a ground-breaking figure. Was he a victim? He was conscripted by a domineering father into very tough, demanding work. There are accounts of the hours of rehearsing he did and the travelling. But he was also pioneering. The black child in American culture tended to be seen as someone too young to be dangerous yet. He was the male version of Topsy from Uncle Tom’s Cabin or the hired “piccaninny”. What he managed to do was to transform that “pic” into an adorable, all-American black boy. You call the adult Jackson a shape-shifter, playing with notions of gender and race. Would he have been more at home today when biology is increasingly being seen and accepted as distinct from gender? Possibly. He was interested in mixing musical genres so he mixed pop and rock with sentimental Tin Pan Alley, and it was the same with his interior and exterior construction of himself. But he was also very cautious and reticent in talking about gender and sexuality. He didn’t make daring decisions in the way Madonna did, who was willing to be openly transgressive. He was always playing the innocent. What was the first Michael Jackson record you bought? I Want You Back by The Jackson 5. It was when they were still putting out 45s. I was dancing to it at every party so I bought the record. His fans then were people in their 20s who’d grown up on Motown but saw the politics of Berry Gordy’s Motown as so middle-of-the-road. Is there a black singer alive today breaking as many boundaries? I don’t know yet if they’re breaking the same kind of ground – someone like Kendrick Lamar is addressing race in interesting ways. And Beyoncé is combining music with the theatre and dance tradition – but I have to wait and see. What kind of music do you listen to? It depends on the time of day, my mood, what I’m writing. I’ll listen to classical music, jazz, songs from the great American song book, Nigerian pop, minimalism. It’s an unholy mix. Is the US a better place to live than it used to be for black Americans? It is in terms of culture. If you look at the arts pages of the New York Times, which are very mainstream, a variety of artists will be represented – Latino, black, Asian. It’s the same with Hollywood, TV and literature. There are nonwhite legacies and traditions pushing forward and being acknowledged in ways they haven’t been before. But it’s a fraught time. Injustices are being acknowledged but the push-back is terrifying. What’s the last really great book you read? A book of poems by Layli Long Soldier called Whereas. She is so linguistically sophisticated. The collection is a combination of poetry as personal, family and psychic narrative, with poetry as cultural and political narrative. Which novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you most admire? Now that I’m no longer a beat critic, I look for books that provide intellectual stimulation or that might be interesting to teach. Often I’m looking for writers who work in the same form as me, so I like the essayist experimentation of Yiyun Li, and I like Claudia Rankine, Maggie Nelson, Fred Moten. I follow critics, too: Darryl Pinckney in the New York Review of Books and Jacqueline Rose in the London Review of Books. I’ve recently read White Tears by Hari Kunzru, which I loved, and Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s Stay With Me – her writing is a great pleasure. I like reading Nell Zink and I’m just starting Rachel Kushner’s first novel, Telex from Cuba, because I thought her second, The Flamethrowers, was amazing. Do you prefer to read on paper or a screen? I still like to read the old-fashioned way but I do read on screen when I travel. I have an iPad and I’m happy to download books but in my house and on the subway I still like reading physical books. I love the way they look and to hold them. I still get the newspaper delivered to my door. Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read? So many. A few years ago I did War and Peace. That helped assuage my guilt. To order a copy of On Michael Jackson for £8.49 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over £10, online orders only.

In his toughest rebuff yet to the demands made by the British prime ministerin her landmark Mansion House speech, Barnier suggested the City would be granted nothing more generous than that enjoyed by Wall Street. “Some argue that the EU desperately needs the City of London, and that access to financing for EU27 business would be hampered – and economic growth undermined – without giving UK operators the same market access as today,” Barnier said at a meeting of finance ministers in Sofia, Bulgaria. “This is not what we hear from market participants, and it is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.” May had argued in March, in a keynote speech spelling out her vision of a future UK-EU trading relationship, that failing to construct a special deal for the City would hurt economies on both sides. The City provided more than £1.1tn of cross-border lending to the rest of the EU in 2015 alone. May conceded in her speech that the current “passporting” regime, under which UK-based financial services would automatically have the right to operate across the EU, would not survive Brexit. However, she went on to suggest that a mutually agreed system would be necessary that would give the UK’s financial services sector greater assurances over future rules than the current “equivalence regime”. Under the current arrangements, the EU has the unilateral right to change its regulatory demands on services operating outside the bloc, leaving any licences to operate at the whim of Brussels. Barnier said on Thursday: “I can perfectly see the UK’s logic and interest in pleading for a system of ‘mutual recognition’ and ‘reciprocal regulatory equivalence’. This is, indeed, what the single market achieves. “‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’ – to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work … Why would the equivalence system, which works well for the US industry, not work for the City?” Barnier pointed out that Brussels was seeking to build on its current equivalence regime to cover more aspects of the financial services sector. He also urged the British government not to seek to undercut the EU by changing its regulatory standards. “The equivalence system will operate in a more effective manner if the UK decides not to diverge from our financial regulation,” he said. “Let’s not have a short memory: we all saw during the [2008 financial] crisis that the risks of financial instability were ultimately borne by taxpayers – not only in the UK. We saw for instance that remuneration of bankers set the wrong incentives and allowed excessive risk-taking.” In response, the chief executive of UK Finance, Stephen Jones, said: “We believe a framework based on regulatory alignment and close supervisory cooperation can be developed to deliver the best outcome for both the EU and UK.” The two negotiating teams started discussing the future relationship last week. EU sources, however, said that the UK side had merely asked questions about the EU’s guidelines on the future relationship rather than offer their own blueprint. “Sabine Weyand [the deputy chief negotiator] talked it through with them and then they queried why this said that,” the source said. “It is how they acted in the previous phase; they ask questions to stall for time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/29/the-writer-almeida-review-ella-hickson-absolute-hell-national-theatre-rodney-ackland","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: The Writer; Absolute Hell – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/29/the-writer-almeida-review-ella-hickson-absolute-hell-national-theatre-rodney-ackland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/29/the-writer-almeida-review-ella-hickson-absolute-hell-national-theatre-rodney-ackland","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: The Writer; Absolute Hell – review","bodyText":"Ella Hickson’s new play is an assault on the stage. The Writer savages the theatrical status quo just as John Osborne did with Look Back in Anger. This, like Osborne’s, is not exactly A Good Play. It shakes and splinters with wrath. It is not under control. It will be much imitated and most of the imitations will be terrible. But it may change the way people frame their thoughts. The Writer is already sending audiences out divided between those who can’t stand it and those who want to stand up for it. It is also planting new conversations. It has not just passion – that excuse for sloppy sentences – but delving, fiery scepticism. Of a truly theatrical kind. For Hickson argues not only with words but with form. Anyone interested in the theatre should see The Writer. Blanche McIntyre’s impeccable production – energetic and witty – begins with two non-theatrical characters meeting on a deserted stage. It flares into one of the most tumultuous speeches I’ve ever heard: an eloquent attack by a student – a galvanic Lara Rossi – on the play she has just seen. She rages against gratuitous rape, women shifting scenery in hot pants, commercial imperatives, male bullying, a theatre out of touch with everything that’s going on outside it. She does so to an older male interlocutor who reacts with measured interest. Has she thought of writing something herself? Samuel West’s face seems to buckle inwards as his character balances civility and disturbance. And then it turns out they have met before – when he offered her a job, and then made a pass. The ground shifts slightly; the sympathies are emphasised. It’s an exciting exchange, full of conviction. It pushes forward into the next scene: an onstage Q&amp;A that shows the earlier exchange to be part of a play. The two performers take their place as actors alongside the nervous writer (Romola Garai) and a casually imperious director (Michael Gould). They throw up objections to the earlier scene – “ranty” is one of them. But then are undermined by the next vision. This is a play that tells you what it is not just by showing but by moving. It’s a play of continually collapsing walls: each scene is as provisional as Anna Fleishle’s brilliant design, which hauls flat screens up from the floor to turn them into backdrops. A view of the London Gherkin, a cardboard-looking wallpapered set; bright flowers. Each episode argues with the previous one. A very neat naturalistic dialogue involving cassoulet, disobliging sex and career pressure gives way to a scene of women behaving wildly: woad in the woods; huge shadows looming like Easter Island statues; stage and actors encased in zebra stripes. All this makes the audience want to argue. For the first time in ages I wanted to interject – during the Q&amp;A scene. My question was to do with the loaded content in that young woman’s speech. Why did she take it for granted that all theatre critics are male? Has she been reading the wrong newspapers? There is more critic-kicking in Absolute Hell, when a tweed-suited lesbian wearing a ginger wig that looks as if it has been snatched from a clown waddles on preposterously, is denounced by a writer for ruining his career – and dies. Playwright Rodney Ackland added the character as an act of revenge on the Sunday Times critic Harold Hobson, who had declared that the first-night audience in 1952 had been present “if not at the death of a talent, at least at its very serious illness”. The play – originally called The Pink Room – closed after three weeks. Despite subsequent revivals – Richmond’s Orange Tree proving that a small theatre can be a standard-bearer – it is still most famous for being neglected and being denounced. The impresario Binkie Beaumont called it “a libel on the British people”. Which whets the appetite for Joe Hill-Gibbins’s new production. As does – for anyone interested in alternative histories of the 20th century – Ackland’s material. Into a Soho drinking club just after the second world war tumble boozers and self-declared artists, a woman who lives with other “old tabbies” in “Earlsie-Courtsie”, a bellowing bonkers preacher, a black-marketeer, GIs. Charles Edwards is beautifully crumpled as the thwarted writer who – after the abolition of the Lord Chamberlain’s office – Ackland recreated as explicitly homosexual. Joanna David is touchingly dippy as his mummy, with library book and perky titfer. Kate Fleetwood is blade-like as the hostess – too much so to seem blowsily done for. The air is sulphurous. Ackland’s punkish snarling is pitted against a nation cheering the results of the 1945 election. The bitching and banter and fractured conversations – the sense that everyone is hanging on or slipping away, punching against the dark with drink – all this is worth hearing. But it should – this is an alternative world – sidle and insinuate, not come wreathed in authority and significance, as here. Lizzie Clachan’s design – perching the club in a shadowy edifice through which a prostitute walks like a ghost – magnifies the intention while diminishing the action. Passages are choreographed like a musical: you can almost see the directions requiring the crowd to mass or disperse. In too big a space everyone attitudinises. The horror of those clubs was that everyone was close enough to puff disdain straight into your face. What should be swift and cutting is here simply slow. A play that should be a challenge looks marmoreal. And marmoreal is the opposite of what makes theatre interesting. Most theatrical statues are terrible. Ridiculously declamatory or simply sunk into themselves. Still, inequities should be put right. At the back of Trafalgar Square Henry Irving is memorialised as the leading actor of the Victorian era. But where is his contemporary, the equally famous Ellen Terry? Hard to catch her mercurial quality on a plinth. But worth a try.

A week of mounting tensions in Freetown culminated on Wednesday with officers escorting 16 members of the All People’s Congress party from the chamber for disruptive behaviour. In a show of political solidarity, they were followed by the remaining members of the APC party, which was unseated after a decade in power when Bio won a contentious run-off election against Samura Kamara at the beginning of April. “Today, yesterday, they were both chaotic,” said Khursve Kargbo, regional operations manager for the Sierra Leone police. “Members of parliament were asked to leave by the clerk, and we had to forcefully remove them from right inside the well of parliament. The day before supporters outside were fighting, throwing stones, and we had to contain them.” Tensions developed on Monday after high court justice Alusine Sesay placed injunctions on 14 elected APC parliamentarians and two SLPP politicians, barring them from participating in the initial session. The injunctions followed claims by the SLPP that their APC rivals had illegally received government salaries throughout their election campaigns. On Monday evening, APC member SSB Dumbuya, the outgoing speaker, declared in a press release – itself a first for a speaker of parliament – that he had indefinitely postponed the opening session in light of the “confused situation”. Parliament’s newly appointed clerk, Paran Tarawally of the SLPP, countered with a statement branding Dumbuya’s declaration illegal, and said the session would go ahead as planned. The following day, however, violent clashes between rival party members outside parliament shut down the proceedings before they began. According to police, at least four people were seriously injured. By Wednesday, the number of injunctions against APC parliamentarians had risen to 16, including outgoing deputy speaker and former APC vice-presidential candidate Chernor Bah. The APC leadership said the move was evidence of an attempt by the SLPP to undermine the APC majority before the opening session’s speaker elections. Parliament nonetheless reconvened, with barricades established along the approaching roads to prevent the public from entering the campus. But when APC officials learned that 16 of their number had been banned, they began shouting and slamming their fists on the desks. “What we are seeing is completely unprecedented, so what else can we do about it?” said APC MP Abdul Karim Koroma. “They are blocking our members from participating in a decision they were chosen to partake in, all in order that they can secure the speakership. They say that it has precedent because two SLPP members were barred in 2012, but that is nothing like the scale of what is happening today, and we have to stand up and say something.” When the session was officially called to order an hour later, several dozen police moved in and blocked the chamber doors, to which APC members began chanting: “No police!” As several MPs stood to shout at Tarawally directly, the clerk called more police into the room and ordered that those standing should be removed. When they resisted, pandemonium broke out. Tables were broken as several people were forcibly removed, while Tarawally shouted, “Get them out!” into his microphone. The remaining APC MPs eventually walked out in protest, allowing the SLLP’s Abass Bundu to stand unopposed for election as speaker. He won the position with 72 votes. “I could not vote in that election,” said Kande Yumkella, a newly elected parliamentarian who ran for president with the National Grand Coalition party. “Police coming in and forcefully removing a party, and not to have lawmakers even comment during the session? It’s wrong, and if we care about the constitution, we shouldn’t stand for that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/26/tsb-chief-online-banking-meltdown-sabadell-paul-pester","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T18:18:50Z","webTitle":"Will the TSB chief pay the price for its online banking meltdown? | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-chief-online-banking-meltdown-sabadell-paul-pester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/26/tsb-chief-online-banking-meltdown-sabadell-paul-pester","fields":{"headline":"Will the TSB chief pay the price for its online banking meltdown?","bodyText":"Let’s try to be generous to Paul Pester, TSB’s beleaguered chief executive. His handling of the fallout from the botched IT “upgrade” has been poor – some of his statements and tweets have been nonsensical, others have been factually wrong – but it is already clear that the primary blame for the fiasco itself lies in Spain, at the door of Banco Sabadell, TSB’s parent. When Pester said on Thursday that he would take personal control of the crisis, many customers will have wondered why the boss wasn’t in charge already. The answer is that the platform switch was being managed from Spain by Sabadell, albeit with help from TSB’s offices in Bristol and London. The arrangement made sense in theory. TSB is adopting Sabadell’s in-house Proteo platform and the parent claimed to be a wizard in the art of migrating data. Pester’s announcement that, on assuming control, he’d hired a crack team from IBM to fly in to Bristol therefore amounted to an expression of little confidence in his Spanish bosses. Note, too, his explanation of why he had tweeted that TSB’s services were “up and running” when they were not. Pester said he’d been assured by the IT provider – meaning Sabadell – that all was well. He should have checked the information himself, but relations between parent and subsidiary do not sound good. The mood probably won’t improve as overworked TSB staff see pictures of Sabadell contractors drinking sparkling wine on Monday to celebrate the “success” of the data transfer. Nor will tensions ease, one suspects, as the bills rise. Over in Spain, Sabadell unveiled an additional €77m (£67m) charge related to its TSB project, which may indicate the IT challenge has been steeper than anybody has previously cared to admit. Pester’s giveaways – no overdraft fees for a month and a better interest rate on the main current account – will cost another £20m-plus. IBM’s emergency crew won’t come cheap either, and there’s a likely financial whack from UK regulators to come. In the circumstances, you can understand why Pester dodged questions about whether he’d accept a bonus this year. He should have made the gesture, but he may be wondering if the internal blame game will end with his exit and the usual contractual wrangles. The head of an overseas subsidiary usually makes a suitable fall guy. Banking advisers get another payday in Nex takeover There has rightly been outrage over the advisory fees racked up by GKN as it tried, unsuccessfully, to defend itself against Melrose’s hostile bid – a cool £107m, including a ridiculous £27m dispatched to advisers acting for Dana, the US firm that wanted to buy GKN’s automotive division. But here’s a deal where the bankers’ bonanza looks even more extreme. Nex Group, Michael Spencer’s financial technology outfit, has somehow found itself on the hook for £45.4m as it is bought by Chicago-based CME Group for £3.9bn. Formal documentation shows the lion’s share of £37.9m is ear-marked for “financial and corporate broking advice” – meaning the services of investment bankers at Citigroup, Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Yes, Nex’s bill is slightly less than half GKN’s, but consider the differences. The UK engineering firm was fighting a hostile bid over a 60-day timetable. Nex is doing a smaller friendly deal that involved no extended scrapping in public. Indeed, the way Terry Duffy, the boss at CME tells the tale, the tricky part of the negotiation was conducted one-on-one with Spencer before the talks became public. How on earth, then, do Nex and CME, which itself clocked up £21.9m on financial advice (principally from Barclays and JP Morgan), justify the sums? There is no explanation, of course. It’s just what the City and Wall Street has been able to demand from compliant clients. Directors convince themselves this is the inevitable price of doing business and, in non-hostile takeover bids, nobody makes a fuss. They really should. In total, the two sets of banking advisers in the Nex/CME alliance are collecting almost £60m. At a rough guess, that covers the work of about 20 principal individuals in a negotiation where there was goodwill on both sides and the heavy all-night sessions were probably compressed into a fortnight. The sums are absurd. BP chair is no stranger to pay rows Just what BP needs as its new chairman – an expert in boardroom pay rows. Unfortunately, Helge Lund is used to being the target of revolting shareholders. His £25m signing-on package at BG Group caused a stink in 2015. It wasn’t his fault, of course, that BG’s board wanted to shower him with incentives, or that Shell soon made a takeover bid that crystallised his windfall. But the Norwegian Lund makes an unlikely figure to police BP’s traditional excess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/26/alfie-evans-parents-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T18:22:32Z","webTitle":"Alfie Evans’ parents needed help.

The vultures came instead","bodyText":"Fanatical. Deluded. Emotive nonsense. These are unusually strong terms for a judge to use, particularly in a case as intensely sad and bitterly contested as that of the terminally ill child Alfie Evans. Yet Mr Justice Hayden, referring to some of the campaigners now surrounding Alfie’s parents, did not mince his words, after this most hellish of ethical dilemmas ended this week in a court ruling that the child’s ventilator be switched off against the family’s wishes. The judge was careful not to attach blame to Tom Evans and Kate James, who cannot accept the settled view of their son’s doctors that his brain has been damaged catastrophically by an as yet undiagnosed condition, or that the intensive treatment required to keep him alive is no longer in his best interest and may be causing him suffering. Alfie’s parents have fought like tigers both in and out of court and no parent – even those whose sympathies in this case are with the doctors facing death threats for doing what they honestly believe is the right thing – will begrudge the family their right to clutch in their grief at every straw there is. But the high court judge is surely right to question the motives of some of those extending straws. The most disturbing aspect of this case is the sense that it is now being exploited by those who see Alfie not as a desperately sick little boy, but as an expedient means of advancing their own ideological cause. That description doesn’t just apply to the pro-life movement, of course. Among Alfie’s viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters, which includes many parents of small children, you will find anti-vaxxers using the story to peddle utterly deluded junk science theories about the Vitamin K injection every newborn gets. You’ll find American gun lobby enthusiasts ranting on about how this is what happens when “the government” runs people’s lives and that’s why everyone needs to keep hold of their weapons; never mind that this decision has nothing to do with the government, resting as it does on the independent judgment of doctors upheld by an independent judiciary. Others have sought to use the case to score cheap, wildly inaccurate points over healthcare reform in the US; to claim this is where “socialised medicine” gets you, when without the NHS and its daily miracle of providing treatment free at the point of use, Alfie’s parents would now be struggling with medical bills running into the millions. And where far-right conspiracy sites such as Infowars and Breitbart rush in, an army of trolls inevitably follows. Staff at Alder Hey children’s hospital have experienced a horrific barrage of death threats and other online abuse. There have been ugly scenes at the hospital too, reports of over-zealous protesters blocking ambulances or intimidating visitors and patients. It is all too uncomfortably reminiscent of those who harass pregnant women outside abortion clinics and threaten to kill doctors offering terminations, so high on their self-righteous mission to save that all other human lives cease to matter. But none of that is quite what the judge meant. His concern centres specifically on the way the Evans family has been taken under the wing of a hitherto little-known evangelical group called the Christian Legal Centre, which has supplied the parents with a barrister and, somewhat dubiously, the services of a law student named Pavel Stroilov. A statement drafted for Alfie’s father was, according to Hayden, loaded with “vituperation and bile” against the hospital, which had not helped the baby’s case. At one point, Stroilov apparently became party to an attempt by Alfie’s father to have the doctors prosecuted for murder. The family’s former solicitor Mary Holmes has accused activists of seeking to “keep this child alive at any costs and not for the right reasons”, using the case to raise their profile with interventions such as securing Tom Evans an audience with the pope. Most seriously, Stroilov stands accused of giving Evans inaccurate advice in a letter stating that he had the legal right to remove his son from the hospital, despite a court order to the contrary, causing an understandably emotional standoff between the parents and the hospital when it became clear that was not the case. What is compassionate or Christian about giving a desperate man false hope? The judge’s objection to an outpouring of what he called “emotive nonsense” in his courtroom is not to be confused with heartlessness. Rather, it is a recognition that courts are the one place where, in cases like these, reason can still prevail over white-hot emotion; that their job is to provide a calm enough environment for doctors facing impossibly difficult choices to explain their clinical reasoning, and for evidence to be considered on its merits. For in British law, what matters is what is in the best interest of the child, not of the parents or the doctors or wider public opinion, and certainly not of organised religion. The court process functions only when the adults involved can be mature enough to put their own interests to one side, which means lawyers in such cases acting as advocates for their clients – not campaigners advancing their own beliefs. And while advocacy may mean fighting to the bitter end, there are times when it means gently introducing a client to the idea that it is time to stop; that however unreconciled they are to a painful verdict, it isn’t going to change. It is a conversation that would be familiar, ironically enough, not only to doctors but to priests. The church’s role can be to give hope where secular medicine has none. Light a candle, say a prayer, and just for a minute you might believe in a miracle. Yet that is not its only role at the end of life, when the dying and the grieving are looking as much for comfort as for hope; and for help in accepting the inevitable with grace. As Psalm 23: 4 has it, “Yea, though I walk through the shadows of the valley of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.” This family is walking through the shadows of that valley now, and they deserve to be accompanied by people with only their best interests at heart. May they find the comfort and grace they deserve. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/27/fracking-south-korean-earthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"Fracking may have caused South Korean earthquake – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/fracking-south-korean-earthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/27/fracking-south-korean-earthquake","fields":{"headline":"Fracking may have caused South Korean earthquake – study","bodyText":"One of South Korea’s largest earthquakes on record may have been caused by hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – according to a study published on Friday in the journal Science. A magnitude-5.5 earthquake hit the south-eastern city of Pohang on 15 November, injuring at least 70 people, temporarily displacing hundreds, and causing millions of dollars of damage. In the aftermath, residents and researchers have questioned whether the quake could be connected to a geothermal plant – the country’s first – less than 2km (about 1 mile) away. A team of researchers from the University of Glasgow, ETH-Zurich in Switzerland and GFZ-Potsdam in Germany analysed data from seismographic stations as well as satellite data to locate where the main shock and 46 aftershocks of the quake occurred. They found that the main shock occurred within 1.5km of where plant workers had been pumping thousands of cubic metres of water into the ground, creating or opening fractures in the rocks to enable water to pass between boreholes. The last of those injections was about two months before the quake. They also found that the main shock and aftershocks all occurred at depths of between 3 and 7km, which are shallow compared to previous quakes in that area, but similar to the depths at which the water was being injected. The researchers have been careful to say only that a connection is plausible. Korean authorities are also conducting their own investigation. “It would be a very a remarkable coincidence if this earthquake were to be unrelated to the activity at the site, given that it occurred so close to it,” said Robert Westaway, a senior research fellow at Glasgow university’s school of engineering, and one of the paper’s co-authors. “My own personal view is that it is highly likely there is a connection.” Westaway said further studies were being carried out to explain the two-month delay between the last round of fracking and the quake. Earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracturing have prompted concerns around the world. Two earthquakes in 2011 led to the UK imposing a fracking moratorium. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, experts have reported a millennium’s worth of quakes in two years because of fracking there. For decades, the Korean peninsula has seen almost no seismic activity. On 12 September 2016, another magnitude-5 quake struck just south of Pohang in Gyeongju. Since then the country has seen hundreds of smaller earthquakes. The study’s conclusions could also change how fracking is studied in relation to earthquakes. Previous theories have focused more on the volume of water used, rather than the pressure at which it enters the ground. In the case of the Pohang quake, a relatively small amount of water – about 10,000 cubic metres – was injected. “No one ever thought that injecting such a small amount of water could lead to such a large earthquake,” Westaway said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/26/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-full-back-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s success highlights Pep Guardiola’s full-back plan | Liam Rosenior","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/26/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-full-back-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/26/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-full-back-plan","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s success highlights Pep Guardiola’s full-back plan","bodyText":"According to some people, any club who can afford to spend £50m on a full-back should be champions. I have lost count of the amount of times this line has been used as a reason why Manchester City deservedly won the Premier League title, which has effectively been theirs since December. The references to the purchases of Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy are demeaning – implying the least important position on the pitch in today’s game is full-back. The more discerning football supporter would have watched the Champions League semi-finals and appreciated both matches were determined by the positioning and performances of the players in a position which I believe is the least-promoted and most undervalued in the sport. Take Liverpool’s attacking exploits against Roma on Tuesday, when the Italian side set up without full-backs in a back three so Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané were able to run riot behind a defence who were either three against three in transitional play or attempting to defend in a block and struggling to contain the penetrating runs of Liverpool’s wide men. It meant Salah and Mané were able to operate in space and run at pace against taller, less agile centre-halves, which has been their speciality in an outstanding run in the competition. Both of Roma’s late away goals were scored after Salah was withdrawn. By then Roma had reverted to a back four with full-backs who were in much better starting positions to deal with Liverpool’s direct play from wide areas. This gave them a platform to attack for the first time and the momentum swung in their favour in the final 15 minutes. Then there was Bayern Munich against Real Madrid on Wednesday, and again players in the defensive positions were key to the outcome. The goal by Bayern’s Joshua Kimmich was a perfect example of the full-back’s role in the modern game – having the stamina and quality to run 80 yards to score, utilising the space vacated by, yes, you guessed it, Marcelo, who had not recovered to his defensive left-back position quickly enough. And then Marcelo atoned for his defensive error by scoring a technically fantastic equaliser at a time when Bayern looked capable of adding to their lead. His tactical position to pick up the loose ball was absolutely perfect. Factor in that Lucas Vázquez became Real’s most important player in the final 30 minutes – dealing with Franck Ribéry’s outstanding play from the left wing – and you have an excellent example of how important attacking and defensive full-back play is to a team’s performance and the result. This opens the debate that we need to see the bigger picture in a more interconnected way, rather than a sport where any one position is more important or valuable in determining the result of a match. Throughout my career the significance of excellent full-backs to the functionality of a team, especially at the highest level, has been undervalued in comparison with other areas of the pitch. We always hear about the importance of “the spine of the team” or the “need for a goalscorer”, which is understandable, but is there another position where a player needs to have long-distance stamina, explosive power in one-v-one situations, sound defensive and tactical awareness, and also to be technically proficient enough to provide decent service to attacking colleagues with crosses and assists? A major component of Manchester City’s dominance this season has been Pep Guardiola’s positional use of his full-backs in the half-space in order to overload the middle of the pitch and overwhelm teams both in possession and in transition. Without the outstanding play of Kyle Walker and the development of Fabian Delph on a technical and tactical level, there is no way City would be the force they are. If Guardiola did not value the importance of the position, moreover, he would not set his team up in the way that he does, spend the money he has on full-backs, and set such high physical, technical and tactical demands for them. My favourite goal growing up was Carlos Alberto’s for Brazil in their 1979 World Cup final triumph over Italy in Mexico. I would rewind on my VHS to watch the passing and interplay leading up to the goal and Pelé’s perfectly weighted pass for Carlos Alberto to drive forward on the overlap and smash the ball into the far corner of the net. This way of thinking paved the way for the outstanding Roberto Carlos and Cafu in later years, with their stamina and ability to play the length of the pitch enabling Brazil to dominate numerically in the centre of midfield, and to win the 2002 World Cup. The use and lack of value I feel we have placed on the role of full-back in England has set us back tactically for years in comparison with our rivals, but I feel we are catching up. This is why I am sure Manchester City will not be the only team spending £50m on a full-back in the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-roma-champions-league-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T12:01:59Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp’s thrilling Liverpool are unlikely to fear a Roma fightback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-roma-champions-league-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-roma-champions-league-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp’s thrilling Liverpool are unlikely to fear a Roma fightback","bodyText":"The awe and wonder from a remarkable Anfield night has not diminished the day after. Fifteen minutes to play in a Champions League semi-final and Jürgen Klopp thinks of Stoke. Almost 60% remains of a tie to decide the cream of Europe’s elite and it is Bruno Martins Indi, Erik Pieters and Mame Biram Diouf who enter the Liverpool manager’s head as he withdraws Mohamed Salah to safeguard against injury. What’s more, he admits it too. “I’m not thinking of one game,” Klopp said. The thought was justified, and another measure of Liverpool’s astonishing command over Roma. Respite from Salah is temporary. Uefa ranked Liverpool the No 1 team in Europe in February 2009 based on a five-year period of success and consistency under Rafael Benítez. A month later they revelled in a 4-0 destruction of Real Madrid that took Benítez’s team into the Champions League quarter-finals, following a semi-final appearance in 2008, a runners-up spot in 2007 and the ultimate triumph in 2005. Klopp’s Liverpool cannot compare with that body of work in only his second full season as manager. His team have, however, reached a level of exhilarating attacking brilliance in this Champions League campaign that their predecessors would envy. And just like the quality of Salah’s goals, they are improving. The 5-2 first-leg romp over Roma made it 38 Champions League goals this season for Liverpool. It is 44 when the qualifier against Hoffenheim is included. With 10 apiece, Salah and the crucial Roberto Firmino now share the record for most goals in a single European campaign by a Liverpool player. Along with Sadio Mané, who should have had a hat-trick on Tuesday, they form the most prolific forward line in the competition – 28 goals and counting. And Liverpool have scored in each of their six European away fixtures this term. Roma’s obligation to attack in Stadio Olimpico next Wednesday will whet Liverpool’s appetite for more. “I learned tonight that we can win the second leg, too,” said Klopp, though he was in no mood to celebrate after losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to a serious knee injury. Post-match interviews are framed by emotion but the contrasting approaches of the managers in the aftermath of the first leg also bodes well for Liverpool’s pursuit of a sixth European Cup. Eusebio Di Francesco, the Roma coach, abdicated responsibility for the high defensive line and three-man rearguard that invited Salah to destroy his former club with one of the finest individual displays in Europe that Anfield has witnessed. It was his players’ fault, Di Francesco claimed, for losing too many individual duels and allowing the Liverpool midfield to launch the “lethal” breaks that Roma had focused on stopping in training. “My Roma players don’t need to tell me about Salah,” ran the headline on the Guardian’s interview with Di Francesco this week. Someone should have done. “We don’t need miracles” was the gist of the Roma coach’s message as he inevitably invoked memories of their quarter‑final comeback against Barcelona. As others quickly pointed out, Liverpool achieved a level of dominance over the Italian side on Tuesday that the Spanish league leaders never did, not even during their 4-1 first leg victory at the Camp Nou. Roma were given hope at Anfield by the two late away goals that followed Salah’s substitution. It is unlikely to be hope but the magnificent Egyptian that kills them in the return. Klopp took a different line to Di Francesco by accepting responsibility for a scoreline that everyone at Liverpool would have embraced before kick-off. “If someone wants to say it is my mistake they scored two goals because I changed the striker I have no problem with that,” he said, having pointed out that it was one defensive lapse and one penalty decision that enabled Roma to close the gulf. The real result of Salah’s exit was to limit Liverpool to five. Just the five goals, in a Champions League semi-final, and with Oxlade‑Chamberlain adding to an ominous injury list Klopp had every reason to protect the forward line that is slicing through Europe. Oxlade-Chamberlain has been an increasing influence on the Champions League campaign but is not expected to play again this season after his knee buckled when challenging Aleksandar Kolarov at Anfield. Adam Lallana and Emre Can are also long-term absentees, although Can has a chance of returning from a back injury before 26 May. His rehabilitation may just have stepped up a notch at Melwood on Wednesday. Georginio Wijnaldum was formidable when he replaced the England international against Roma, however, while Jordan Henderson and James Milner – whose nine assists are the record for a Champions League season – were again outstanding in Europe as they turned the semi-final in Liverpool’s favour. The last three senior midfielders standing at Anfield will get no relief in the days ahead.

The scale of the problem was set out by Adam Lewis QC, the author of Independent Review of Integrity in Tennis, who said “tennis is responsible for more suspicious betting than any other sport”. A survey of 3,200 players at all levels of the professional game found that 14.5% had first-hand knowledge of match-fixing – 464 players in total. The interim review, which was finally published after a 27-month process that cost nearly £20m, proposed a number of controversial solutions to tackle the problem, including banning betting companies from sponsoring tennis and gambling on lower-level matches. But it insisted the evidence did not reveal a “widespread problem” in elite professional tennis or a cover-up by the game’s authorities. According to Lewis, many of the problems dated back to the International Tennis Federation’s decision in 2012 to sign a $70m deal with the data company Sportradar to distribute live scores from small and intermediate tournaments around the globe. It meant bookmakers could provide odds on those matches, particularly on the lucrative in-play market – and unscrupulous gamblers had a prime opportunity which they could exploit. The report noted: “The panel has seen little empirical evidence that betting was widespread on the lowest levels of ITF tournaments before the deal in 2012. But in 2013, the year after the first ITF-Sportradar contract, 40,000 matches at ITF Men’s Futures and Women’s 15k and 25k events were made available to the betting market. By 2016 that number had increased to over 60,000.” Because the Futures events offer such poor prize money, the report found that only 336 men and 253 women were able to break even – and that was before accounting for coaching costs. It meant that many players were vulnerable to being manipulated by fixers. “The nature of the game lends itself to manipulation for betting purposes,” the report added. “The player incentive structure creates a fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity. Today tennis faces a serious integrity problem.” Umpires were sometimes involved, too. As the Guardian revealed in 2016, under the terms of the Sportradar deal, umpires were asked to immediately update the scoreboard after each point using their official IBM tablets. But some umpires deliberately delayed updating the scores for up to 60 seconds – allowing gamblers to place bets knowing what was going to happen next. That problem has now been tackled but the report admitted there was “no simple solution or panacea” to deal with the many other outstanding issues. It suggested discontinuing the sale of official live scoring data at lower levels of the game would help. However, Sportradar responded angrily to this proposal calling it “unrealistic and potentially unlawful”. In a statement it warned: “Prohibition simply doesn’t work. Prohibiting data partnerships will not stop betting, live or otherwise, on these matches nor will it remove corruption risk at this level. Pre-match betting will remain available and the risk of data fraud and ghost matches will increase. This will almost certainly encourage black-market activity.” The ITF was criticised in the report for “at times insufficient” investigations around grand slams and the ATP for not doing more in following up on a report by Richard Ings’s original anti-corruption code in 2005. Tennis authorities say they plan to implement the findings of the final report, which is scheduled to be published in the autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2018/apr/25/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-wizarding-fantasy-andoid-iphone-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T13:25:02Z","webTitle":"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery – a wizarding fantasy on your phone?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/25/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-wizarding-fantasy-andoid-iphone-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/apr/25/harry-potter-hogwarts-mystery-wizarding-fantasy-andoid-iphone-review","fields":{"headline":"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery – a wizarding fantasy on your phone?","bodyText":"I won’t lie: on my 11th birthday, a tiny part of me hoped that I might get a letter from Hogwarts. By that age I had long accepted that my toys would not spring to life, I would not find a snowy fantasy realm in the back of a closet, and I was not a secret warrior princess – but the existence of a secret school in the Highlands of Scotland still seemed just possible. Edinburgh’s Fettes College was down the road from where I grew up; I imagined Hogwarts would be much the same, but for wizards instead of extremely posh children. The first Harry Potter game in more than five years, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, attempts to fulfil that childhood fantasy. Released today for Android and iPhone, it is a gentle narrative game that offers a pared-down Hogwarts experience, letting you pick your house, form friendships and rivalries and master spells in the famous castle. I was really hoping it would be good. On first impressions, it’s not the lazy cash-in I’d feared. The game looks pretty spot-on, with decent music and a cartoonish art style that is distinct from the films and illustrated books. It helps that Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Warwick Davis (Flitwick) and Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) have lent their voices to the game, though you won’t hear them very often – it’s mostly soundtracked by unexceptional magical music and sound effects. The writing in the early scenes, however, is a little bland; it makes a good attempt at capturing Snape’s sardonic disdain and McGonagall’s pursed restraint, but there’s not much flair to it. It doesn’t have the fizz and personality of the books. Hogwarts Mystery employs a familiar but irritating “energy” system to encourage you to spend money, essentially cutting off your access to the game until a timer goes down. Taking part in lessons or moving the story along cost points that recharge painfully slowly; you can’t sit down with it for more than 10 or 15 minutes. Ridiculously, this means that your character can be caught in the clutches of Devil’s Snare for an hour while you patiently wait until you can tap the right button to fend it off. It’s frustrating that the game resorts to this; surely players will be more than happy spending money on customising their little witches and wizards. The constant waiting will be enough to put a lot of players off. When you’re exploring the castle and talking to people, free of energy restrictions, Hogwarts Mystery really captures something of the Hogwarts fantasy. It’s set in the 1980s, when Harry was still a baby, so there are no conversations with Draco or Ron, but there are cameos from other well-known characters in their younger days. For anyone who loves the books, there’s a thrill to trying out your first wand in Olivander’s, even if you’re now 30 and your most exciting purchases are tiny clothes for other people’s babies. Developer Jam City will add to Hogwarts Mystery over time, taking players through a full seven-year school career. The personality and skills that your student avatar cultivates will have an impact on the story. Happily, there are good foundations here to build upon – when it’s not getting in the way of its own fun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/25/damian-green-dismissed-windrush-citizenship-pleas","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T15:17:20Z","webTitle":"Damian Green 'dismissed Windrush citizenship pleas'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/damian-green-dismissed-windrush-citizenship-pleas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/damian-green-dismissed-windrush-citizenship-pleas","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green 'dismissed Windrush citizenship pleas'","bodyText":"One of Theresa May’s most loyal allies dismissed pleas from the Windrush generation for help to confirm citizenship status as far back as 2011, a letter seen by the Guardian shows. Damian Green, former deputy to the prime minister and an immigration minister during May’s first two years running the Home Office, suggested the blame could have lain with the migrants themselves for not sorting out their settled status earlier. The letter, sent to the Labour MP David Lammy, is the earliest evidence yet of the Conservative immigration policy that was to follow – which was defined by May two years later as the “hostile environment” strategy. The government is struggling to contain the growing pressure on both May and the home secretary, Amber Rudd. The home secretary is likely to face angry questions in parliament on Wednesday from the home affairs select committee. The involvement of Green, whom May made her first secretary when she took over at No 10, draws the scandal ever closer to the prime minister despite the government’s repeated attempts to lay the blame elsewhere. At prime minister’s questions, Lammy revealed the plight of one constituent, William O’Grady, who left Jamaica as a child in 1959 and then lived and worked in the UK for 40 years. He was unable to work for seven years, however, because he did not have the “right” documentation, despite having had a national insurance number since 1971. Then he found he could not claim benefits to help with living costs, including his rent. Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, who has championed the cause of Windrush citizens, said his pleas had fallen on deaf ears at the Home Office, the UK Border Agency and Passport Office. They had also rejected a suggestion that UK citizenship fees could be waived, which the home secretary has done for all those affected by the immigration scandal. In his letter, Green suggested that O’Grady should have acquired settled status before 1971, when the law changed. “Having settled status would mean that he would be able to live and work in the UK without restriction,” he said. It was the constituent’s responsibility to provide evidence that he had been in the UK before that time, and had stayed continuously. A separate letter from the UK Border Agency to Lammy apologised for failing to reply to earlier correspondence and told him the fee for a single application for British citizenship had since risen to £836. It suggested O’Grady should acquire a “no time limit” stamp on his passport to enable him to work. However, the Passport Agency held on to O’Grady’s passport and birth certificate for more than a year, then claimed that he had lost his claim to British citizenship when Jamaica gained independence in 1962. In fact, all those people who went to Britain from Commonwealth countries from 1948 to 1971 can gain citizenship. Lammy demanded the prime minister personally apologise to O’Grady. He said his constituent should receive significant compensation for the years when he was out of work and unable to access benefits, and for the trauma he had been put through. He also called for O’Grady’s citizenship and passport to be granted immediately. Lammy said: “William lived here since he was a very young child and worked here for 40 years. The government were happy to take his taxes for four decades – but then treat him in this utterly shameful manner without even a second thought. “He was a citizen when he came here so why was he treated like an illegal immigrant? Modern Britain was built on the backs of William and the rest of the Windrush generation and it is a disgrace that he was stripped of his rights and treated in this way. “How many more Windrush cases have successive Home Office ministers dismissed? How many other innocent people have been stripped of their right to work, stripped of their right to access benefits and healthcare or imprisoned in their own country? I asked the home secretary over a week ago and she still hasn’t told me. The people of this country have a right to know.” May told the Commons: “Obviously, individual cases will have different circumstances but the home secretary will be setting out the compensation scheme and she will be doing that shortly.” A Home Office spokesman said: “As the home secretary announced, members of the Windrush generation who arrived in the UK before 1973 and have stayed to build a life here will be eligible for free citizenship. “The offer, which will be available to people from Commonwealth countries, not just Caribbean nationals, will extend to individuals who have no current documentation, those who already have leave to remain and want to advance their status and children of the Windrush generation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/25/webstresser-org-website-cyber-attacks-uk-banks-shut-down","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T11:57:32Z","webTitle":"Website linked to cyber-attacks against UK banks is shut down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/webstresser-org-website-cyber-attacks-uk-banks-shut-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/25/webstresser-org-website-cyber-attacks-uk-banks-shut-down","fields":{"headline":"Website linked to cyber-attacks against UK banks is shut down","bodyText":"A website linked to more than 4m cyber-attacks worldwide, including against some of Britain’s biggest banks, has been shut down following a UK- and Netherlands-led operation. Webstresser.org had 136,000 registered users and could be rented for about £10 to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, in which high volumes of internet traffic are launched at target computers to disable them. Following an investigation led by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Dutch national police, servers were seized at 11.30am on Wednesday in the Netherlands, the US and Germany, effecting a takedown of the website. Suspected members of the group were arrested on Tuesday in Scotland, Canada and Serbia, the NCA said. Croatian police said they had arrested a 19-year old man who faces charges of criminal acts against computer systems. The operation was supported by Europol and Police Scotland, as well as law enforcement in 11 countries. NCA officers also raided a property in Bradford, where the agency believed a suspect linked to the address used the Webstresser service to target seven of the UK’s biggest banks in attacks in November last year. The banks, which have not been named by investigators, were forced to reduce their operations or shut down entire systems, incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands. Jo Goodall, senior investigating officer at the NCA, said: “A significant criminal website has been shut down and the sophisticated crime group behind it stopped as a result of an international investigation involving law enforcement agencies from 11 countries.“The arrests made over the past two days show that the internet does not provide bulletproof anonymity to offenders and we expect to identify further suspects linked to the site in the coming weeks and months as we examine the evidence we have gathered.” Individuals with little or no technical knowledge could use the Webstresser service to launch crippling cyber-attacks across the world. Other targets have included government institutions and police forces, as well as victims in the gaming industry. Gert Ras, the head of the national hi-tech crime unit at the Dutch police, said: “By taking down the world’s largest illegal DDoS seller in a worldwide joint law-enforcement operation based on NCA intelligence, we have made an unprecedented impact on DDoS cybercrime. Not only were the administrators of this illegal service arrested, but also users will now face prosecution and civil liability for caused damage. “This is a warning to all wannabe DDoS-ers: do not DDoS because, through close law-enforcement collaboration, we will identify you, bring you to court and facilitate that you will be held liable by the victims for the huge damage you cause.” Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-Cat) supported the investigation by assisting the exchange of information between all partners.

The possibility has hovered over the team for much of the year. The Spurs struggled, and occasionally even fell out of the playoff picture entirely, without star forward Kawhi Leonard, who ended up playing just nine games this season while dealing with a quadriceps issue. Despite the Spurs’ reputation as a team able to sidestep controversy, a disagreement between Leonard and the Spurs about the best way to handle his injury snowballed into a very public debate. Maybe the most troubling moment came when Spurs coach Gregg Popovich praised LeMarcus Aldridge using language that many interpreted as snarky commentary aimed at his MIA all-star: “[Aldridge] doesn’t complain about a darn thing out on the court... I can’t imagine being more proud of a player as far as playing through adversity and being there for his team-mates night after night after night.” It was difficult not to read this as reflecting negatively on Leonard, who some believed was doing the exact opposite of Aldridge. The Spurs now are at a crossroads, as they could choose to move away from Leonard, who has one year left on his current deal, or offer him a five-year/$219m extension. The clock had barely wound down on San Antonio’s season before rumors of a Leonard trade to the Los Angeles Lakers began to bubble up. Leonard is not the only man the Spurs could lose in the offseason. Manu Ginobili, who has been with the team since 2002, is contemplating retirement. Tony Parker, a Spur since 2001, plans to continue playing but is not under contract. Danny Green, whose three-point shooting was key in San Antonio’s 2014 Finals victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat, has a player’s option for next year and his return isn’t certain either. It was supposed to be easier than this. When Tim Duncan, arguably the greatest player of his generation, retired in 2016, it looked like San Antonio had lucked into a seamless line of succession. With Leonard, they had one of the NBA’s top talents, a perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate who was also frightening on offense. It was no easy feat to take over from Duncan, but it looked like the Spurs had their guy. Maybe it was a mistake to assume that any player could ever truly replace Duncan, but most people believed that things would continue to go smoothly for the Spurs because they always have. If they had missed the playoffs this year, a real concern at one point, it would have been for the first time since 1997. In fact, the Spurs have made the playoffs in 27 of the last 28 seasons, appeared in six NBA finals, the first in 1999 and the most recent in 2014, and have won five of them. They’ve won a total of 22 division titles since 1978. It’s hard to remember a time when they weren’t the model of consistency not just in the NBA but for the US sports scene in general. Overseeing it all has been Popovich, who has been head coach in San Antonio since 1996 and has overseen 21 consecutive winning seasons. It’s a run all the more impressive considering it’s come during an era in which teams discard head coaches like tissue paper: Popovich, in fact, is the longest tenured coach in the four major US professional sports leagues. Over the last few years, however, we’ve seen a different Popovich. The notorious curmudgeon revealed his softer side as his former TV sparring partner, reporter Craig Sager, succumbed to cancer. After Trump’s election, Pop became as likely to discuss social and political issues as basketball. His rejection of the “stick to sports” mindset has recently led to two opposing movements: left-leaning fans have started a tongue-in-cheek “Popovich 2020” presidential campaign in his honor while a group of apparently serious conservatives have been calling for a Spurs boycott due to his explicitly anti-Trump comments. Popovich has become more than a basketball coach, he’s become a public figure, which made the report that Erin, his wife of four decades, passed away on 18 April after a long illness all the more devastating. The news cast a shadow over the remainder of the Spurs-Warriors series. In the face of bereavement, it feels almost disrespectful to focus on what is, after all, just a game. As of right now, nobody can say what this will mean as far as Popovich’s future, probably not even the coach himself. Assistant Ettore Messina, who may soon depart for a head coaching job elsewhere, took over for Popovich for what ended up being the final three games of the series. The Spurs’ last win of the season, a 103-90 victory in Game 4, felt less like a team fighting back and more like one last hurrah. The hometown crowd cheered on Ginobili, who scored 16 points off the bench in his 132nd, and possibly final, playoff win. Maybe it’s not over. Maybe a grieving Popovich emerges from the offseason ready to return to coaching. Maybe the Spurs and Leonard find common ground over the offseason. Maybe Ginobili and Parker decide to sign up for one more go around together. All of this is possible, but for right now, the Spurs, for the first time in decades, face an uncertain future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/29/beast-review-jessie-buckley-johnny-flynn-dangerous-liaison","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Beast review – a dangerous liaison to get your teeth into","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/29/beast-review-jessie-buckley-johnny-flynn-dangerous-liaison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/29/beast-review-jessie-buckley-johnny-flynn-dangerous-liaison","fields":{"headline":"Beast review – a dangerous liaison to get your teeth into","bodyText":"After the whimsy of last week’s The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and the real-life dramas of 2017’s Another Mother’s Son, the Channel Islands become home to something altogether more eerie in this Jersey-set debut feature from writer-director Michael Pearce. Charting a turbulent relationship between a cloistered young woman and the vagabond man who turns her world upside down, Pearce’s increasingly intense psychological thriller deftly overturns expectations as it dances between timeless fable, modern romance and murder mystery. Superb central performances from rising stars Jessie Buckley and Johnny Flynn provide the visceral spark that fires the story – a game of psychological cat and mouse in which desire and danger, innocence and guilt, are intriguingly intertwined. Buckley is on phosphorescent form as flame-haired islander Moll, a twentysomething misfit who is still firmly under the thumb of her domineering mother. While her siblings have long since spread their wings, Moll remains trapped within the family home, helping to care for her ageing father, rigidly controlled by her choir-mistress mum, Hilary (Geraldine James). When Moll meets gun-toting woodsman Pascal (Flynn), his Heathcliff-like charms awaken passionate responses, encouraging Moll to break away from her suffocating home life. Meanwhile, a spate of killings has cast a cloud over this picturesque isle, with the finger of suspicion pointing toward Pascal. Yet Moll has secrets of her own, is haunted by the spectre of a violent childhood assault, and the whispered warning that “Moll’s a wild one…” Although the narrative may contain a distant echo of a grisly real-life case from the 1960s, Beast owes a greater debt to the traditions of the fairytale, and is cut from the same inspirational cloth as Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread, with a touch of the stranded desperation of Joanna Hogg’s Archipelago. The title, which is deliberately ambiguous, seems to allude to Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont’s beloved Beauty and the Beast, but there’s also a whiff of Walerian Borowczyk’s controversially erotic (and once-banned) La Bête. Certainly, there’s a subversive European flavour to Pearce’s ambitious Brit-pic that keeps us guessing about its characters’ motives as it slides between genres (melodrama, crime thriller, beastly chiller) with ease. Tonally, I was reminded at times of François Ozon’s deeply unsettling Regarde la mer, with its sharp juxtaposition of sensual island sunshine and murderously dark deception. Crucially, Pearce, who made a splash with shorts such as Rite and Keeping Up With the Joneses, steers clear of identifying any specific character as the “Beast” of the title – of which there may be more than one. Like Rachel Weisz’s anti-heroine in Roger Michell’s recent remake of My Cousin Rachel, Flynn plays Pascal’s guilt or innocence close to his chest, conjuring an enigma who simultaneously attracts and repels. Yet Buckley’s Moll is just as slippery, seeing a kindred spirit in her outcast lover, finding parallels with her past in his predicament. (At one point, Moll compares herself to a captive killer whale – smiling but deranged.) “You’re wounded,” says Pascal pointedly on their first meeting. “I can fix that.” Perhaps this is why she defends him even in the face of supposedly damning evidence. Or maybe she’s just blinded by passion, unable to see her lover for what he really is. While Beast pulses with sweeping primal themes, it’s the details that ensure that it gets its claws into an audience. An early scene in which Moll is casually sidelined at her own birthday party speaks volumes about her family history and the yoke under which she now struggles. Later, she digs her muddy nails into the family sofa – a powerful image of lusty defiance. As Hilary, Geraldine James is impressively oppressive, but there’s a hint of terror behind her authoritarian manner. She may be a scary mum, but Hilary is also clearly frightened of her daughter – of what she might do, what she might become. Contrasting the breathtaking vistas of the Jersey exteriors with the conservative confines of Moll’s home-life interiors (the latter were shot in Surrey), Pearce and cinematographer Benjamin Kračun conjure an archetypal landscape in which disparate worlds collide. As Moll moves from one environment to the other, so the form of the film itself shifts, with elegantly orchestrated compositions giving way to more free-form, handheld sequences. The result is a smart and sinewy psychodrama that maintains a delicate balance between its warring elements right through to the final frames. The furniture on this review was amended on 29 April 2018 to correct a description of Irish actor Jessie Buckley as British."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/25/roger-curry-case-simon-hayes-appears-in-court-over-american-man-found-hereford","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T13:06:23Z","webTitle":"Man appears in court over case of American found in Hereford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/roger-curry-case-simon-hayes-appears-in-court-over-american-man-found-hereford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/25/roger-curry-case-simon-hayes-appears-in-court-over-american-man-found-hereford","fields":{"headline":"Man appears in court over case of American found in Hereford","bodyText":"A man has appeared in court charged in connection with the mysterious appearance in Hereford of a vulnerable, elderly man with an American accent who could not explain how he got there. The case made headlines around the world and led to him being identified as Roger Curry, from Los Angeles, who had dementia. Simon Hayes, 52, of Taunton, Somerset, appeared before magistrates on Wednesday in Hereford, charged with intending to pervert the course of justice and three fraud offences. Hayes gave his nationality as British. The case was transferred to Worcester crown court, where he will next appear on 23 May. Hayes was granted unconditional bail. No pleas were taken. Curry was found at Hereford bus station in November 2015. An ambulance was flagged down for him. He was taken into the care of a nursing home, and police and social services spent months trying to confirm his identity. A BBC investigation later alleged that he was abandoned. Because of the high cost of care in the US, elderly people are sometimes left at hospitals. The details of the perverting the course of justice charge against Hayes are that he falsely represented to West Mercia police and members of the public that he had found Curry and did not know his identity. He is also charged with making a false representation that he had found an unknown man and handed him over to the care of the NHS, intending to cause loss to the health service or expose that person to loss. Hayes is also accused of two charges of possessing articles for use in fraud. According to the details, the first of these involves fake references by Maj Gen Buster Howes, a former commandant general of the Royal Marines. The second allegedly centres on fake letters from Control Risks, a global security company. When he was found, Curry appeared to have been well looked after and was wearing new clothing from Tesco. Though he gave the name Roger Curry to staff caring for him, police did not know whether it was his real name. He told doctors and care home staff that he was not from the area and had been training nearby, leading police to contact veterans’ organisations in case he was a former serviceman. An international appeal was launched and somebody came forward having found an old image on the internet showing what looked like a younger version of the man. The image came from a 1958 yearbook for Edmonds high school in Washington state and showed an 18-year-old student called Roger Curry. The BBC’s Panorama programme linked Curry to an affluent suburb of Los Angeles, where neighbours identified him as a former nurse who was married with two children. Curry’s son Kevin told Panorama he had nothing to do with the apparent abandonment of his father. His father became ill when they were visiting England on holiday, he said. Curry was flown back to the US and taken under the care of authorities in Los Angeles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/26/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-writing","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about writing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-writing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/26/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-writing","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about writing","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of your suggestions last week. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. Dear diary, I’m tearing my hair out, surrounded by balls of crumpled paper. I’m losing the plot; I think I have writer’s block. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this … white page oblivion, mental exhaustion. I’ve found my inspiration! As feral as a Thought Fox from Ted Hughes’s poetry, it hid in this scribble of a song dismissed early and now my opening line. Fucked Up bring the Magic Word(s) I hope will appear like smoke on my page. Maybe a writer needs to suffer? Can my pain be literature’s gain? Are illness, hedonism, excess, drug and drink-fuelled forays to bars and the beach to seek inspiration what I need? Sounds like the temptations and struggles in Father John Misty’s I’m Writing a Novel, the aural equivalent of reading Ask the Dust, by John Fante. I’ve now got “subjects locked in my cerebral cortex”, and they need to come out somehow. I must learn the art of structuring and rearranging my words on to the page like the Herbaliser in The Blend. Then I’ll edit, edit, edit as in Paul Simon’s Rewrite. I wish someone thought of me like Prince thought of (The Ballad of) Dorothy Parker. I’d love to be as quick-witted, caustic, sexy and bright as her. She wisecracked her way into history – how do I get that good? Perhaps I need to join a writers’ group from which to draw inspiration, like Virginia and the Bloomsbury Set or Jack, Alan and William and their Beat clique, then I could say Hey Jack Kerouac, like one of 10,000 Maniacs. We could be “the hesitant writers of the next line” – or something equally pithy. I wonder whether I could sell my soul and write a pulp story to be stacked on airport bookshop shelves. Am I that desperate for writing fame that I’d be a Paperback Writer and have the Beatles tormenting me? What I really need is practice. Elvis Costello tells me I can take inspiration from those around me, my relationships and affairs to make my writing real and state: Everyday I Write the Book. But, Dear Diary, what if I write that one great novel and it’s the only work everyone wants to hear about? It would kill me – I’m so much more than one work of fiction. I don’t want to suffer like the Fall, being constantly asked How I Wrote Elastic Man. In Storytelling, Belle &amp; Sebastian warned me of the great privilege and responsibility that comes with being a writer because, after all, the pen is mightier than the sword. It’s a minefield! I don’t want to become the kind of Mr Writer Stereophonics end up complaining about. I’d much rather put my writing to good use and make a difference, use it to drag me out of writerly poverty, find fame and fortune for my words and if I get into trouble, I’ll write to clear my name, like in Hurricane, by the Hamilton cast. Actually, you know what? I’m not sure I’m cut out for this at all. Can a writer ever please all? I think I might not be a writer after all. I have it! All of the writers featured in The Booklovers by the Divine Comedy had their own thing to say. I need to find my own voice. I need not worry what everyone else thinks or wants. I need to write for me and remember I have “life and have strength enough to say yesterday’s dead and gone – I want to live today”.

This suggested that the blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia “was killed in direct response to her fearless investigative journalism exposing high-level government corruption in Malta”. Most would understand this as an unqualified allegation that this government had at least some hand in the organisation of the murder. This is false and grossly defamatory, unsupported by the known facts, as set out in the Guardian and elsewhere. We do not deny that Caruana Galizia was frequently at odds with the government of Malta, and individuals within the government were targets of her blog; she had deep political animosity towards the Labour party. Many of her allegations were false and defamatory, resulting in libel actions from people seeking proper legal redress. Had the government been the only target of her attacks, it might be possible to understand the speculation of government involvement – however alien to the values and commitments of this administration. But the targets for her stories were numerous, including criminals with a known propensity for violence. The Guardian’s own report said she “had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.” At the time of her death, she was facing five libel actions from the leader of the opposition. To suggest that her murder must be connected to her criticism of government is to wilfully ignore the nature of her work and its impact on large numbers of her targets. The government has pursued the investigation with the utmost rigour, assisted by the FBI and Europol. It has offered a €1m reward for information leading to her killers. Three individuals have been arrested and charged, and the investigation continues unabated, although hampered by the refusal to make her laptop available to the investigators. The PEN letter was signed by numerous signatories, including many writers of great distinction. We have to ask whether they were presented with the full facts before they were persuaded to sign this letter. PEN’s own press release ascribes the cause of the murder to “rampant government corruption at the heart of the EU” – a wholly different allegation to the “high-level government corruption in Malta”, as set out in your newspaper. Which, in fact, was the letter endorsed by the signatories? This evil and shocking murder has appalled everyone in Malta. However, we do know that there are interests hostile to the Malta government who would welcome any opportunity to damage or destabilise the current administration in Malta. But we also believe that much of the recent outcry has resulted from an inadequate understanding of the facts in this tragic and complex matter. We hope that here we have helped clear some of the most serious misapprehensions.

The decision over Mandy Richards was made after an emergency meeting of the party’s ruling body on Tuesday night. Richards, selected as the party’s candidate for Worcester last week, had claimed on her Twitter account there were “no images … of physical damage” from the bombing last May, and also said there was a “convenient shortage of evidence” in the murder of the MP Jo Cox. A panel from Labour’s national executive committee – including Unite union’s national officer, Jim Kennedy, the GMB union’s national political officer, Cath Speight, and the Islington councillor Claudia Webbe – called Richards to an emergency meeting to explain herself, the Guardian understands. The decision has been taken not to endorse her candidacy. The NEC has the power to remove a candidate if he or she has concealed anything that might be likely to bring the party into disrepute. Richards allegedly did not fill in the form correctly, nor did the selection committee question her about her social media history. Richards has been subjected to two extended civil restraint orders by the high court. These orders prevent her from making fresh applications in relation to those particular proceedings. She is reported to have made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was called to give evidence in a separate election petition hearing at the high court, involving Richards’ challenge to her failure to be elected in the London elections of 2106, where she said Richards was an “obsessive” whose claims “cannot be true”. Questions are likely to be asked about how Richards passed the selection process, having previously been shortlisted for another target seat in Telford several weeks earlier. Applicants are explicitly asked in the application form and by the interview panel to disclose anything in their background, personal, political or financial, past or present, which could have any potential to embarrass either themselves or the party. Richards was told by the panel she had broken the rules when she did not disclose any information in response to that question in the application form or interview. The panel decided that was a “lack of judgment that is not compatible with the high standards the party expect of candidates and elected representatives”. Richards has said she is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, but sources at Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, have insisted it does not back her, and said they did not back any candidate in the seat, which has a 2,500 Conservative majority. A source close to the NEC said the committee had decided to take swift action. “The panel is people from right across the political spectrum,” the source said. Kennedy and Webbe are key allies of Corbyn on the committee. “This is not a factional decision but a unanimous one that no one else on the NEC would block,” the source said. “There will be plenty of others now who want to contest that seat.” On Tuesday night, members of the local Worcester party’s committee met to discuss the selection, agreeing to back the NEC’s decision.Speaking after the decision, Richards said she was disappointed but understood the NEC’s decision, which was the result of “adverse publicity” over the past few days. “It has not, however, dampened my resolve or passion for politics,” she said. “It is unfortunate that the misrepresentation of the circumstances leading up to my selection were allowed to gain traction.” Richards said she had not stated that the Manchester attack and Cox’s death were staged, despite tweets questioning both events. “I would never seek to offend the victims and the bereaved in these incidents, that would be entirely contrary to my motivation,” she said. She hinted that those who had opposed her candidacy were politically motivated, saying that individuals had “unfairly seized on an opportunity to distort my intention to further their own ambition at the expense of mine … they will need to wrestle with their consciences on that in due course. The conceit, however, will not remain unanswered.” Richards said she wanted to apologise to the people of Worcester. “Your standing ovation at the hustings meeting has left me with the most heartwarming memory of my brief time with you,” she said. “I hope you find another formidable women to take up the mantle for we are aplenty.” This article was amended on 16 August 2018. An earlier version conflated other high court cases taken by Richards. To clarify: Diane Abbott was called to give evidence in a separate election petition hearing in the high court involving Richards. It was further amended on 22 October 2018 to correct details relating to the civil restraint orders made by the high court in relation to Richards. These orders prevent her from bringing fresh claims in particular proceedings, but do not prevent her from bringing any legal action without judicial approval as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-says-time-for-amber-rudd-to-go-over-windrush-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T11:49:50Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict:  Corbyn says time for Rudd to go over Windrush scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-says-time-for-amber-rudd-to-go-over-windrush-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/25/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-says-time-for-amber-rudd-to-go-over-windrush-scandal","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict:  Corbyn says time for Rudd to go over Windrush scandal","bodyText":"Key points A PMQs that got off to a slow start but ended with Jeremy Corbyn calling for Amber Rudd’s resignation over the Windrush scandal. Theresa May and Corbyn start by congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the arrival of their third child. May says MPs will want to mark the anniversary of Stephen Lawrence’s death. Corbyn says Lawrence’s parents, Doreen and Neville, fought for years to get justice. Institutional racism must be driven out wherever it occurs, he says. Turning to the Windrush generation, he says there is a lack of trust. Can May confirm those denied work and benefits will be fully compensated? May agrees with Corbyn about stamping out racism “in every form”. On Windrush, she repeats the offer made by Amber Rudd. There will be a compensation scheme, she says; everyone knows the Windrush generation are British. Corbyn hits back that it is not an act of generosity to give people rights that are theirs already. He says an internal Home Office memo from May’s time as home secretary talked about creating a hostile environment and the possible dangers. Why did May ignore it? May says Liam Byrne talked about creating a hostile environment for illegal immigrants when he was a shadow immigration minister. He is now on the Labour frontbench, she says. Corbyn says May ignored warnings from Labour MPs about the impact her policies would have on the Windrush generation. May says these people have a right to be here but they were not documented, she says. She says Corbyn is talking about policies aimed at people here illegally. The Windrush case relates to people here legally. She quotes various measures taken by Labour to crack down on illegal immigration. Corbyn says May seems to want to get away from the Windrush issue. He says the Equality and Human Rights Commission warned about the dangers of the Immigration Act. Will May review the legislation? May accuses Labour of ignoring the facts. The government is not ignoring the problems facing the Windrush generation and points to a Home Office taskforce to help them. The government will give them citizenship to recognise that they already are British. The problem is that before 1973 these migrants were not given documents. Corbyn says May in 2013 said she wanted to create a hostile environment for migrants. He says there would be no compensation if it were not for campaigning by Labour MPs. He says the withdrawal of legal aid made it harder for migrants to challenge government policy. Can May tell us the hostile environment is over and the immigration targets will be scrapped? May says dealing with people who are here illegally is different from the Windrush cases. She says in 2013 the then shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said much stronger action was needed by government to bring illegal immigration down. She repeats the point about the Windrush generation being here legally and says the public want government to deal with illegal immigration. Corbyn says we are talking about the climate created by May when she was home secretary. She knew full well the problems she was creating. Rudd said last week the Home Office sometimes lost sight of the individual. But we know now she wanted tighter rules. The current home secretary has taken a policy and made it worse. Isn’t it time she took responsibility and resigned? May says up and down this country people want the government to take action against people here illegally. The government wants to help those here legally. We welcomed the Windrush generation. We need to ensure they remain here. But the government also needs to take action against people here illegally. If Corbyn wants to talk about fairness, let’s look at what Labour would do. It would tax people and destroy jobs. Snap verdict For many listeners that may have been a confusing PMQs to follow, because for much of it Corbyn and May appeared to be talking at complete cross-purposes, but there was no escaping the fact that May was dodging legitimate and awkward questions about the impact of her policies as home secretary and Corbyn successfully had her wriggling. He repeatedly asked why she ignored warnings about the impact her “hostile environment” strategy would have on Windrush generation migrants, and she couldn’t answer. Instead she more or less ignored the points he was making and kept trying to bring the exchanges back to the issue of illegal immigration, not legal, Windrush-era immigration. It may well be the case that there is more public support for May than Labour MPs (or Guardian readers) would care to admit when she says the public do want to see the government crack down on illegal immigration. And Corbyn’s firm questioning took a slightly odd turn at the end, when he threw in a surprise call for Rudd’s resignation at the end of an exchange that had focused on May’s own culpability. But, overall, May was on the defensive and her effort to defend herself against Corbyn by quoting Byrne and Cooper against him was a strategy doomed to failure. You won’t find “controls on immigration” mugs on sale at Labour HQ any more, and there is a very good reason why Cooper is no longer shadow home secretary. Corbyn can’t be held responsible for Labour immigration policy pre-2015; he opposed it as strongly as anyone. Memorable lines May on measures to help the Windrush generation: The Windrush generation are British, they are part of us and there will be a compensation scheme. Corbyn calling for Rudd’s resignation: The current home secretary inherited a failing policy and made it worse. Isn’t it time she took responsibility and resigned?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
